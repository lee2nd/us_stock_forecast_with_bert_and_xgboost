ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains “forward-looking statements” that indicate certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. Actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth below and elsewhere in this report. Important factors that may cause actual results to differ from projections include:
· We may not be able to continue operating without additional financing;
· Current negative operating cash flows;
· Our capital needs to accomplish our goals, including any further financing, which may be highly dilutive and may include onerous terms;
· Risks related to recent and future acquisitions, including the possibility of further impairment of goodwill and risks related to the benefits and costs of acquisition;
· Risks related to our partnerships with other companies, including the need to negotiate the definitive agreements; possible failure to realize anticipated benefits of these partnerships; and costs of providing funding to our partner companies, which may never be repaid or provide anticipated returns;
· Risk that we will be unable to protect our intellectual property or claims that we are infringing on others’ intellectual property;
· The impact of competition;
· Acquisition and maintenance of any necessary regulatory clearances applicable to applications of our technology;
· Inability to attract or retain qualified senior management personnel, including sales and marketing personnel;
· Risk that we never become profitable if our products and services are not accepted by potential customers;
· Possible impact of government regulation and scrutiny;
· Unexpected costs and operating deficits, and lower than expected sales and revenues, if any;
· Adverse results of any legal proceedings;
· The volatility of our operating results and financial condition,
· Management of growth; and
· Risk that our business and operations will continue to be materially and adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has impacted on a significant supplier; has resulted in delayed production and less efficiency; and has impacted on our sales efforts, accounts receivable, and terms demanded by suppliers; and may impact financing transactions.

Overview
We operate in three primary business areas: first, application of artificial intelligence (“AI”) in our precision medicine business, to provide AI-driven predictive models of tumor drug response to improve clinical outcomes for patients and to assist pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and biotech industries in the development of new personalized drugs and diagnostics; second, a provider of soluble and stable formulations for proteins and third, production of the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) - cleared STREAMWAY System for automated, direct-to-drain medical fluid disposal and associated products.
We have three reportable segments: Helomics, Soluble, and Skyline. The Helomics segment includes clinical testing and contract research services that include the application of AI. Soluble segment consists of contract services and research focused on solubility improvements, stability studies, and protein production. Skyline consists of the STREAMWAY System product sales. The Helomics segment consists of clinical testing and contract research. Our TumorGenesis subsidiary specializes in media that help cancer cells grow and retain their DNA/RNA and proteomic signatures and is included within corporate. Going forward, we have determined that we will focus our resources on the Helomics segment and our primary mission of applying AI to precision medicine and drug discovery.
Capital Requirements
Since inception, we have been unprofitable. We incurred net losses of $25,884,397 and $19,390,766 for the years ended December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $108,383,108 and $82,498,711, respectively.
We have never generated sufficient revenues to fund our capital requirements. Since 2017, we have diversified our business by investing in ventures, including making significant loans and investments in early-stage companies. These activities led to the acquisition of Helomics in April 2019 and the purchase of the assets of two businesses in 2020 which have accelerated our capital needs further. We have funded our operations through a variety of debt and equity instruments. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources - Liquidity and Plan of Financing” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources - Financing Transactions” below.
Our future cash requirements and the adequacy of available funds depend on our ability to generate revenues from our Helomics segment; our ability to continue to sell our Skyline Medical products and to reach profitability in the Skyline Medical business, our ability to generate revenue from our Soluble reportable segment and the availability of future financing to fulfill our business plans. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources - Liquidity and Plan of Financing” below.
Our limited history of operations, especially in our precision medicine business, and our change in the emphasis of our business, starting in 2017, makes prediction of future operating results difficult. We believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied on as predictive of our future results.
Results of Operations
Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2020 with Year Ended December 31, 2019
Revenue. We recorded revenue of $1,252,272 in 2020, compared to $1,411,565 in 2019. Our Skyline division was responsible for the majority of the revenue, with Helomics generating $64,188 and $48,447 in revenue in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We sold 25 STREAMWAY System units in 2020 and 41 STREAMWAY System units in 2019.
Cost of sales. Cost of sales was $447,192 and $531,810 in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The gross profit margin was 64% in 2020 compared to 62% in 2019. Our margins increased 2020 primarily due to decreased costs associated with supporting our maintenance contracts, offset by increased cost of sales related to sales in the Skyline Medical business in 2020 as a result of lower number of units, average cost increased slightly.
General and Administrative expense. General and administrative (“G&A”) expense primarily consists of management salaries, professional fees, consulting fees, travel expense, administrative fees and general office expenses.
G&A expense increased by $570,755 to $10,351,973 in 2020 from $9,781,218 in 2019. The increase is primarily due to increases in staff and related expenses due to additional headcount including new employees for our Soluble Biotech subsidiary, the assets of which we acquired in 2020, as well as certain one-time expenses related to severance incurred as part of our cost cutting measures. Also, increased depreciation is driven by newly added assets resulting from our asset purchase agreements for the assets of Soluble division and those of Quantitative Medicine LLC (“QM”), which we acquired in 2020.
Operations expense. Operations expense in our current stage primarily consists of expenses related to product development, prototyping and testing including staff related expenses for individuals performing this work.
Operations expense decreased by $608,422 to $2,351,709 in 2020 compared to $2,960,131 in 2019. The decrease in operations expense in 2020 was primarily due to lower payroll costs and employee stock option vesting expenses, offset by increased costs associated with cloud computing.
Sales and marketing expense. Sales and marketing expense consists of expenses required to sell products through independent reps, attendance at trade shows, product literature and other sales and marketing activities.
Sales and marketing expenses decreased by $1,327,962 to $584,937 in 2020 compared to $1,912,899 in 2019. Such expenses related almost exclusively to the Skyline Medical business. The decrease in 2020 was a direct result of the strategic decision focus on the precision medicine business and reduce the emphasis on expenditures in the Skyline Medical business. These factors decreased our expenses for payroll and bonus expense for sales staff as well as travel related costs, web development, public relations, and market research.
Impact of minority investment on net loss. The net loss for 2019 includes a loss on equity method investment of $439,637. The 2019 loss represented a portion of Helomics’ net loss from continuing operations of $1,555,542 prior to the merger on April 4, 2019 and resulted from our ownership of 25% of Helomics’ capital stock before the merger. This net loss was offset by the gain of $6,164,260 in 2019 on revaluation upon the initial acquisition of Helomics. Commencing with the merger effective April 4, 2019, we own 100% of the Helomics business, which is included in the consolidated financial statements.
Loss on goodwill and intangible impairment. We incurred a loss on impairment of goodwill of $12,876,498 during 2020. We incurred impairments charges of $8,100,000 and $770,250 on goodwill and intangibles, respectively during 2019.
Goodwill is calculated as the difference between the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred and the fair value of net assets acquired in the Helomics acquisition and represents the future economic benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the acquisition that are not individually identified and separately recognized. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level, or whenever events or circumstances present an indication of impairment. The primary items that generate goodwill include the value of the synergies between the acquired company and the Company and the acquired assembled workforce, neither of which qualifies for recognition as an intangible asset.
Based upon our annual and interim goodwill impairment tests in each 2020 and 2019, we concluded that goodwill was impaired as of the testing dates. Pursuant to Accounting Standards Update No, 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, the single step is to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill. To the extent the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill, the difference is the amount of the goodwill impairment. Our goodwill following the impairment was $2,813,792 and $15,690,290 at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. We will continue to monitor our reporting unit in an effort to determine whether events and circumstances warrant further impairment testing in future periods, which may include interim periods. The cumulative losses on goodwill are $20,976,498 as of December 31, 2020. Please see Note 11 to our audited financial statements included in this annual report for further information.
Other income. We earned other income of $843,440 in 2020 compared to $65,300 in 2019. Other income was comprised of gain on the forgiveness of the Paycheck Protection Program loan of $541,867 and gains on settlement of outstanding payables during 2020. 2019 other income included gains on settlement of outstanding payables and dividend income.
Other expense. We incurred other expenses of $2,427,026 in 2020 compared to $3,466,696 in 2019. Other expenses consisted primarily of interest expense, payment penalties and amortization of original issue discounts.
Income Taxes. We have not recognized any income tax benefit in our statement of operations related to our U.S. operating losses, as all tax benefits are fully reserved.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash Flows
Net cash used in operating activities was $12,257,732 in 2020, compared with net cash used of $8,732,451 in 2019. Cash used in operating activities increased in 2020 primarily due to increased operating losses as well as increased outflows related to payments on accounts payables and payments for accrued expenses, inventories and prepaid expenses.
Cash flows used in investing activities were $167,456 in 2020 and $599,087 in 2019. Cash flows used in investing activities in 2020 were primarily purchases of fixed assets, offset by disposals of fixed assets. Cash flows used in investing activities in 2019 were primarily for loans made to Helomics, partially offset by cash received from Helomics on the acquisition date.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $12,952,689 in 2020 compared to net cash provided of $9,320,217 in 2019. Cash flows provided by financing activities in 2020 were primarily due from proceeds of common stock issuances of $4,891,348, proceeds from the issuance of common stock, prefunded warrants, warrants and the exchange of warrants of $5,057,919 and the exercise of warrants of $1,935,855. In 2019, we received proceeds from debt issuance of $2,690,000, including $1,920,000 from our CEO, proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock due to a private placement of $2,338,840, and proceeds of common stock issuances of $5,323,018.
Liquidity and Plan of Financing
Since our inception, we have incurred significant losses, and our accumulated deficit was $108,383,108 as of December 31, 2020. We have committed significant capital and management resources to develop our CRO business and other new business areas and intend to continue to devote significant resources to the Helomics business and other new businesses in this market. To fund this, we have significantly decreased our salary and benefits expenses, particularly in our Skyline Medical business unit, through reductions in personnel and other measures. We continue to focus on reducing expenses. Our businesses will need to generate significantly more revenue to sufficiently fund our operations without external financing. Our operations from inception have been funded with private placements of convertible debt securities and equity securities, public offerings, and loan agreements. We have not achieved profitability and anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses at least through the remainder of 2021. We had revenues of $1,252,272 and $1,411,565 in 2020 and 2019, respectively, but we had negative operating cash flows of $12,257,732 and $8,732,451 in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our cash balance was $678,332 as of December 31, 2020, and our accounts payable and accrued expenses were an aggregate $3,960,117. These matters are indicators of substantial doubt and were alleviated as noted below due to the registered direct offerings and private placement in January and February 2021. Additionally, all amounts payable related to outstanding debt agreements have been subsequently repaid. See “Financing Transactions” below.
Since January 2019, we have raised capital in a variety of private sales and public offerings of debt and equity securities. See “Financing Transactions” below. We have also issued equity securities in several acquisitions of other companies in 2019 and 2020. See “Issuances of Securities in Acquisitions” below. In January and February 2021, we received aggregate net proceeds of $31,077,232 in a series of registered direct offerings and a private placement of equity securities. On March 1, 2021, we used $5,906,802 of the net proceeds from the private placement to pay the remaining principal and interest on the loans originally issued in September 2018, September 2019 and February 2020 and to pay premium payable upon such repayment. The remaining net proceeds of the 2021 transactions have been or will be used for working capital.
We believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to support our operating plan at least through March 31, 2022. However, we may also seek to raise additional capital to support our growth through additional debt, equity or other alternatives or a combination thereof. We would raise such capital through equity or debt financing to fund our capital and equipment investments and our operations.
Financing Transactions
We have funded our operations through a combination of debt and equity instruments including an early bank loan (since repaid), and a variety of debt and equity offerings. Since late 2018, these financing transactions have consisted of (1) secured convertible notes to private investors starting in late 2018, the remaining amount of which was repaid on March 1, 2021; (2) a series of loans from Dr. Carl Schwartz, our CEO, starting in late 2018, which were exchanged for common stock in 2020; and (3) a number of public offerings, registered direct offerings and private placements, including an equity line arrangement (offerings), since 2019.
Secured Notes and Repayment in Full
In September 2018, the Company issued convertible secured promissory notes to two private investors in the original principal amount of an aggregate $2,297,727 (together, the “2018 Investor Note”) in exchange for cash proceeds of $2,000,000. As additional consideration for the 2018 Investor Note, the Company issued an aggregate 65,000 shares of its common stock as inducement shares plus warrants to acquire up to an aggregate 107,178 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $11.55 per share. Pursuant to a security agreement between the Company and the investors, the Company granted to the investors a security interest in its assets to secure repayment of the note. The 2018 Investor Note accrued interest at a rate of 8% per annum. In February 2019, the Company entered into a forbearance agreement with the 2018 Investor Note investors pursuant to which, among other things, the investors agreed to forbear on their rights to accelerate the 2018 Investor Note based on an event of default and a claimed event of default. In connection with such forbearance, an additional $344,659 in principal and an additional 16,667 common shares were issued to the investors. In September 2019, the 2018 Investor Note of one investor was paid in full. On March 19, 2020, the Company and the L2 Capital, LLC (“L2”) agreed to extend the note maturity to June 28, 2020. The Company and L2 further agreed to extend the due date to July 15, 2020 and then in July 2020 agreed to extend to September 30, 2020. Effective September 30, 2020, L2 and the Company agreed to extend to March 31, 2021.
No payment penalties were paid in relation to payments on the 2018 Investor Note during the year ended December 31, 2020 and $525,926 in payment penalties were accrued but not paid as of December 31, 2020. The outstanding principal balance of the 2018 Investor Note as of December 31, 2020 was $1,721,776, with an unamortized discount of $0.
Each investor received the right to convert all or any part of its portion of the 2018 Promissory Note into shares of the Company’s common stock at a discounted price, subject to certain limitations. During the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, L2 converted $267,328 and $140,000 of the principal balance, respectively and received 170,000 and 47,556 shares of the Company’s common stock, respectively.
During September 2019, the Company issued a secured promissory note with a principal amount of $847,500 (the “2019 Investor Note”) to Oasis Capital, LLC (“Oasis”), an affiliate of L2, in exchange for cash proceeds of $700,000. As additional consideration for the loan, the Company issued an aggregate 8,857 shares of its common stock to Oasis plus warrants to acquire up to 68,237 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $6.21 per share. The warrants are exercisable beginning on the sixth month anniversary of the effective date through the fifth-year anniversary thereof. The 2019 Investor Note accrued interest at a rate of 8% per annum. On March 19, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement to extend the due date the 2019 Investor Note from March 2020 to June 27, 2020. The Company increased the principal amount due on the 2019 Investor Note by $300,000 and issued 30,000 shares of its common stock as consideration for the extension. The change in value resulting from the extension exceeded 10% and as a result the extension was accounted for as an extinguishment under ASC 470, Debt. During the first quarter of 2020, the Company incurred a $300,000 loss on debt extinguishment related to the extension of the note. The Company and Oasis further agreed to extend the due date of the note to July 15, 2020 and then agreed to extend to September 30, 2020. The change in value resulting from the extension to September 30, 2020 exceeded 10% and as a result the extension was accounted for as an extinguishment under ASC 470, Debt. During the third quarter of 2020, the Company incurred a $345,000 loss on debt extinguishment related to the extension of the 2019 Investor Note to September 30, 2020. Effective September 30, 2020, Oasis and the Company agreed to further extend the maturity date of the 2019 Investor Note to March 31,2021. The change in value resulting from the extension to March 31, 2021 exceeded 10% and as a result the extension was accounted for as an extinguishment under ASC 470, Debt. During the third quarter of 2020, the Company incurred a $690,000 loss on debt extinguishment related to the extension of the note to March 31, 2021. Further, the parties agreed that the note shall be convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock, at a conversion price equal to the lesser of (i) $1.00 and (ii) 70% of the lowest VWAP (as defined in the note) of the Company’s common stock during the twenty (20) Trading Day (as defined) period ending on either (i) the last complete Trading Day prior to the conversion date or (ii) the conversion date, as determined by the holder in its sole discretion upon such conversion (subject to adjustment). During the fourth quarter of 2020, Oasis converted $525,000 in outstanding principal of the 2019 Investor Note in exchange for 1,136,448 shares of the Company’s common stock. No payment penalties were paid in relation to payments on this promissory note during the year ended December 31, 2020 and $320,542 in payment penalties were accrued but not paid as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the remaining balance on the promissory note was $1,490,833 with $244,830 unamortized discount.
On February 5, 2020, the Company issued a secured promissory note with a principal amount of $1,450,000 (the “2020 Investor Note”) to Oasis. Net proceeds of $400,000 were received for each of the first, second, and third tranches on February 5, 2020, March 5, 2020, and April 5, 2020, respectively. The Company granted to Oasis a security interest in its assets to secure repayment of the note. The 2020 Investor Note accrued interest at a rate of 8% per annum. Subject to certain limitations, the outstanding principal amount of the note and interest thereon were convertible at the election of the investor into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price equal to $2.589. The conversion price was amended effective September 30, 2020 to a variable price equal to 70% of the lowest volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) (as defined in the note) of Company’s common stock during the twenty (20) Trading Day (as defined in the note) period ending on either (i) the last complete Trading Day prior to the conversion date or (ii) the conversion date, as determined by the holder in its sole discretion upon such conversion (subject to adjustment). The note contains a conversion feature and a put which were determined to be derivatives and are discussed further below. Effective July 15, 2020, the Company and Oasis agreed to amend the maturity date of the note to September 30, 2020. The change in value resulting from the amendment to maturity to September 30, 2020 exceeded 10% and as a result the amendment was accounted for as an extinguishment under ASC 470, Debt. During the third quarter of 2020, the Company incurred a $172,500 loss on debt extinguishment related to the amendment of the note to September 30, 2020. Effective September 30, 2020, the investor and the Company agreed to further extend the maturity date of the 2020 Investor Note to March 31, 2021. The change in value resulting from the extension to March 31, 2021 exceeded 10% and as a result the extension was accounted for as an extinguishment under ASC 470, Debt. During the third quarter of 2020, the Company incurred a $345,000 loss on debt extinguishment related to the extension of the note to March 31, 2021. As additional consideration, the Company issued to Oasis warrants to purchase 94,631, 92,700 and 92,700 shares of the Company’s common stock at the closing of the first, second and third tranches, respectively. The warrants are exercisable beginning on the sixth month anniversary of the issuance date at an exercise price equal $2.992 per share. The Company also issued 46,875 shares of its common stock to Oasis at the closing of the first tranche. During the fourth quarter of 2020, Oasis converted $503,354 in outstanding principal in exchange for 1,075,911 shares of the Company’s common stock. No payment penalties were paid in relation to payments on this promissory note during the year ended December 31, 2020 and $314,011 in payment penalties were accrued but not paid as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the outstanding balance on the promissory note was $1,464,146 with no remaining unamortized discount.
On March 1, 2021, the Company used $5,906,802 of the proceeds of the private placement on February 23, 2021, described below under “2021 Offerings”, to repay in full the outstanding principal and interest and applicable premium amounts under the 2018 Investor Note, the 2019 Investor Note and the 2020 Investor Note.
Dr. Schwartz Notes
In November 2018, Dr. Schwartz made a loan to the Company with a principal balance of $370,000. As of December 31, 2018, one promissory note was held with a principal balance of $370,000 and an unamortized discount of $63,028. From November 30, 2018 through July 15, 2019, Dr. Schwartz made numerous loans to the Company in the total amount of $1,920,000 under two promissory notes. As consideration for these amounts, Dr. Schwartz received promissory notes and warrants to purchase 22,129 shares of the Company’s common stock at $8.36 per share. Further, beginning on February 1, 2019 and the first day of each calendar month thereafter while the note remained outstanding, a number of additional warrants were issued. Beginning in October 2019, the Company and Dr Schwartz began to renegotiate the note. Due to the negotiations, the Company did not issue any additional warrants because they would be cancelled under the new deal.
During January 2020, the Company entered into an exchange agreement with Dr. Schwartz. Under the exchange agreement, the two outstanding notes were cancelled and in exchange a new combined promissory note in the amount of $2,115,000 (the “2020 Schwartz Note”) bearing 12% interest per annum and maturing on September 30, 2020 was issued. In addition to the 2020 Schwartz Note, Dr. Schwartz received 50,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. All warrants issued under the prior promissory notes were cancelled under the exchange agreement; no rights and obligations remain under the cancelled notes. The Company determined that the exchange agreement had, in substance, occurred at December 31, 2019.
Effective as of April 21, 2020, the Company and Dr. Schwartz, entered into an exchange agreement relating to the 2020 Schwartz Note. The 2020 Schwartz Note bore twelve percent (12%) interest per annum and had a maturity date of September 30, 2020. The accrued interest on the note through April 21, 2020 was $77,878, resulting in a total balance of $2,192,878 in principal and accrued interest on the 2020 Schwartz Note as of such date. Dr. Schwartz and the Company agreed to exchange the 2020 Schwartz Note for newly issued shares of common stock of the Company at market value. Pursuant to the exchange agreement, Dr. Schwartz was issued 1,533,481 shares of newly issued common stock at an exchange rate of $1.43 per share, equal to the closing price of the common stock on April 21, 2020. Dr. Schwartz agreed (1) not to sell or otherwise transfer 766,740 shares for three months after the date of the exchange agreement, and (2) not to sell or otherwise transfer the remaining 766,741 shares for six months after the date of the exchange agreement. In 2021, the Company determined that due to a calculation error, the balance of the 2020 Schwartz Note should have been higher by $143,574 at the time of the exchange agreement, and on February 24, 2021, the Company issued an additional 100,401 shares to Dr. Schwartz.
2019 Offerings
On February 27, 2019, we entered into a placement agency agreement for a registered direct offering in which we sold 138,500 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase up to 69,250 shares of common stock. The common stock and warrants were sold in units, with each unit consisting of 0.1 share of common stock and a Warrant to purchase 0.05 of a share of our common stock at an exercise price of $10.00 per whole share. The Warrants are exercisable at any time on or after the date of issuance and expire on the fifth anniversary of issuance. The units were sold at a price of $9.00 per unit, resulting in gross proceeds of $1,246,608 and net offering proceeds, after deducting the placement agent’s fees and other estimated offering expenses, were $1,111,888. The closing of this offering occurred on March 1, 2019. We granted the placement agent or its assigns the right to purchase up to an aggregate of 6,925 units at an exercise price of $11.25 per unit. The unit purchase options shall expire on February 27, 2024.
On March 26, 2019, we entered into a placement agency agreement for a registered direct offering in which we sold 147,875 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase up to 73,938 shares of common stock. The common stock and warrants were sold in units, with each unit consisting of 0.1 share of common stock and a warrant to purchase 0.05 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $10.00 per whole share. The warrants are exercisable at any time on or after the date of issuance and expire on the fifth anniversary of issuance. The units were sold at a price of $8.00 per unit, resulting in gross proceeds of $1,183,101, before deducting placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses. The net offering proceeds were $1,053,460. The closing of this offering occurred on March 29, 2019. Pursuant to the placement agent agreement, we granted the placement agency or its assigns the right to purchase up to an aggregate of 73,938 units at an exercise price of $10.00 per unit. The unit purchase options shall expire on March 29, 2024.
In June through September 2019, the Company entered into a private placement securities purchase agreement with investors for shares of Series E convertible preferred stock. The Company issued 258 preferred shares. Each preferred shareholder had the right to convert each Series E convertible preferred share into 0.056857% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock immediately prior to conversion for each share of Series E convertible stock, beginning six months after the initial close date of June 13, 2019. On the date that is 12 months after the initial closing date, the Company has the option to convert the preferred shares into common stock upon the same terms and limitations as the above optional conversion. The preferred shares included a contingent beneficial conversion amount of $289,935, representing the intrinsic value of the shares at the time of issuance. The Company determined the Series E convertible preferred stock should be classified as permanent equity and the beneficial conversion feature amount was accreted through the earliest redemption date of December 13, 2019.
In May 2020, we notified the holders of our Series E Convertible Preferred Stock of our election to convert the outstanding shares of Series E Stock into common stock effective on June 13, 2020 pursuant to the terms of the Series E Stock. Prior to the conversion, there were 207.7 shares of Series E Stock outstanding. Each share of Series E Stock converted into 0.056857% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock immediately prior to conversion; therefore, the 207.7 outstanding shares of Series E Stock on June 13, 2020 converted into 1,257,416 shares of common stock equal to 11.8% of the outstanding shares of common stock as of June 12, 2020.
On October 4, 2019, we sold 633,554 shares of our common stock in a public offering.

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions in the purchase agreement, the investor is committed to purchase shares having an aggregate value of up to $15,000,000 of our common stock for a period of up to three years. We issued to Oasis 104,651 commitment shares for entering into the agreement. From time to time during the three-year commitment period, provided that the closing conditions are satisfied, we may provide Oasis with put notices to purchase a specified number of shares subject to certain limitations and conditions and at specified prices, which generally represent discounts to the market price of the common stock.
From the date of the agreement through December 31, 2019, we sold an aggregate 122,356 shares of common stock to Oasis for proceeds of $319,195.
2020 Paycheck Protection Program Loan and Forgiveness
On April 20, 2020, the Company entered into a promissory note with Park State Bank, which provides for an unsecured loan of $541,867 pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and applicable regulations (the “CARES Act”). The promissory note has a term of 2 years with a 1% per annum interest rate. Payments are deferred for 6 months from the date of the promissory note and the Company can apply for forgiveness of all or a portion of the promissory note after 60 days for covered use of funds.
Pursuant to the terms of the PPP, the promissory note, or a portion thereof, may be forgiven if proceeds are used for qualifying expenses as described in the CARES Act, such as payroll costs, costs used to continue group health care benefits, mortgage interest payments, rent and utilities. The Company has used all proceeds for qualifying expenses.

Quantitative Medicine is a biomedical analytics and computational biology company that developed a novel, computational drug discovery platform called CoRE. CoRE is designed to dramatically reduce the time, cost, and financial risk of discovering new therapeutic drugs by predicting the main effects of drugs on target molecules that mediate disease. In exchange for Seller’s assets, including CoRE, the Company provided consideration in the form of 954,719 shares of common stock, which, when issued, had a fair value of $1,470,267. One half of the shares issued, or 477,359 shares were deposited and held in escrow upon issuance, while 207,144 of the remaining shares were issued to Carnegie Mellon University (“CMU”) in satisfaction of all pre-closing amounts owed to CMU under a technology licensing agreement that was assumed by the Company on the closing date. Half of the shares held in escrow will be released on the six-month anniversary of the closing date, and the other half will be released on the one-year anniversary of the closing date; provided, however, that all or some of the escrow shares may be released and returned to the Company for reimbursement in the event that the Company suffers a loss against which the Selling Parties have indemnified the Company pursuant to the Agreement. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods presented, as well as our disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to, fair value of stock-based compensation, fair value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and fixed assets, income taxes, and contingencies and litigation.
We base our estimates and assumptions on our historical experience and on various other information available to us at the time that these estimates and assumptions are made. We believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances and form the basis for our making judgments about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results and outcomes could differ from our estimates primarily due to incorrect sales forecasting. We utilize a pipeline generated by our sales team and speak directly with all departments regarding estimates and assumptions. If, for any reason, those estimates, and assumptions vary substantially it would also impact our cost of goods and associated operating expenses. The other volatile area for estimates and assumptions is determining financing needs. Depending on how we choose to fund will affect numerous expense categories so the potential for underestimating those expenses is a viable concern.
Our significant accounting policies are described in “Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” in Notes to Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies and reflects those areas that require more significant judgments and use of estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our Financial Statements.
Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue Recognition.
Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. The standard’s core principle is that an entity will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
Revenue from Product Sales. We have medical device revenue consisting primarily of sales of the STREAMWAY System, as well as sales of the proprietary cleaning fluid and filters for use with the STREAMWAY System. This revenue stream is reported within both the domestic and international revenue segments. We sell our medical device products directly to hospitals and other medical facilities using employed sales representatives and independent contractors. Purchase orders, which are governed by sales agreements in all cases, state the final terms for unit price, quantity, shipping and payment terms. The unit price is considered the observable stand-alone selling price for the arrangements. Our sales agreement, Terms and Conditions, is a dually executed contract providing explicit criteria supporting the sale of the STREAMWAY System. We consider the combination of a purchase order and acceptance of our Terms and Conditions to be a customer’s contract in all cases.
Product sales for medical devices consist of a single performance obligation that we satisfy at a point in time. We recognize product revenue when the following events have occurred: (1) we have transferred physical possession of the products, (2) we have a present right to payment, (3) the customer has legal title to the products, and (d) the customer bears significant risks and rewards of ownership of the products. Based on the shipping terms specified in the sales agreements and purchase orders, these criteria are generally met when the products are shipped from our facilities (“FOB origin,” which is our standard shipping terms). As a result, we determined that the customer is able to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the benefits from, the products at the time the products are shipped. We may, at our discretion, negotiate different shipping terms with customers which may affect the timing of revenue recognition. Our standard payment terms for customers are generally 30 to 60 days after we transfer control of the product to the customer. We allow returns of defective disposable merchandise if the customer requests a return merchandise authorization from us.
Customers may also purchase a maintenance plan for the medical devices from us, which requires us to service the STREAMWAY System for a period of one year subsequent to the one-year anniversary date of the original STREAMWAY System invoice. The maintenance plan is considered a separate performance obligation from the product sale, is charged separately from the product sale, and is recognized over time (ratably over the one-year period) as maintenance services are earned and provided. A time-elapsed output method is used to measure progress because we transfer control evenly by providing a stand-ready service. We have determined that this method provides a faithful depiction of the transfer of services to our customers.
All amounts billed to a customer in a sales transaction for medical devices related to shipping and handling, if any, represent revenues earned for the goods provided, and these amounts have been included in revenue. Costs related to such shipping and handling billing are classified as cost of goods sold.
Revenue from Clinical Testing. The Precision Oncology Insights are clinic diagnostic testing comprised of our Tumor Drug Response Testing (formerly ChemoFx) and Genomic Profiling (formerly BioSpeciFx) tests. The Tumor Drug Response Testing test determines how a patient’s tumor specimen reacts to a panel of various chemotherapy drugs, while the Genomic Profiling test evaluates the expression of a particular gene related to a patient’s tumor specimen. Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The estimated uncollectible amounts are generally considered implicit price concessions that are a reduction in revenue. Payments terms vary for contracts and services sold by our Helomics subsidiary. Our performance obligations are satisfied at one point in time when test reports are delivered and studies are completed.
For service revenues, we estimate the transaction price which is the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for providing services based on our historical collection experience using a portfolio approach as a practical expedient to account for patient contracts as collective groups rather than individually. We monitor our estimates of transaction price to depict conditions that exist at each reporting date. If we subsequently determine that we will collect more consideration than we originally estimated for a contract with a patient, we will account for the change as an increase to the estimate of the transaction price, provided that such downward adjustment does not result in a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized.
We recognize revenue from these patients when contracts as defined in ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers are established at the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled or when we receive substantially all of the consideration subsequent to the performance obligations being satisfied.
CRO Revenue. Contract revenues are generally derived from studies conducted with biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies. The specific methodology for revenue recognition is determined on a case-by-case basis according to the facts and circumstances applicable to a given contract. We typically use an input method that recognizes revenue based on our efforts to satisfy the performance obligation relative to the total expected inputs to the satisfaction of that performance obligation. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation on the basis of the standalone-selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. Advance payments received in excess of revenues recognized are classified as deferred revenue until such time as the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Payment terms are net 30 from the invoice date, which is sent to the customer as we satisfy the performance obligation relative to the total expected inputs to the satisfaction of that performance obligation.
Variable Consideration. We record revenue from distributors and direct end customers in an amount that reflects the transaction price we expect to be entitled to after transferring control of those goods or services. Our current contracts do not contain any features that create variability in the amount or timing of revenue to be earned.
Warranty. We generally provide one-year warranties against defects in materials and workmanship on product sales and will either repair the products or provide replacements at no charge to customers. As they are considered assurance-type warranties, we do not account for them as separate performance obligations. Warranty reserve requirements are based on a specific assessment of the products sold with warranties where a customer asserts a claim for warranty or a product defect.
Contract Balances. We record a receivable when we have an unconditional right to receive consideration after the performance obligations are satisfied. Our deferred revenues relate primarily to maintenance plans and CRO revenue.
Practical Expedients. We have elected the practical expedient not to determine whether contracts with customers contain significant financing components as well as the practical expedient to recognize shipping and handling costs at point of sale.
Stock-Based Compensation. We account for share-based compensation expense in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, which requires us to measure and recognize compensation expense in our financial statements based on the fair value at the date of grant for our share-based awards. We recognize compensation expense for these equity-classified awards over their requisite service period and adjust for forfeitures as they occur.
ASC 718 requires companies to estimate the fair value of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model which requires the input of significant assumptions including an estimate of the average period of time employees and directors will retain vested stock options before exercising them, the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term, the number of options that will ultimately be forfeited before completing vesting requirements and the risk-free interest rate.
When an option or warrant is granted in place of cash compensation for services, we deem the value of the service rendered to be the value of the option or warrant. In most cases, however, an option or warrant is granted in addition to other forms of compensation and its separate value is difficult to determine without utilizing an option pricing model. For that reason we also use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value options and warrants granted to non-employees, which requires the input of significant assumptions including an estimate of the average period that investors or consultants will retain vested stock options and warrants before exercising them, the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term, the number of options and warrants that will ultimately be forfeited before completing vesting requirements and the risk-free interest rate. Changes in the assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock-based compensation and, consequently, the related expense recognizes that. We have been on the NASDAQ Capital Market since 2015 and has had a volatile stock including reverse stock splits. The assumptions we use in calculating the fair value of stock-based payment awards represent our best estimates, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our equity-based consulting and interest expense could be materially different in the future.
In the case of standard options to employees we determined the expected life to be the midpoint between the vesting term and the legal term. In the case of options or warrants granted to non-employees, we estimated the life to be the legal term unless there was a compelling reason to make it shorter.
Business Combination. We accounted for the Helomics merger as a business combination, using the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. The fair value for the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are based on information knowable and determined by management as of the date of this filing. We allocate the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price, if any, over the aggregate fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to goodwill.
Fixed Assets. We account for assets acquired at fair value as of the acquisition date. The fair value for assets acquired are based on their estimated fair values. Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of fixed assets is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Impairment. In accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, goodwill is calculated as the difference between the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred and the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is an indefinite-lived asset and is not amortized. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level, or whenever events or circumstances present an indication of impairment.
In the Helomics acquisition, the Company recorded goodwill of $23,790,290. The goodwill was recorded to the Helomics segment which represents a single reporting unit. As a part of the annual impairment testing, the Company had the option to assess qualitative factors to determine if it was more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. The Company believed a qualitative testing approach was not appropriate and, therefore, proceeded to the quantitative testing. When performing quantitative testing, the Company first estimated the fair value of the Helomics reporting unit using discounted cash flows. To determine fair values, the Company was required to make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis included financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations including the rate of future revenue growth, capital requirements, and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value, and discount rates for the Helomics reporting unit. Comparative market multiples were also used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow test. These assumptions required significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed and estimated amounts.
In testing goodwill for impairment as of December 31, 2019, the Company performed a quantitative impairment test, including computing the fair value of the Helomics reporting unit and comparing that value to its carrying value. Based upon the Company’s annual goodwill impairment test, the Company concluded that goodwill was impaired as of the testing date of December 31, 2019. Pursuant to ASU 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, the single step is to determine the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill. To the extent the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill, the difference is the amount of the goodwill impairment. The Company’s annual impairment test as of December 31, 2019 resulted in $8,100,000 of impairment expense related to goodwill.
When evaluating the fair value of Helomics reporting unit the Company used a discounted cash flow model. Key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value included: (a) expected cash flow for the 20-year period following the testing date (including net revenues, costs of revenues, and operating expenses as well as estimated working capital needs and capital expenditures); (b) an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate of 3.0% determined based on the growth prospects of the reporting unit; and (c) a discount rate of 18.3% based on management’s best estimate of the after-tax weighted average cost of capital. The discount rate included a company specific risk premium of 7% for risks related to the term of the forecasts. During the third quarter of 2020, the Company’s share price experienced a sustained reduction in trading values. This was also reflective of broader difficulties in the general economic conditions due to the COVID pandemic. Based on our examination of these and other qualitative factors at September 30, 2020, the Company concluded that that potential impairment indicators were present and that an impairment assessment was warranted for goodwill.
In testing goodwill for impairment as of September 30, 2020, the Company performed a quantitative impairment test, including computing the fair value of the Helomics reporting unit and comparing that value to its carrying value. Based upon the Company’s quantitative goodwill impairment test, the Company concluded that goodwill was impaired as of the testing date of September 30, 2020. The quantitative review as of September 30, 2020 resulted in $2,997,000 of impairment expense related to goodwill.
When evaluating the fair value of Helomics reporting unit the Company used a discounted cash flow model and market comparisons. Key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value included: (a) expected cash flow for the 20-year period following the testing date (including net revenues, costs of revenues, and operating expenses as well as estimated working capital needs and capital expenditures); (b) an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate of 3.0% determined based on the growth prospects of the reporting unit; and (c) a discount rate of 25% based on management’s best estimate of the after-tax weighted average cost of capital. The discount rate included a Company specific risk premium of 10% for risks related to the term of the forecasts.
In testing goodwill for impairment as of December 31, 2020, the Company performed a quantitative impairment test, including computing the fair value of the Helomics reporting unit and comparing that value to its carrying value. Based upon the Company’s annual goodwill impairment test, the Company concluded that goodwill was impaired as of the testing date of December 31, 2020. Pursuant to ASU 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, the single step is to determine the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill. To the extent the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill, the difference is the amount of the goodwill impairment. The Company’s annual impairment test as of December 31, 2020 resulted in $9,879,458 of impairment expense related to goodwill. A decrease in the growth rate of 0.5% or an increase of 0.5% to the discount rate would reduce the fair value of Helomics reporting unit by approximately an additional $588,000 and $988,000, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the cumulative impairment recorded was $20,976,498.
When evaluating the fair value of Helomics reporting unit the Company used a discounted cash flow model. Key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value in 2020 included: (a) expected cash flow for the 10-year period following the testing date (including net revenues, costs of revenues, and operating expenses as well as estimated working capital needs and capital expenditures); (b) an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate of 5.0% determined based on the growth prospects of the reporting unit; and (c) a discount rate of 14.0% based on management’s best estimate of the after-tax weighted average cost of capital. The discount rate included a Company specific risk premium of 1.0% for risks related to the term of the forecasts. The Company further used a probability weighting of various forecasts to address forecast risk.
Long-lived Assets
The Company reviews finite-lived identifiable intangible assets for impairment in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable include, but are not limited to, a significant change in the medical device marketplace and a significant adverse change in the business climate in which the Company operates.
Because evaluation of other long-lived assets is necessary based on a triggering event, the Company prepared the undiscounted cash flows per ASC 360. The Company concluded that the undiscounted cash flows of the long-lived assets exceeded the carrying values. The Company concluded there was no impairment of its finite lived assets as of December 31, 2020.
Income Taxes. Deferred income taxes are provided on a liability method, whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences, which are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. The Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority.
