Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
You should read the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and operating results together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth in the section titled “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in or implied by these forward-looking statements. For convenience of presentation some of the numbers have been rounded in the text below.
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving the lives of patients suffering from debilitating and life-threatening diseases through the discovery, development and commercialization of therapies to degrade disease-causing proteins. We use our proprietary technology platform to engineer proteolysis targeting chimeras, or PROTAC targeted protein degraders, that are designed to harness the body’s own natural protein disposal system to selectively remove disease-causing proteins. We believe that our targeted protein degradation approach is a therapeutic modality that may provide distinct advantages over existing modalities, including traditional small molecule therapies and gene-based medicines. Our small-molecule PROTAC technology has the potential to address a broad range of intracellular disease targets, including those representing the up to 80% of proteins that cannot be addressed by existing small molecule therapies, commonly referred to as “undruggable” targets. We are using our PROTAC Discovery Engine to build an extensive pipeline of protein degradation product candidates to target diseases in oncology, neuroscience, and other therapeutic areas.
Our two lead product candidates are ARV-110 and ARV-471. We are developing ARV-110, a PROTAC protein degrader targeting the androgen receptor protein, or AR, for the treatment of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, or mCRPC. We initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of ARV-110 in March 2019. This Phase 1 trial is designed to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ARV-110 and also includes measures of anti-tumor activity as secondary endpoints, including reduction in prostate specific antigen, or PSA, a well-recognized biomarker of prostate cancer progression. We received fast track designation for ARV-110 for mCRPC in May 2019. In October 2020, we initiated the Phase 2 expansion for ARV-110.
We are also developing ARV-471, a PROTAC protein degrader targeting the estrogen receptor protein, or ER, for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic ER positive / HER2 negative breast cancer. We initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of ARV-471 in August 2019. This Phase 1 trial is designed to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ARV-471 and also includes measures of anti-tumor activity as secondary endpoints. We amended the protocol for our Phase 1 clinical trial for ARV-471 in the first quarter of 2020 to include the Phase 2 expansion cohort and in the fourth quarter of 2020 to include a Phase 1b cohort expansion of ARV-471 in combination with Ibrance® (palbociclib).
In our preclinical studies, these lead product candidates have demonstrated potent and selective protein degradation. We believe favorable clinical trial results in these initial oncology programs would provide validation of our platform as a new therapeutic modality for the potential treatment of diseases caused by dysregulated intracellular proteins regardless of therapeutic area.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many companies have experienced disruptions in their operations and in markets served. We have instated some and may take additional precautionary measures intended to help ensure our employees, well-being and minimize business disruption. We temporarily shut down our laboratories in mid-March 2020 and initiated work with biology contract research organizations, or CROs, but have since reopened our laboratories. Our office-based employees continue to work remotely. We considered the impact of COVID-19 on the assumptions and estimates used and determined that there were no material adverse impacts on our results of operations and financial position as of December 31, 2020. The full extent of the future impacts of COVID-19 on our operations is uncertain. A prolonged outbreak could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and business operations, including the timing and our ability to complete certain clinical trials and other efforts required to advance our preclinical pipeline.
We commenced operations in 2013, and our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, conducting discovery and research activities, filing patent applications, identifying potential product candidates, undertaking preclinical studies and clinical trials and establishing arrangements with third parties for the manufacture of initial quantities of our product candidates. To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and have financed our operations primarily through sales of our equity interests, proceeds from our collaborations, grant funding and debt financing. Through December 31, 2020, we raised approximately $887.3 million in gross proceeds from the sale of equity instruments and the exercise of stock options, and had received an aggregate of $120.8 million in payments from collaboration partners, grant funding and partially forgivable loans from the State of Connecticut.
In June 2019, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement, or the Collaboration Agreement, with Bayer AG, or, together with its controlled affiliates, Bayer, which agreement became effective in July 2019.
We also entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Bayer, or the Stock Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which we issued and sold to Bayer 1,346,313 shares of our common stock, or the Shares, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $32.5 million. The price per share was $24.14, based on a 15% premium above our 60-day trading average from April 2, 2019 through May 31, 2019. The closing price of our stock on July 16, 2019, the closing date for the issuance of shares under the Stock Purchase Agreement, was $25.10. In connection with the closing under the Stock Purchase Agreement, we also entered into an Investor Agreement providing for registration rights, standstill and lock-up restrictions and a voting agreement with respect to the Shares. On October 1, 2019, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 covering the resale of the Shares.
Also in June 2019, we entered into a Commitment Agreement with Bayer, relating to the formation of a joint venture entity, Oerth Bio LLC, or Oerth, for the purpose of researching, developing and commercializing PROTAC targeted protein degraders for applications in the field of agriculture. We consummated the formation of the joint venture with Bayer as contemplated by the Commitment Agreement in July 2019, upon the expiration of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, with respect to the reportable transactions and the satisfaction of other application closing conditions, or the JV Closing. Pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Agreement and certain other agreements entered into at the JV Closing, we and Bayer each made an in-kind intellectual property contribution to Oerth at the JV Closing. In addition, Bayer has made a $56.0 million total cash commitment to Oerth, $16.0 million of which Bayer contributed to Oerth in connection with the JV Closing. We and Bayer each hold an ownership interest in Oerth initially representing 50% of the ownership interests. A 15% ownership interest of Oerth is reserved for the future grant of incentive units to employees and service providers of Oerth. Oerth will generally be governed by a board of managers, or the JV Board, which will initially comprise four voting members, two of which will be designated by us and two of which will be designated by Bayer. JV Board decisions will generally be made by majority vote of the managers, with each manager having one vote. Certain matters will require both our consent and Bayer’s or both of our and Bayer’s designated managers on the JV Board. During the term of the joint venture and, in certain limited cases as described below, for one year following the end of the term of the joint venture, neither we, Bayer nor any of their respective affiliates may research, develop, manufacture, use or commercialize in the field of agriculture any PROTAC targeted protein degraders whose primary mechanism of action by design is the binding to and degradation of any Target, as defined below, subject to certain exclusions for early stage research activities and minority investments. Oerth and Bayer also entered into an option agreement, or the Option Agreement, pursuant to which the parties will agree to certain procedures for, and preferential rights relating to, the possible transfer to Bayer of PROTAC targeted protein degrader product candidates researched, developed and commercialized by Oerth under the joint venture. In addition, in the event either Bayer or a third party licenses a PROTAC targeted protein degrader candidate from Oerth pursuant to the Option Agreement, the non-licensing party or parties to the Commitment Agreement will be prohibited from developing, commercializing or otherwise exploiting any product utilizing PROTAC technology to target the same Target as that of the licensed product candidate in the field of agriculture.
We are a clinical-stage company. ARV-110 and ARV-471 are each in Phase 1/2 clinical trials and our other drug discovery activities are at the research and preclinical development stages. Our ability to generate revenue from product sales sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. Since inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years. Our net loss was $119.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, $70.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, and $41.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $491.9 million.
Our total operating expenses were $146.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, $94.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, and $58.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially due to costs associated with our ongoing and anticipated clinical activities for ARV-110 and ARV-471, development activities associated with our other product candidates, research activities in oncology, neurological and other disease areas to expand our pipeline, hiring additional personnel in research, clinical trials, quality and other functional areas, increased expenses incurred with contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to supply us with product for our preclinical and clinical studies and CROs for the synthesis of compounds in our pre-clinical development activities, as well as other associated costs including the management of our intellectual property portfolio.
We do not expect to generate revenue from sales of any product for many years, if ever. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research or product development programs or any future commercialization efforts, or to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.
Financial Operations Overview
Revenue
To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the foreseeable future. Our revenues to date have been generated through research collaboration and license agreements. Revenue is recognized ratably over our expected performance period under each agreement. We expect that any revenue for the next several years will be derived primarily from our current collaboration agreements and any additional collaborations that we may enter into in the future. To date, we have not received any royalties under any of the collaboration agreements.
Genentech License Agreement
In September 2015, we entered into an Option and License Agreement with Genentech, Inc. and F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, collectively referred to as Genentech, focused on PROTAC targeted protein degrader discovery and research for target proteins, or Targets, based on our proprietary platform technology, other than excluded Targets as described below. This collaboration was expanded in November 2017 through an Amended and Restated Option, License and Collaboration Agreement, which we refer to as the Restated Genentech Agreement.
Under the Restated Genentech Agreement, Genentech has the right to designate up to ten Targets for further discovery and research utilizing our PROTAC platform technology. Genentech may designate as a Target any protein to which a PROTAC targeted protein degrader, by design, binds to achieve its mechanism of action, subject to certain exclusions. Genentech also has the right to remove a Target from the collaboration and substitute a different Target that is not an excluded Target at any time prior to us commencing research on such Target or in certain circumstances following commencement of research by us.
At the time we entered into the original agreement with Genentech we received an upfront payment of $11.0 million, and at the time we entered into the Restated Genentech Agreement, we also received an additional $34.5 million in upfront payments and expansion target payments. We are eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $27.5 million in additional expansion target payments if Genentech exercises its options for all remaining Targets. We are also eligible to receive payments aggregating up to $44.0 million per Target upon the achievement of specified development milestones; payments aggregating up to $52.5 million per Target (assuming approval of two indications) subject to the achievement of specified regulatory milestones; and payments aggregating up to $60.0 million per PROTAC targeted protein degrader directed against the applicable Target, subject to the achievement of specified sales milestones. These milestone payments are subject to reduction if we do not have a valid patent claim covering the licensed PROTAC targeted protein degrader at the time the milestone is achieved. We are also eligible to receive, on net sales of licensed PROTAC targeted protein degraders, mid-single digit royalties, which may be subject to reductions.
Pfizer License Agreement
In December 2017, we entered into a Research Collaboration and License Agreement with Pfizer, Inc., or Pfizer, setting forth our collaboration to identify or optimize PROTAC targeted protein degraders that mediate for degradation of Targets using our proprietary platform technology that are identified in the agreement or subsequently selected by Pfizer, subject to certain exclusions. We refer to this agreement as the Pfizer Collaboration Agreement.
Under the Pfizer Collaboration Agreement, Pfizer has designated a number of initial Targets. For each identified Target, we and Pfizer will conduct a separate research program pursuant to a research plan. Pfizer may make substitutions for any of the initial Target candidates, subject to the stage of research for such Target.
In the year ended December 31, 2018, we received an upfront non-refundable payment and certain additional payments totaling $28.0 million in 2018 in exchange for use of the Company’s technology license and to fund Pfizer-related research as defined within the agreement. We are also eligible to receive up to an additional $37.5 million in non-refundable option payments if Pfizer exercises its options for all targets under the agreement. Pfizer has exercised options for $4.9 million as of December 31, 2020. We are also entitled to receive up to $225 million in development milestone payments and up to $550 million in sales-based milestone payments for all designated targets. In addition, we are eligible to receive, on net sales of PROTAC targeted protein degrader-related products, mid- to high-single digit tiered royalties, which may be subject to reductions. Pfizer paid us $1.2 million in December 2019 and $3.0 million in 2020 relating to adding additional targets into the collaboration.
Bayer Collaboration Agreement
In June 2019, we entered into the Bayer Collaboration Agreement with Bayer, setting forth our collaboration to identify or optimize PROTAC targeted protein degraders that mediate for degradation of Targets, using our proprietary platform technology, that are selected by Bayer, subject to certain exclusions and limitations. The Bayer Collaboration Agreement became effective in July 2019.
Under the Bayer Collaboration Agreement, we and Bayer will conduct a research program pursuant to separate research plans mutually agreed to by us and Bayer and tailored to each Target selected by Bayer. Bayer may make substitutions for any such initial Target candidates, subject to certain conditions and based on the stage of research for such Target. During the term of the Bayer Collaboration Agreement, we are not permitted, either directly or indirectly, to design, identify, discover or develop any small molecule pharmacologically-active agent whose primary mechanism of action is, by design, directed to the inhibition or degradation of any Target selected or reserved by Bayer, or grant any license, covenant not to sue or other right to any third party in the field of human disease under the licensed intellectual property for the conduct of such activities.
Under the terms of the Bayer Collaboration Agreement, we received an aggregate upfront non-refundable payment of $17.5 million, plus an additional $1.5 million in research funding payments. Bayer is committed to fund an additional $10.5 million in research funding payments through 2022, of which $3.0 million was received in 2020, subject to potential increases if our costs for research activities exceed the research funding payments allocated to a Target and certain conditions are met. We are also eligible to receive up to $197.5 million in development milestone payments and up to $490.0 million in sales-based milestone payments for all designated Targets. In addition, we are eligible to receive, on net sales of PROTAC targeted protein degrader-related products, mid-single digit to low-double digit tiered royalties, which may be subject to reductions.
Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses since inception have consisted solely of research and development costs and general and administrative costs.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our discovery efforts, and the development of our product candidates, and include:
•
salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, for personnel engaged in research and development functions;
•
expenses incurred under agreements with third parties, including contract research organizations and other third parties that conduct research and preclinical activities on our behalf as well as third parties that manufacture our product candidates for use in our preclinical studies and clinical trials;
•
costs of outside consultants, including their fees, stock-based compensation and related travel expenses;
•
the costs of laboratory supplies and developing preclinical studies and clinical trial materials;
•
facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs of equipment and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs; and
•
third-party licensing fees.
We expense research and development costs as incurred.
We typically use our employee and infrastructure resources across our development programs, and as such, do not track all of our internal research and development expenses on a program-by-program basis. The following table summarizes our research and development expenses for our AR program, ER program and all other platform and exploratory research and development costs:
Research and development activities are central to our business model. We expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase substantially for the foreseeable future as we conduct clinical trials for ARV-110 and ARV-471, including our ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trials, and continue to discover and develop additional product candidates.
We cannot reasonably estimate or determine with certainty the duration and costs of future clinical trials of ARV-110 and ARV-471 or any other product candidate we may develop or if, when, or to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. We may never succeed in obtaining marketing approval for any product candidate. The successful development and commercialization of our product candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs, including the uncertainty of:
•
successful completion of preclinical studies;
•
successful initiation of clinical trials;
•
successful patient enrollment in and completion of clinical trials;
•
receipt and related terms of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;
•
obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates;
•
making arrangements with third-party manufacturers, or establishing manufacturing capabilities, for both clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates;
•
establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities and launching commercial sales of our products, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;
•
acceptance of our products, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;
•
obtaining and maintaining third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement;
•
maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of the products following approval; and
•
effectively competing with other therapies.
A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate, or if we experience significant delays in our clinical trials due to patient enrollment or other reasons, we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation for personnel in our executive, finance, business development and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include legal fees relating to intellectual property and corporate matters; professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and consulting services; insurance costs; travel expenses; and facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs.
We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our personnel headcount to support increased research and development activities relating to our product candidates. We also expect to incur increased expenses associated with being a public company, including costs of accounting, audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with Nasdaq and Securities and Exchange Commission requirements; director and officer insurance costs; and investor and public relations costs.
Interest Income (Expense)
Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Interest income decreased in 2020 due to declining interest rates and a decrease in our marketable securities. Interest expense consists of interest paid or accrued on our outstanding partially forgivable debt of $2.0 million. Interest expense was approximately $0.1 million in 2020 and we expect that it will remain relatively stable at that level in 2021.
Income Taxes
Since our inception in 2013, we have not recorded any U.S. federal or state income tax benefits for the net losses we have incurred in any year or for our federal earned research and development tax credits, due to our uncertainty of realizing a benefit from those items. As of December 31, 2020, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $205.1 million, which begin to expire in 2033. As of December 31, 2020, we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $10.1 million and $2.3 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2033 and 2029, respectively.
As of December 31, 2020, Arvinas, Inc. had four wholly owned subsidiaries organized as C-corporations: Arvinas Operations, Inc., Arvinas Androgen Receptor, Inc., Arvinas Estrogen Receptor, Inc., and Arvinas Winchester, Inc. Prior to December 31, 2018, these subsidiaries were separate filers for federal tax purposes. Net operating loss carryforwards are generated from the C-corporation subsidiaries’ filings. We have provided a valuation allowance against the full amount of the deferred tax assets since, in the opinion of management, based upon our earnings history, it is more likely than not that the benefits will not be realized.
Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, costs and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue under Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Our revenue is generated through research collaboration and license agreements with pharmaceutical partners. The terms of these agreements contain multiple goods and services which may include (i) licenses, (ii) research and development activities and (iii) participation in joint research and development steering committees. The terms of these agreements may include non-refundable upfront license or option fees, payments for research and development activities, payments upon the achievement of certain milestones, and royalty payments based on product sales derived from the collaboration. Under ASC 606, we evaluate whether the license agreement, research and development services, and participation in research and development steering committees, represent separate or combined performance obligations. We have determined that these services within our existing contracts represent a combined single performance obligation.
The research collaboration and license agreements typically include contingent milestone payments related to specified preclinical and clinical development milestones and regulatory milestones. These milestone payments represent variable consideration that are not initially recognized within the transaction price as they are fully constrained under the guidance in ASC 606. We will continue to assess the probability of significant reversals for any amounts that become likely to be realized prior to recognizing the variable consideration associated with these payments within the transaction price.
Revenue is recognized ratably over our expected performance period under each respective arrangement. We make our best estimate of the period over which we expect to fulfill our performance obligations, which includes access to technology through the license agreement and research activities. Given the uncertainties of these collaboration arrangements, significant judgement is required to determine the duration of the performance period.
For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, transaction price allocated to the combined performance obligation identified under the agreements was recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the estimated performance period under each respective arrangement. Straight-line basis was considered the best measure of progress in which control of the combined obligation transfers to the customers, due to the contract containing license rights to technology, research and development services, and joint committee participation, which in totality are expected to occur ratably over the performance period.
Our contracts may also call for certain sales-based milestone and royalty payments upon successful commercialization of a target. In accordance with ASC 606-10-55-65, we recognize revenues from sales-based milestone and royalty payments at the later of (i) the occurrence of the subsequent sale; or (ii) the performance obligation to which some or all of the sales-based milestone or royalty payments has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). We anticipate recognizing these milestone and royalty payments if and when subsequent sales are generated by the customer from the use of the technology. To date, no revenue from these sales-based milestone and royalty payments has been recognized for any periods.
Amounts received prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are recorded as a contract liability in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Research and Development Contract Costs and Accruals
As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advance payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in the financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of these estimates with the service providers and make adjustments, if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:
• vendors in connection with clinical development activities; and
• CROs and investigative sites in connection with pre-clinical, non-clinical, and human clinical trials
We base the expense recorded related to external research and development on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with multiple CMOs and CROs that supply, conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we adjust the accrual or the amount of prepaid expenses accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have not been any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses.
Incentive Units
Prior to our initial public offering, we issued equity-based compensation awards to employees and non-employees through the granting of incentive units. We had periodically granted incentive units to employees and non-employees, which generally vested over a four-year period. The incentive units represented a separate substantive class of equity with defined rights within the limited liability company agreement of Arvinas Holding Company, LLC. The incentive units represented profit interest in the increase in the value of the entity over a participation threshold, as determined at the time of grant. The holder, therefore, had the right to participate in distributions of profits only in excess of such participation threshold. The participation threshold was based on the valuation of the incentive unit on or around the grant date.
We accounted for unit-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. In accordance with ASC 718, compensation cost is measured at estimated fair value and is included as compensation expense over the vesting period during which an employee provides service in exchange for the award.
We used a Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of our incentive units, due to the existence of a participation threshold. The Black-Scholes option pricing model includes various assumptions, including the expected life of incentive units, the expected volatility and the expected risk-free interest rate. The fair value of the underlying common units represented the exercise price utilized in the Black-Scholes option pricing model. These assumptions reflected our best estimates, but they involved inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside our control. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, unit-based compensation cost could have been materially impacted. Furthermore, if we used different assumptions for future grants, unit-based compensation cost could have been materially impacted in future periods.
As there had been no public market for our common units prior to our initial public offering, the estimated fair value of our common units had been determined by our board of directors as of the date of each incentive unit grant, with input from management, considering our most recently available third-party valuations of common stock units. Valuations were updated when facts and circumstances indicated that the most recent valuation was no longer valid, such as changes in the stage of our development efforts, various exit strategies and their timing, and other scientific developments that could be related to the valuation of our company, or, at a minimum, annually. Third-party valuations were performed in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Accounting and Valuation Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. Our common unit valuation in January 2018 was prepared using a market approach, specifically the subject company transaction method. The subject company transaction method solves for the total equity value which allocates a probability-weighted present value to the series B preferred unit holders consistent with the investment amount of that financing round adjusted to account for the impact of progress or changes in the business since the closing of the series B financing. Our common unit valuation as of June 30, 2018 was prepared using the income and market approaches simultaneously. Under the income approach, the hybrid method was used, which is a combination of the probability weighted expected return method, or PWERM, and the option pricing method, or OPM. Under the market approach, the subject company transaction method was used. Within both the PWERM and OPM, the subject company transaction method was used to solve for the total equity value which allocates a probability weighted present value to the series C preferred unit holders consistent with the investment amount of that financing round.
These third-party valuations resulted in participation thresholds of $270.8 million as of March 31, 2018 and $292.0 million as of June 30, 2018. Fair value estimates of underlying shares are no longer necessary to determine the fair value of new equity awards because the underlying shares are traded in the public market.
Immediately prior to the effectiveness of our registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-227112) in September 2018, Arvinas Holding Company, LLC, or Arvinas LLC, our predecessor company, converted from a Delaware limited liability company into Arvinas, Inc., a Delaware corporation, which we refer to as the Conversion. In connection with the Conversion, incentive units in Arvinas LLC were exchanged for common stock and restricted common stock of Arvinas, Inc.

Results of Operations
Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Revenues
Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $21.8 million, compared with $43.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 included $24.7 million recognized from the contribution of the license to Oerth. The balance of the revenue increased by $3.5 million over the prior year primarily related to a full year of revenue in 2020 associated with the Bayer Collaboration Agreement which was initiated in the third quarter of 2019 and an increase in activities related to the Pfizer agreement.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $108.4 million, compared with $67.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $41.2 million was primarily due to an increase in our continued investment in our wholly-owned platform and exploratory programs of $17.6 million, expenses related to our AR program of $12.3 million and our ER program of $11.3 million. The increase in spending over all of our programs was primarily due to increased personnel and personnel costs utilized across all our programs of $14.7 million, including an increase in stock compensation expense of $5.7 million. Clinical trial costs and related drug manufacturing costs increased by $20.2 million as we expanded or AR and ER programs in 2020. Direct expenses related to our platform and exploratory programs increased $7.0 million in 2020 as we expanded the number of protein targets in the exploratory phase.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses were $38.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with $27.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $11.0 million was primarily due to an increase of $9.6 million in personnel and facility related costs, including $4.8 million related to stock compensation expense, and insurance, taxes and professional fees of $1.4 million.
Other Income
Other income was $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease of $0.4 million due to lower interest rates and a decrease in our marketable securities investments, partially offset by an increase in refundable income tax credits from the State of Connecticut of $0.4 million.
Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018
Revenues
Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $43.0 million, compared with $14.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 included $24.7 million recognized from the contribution of the license to Oerth. The remaining revenues of $18.3 million increased by $4.0 million over the prior year primarily related to the revenue associated with the Bayer Collaboration Agreement which was initiated in the third quarter of 2019 and an increase in license and rights to technology fees and research and development activities related to the Pfizer Collaboration Agreement.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $67.2 million, compared with $45.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of $22.0 million was primarily due to an increase in our continued investment in our wholly-owned platform and exploratory programs of $19.2 million, expenses related to our ER program of $2.0 million and AR program of $0.8 million. The increase in spending over all of our programs was primarily due to increased personnel and personnel costs of $10.9 million, including an increase in stock compensation expense of $3.6 million. Direct expenses related to our platform and exploratory programs increased $11.1 million in 2019 as we expanded the number of protein targets in the exploratory phase. Clinical trial costs increased by $3.0 million but were more than offset by a decrease in lead optimization costs and IND-enabling costs for our AR and ER programs in 2019.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses were $27.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared with $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of $14.4 million was primarily due to an increase of $10.0 million in personnel and facility related costs, including $5.0 million related to stock compensation expense. Increases in other costs, including legal and other professional fees of $3.0 million and corporate insurance of $0.9 million, are primarily related to costs incurred in our first full year as a public company in 2019.
Other Income
Other income was $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared with $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of $3.6 million was primarily related to an increase in interest income of $2.1 million and an increase in refundable research and development credits from the State of Connecticut of $1.2 million. The increase in interest income was the result of our higher average cash, cash equivalent and short-term investment balances for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to the proceeds from our initial public offering in 2018, the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Bayer Collaboration Agreement and our follow-on public offering in 2019.
Loss on Equity Method Investment
Loss on equity method investment for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $24.7 million, generated from Oerth’s expensing intellectual property contributed to it.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources of Liquidity
We do not currently have any approved products and have never generated any revenue from product sales. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity interests and through payments from collaboration partners, grant funding and loans from the State of Connecticut. Through December 31, 2020, we raised approximately $887.3 million in gross proceeds from the sale of equity interests and the exercise of stock options and had received an aggregate of $120.8 million in payments from collaboration partners, grant funding and forgivable and partially forgivable loans from the State of Connecticut. In October 2018, we completed our IPO in which we issued and sold an aggregate of 7,700,482 shares of common stock, including 200,482 additional shares of common stock at a subsequent closing upon the exercise in part by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares at a public offering price of $16.00 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $123.2 million before fees and expenses. In July 2019, we sold 1,346,313 shares of common stock to Bayer AG for aggregate gross proceeds of $32.5 million. In November 2019, we completed a follow-on offering in which we issued 5,227,273 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $22.00 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $115.0 million before fees and expenses. In December 2020, we completed a public offering in which we issued 6,571,428 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $70.00 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $460.0 million before fees and expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold 2,593,637 shares of common stock in an “at-the-market offering” for aggregate net proceeds of $64.1 million before fees and expenses.
Cash Flows
Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $688.5 million as of December 31, 2020 and $280.9 million as of December 31, 2019. We had an outstanding loan balance of $2.0 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for the period presented:
Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $89.8 million, resulting from our net loss of $119.3 million and a decrease in deferred revenue of $13.3 million, partially offset by non-cash expenses of $35.5 million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $12.8 million. Non-cash expenses included $30.2 million of stock compensation expense. The decrease in deferred revenue is primarily due to $21.8 million of revenue recognized, partially offset by $8.5 million in payments received and an accounts receivable from collaboration partners.
Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $40.6 million, resulting from our net loss of $70.3 million and an increase in other receivables of $4.0 million, partially offset by non-cash expenses of $22.5 million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $5.2 million and deferred revenue of $4.9 million. The increase in deferred revenue is primarily due to $23.1 million in payments received from collaboration partners, partially offset by $18.3 million of revenue recognized.
Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $16.1 million, resulting from our net loss of $41.5 million and a reduction in our deferred revenue of $8.5 million, partially offset by non-cash expenses of $12.8 million and a decrease in accounts receivable of $22.2 million. The reduction in deferred revenue is primarily due to $14.3 million of revenue recognized, partially offset by $5.8 million in target payments received from a collaboration partner.
Investing Activities
Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $164.3 million, attributable to the net maturities and sales of marketable securities in excess of purchases of $170.7 million, offset by the purchases of property and equipment of $6.4 million.
Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $93.1 million, attributable to the net investment of excess cash of $86.9 million and the purchases of property and equipment of $6.2 million.
Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $179.7 million, attributable to the net investment of excess cash of $176.8 million and the purchases of property and equipment of $2.8 million.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $504.7 million, primarily attributable to the proceeds from sales of our common stock from our public offering and at-the-market offering of $496.4 million, net of combined underwriter discounts from the public offering and offering costs of $29.2 million and the proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $8.3 million.
Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $139.7 million, primarily attributable to the proceeds from the sales of our common stock, net of underwriter discounts and offering costs, of $137.1 million and the proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $2.8 million. We also made $0.2 million in debt payments.
Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $168.1 million, primarily attributable to the net proceeds from the sale of series C preferred units of $55.0 million and the sale of common stock, net of underwriter discounts and offering costs, of $111.2 million. We also received loan proceeds of $2.0 million and made $0.2 million in debt payments.
Funding Requirements
Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates. In addition, we expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.
Specifically, we anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we:
•
continue a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of our product candidate ARV-110, and initiate one or more Phase 1b cohort expansions of ARV-110 in combination with standard of care agents, in men with mCRPC;
•
continue a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of our product candidate ARV-471, a Phase 1b cohort expansion of ARV-471 in combination with palbociclib, and initiate an additional Phase 1b cohort expansion in combination with a standard of care agent, each in patients with locally advanced or metastatic ER positive / HER2 negative breast cancer, and initiate a window of opportunity study in early breast cancer;
•
initiate a planned Phase 1 clinical trial of our product candidate ARV-766 in the first half of 2021;
•
apply our PROTAC Discovery Engine to advance additional product candidates into preclinical and clinical development;
•
expand the capabilities of our PROTAC Discovery Engine;
•
seek marketing approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;
•
ultimately establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure and scale up external manufacturing capabilities to commercialize any products for which we may obtain marketing approval;
•
expand, maintain and protect our intellectual property portfolio;
•
hire additional development, including clinical and regulatory, and scientific personnel; and
•
add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel to support our research, product development and future commercialization efforts and support our operations as a public company.
As of December 31, 2020, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into 2024. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:
•
the progress, costs and results of our ongoing clinical trials for ARV-110 and for ARV-471 and any future clinical development of ARV-110 and ARV-471;
•
the initiation, progress, costs and results of our planned clinical trial for ARV-766 and any future clinical development of ARV-766;
•
the scope, progress, costs and results of preclinical and clinical development for our other product candidates and development programs;
•
the number of, and development requirements for, other product candidates that we pursue, including our other oncology and neurodegenerative research programs;
•
the success of our collaborations with Pfizer, Genentech and Bayer;
•
the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;
•
the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;
•
the revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;
•
the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims; and
•
our ability to establish additional collaboration arrangements with other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies on favorable terms, if at all, for the development or commercialization of our product candidates.
As a result of these anticipated expenditures, we will need to obtain substantial additional financing in connection with our continuing operations. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial revenue from product sales, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements. Although we may receive potential future payments under our collaborations with Pfizer, Genentech and Bayer, we do not currently have any committed external source of funds. Adequate additional funds may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our research, product development programs or any future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making acquisitions or capital expenditures or declaring dividends.
If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.
Borrowings
In August 2013, we entered into a Loan Agreement, or Loan, with Connecticut Innovations, Incorporated, or CII, the strategic venture capital arm and a component unit of the State of Connecticut. Under the Loan, we borrowed $750,000 for the purchase of laboratory equipment, information technology equipment and leasehold improvements. Interest on the Loan was compounded on a monthly basis at a rate of 7.50% per annum. The Loan provided for monthly, interest-only payments for ten months. Beginning on June 1, 2015 we were required to make monthly principal and interest payments through July 31, 2019. We could have prepaid the amount due at any time without premium or penalty. The Loan was secured by substantially all of our assets. The amount outstanding under the Loan was $0.2 million as of December 31, 2018. We paid the Loan in full in July 2019. In connection with the issuance of the Loan, we granted CII a warrant to purchase 110,116 of our series A preferred units at a purchase price of $0.6811 per unit, with a seven-year term from the date of issuance. The warrant was exercised in July 2018.
In January 2014, we entered into an Assistance Agreement with the State of Connecticut, or the 2014 Assistance Agreement. Under the terms of the 2014 Assistance Agreement, we borrowed $2.5 million. Borrowings under the 2014 Assistance Agreement were forgivable if we maintained a minimum number of full-time jobs in the State of Connecticut for a minimum period at a minimum annual salary. Effective in March 2016, the full principal amount under the 2014 Assistance Agreement had been forgiven. While borrowings under the 2014 Assistance Agreement have been forgiven, we remain subject to an ongoing covenant to be located in the State of Connecticut through January 2024. Upon violation of this covenant we would be required to repay the full original funding amount of $2.5 million plus liquidated damages of 7.50%.
In June 2018, we entered into an additional Assistance Agreement with the State of Connecticut, or the 2018 Assistance Agreement, to provide funding for the expansion and renovation of laboratory and office space. Under the terms of the 2018 Assistance Agreement, we could borrow from the State of Connecticut a maximum of $2.0 million, provided that the funding does not exceed more than 50% of the total costs of the expansion and renovation. Borrowings under the 2018 Assistance Agreement bear an interest rate of 3.25% per annum and interest payments are required for the first 60 months from the funding date. Interest expense related to the Assistance Agreement is expected to be $65,000 annually for the first five years. Thereafter, the loan begins to fully amortize through month 120, maturing in June 2028. Up to $1.0 million of the funding can be forgiven if we meet certain employment conditions. We may be required to prepay a portion of the loan if the employment conditions are not met. The 2018 Assistance Agreement requires that we be located in the State of Connecticut through June 2028 with a default penalty of repayment of the full original funding amount of $2.0 million plus liquidated damages of 7.5% of the total amount of funding received. We borrowed the full $2.0 million under the 2018 Assistance Agreement in September 2018 and the full amount remains outstanding at December 31, 2020.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements and do not have any holdings in variable interest entities.
