ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
(Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)
Overview
We are a holding company and are engaged principally in two business segments:
•Tobacco: the manufacture and sale of cigarettes in the United States through our Liggett Group LLC and Vector Tobacco Inc. subsidiaries, and
•Real Estate: the real estate services, technology and investment business through our subsidiary New Valley, which (i) owns Douglas Elliman Realty, (ii) has interests in numerous real estate projects across the United States and (iii) is seeking to acquire or invest in additional real estate services, technologies, properties or projects. Douglas Elliman operates the largest residential brokerage company in the New York metropolitan area and also conducts residential real estate brokerage operations in Florida, California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Colorado, New Jersey and Texas.
Our tobacco subsidiaries’ cigarettes are produced in 100 combinations of length, style and packaging. Liggett’s current brand portfolio includes:
•Eagle 20’s
•Pyramid
•Montego
•Grand Prix
•Liggett Select
•Eve
•USA and various Partner Brands and private label brands.
The discount segment is a challenging marketplace, with consumers having less brand loyalty and placing greater emphasis on price. Liggett’s competition is divided into two segments. The first segment consists of the three largest manufacturers of cigarettes in the United States: Philip Morris USA Inc., which is owned by Altria Group, Inc., RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company, which is owned by British American Tobacco Plc, and ITG Brands LLC, which is owned by Imperial Brands Plc. These three manufacturers, while primarily premium cigarette-based companies, also produce and sell discount cigarettes. The second segment of competition is comprised of a group of smaller manufacturers and importers, most of which sell deep discount cigarettes.
See Item 1. “Business” for detailed overview and description of our principal operations.
Certain discussions of the changes in our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources from the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 have been omitted from this Form 10-K, but may be found in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 2, 2020.
COVID-19 Pandemic
The outbreak of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, has led to adverse impacts on the U.S. and global economies and created economic uncertainty. Although much uncertainty still surrounds the pandemic, including its duration and ultimate overall impact on our operations and real estate ventures, we are carefully evaluating potential outcomes and working to mitigate risks. As with many other companies, our operations have been affected by COVID-19. We have implemented remote working for many employees and adopted the social distancing protocols recommended by public health authorities. The following provides a summary of our actions in our two segments - Tobacco and Real Estate - since COVID-19 was declared a pandemic.
Impact of COVID-19 on Tobacco Segment. To date, we have not experienced any material disruptions to our supply or distribution chains, and have not experienced any material adverse effects associated with governmental actions to restrict consumer movement or business operations. However, our suppliers and members of our distribution chain may be subject to government action requiring facility closures and remote working protocols. The majority of retail stores in which our tobacco products are sold, including convenience stores, have been deemed to be essential businesses by authorities and have remained open. We continue to monitor the risk that a supplier, a distributor or any other entity within our supply and distribution chain closes temporarily or permanently.
Although our tobacco segment has not been negatively impacted to date by COVID-19, there remains uncertainty as to how the pandemic may ultimately impact the market. We continue to monitor the macro-economic risks of COVID-19 and the effect on tobacco consumers, including purchasing behavior changes and changes in sales volumes and mix within the discount category. Our Eagle 20’s and Montego brands are priced in the deep discount category and our other brands are primarily priced in the traditional discount category.
Impact of COVID-19 on Real Estate Segment. Douglas Elliman is the largest residential real estate broker in the New York City market and approximately 46% of its revenues were derived from this region in 2018 and 2019. In addition, New Valley has investments in multiple real estate ventures and properties in the New York metropolitan area, which had a carrying value of $35,685 at December 31, 2020. Published reports and data indicate that the New York metropolitan area was initially impacted more than any other area in the United States. Consequently, various governmental agencies in the New York metropolitan area and in other markets where Douglas Elliman operates, instituted quarantines, “pause” orders, “shelter-in-place” rules, restrictions on travel and restrictions on the types of businesses that could operate. These restrictions adversely impacted Douglas Elliman’s ability to conduct business during the year ended December 31, 2020. For example, Douglas Elliman’s agents were restricted from performing in-person showings of properties or conducting open houses in most of Douglas Elliman’s markets from March 2020 to June 2020. Douglas Elliman experienced a severe decline in closed sales volume in New York City from March 2020 to October 2020.
Beginning in April 2020, as a response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company made significant operating adjustments at Douglas Elliman Realty LLC, including a reduction of personnel of approximately 25% and reductions of other administrative expenses, as well as a reduction, deferral or elimination of certain office lease expenses. Despite increases in expenses in the fourth quarter of 2020 as business improved, Douglas Elliman Realty LLC operated at a lower cost basis for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2019.
The COVID-19 pandemic and macroeconomic trends resulting therefrom could continue to have a material impact on our Real Estate segment; the likelihood and magnitude of a material impact increases with the amount of time the virus affects activity levels in locations in which Douglas Elliman operates. Therefore, we are unable to predict the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and macroeconomic trends (including, in particular the virtual work trend arising as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic), or other factors resulting therefrom on the future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows from our Real Estate segment.
Recent Developments
Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services Inc. (“LTS”). On November 11, 2019, LTS entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Advisor Group. On February 14, 2020, the merger was completed, and each share of LTS common stock was converted into a cash payment of $3.50 per share. We received proceeds of $53,169 from our 15,191,205 common shares of LTS, and we recorded a pre-tax gain of $53,424 from the transaction. We also tendered 240,000 shares of LTS’s 8% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock for redemption and received an additional $6,009 in March 2020. At the closing of the transaction, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer resigned as Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of LTS, and our management agreement with LTS was terminated.
Maturity of 5.5% Variable Interest Senior Convertible Debentures due 2020. In April 2020, our 5.5% Variable Interest Senior Convertible Debentures due 2020 matured and we retired them with a cash payment for the principal balance of $169,610.
Issuance of Common Stock. In May 2020, we announced the pricing of our underwritten public offering (the “Offering”) of 5,000,000 shares of our common stock. We received approximately $53,000 in proceeds from the offering.
Montego. In August 2020, Liggett expanded the distribution of its Montego deep discount brand by 10 states, primarily located in the southeast. Prior to August 2020, Montego was sold in select targeted markets in four states. Montego’s volume
represented 6.3% of Liggett’s unit volume for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 3.8% for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Issuance of Senior Secured Notes due 2029. In January 2021, we issued $875,000 in aggregate principal of our 5.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2029 (“5.75% Senior Secured Notes”) in a private offering that is exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to persons outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. The 5.75% Senior Secured Notes pay interest on a semi-annual basis at a rate of 5.75% per year and mature on February 1, 2029. Prior to February 1, 2024, we may redeem some or all of the 5.75% Senior Secured Notes at any time at a make-whole redemption price and, thereafter, we may redeem some or all of the 5.75% Senior Secured Notes at a premium that will decrease over time, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. The aggregate net proceeds from the issuance of the 5.75% Senior Secured Notes were approximately $855,500 after deducting offering expenses. We used the net proceeds of the issuance, together with cash on hand, to redeem all of our outstanding 6.125% Senior Secured Notes due 2025, including accrued interest and any premium thereon, and to pay fees and expenses in connection with the offering of the 5.75% Senior Secured Notes.
Recent Developments in Tobacco-Related Litigation
The cigarette industry continues to be challenged on numerous fronts. New cases continue to be commenced against Liggett and other cigarette manufacturers. Liggett could be subjected to substantial liabilities and bonding requirements from litigation relating to cigarette products. Adverse litigation outcomes could have a negative impact on our ability to operate due to their impact on cash flows. It is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending cases including the certification of additional class actions. An unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobacco-related litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation. In addition, an unfavorable outcome in any tobacco-related litigation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Liggett could face difficulties in obtaining a bond to stay execution of a judgment pending appeal.
Mississippi Dispute. In January 2016, the Attorney General for Mississippi filed a motion in Chancery Court in Jackson County, Mississippi to enforce the March 1996 settlement agreement (the “1996 Agreement”). In April 2017, the Chancery Court ruled that the 1996 Agreement should be enforced and referred the matter to a Special Master for further proceedings to determine the amount of damages, if any, to be awarded. In July 2019, the parties stipulated that the unpaid principal (exclusive of interest) purportedly due from Liggett to Mississippi pursuant to the 1996 Agreement (from inception through 2019) is approximately $15,500, subject to Liggett’s right to litigate and/or appeal the enforceability of the 1996 Agreement (and all issues other than the calculation of such principal amount). In September 2019, the Special Master held a hearing regarding the state’s claim for approximately $17,500 in prejudgment interest as well as post-judgment interest in amounts to be determined. A decision is pending. In the event Liggett appeals an adverse judgment, the posting of a bond may be required.
Critical Accounting Policies
General. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Significant estimates subject to material changes in the near term include impairment charges, valuation of intangible assets, promotional accruals, actuarial assumptions of pension plans, deferred tax liabilities, settlement accruals, valuation of investments, including other-than-temporary impairments to such investments, and litigation and defense costs. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition. Revenue is measured based on a consideration specified in a contract with a customer and excludes any sales incentives. Revenue is recognized when (a) an enforceable contract with a customer exists, that has commercial substance, and collection of substantially all consideration for services is probable; and (b) the performance obligations to the customer are satisfied either over time or at a point in time.
Revenue from cigarette sales, which include federal excise taxes billed to customers, are recognized upon shipment of cigarettes when control has passed to the customer. Average collection terms for Tobacco sales range between three and twelve days from the time cigarettes are shipped to the customer. We record a liability for goods estimated to be returned in other current liabilities and the associated receivable for anticipated federal excise tax refunds in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The allowance for returned goods is based principally on sales volumes and historical return rates. The estimated costs of sales incentives, including customer incentives and trade promotion activities, are based principally on historical experience and are accounted for as reductions in Tobacco revenue. Expected payments for sales incentives are included in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We account for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs as part of cost of sales.
Real estate commissions earned by our Real Estate brokerage businesses are recognized as revenue when the real estate sale is completed or lease agreement is executed, which is the point in time that the performance obligation is satisfied. Any commission and other payments received in advance are deferred until the satisfaction of the performance obligation. Corresponding agent commission expenses, including any advance commission or other direct expense payments, are deferred and recognized as cost of sales concurrently with related revenues.
Contracts in our development marketing business provide us with the exclusive right to sell units in a subject property for a commission fee per unit sold calculated as a percentage of the sales price of each unit. Accordingly, a performance obligation exists for each unit in the Development Marketing property under contract, and a portion of the total contract transaction price is allocated to and recognized at the time each unit is sold.
Under development marketing service arrangements, dedicated staff are required for a subject property and these costs are typically reimbursed from the customer through advance payments that are recoupable from future commission earnings. Advance payments received and associated direct costs paid are deferred, allocated to each unit in the subject property, and recognized at the time of the completed sale of each unit.
Development marketing service arrangements also include direct fulfillment costs incurred in advance of the satisfaction of the performance obligation. We capitalize costs incurred in fulfilling a contract with a customer if the fulfillment costs 1) relate directly to an existing contract or anticipated contract, 2) generate or enhance resources that will be used to satisfy performance obligations in the future, and 3) are expected to be recovered. These costs are amortized over the estimated customer relationship period which is the contract term. We use an amortization method that is consistent with the pattern of transfer of goods or services to its customers by allocating these costs to each unit in the subject property and expensing these costs as each unit sold is closed over the contract.
Commission revenue is recognized at the time the performance obligation is met for our Real Estate commercial leasing contracts, which is when the lease agreement is executed, as there are no further performance obligations, including any amounts of future payments under extended payment terms.
Our Real Estate property management revenue arrangements consist of providing operational and administrative services to manage a subject property. Fees for these services are typically billed and collected monthly. Property management service fees are recognized as revenue over time using the output method as the performance obligations under the customer arrangement are satisfied each month. Our Real Estate title insurance commission fee revenue is earned when the sale of the title insurance is completed, which corresponds to the point in time when the underlying real estate sale transaction closes and the payment is received.
Leasing Standard. On January 1, 2019, we adopted ASU No. 2016-02- Leases (Topic 842), therefore, our lease accounting policy has been modified as discussed in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. Under ASC 842, we determine if an arrangement is a lease at contract inception. At lease commencement, we record and recognize right-of-use (“ROU”) assets for the lease liability amount and initial direct costs incurred, offset by lease incentives received. We record lease liabilities for the net present value of future lease payments over the lease term. The discount rate we use is generally our estimated incremental borrowing rate unless the lessor’s implicit rate is readily determinable. We calculate discount rates periodically to estimate the rate we would pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value, over a similar term, with a similar security. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We recognize operating lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We recognize finance lease cost on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the lease term. Operating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in investments in real estate, net, property, plant and equipment and current and long-term portions of notes payable and long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets.
Contingencies. We record Liggett’s product liability legal expenses and other litigation costs as operating, selling, administrative and general expenses as those costs are incurred. As discussed in Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements, legal proceedings regarding Liggett’s tobacco products are pending or threatened in various jurisdictions against Liggett and us.
We record provisions in our consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. At the present time, while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur, except as discussed in Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements and discussed below related to the 16 cases where an adverse verdict was entered against Liggett: (i) management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobacco-related cases; or (ii) management is unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of any of the pending tobacco-related cases and, therefore, management has not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes, if any. Legal defense costs are expensed as incurred.
Although Liggett has generally been successful in managing litigation in the past, litigation is subject to uncertainty and significant challenges remain, particularly with respect to the Engle progeny cases.
A reader of this Form 10-K should not infer from the absence of any reserve in our consolidated financial statements that we will not be subject to significant tobacco-related liabilities in the future. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and it is possible that our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome in any such tobacco-related litigation.
There may be several other proceedings, lawsuits and claims pending against us and certain of our consolidated subsidiaries unrelated to tobacco or tobacco product liability. We are of the opinion that the liabilities, if any, ultimately resulting from such other proceedings, lawsuits and claims should not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Master Settlement Agreement. As discussed in Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements, Liggett and Vector Tobacco are participants in the Master Settlement Agreement (“MSA”). Liggett and Vector Tobacco have no payment obligations under the MSA except to the extent their market shares exceed approximately 1.65% and 0.28%, respectively, of total cigarettes sold in the United States. Their obligations, and the related expense charges under the MSA, are subject to adjustments based upon, among other things, the volume of cigarettes sold by Liggett and Vector Tobacco, their relative market shares and inflation. Since relative market shares are based on cigarette shipments, the best estimate of the allocation of charges under the MSA is recorded in cost of goods sold as the products are shipped. Settlement expenses under the MSA recorded in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were $175,837 for 2020, $165,471 for 2019 and $162,522 for 2018. Adjustments to these estimates are recorded in the period that the change becomes probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
Embedded Derivatives and Beneficial Conversion Feature. We measure all derivatives, including certain derivatives embedded in other contracts, at fair value and recognize them on the consolidated balance sheets as an asset or a liability, depending on our rights and obligations under the applicable derivative contract. We have issued variable interest senior convertible debt in a series of private placements where a portion of the total interest payable on the debt is computed by reference to the cash dividends paid on our common stock. This portion of the interest payment is considered an embedded derivative within the convertible debt, which we are required to separately value. As a result, we have bifurcated this embedded derivative and estimated the fair value of the embedded derivative liability. The resulting discount created by allocating a portion of the issuance proceeds to the embedded derivative is then amortized to interest expense over the term of the debt using the effective interest method.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the fair value of derivative liabilities was estimated at $0 and $4,999, respectively. The decline was primarily due to the amortization of the 2020 interest payments associated with the derivative liability as well as the redemption of the 5.5% variable interest convertible senior notes during 2020.
Changes to the fair value of these embedded derivatives are reflected on our consolidated statements of operations as “Change in fair value of derivatives embedded within convertible debt.” The value of the embedded derivative is contingent on changes in interest rates of debt instruments maturing over the duration of the convertible debt as well as projections of future cash and stock dividends over the term of the debt. We recognized gains of $4,999, $26,425 and $44,989 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, due to changes in the fair value of the embedded derivatives.
After giving effect to the recording of embedded derivative liabilities as a discount to the convertible debt, our common stock had a fair value at the issuance date of the notes in excess of the conversion price, resulting in a beneficial conversion feature. The intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature was recorded as additional paid-in capital and as a further discount on the debt. The discount is then amortized to interest expense over the term of the debt using the effective interest rate method.
We recognized non-cash interest expense of $4,053, $18,512 and $55,769 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, due to the amortization of the debt discount attributable to the embedded derivatives and $1,223, $6,301 and $30,854 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, due to the amortization of the debt discount attributable to the beneficial conversion feature.
Stock-Based Compensation. Our stock-based compensation uses a fair-value-based method to recognize non-cash compensation expense for share-based transactions. Under the fair value recognition provisions, we recognize stock-based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. We recognized stock-based compensation expense of $1,428, $1,923 and $2,246 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to the amortization of stock option awards and $8,055, $7,546 and $7,705, respectively, related to the amortization of restricted stock grants. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there was $1,229 and $2,657, respectively, of total unrecognized cost related to employee stock options and $12,081 and $15,095, respectively, of total unrecognized cost related to restricted stock grants. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements.
Employee Benefit Plans. The determination of our net pension and other postretirement benefit income or expense is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. Those assumptions include, among others, the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation and healthcare costs. We determine discount rates by using a quantitative analysis that considers the prevailing prices of investment grade bonds and the anticipated cash flow from our two qualified defined benefit plans and our postretirement medical and life insurance plans. These analyses construct a hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flow from coupons and maturities match the annual projected cash flows from our pension and retiree health plans. As of December 31, 2020, our benefit obligations were computed assuming a discount rate between 1.40% - 2.55%. As of December 31, 2020, our service cost was computed assuming a discount rate of 2.55% - 3.30%. In determining our expected rate of return on plan assets, we consider input from our external advisors and historical returns based on the expected long-term rate of return which is the weighted average of the target asset allocation of each individual asset class. Our actual 10-year annual rate of return on our pension plan assets was 6.91%, 7.59% and 8.26% for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and our actual five-year annual rate of return on our pension plan assets was 7.51%, 5.41% and 3.19% for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In computing expense for the year ended December 31, 2021, we will use an assumption of a 3.5% annual rate of return on our pension plan assets. In accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore, generally affect our recognized income or expense in such future periods. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our future net pension and other postretirement benefit income or expense.
Net pension expense for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement expense was $4,210, $2,834 and $1,611 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and we currently anticipate benefit expense will be approximately $1,390 for 2021. In contrast, our funding obligations under the pension plans are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”). To comply with ERISA’s minimum funding requirements, we do not currently anticipate that we will be required to make any funding to the tax qualified pension plans for the pension plan year beginning on January 1, 2021 and ending on December 31, 2021.
Long-Term Investments and Impairments. At December 31, 2020, our long-term investments were comprised of $34,218 of equity securities at fair value that qualify for the net asset value (“NAV”) practical expedient and $18,310 of long-term investments that were accounted for under the equity method. Our investments in equity securities at fair value that qualify for the NAV practical expedient consisted primarily of investment partnerships investing in investment securities. The investments in these investment partnerships are illiquid and the ultimate realization of these investments is subject to the performance of the underlying partnership and its management by the general partners. The estimated fair value of these investments was provided by the partnerships based on the indicated market values of the underlying assets or investment portfolio. Our investments accounted for under the equity method included interests in partnerships in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over their operating and financial policies. The estimated fair value of the investments is either provided by the partnerships based on the indicated market values of the underlying assets or is calculated internally based on the number of shares owned and the equity in earnings or losses and interest income we recognize on the investment. Gains are recognized when realized in our consolidated statement of operations. Losses are recognized as realized or upon the determination of the occurrence of an other-than-temporary decline in fair value. Pursuant to the amendments provided by ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (“ASU 2016-01”), our long-term investments that qualify for the NAV practical expedient are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. Therefore, impairment analyses for these investments are no longer warranted.
At December 31, 2020, we also had $5,200 of investments in various limited liability companies that were classified as equity securities without readily determinable fair values that do not qualify for the NAV practical expedient. The investments are included in “Other assets” on the consolidated balance sheets and are valued at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate our investments to determine if there are indicators of impairment. If so, we also make a determination of whether there is an impairment and if it is considered temporary or other than temporary. We believe that the assessment of temporary or other-than-temporary impairment is facts-and-circumstances driven. The impairment indicators that are taken into consideration as part of our analysis include (a) a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, or business prospects of the investee, (b) a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the investee, (c) a significant adverse change in the general market condition of either the geographical area or the industry in which the investee operates, and (d) factors that raise significant concerns about the investee’s ability to continue as a going concern, such as negative cash flows from operations, working capital deficiencies, or noncompliance with statutory capital requirements or debt covenants.
Current Expected Credit Losses. On January 1, 2020, we adopted ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, therefore, our measurement of credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments has been modified as discussed in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.
•Tobacco receivables: Average collection terms for Tobacco sales range between three and twelve days from the time that the cigarettes are shipped to the customer. Based on Tobacco historical and ongoing cash collections from customers, an estimated credit loss in accordance with ASU 2016-13 was not recorded for these trade receivables as of January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020.
•Real estate broker agent receivables: Douglas Elliman Realty is exposed to credit losses for various amounts due from real estate agents, which are included in Other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets, net of an allowance for credit losses. Douglas Elliman Realty historically estimated its allowance for credit losses on receivables from agents based on an evaluation of aging, agent sales in pipeline, any security, specific exposures, and historical experience of collections from the individual agents. Based on Douglas Elliman Realty’s historical credit losses on receivables from agents, current and expected future market trends (such as the current and expected impact of COVID-19 on the real estate market), it was determined that the requirements of ASU No. 2016-13 did not result in a material impact on the Company’s allowance for credit losses as of January 1, 2020 of $6,132. Douglas Elliman Realty estimated that the credit losses for these receivables were $7,038 at December 31, 2020.
•Term loan receivables: New Valley provides term loans to real estate developers, which are included in Other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The loans are secured by guarantees and are evaluated individually. Because New Valley does not have internal historical loss information by which to evaluate the risk of credit losses, external market data measuring default risks on high yield loans as of each measurement date was utilized to estimate reserves for credit losses on these loans. New Valley’s expected credit loss estimate was $3,100 as of adoption (January 1, 2020). New Valley’s expected credit loss estimates was $15,928 as of December 31, 2020 and this amount reflected changes in market conditions as of December 31, 2020 due to changes in the real estate development market in 2020.
Goodwill and Indefinite Life Assets. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment on an annual basis, or whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable.
Our goodwill and trademarks are related to Douglas Elliman. Our intangible asset associated with the benefit under the MSA is related to Vector Tobacco.
We follow ASC 350, Intangibles -- Goodwill and Other, and subsequent updates including ASU 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment and ASU 2017-14, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. The amendments permit entities to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value or chooses to bypass the optional qualitative assessment, it would then assess recoverability by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to the Company’s carrying amount; otherwise, no further impairment test would be required.
The fair value of the intangible asset associated with the Douglas Elliman trademark is determined using a “relief from royalty payments” method. This approach involves two steps: (i) estimating reasonable royalty rates for its trademark associated with the Douglas Elliman trademark and (ii) applying these royalty rates to a net sales stream and discounting the resulting cash flows to determine fair value. This fair value is then compared with the carrying value of the trademark.
As discussed in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements, during the first quarter of 2020, we performed quantitative assessments of the goodwill associated with the Douglas Elliman reporting unit and its trademark intangible asset in conjunction with our quarterly review for indicators of impairment. The quantitative assessments resulted in impairment charges to goodwill of $46,252 and to the trademark intangible asset of $12,000. The Company performed a qualitative assessment for the year ended December 31, 2020, which did not result in additional impairment charges related to the Company’s goodwill or trademark.
The fair value of the intangible asset associated with the benefit under the MSA is determined using discounted cash flows. This approach involves two steps: (i) estimating future cash savings due to the payment exemption under the MSA and (ii) discounting the resulting cash flow savings to determine fair value. This fair value is then compared with the carrying value of the intangible asset associated with the benefit under the MSA. To the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value of the intangible asset, an impairment loss is recognized. The Company performed a qualitative assessment for the year ended December 31, 2020 and no impairment was noted.
Income Taxes. The application of income tax law is inherently complex. Laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous. As such, we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures. Interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time and, as a result, changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments may materially affect amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements.
See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our accounting for income taxes and uncertain tax positions.
Results of Operations
The following discussion provides an assessment of our results of operations, capital resources and liquidity and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.

2020 Compared to 2019
Revenues. Total revenues were $2,002,669 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $1,903,711 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $98,958 (5.2%) increase in revenues was due to a $89,661 increase in Tobacco revenues related to an increase in both unit volume and net pricing and a $9,297 increase in Real Estate revenues, primarily related to the $20,500 sale of an investment in real estate located in Sagaponack, NY.
Cost of sales. Total cost of sales was $1,367,145 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $1,301,579 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $65,566 (5.0%) increase in cost of sales was due to a $40,792 increase in Real Estate cost of sales, which was primarily related to Douglas Elliman’s agent commissions, and a $24,774 increase in Tobacco cost of sales related to increased sales volume and higher MSA expense.
Expenses. Operating expenses were $390,381 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $370,997 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $19,384 (5.2%) increase was due to a $15,470 increase in Real Estate expenses, including impairment of goodwill and intangible asset charge at Douglas Elliman of $58,252, restructuring charges of $3,382, and loss on sale of assets of $1,169 and a $6,981 increase in Tobacco expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020. This was offset by a $3,067 decline in Corporate and Other expense, including gain on sale of assets of $2,283.
See Critical Accounting Policies - Goodwill and Indefinite Life Assets for detail of the Douglas Elliman impairment charge.
Operating income. Operating income was $245,143 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $231,135 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $14,008 (6.1%). Tobacco operating income increased by $57,906 and Corporate and Other operating loss declined by $3,067, while Real Estate operating income declined by $46,965, primarily related to Douglas Elliman’s operations.
Other expenses. Other expenses were $110,428 and $97,307 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, other expenses primarily consisted of interest expense of $121,541, equity in losses from real estate ventures of $44,698, and other expenses of $5,456. This was offset by equity in earnings from investments of $56,268 and income of $4,999 from changes in the fair value of derivatives embedded within convertible debt. For the year ended December 31, 2019, other expenses primarily consisted of interest expense of $138,448, loss on extinguishment of debt of $4,301 and equity in losses from real estate ventures of $19,288. This was offset by income of $26,425 from changes in fair value of derivatives embedded within convertible debt, equity in earnings from investments of $17,000 and other income of $21,305.
Income before provision for income taxes. Income before income taxes was $134,715 and $133,828 for the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
Income tax expense. Income tax expense was $41,777 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to income tax expense of $32,813 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 do not bear a customary relationship to statutory income tax rates as a result of the impact of nondeductible expenses, state income taxes, changes in valuation allowances, and excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation.
Tobacco.
Tobacco revenues. Liggett increased the list price of Eagle 20’s by $0.14 per pack on January 25, 2021, $0.13 per pack in November 2020, $0.11 per pack in June 2020, $0.08 per pack in February 2020, $0.08 per pack in October 2019, and $0.11 per pack in February 2019. Liggett also increased the list price of Pyramid, Liggett Select, Eve and Grand Prix by $0.14 per pack on January 25, 2021, $0.13 per pack in November 2020, $0.11 per pack in June 2020, $0.08 per pack in February 2020, $0.08 per pack in October 2019, $0.06 per pack in June 2019, and $0.11 per pack in February 2019.
All of our Tobacco sales were in the discount category in 2020 and 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Tobacco revenues were $1,204,501 compared to $1,114,840 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Revenues increased by $89,661 (8.0%) due to increases in unit sales volume and the average selling price of our brands for the year ended December 31, 2020. The higher selling prices resulted in a favorable price variance of $65,348 and the increase in sales volume (195.6 million units) resulted in a favorable variance of $24,313. We believe a competitor’s announcement of a price increase in December, as well as the prospect of increased restrictions and lockdowns associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, resulted in increased fourth quarter sales volumes and elevated wholesale inventories as of December 31, 2020. We anticipate a normalization of wholesale inventory levels over the course of the first quarter of 2021 which could result in lower sales volume for the three months ended March 31, 2021.
Tobacco cost of sales. The major components of our Tobacco cost of sales were as follows:
_____________________________
(1)Includes $299 increase in expense from MSA Settlement.
The Tobacco segment’s MSA expense is included in cost of sales. Under the terms of the MSA, we have no payment obligations except to the extent that our tobacco subsidiaries’ market share of the U.S. cigarette market exceeds 1.92%. The calculation of this benefit from the MSA is an estimate based on taxable unit shipments of cigarettes in the U.S. As of December 31, 2020, we estimate taxable shipments in the U.S. increased by approximately 1.0% in 2020. Our annual MSA liability changes by approximately $1,700 for each percentage change in the estimated shipment volumes in the U.S. market. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the estimated increase in taxable shipments in conjunction with the annual MSA inflation adjustment increased the value of Liggett’s market share exemption compared to the prior year end and, thus,
decreased cost of sales by $7,731. Similar to some other consumer product categories, cigarette industry volumes outperformed recent historical trends and benefited from increased consumer demand related to changes in underlying cigarette purchasing and consumption patterns associated with the pandemic.
Tobacco gross profit was $408,597 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $343,710 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $64,887 (18.9%). The increase in gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily attributable to increased pricing on the Eagle 20’s and Pyramid brands and increased Eagle 20’s volume. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Eagle 20’s remains Liggett’s primary low-cost cigarette brand and its percentage of Liggett’s total unit volume sales has increased from approximately 60% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to approximately 62% for the year ended December 31, 2020. Pyramid, Liggett’s second largest brand, declined from approximately 27% of total unit volume sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 to approximately 23% for the year ended December 31, 2020. As a percentage of revenue (excluding Federal Excise Taxes), Tobacco gross profit increased from 51.8% in the 2019 period to 55.0% in the 2020 period primarily as a result of price increases partially offset by a continued shift in sales volume to the lower-priced Eagle 20’s brand.
Tobacco expenses. Tobacco operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding settlements and judgments, were $88,724 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $81,090 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $7,634 (9.4%) increase is primarily due to increased professional fees and expenses associated with Colorado’s minimum price legislation. Tobacco product liability legal expenses, including settlements and judgments, were $6,476 and $7,363 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Tobacco operating income. Tobacco operating income was $319,536 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $261,630 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $57,906 (22.1%) was primarily attributable to higher gross profit margins, as discussed above, and was partially offset by increased operating, selling, general and administrative expenses.
Real Estate.
Real Estate revenues. Real Estate revenues were $798,168 and $788,871 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Real Estate revenues increased by $9,297 (1.2%), which was primarily related to the $20,500 sale of an investment in real estate located in Sagaponack, NY offset by a decline of $7,306 in Douglas Elliman’s commission and other brokerage income. This decline in commission and other brokerage income was primarily related to declines in existing-home sales in New York City of $106,780, as well as declines in revenues from development marketing of $25,563. This was offset by increases in existing-home sales in the Southeast market (Florida) of $53,817, the Northeast market (primarily Long Island, the Hamptons, Westchester and Connecticut) of $40,090 and the West market (California and Colorado) of $31,130.
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant effect on the economy and, especially, in the New York City market, where approximately 46% of Douglas Elliman’s commissions and other brokerage revenues were derived in 2018 and 2019. In response to the pandemic, various governmental agencies in the markets where Douglas Elliman operates instituted restrictions on individuals and on the types of businesses that were permitted to operate from March 2020 to June 2020, which adversely impacted Douglas Elliman’s business and commissions and other brokerage income declined by 46.5% in the second quarter of 2020. When the economy reopened, Douglas Elliman’s business improved significantly in markets complementary to New York City, including the Hamptons, as well as in Palm Beach, Miami, Aspen and Los Angeles and, consequently, commissions and other brokerage income increased by 52.9% in the fourth quarter of 2020. Consequently, as a result of the declines in the second quarter of 2020, which were offset by increases in the fourth quarter of 2020, commission and other brokerage income declined by 1.0% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019.
Real Estate revenues and cost of sales were as follows:
Real Estate cost of sales. Real Estate cost of sales were $571,241 and $530,449 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Real Estate cost of sales increased by $40,792, primarily related to $20,488 from the sale of an investment in real estate located in Sagaponack, NY and increased Douglas Elliman real estate agent commissions of $21,724.
Douglas Elliman’s gross margin on real estate brokerage income declined from 29.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 25.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020. This was primarily due to the decline in the percentage of revenues from the New York City region, which traditionally earns higher gross margin percentages than the Southeast (Florida) and Western (primarily California) regions.
Real Estate expenses. Real Estate expenses were $276,822 and $261,352 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These expenses included the non-cash impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of $58,252, restructuring charges of $3,382 and the loss on sale of assets of $1,169 at Douglas Elliman for the year ended December 31, 2020. The non-cash impairment related to the evaluation of potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the possibility of an economic recession, on Douglas Elliman’s business. The restructuring charges were the result of Douglas Elliman realigning its administrative support functions, and office locations as well as adjusting its business model to more efficiently serve its clients. Beginning in April 2020, as a response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company made significant operating adjustments at Douglas Elliman Realty LLC, including a reduction of personnel of approximately 25% and reductions of other administrative expenses, as well as a reduction, deferral or elimination of certain office lease expenses. Despite increases in expenses in the fourth quarter of 2020 as business improved, Douglas Elliman Realty LLC operated at a lower cost basis for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2019.
Real Estate operating loss. The Real Estate segment had operating loss of $49,895 and $2,930 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Real Estate segment’s operating loss was primarily caused by the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of $58,252 at Douglas Elliman, the decreased gross margin percentages discussed above, restructuring charges of $3,382 at Douglas Elliman, and loss on sale of assets of $1,169 at Douglas Elliman; it was offset by the impact of expense-reduction initiatives at Douglas Elliman in 2020.
Corporate and other.
Corporate and other loss. The operating loss at the corporate segment was $24,498 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $27,565 for the same period in 2019. The decline of $3,067 was primarily due to the $2,283 gain on the sale of assets and decreased administrative costs related to professional fees and travel expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Summary of Real Estate Investments
We own and seek to acquire investment interests in various domestic and international real estate projects through debt and equity investments. Our real estate investments primarily include the following projects as of December 31, 2020:
(2) This column only represents capital commitments required under the various joint venture agreements. However, many of the operating agreements provide for the operating partner to call capital. If a joint venture partner, such as New Valley, declines to fund the capital call, then the partner’s ownership percentage could either be diluted or, in some situations, the character of a funding member’s contribution would be converted from a capital contribution to a member loan.
(3) The Witkoff GP Partners venture includes a $2,034 investment in 500 Broadway.
(4) Equity in losses in excess of the joint ventures' carrying value were $3,946 as of December 31, 2020, and are classified in Other current liabilities.
N/A - Not applicable SF - Square feet H - Hotel rooms TBD -To be determined R - Residential Units R Lots - Residential lots
New Valley capitalizes net interest expense into the carrying value of its ventures whose projects were under development. Net capitalized interest costs included in Carrying Value as of December 31, 2020 were $7,478. This amount is included in the “Cumulative Earnings (Losses)” column in the table above. During the year ended December 31, 2020, New Valley capitalized $4,003 of interest costs and utilized (reversed) $7,120 of previously capitalized interest in connection with the recognition of equity in (losses) earnings, gains and liquidations from various ventures.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash and cash equivalents declined by $13,799 and $212,253 in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Cash provided from operations was $267,547 and $124,071 in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in 2020 related primarily to increases in operating income (taking into account the exclusion of the $58,252 non-cash impairment charge), increased distributions from long-term investments, which were associated with the sale of LTS and, the proceeds from the sale of an investment in real estate located in Sagaponack, NY and, in connection with tax planning strategies, a deferral of a portion our MSA payments to 2021.
Cash provided by investing activities was $7,341 in 2020 and cash used in investing activities was $23,099 in 2019. Our investment philosophy is to maximize return on investments using a reasonable expectation for return. For example, we expect our investment returns to exceed the comparable return on cash or short-term U.S. Treasury Bills when investing in equity and debt securities and to exceed our weighted-average cost of capital when investing in non-consolidated real estate businesses, and PropTech investments, and making capital expenditures. In 2020, cash provided by investing activities comprised the sale of investment securities of $30,458, distributions from investments in real estate ventures of $18,818, proceeds from the sale or liquidation of long-term investments of $32,572, pay downs of investment securities of $812, maturities of investment securities of $61,230, proceeds from the sale of fixed assets of $5,162, a decrease in restricted assets of $436 and cash acquired in purchase of subsidiaries of $2,760. These items were offset by the purchase of investment securities of $99,871, investments in real estate ventures of $14,922, capital expenditures of $19,063, the purchase of long-term investments of $9,687, the purchase of subsidiaries of $722 and an increase in the cash surrender value of corporate-owned life insurance policies of $642. In 2019, cash used in investing activities comprised the purchase of investment securities of $87,766, investments in real estate ventures of $52,529, capital expenditures of $12,575, the purchase of long-term investments of $9,223, the purchase of subsidiaries of $380, investments in real estate, net of $2,295 and an increase in the cash surrender value of corporate-owned life insurance policies of $719. These items were offset by the sale of investment securities of $21,879, distributions from investments in real estate ventures of $41,300, proceeds from the sale or liquidation of long-term investments of $8,256, pay downs of investment securities of $1,083, maturities of investment securities of $68,859, the proceeds from the sale of fixed assets of $17, and a decrease in restricted assets of $994.
Cash used in financing activities was $288,687 and $313,225 in 2020 and 2019, respectively. In 2020, cash used in financing activities comprised dividends and distributions on common stock of $128,231, repayments of debt of $174,989, tax withholdings related to net share settlements of stock option exercise of $2,630, distributions to non-controlling interest of $448 and net repayments of debt under the Liggett Credit Agreement described below of $34,952. These items were offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $52,563. In 2019, cash used in financing activities comprised dividends and distributions on common stock of $238,249, repayments of debt of $293,419, payment of deferred financing costs of $9,802, tax withholdings related to net share settlements of stock option exercise of $5,415, distributions to non-controlling interest of $286 and other of $216. These factors were offset by proceeds of debt issuance of $230,000 associated with the issuance of an additional amount of our 10.5% Senior Notes due 2026 in November 2019, and net borrowings of debt under the Liggett Credit Agreement described below of $4,162.
We have significant liquidity commitments in 2021 at the corporate level (not including our tobacco and real estate operations) that require the use of existing cash resources. These include cash interest expense of approximately $109,500, dividends on our outstanding common shares of approximately $128,400, which is based on an assumed quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share, and other corporate expenses and taxes.
In order to meet these liquidity requirements as well as other liquidity needs in the normal course of business, we have in the past used cash flows from operations as well as existing cash and cash equivalents, which have, in the past, been generated from operations, monetization of investments and proceeds from debt issuances. Should these resources be insufficient to meet upcoming liquidity needs, we may also liquidate investment securities and other long-term investments, or, if available, draw on Liggett’s credit facility. While there are actions we can take to reduce our liquidity needs, there can be no assurance that such measures will be successful. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $352,842 (including $94,421 of cash at Douglas Elliman and $45,406 of cash at Liggett), and investment securities, carried at $169,803 (see Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements). As of December 31, 2020, our investments in real estate ventures were carried at $85,400 and our investments in real estate, net were carried at $15,631.
Limitation of interest expense deductible for income taxes. Since 2018, the amount of interest expense that is deductible in the computation of income tax liability has been limited to a percentage of adjusted taxable income, as defined by applicable law. In 2019 and 2020, the amount of deductible interest expense was limited to 50% of taxable income before interest, depreciation and amortization and, in 2021, the amount will be limited to 30% of taxable income before interest, depreciation and amortization. Beginning in 2022, the amount will be limited to 30% of taxable income before interest. However, interest expense allocable to a designated excepted trade or business is not subject to limitation. One such excepted trade or business is any electing real property trade or business, for which portions of our real estate business may qualify. If any interest expense is
disallowed, we are permitted to carry forward the disallowed interest expense indefinitely. Although all of our interest expense to date has been tax deductible, due to our high degree of leverage, a portion of our interest expense in future years may not be deductible, which could increase the after-tax cost of any new debt financings as well as the refinancing of our existing debt.
Tobacco Litigation. As of December 31, 2020, 16 verdicts were entered in Engle progeny cases against Liggett. Several of these verdicts have been affirmed on appeal and have been satisfied by Liggett. Liggett has paid $39,773, including interest and attorney’s fees, to satisfy the judgments entered against it. It is possible that additional cases could be decided unfavorably.
Notwithstanding the comprehensive nature of the Engle Progeny Settlements of more than 5,200 cases, approximately 41 plaintiffs’ claims remain outstanding. Therefore, we and Liggett may still be subject to periodic adverse judgments that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
In addition, Liggett may be required to make additional payments to Mississippi which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See Recent Developments in Litigation.
Management cannot predict the cash requirements related to any future settlements or judgments, including cash required to bond any appeals, and there is a risk that those requirements will not be able to be met. Management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the cases pending against Liggett or the costs of defending such cases. It is possible that our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome in any such tobacco-related litigation.

6.125% Senior Secured Notes. In January 2017, we issued $850,000 in aggregate principal amount of our 6.125% Senior Secured Notes in a private offering to qualified institutional investors and non-U.S. persons pursuant to the exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) contained in Rule 144A and Regulation S thereunder. The aggregate net proceeds from the issuance of the 6.125% Senior Secured Notes were approximately $831,100 after deducting offering expenses. On February 1, 2021, the 6.125% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 were redeemed in full and we anticipate recording a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $21,362 for the three months ended March 31, 2021, including $13,014 of premium and $8,348 of other costs and non-cash interest expense related to the recognition of previously unamortized deferred finance costs.
5.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2029. On January 28, 2021, we completed the sale of $875,000 in aggregate principal amount of our 5.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2029 (“5.75% Senior Secured Notes”) to qualified institutional buyers and non-U.S. persons in a private offering pursuant to the exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) contained in Rule 144A and Regulation S thereunder. The aggregate net cash proceeds from the sale of the 5.75% Senior Secured Notes were approximately $855,500 after deducting the initial purchaser’s discount and estimated expenses and fees in connection with the offering. We used the net cash proceeds from the 5.75% Senior Secured Notes offering, together with cash on hand, to redeem all of our outstanding 6.125% Senior Secured Notes due 2025, including accrued interest and premium thereon., on January 28, 2021.
The 5.75% Senior Secured Notes pay interest on a semi-annual basis at a rate of 5.75% per year and mature on the earlier of February 1, 2029 and the date that is 91 days before the final stated maturity date of our 10.5% Senior Notes due 2026 (“10.5% Senior Notes”) if such 10.5% Senior Notes have not been repurchased and cancelled or refinanced by such date. Prior to February 1, 2024, we may redeem some or all of the 5.75% Senior Secured Notes at any time at a make-whole redemption price. On or after February 1, 2024, we may redeem some or all of the 5.75% Senior Secured Notes at a premium that will decrease over time, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. In addition, any time prior to February 1, 2024, we may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate outstanding amount of the 5.75% Senior Secured Notes with the net proceeds of certain equity offerings at 105.75% of the aggregate principal amount of the 5.75% Senior Secured Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, if at least 60% of the aggregate principal amount of the 5.75% Senior Secured Notes originally issued remains outstanding after such redemption, and the redemption occurs within 90 days of the closing of such equity offering. In the event of a change of control, as defined in the indenture governing the 5.75% Senior Secured Notes (the “2029 Indenture”), each holder of the 5.75% Senior Secured Notes may require the Company to repurchase some or all of its 5.75% Senior Secured Notes at a repurchase price equal to 101% of their aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase. If the Company sells certain assets and does not apply the proceeds as required pursuant to the 2029 Indenture, it must offer to repurchase the 5.75% Senior Secured Notes at the prices listed in the 2029 Indenture.
The 5.75% Senior Secured Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, subject to certain customary automatic release provisions, on a joint and several basis by all of our wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries that are engaged in the conduct of our cigarette businesses, which subsidiaries, as of the issuance date of the 5.75% Senior Secured Notes, were also guarantors under our outstanding 10.5% Senior Notes. The 5.75% Senior Secured Notes are not guaranteed by New Valley LLC, or any of our subsidiaries engaged in our real estate business conducted through our subsidiary, New Valley LLC. The guarantees provided
by certain of the guarantors are secured by first priority or second priority security interests in certain collateral of such guarantors pursuant to security and pledge agreements, subject to certain permitted liens and exceptions as further described in the 2029 Indenture and the security documents relating thereto. Vector Group Ltd does not provide any security for the 5.75% Senior Secured Notes.
The 2029 Indenture contains covenants that restrict the payment of dividends if our consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Consolidated EBITDA”), as defined in the 2029 Indenture, for the most recently ended four full quarters is less than $75,000. The 2029 Indenture also restricts the incurrence of debt if our Leverage Ratio and our Secured Leverage Ratio, each as defined in the 2029 Indenture, exceed 3.0 to 1.0 and 1.5 to 1.0, respectively. Our Leverage Ratio is defined in the 2029 Indenture as the ratio of our and our guaranteeing subsidiaries’ total debt less the fair market value of our cash, investment securities and long-term investments to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the 2029 Indenture. Our Secured Leverage Ratio is defined in the 2029 Indenture in the same manner as the Leverage Ratio, except that secured indebtedness is substituted for indebtedness. The following table summarizes the requirements of these financial test and the extent to which we would have satisfied these requirements had the 2029 Indenture been in effect as of December 31, 2020.
10.5% Senior Notes due 2026.. On November 2, 2018 and November 18, 2019, we sold $325,000 and $230,000, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of our 10.5% Senior Notes to qualified institutional buyers and non-U.S. persons pursuant to the exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act contained in Rule 144A and Regulation S thereunder. The aggregate net proceeds from the 2018 sale of the 10.5% Senior Notes and the 2019 sale of the 10.5% Senior Notes were approximately $315,000 and $220,400, respectively, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, fees and offering expenses. We used the net cash proceeds from the 2018 issuance of our 10.5% Senior Notes to retire the principal amount of, plus accrued and unpaid interest on, our 7.5% Variable Interest Senior Convertible Notes due 2019, and for general corporate purposes. We used the net cash proceeds from the 2019 issuance of our 10.5% Senior Notes to retire the principal amount of, plus accrued and unpaid interest on, our 5.5% Variable Interest Senior Convertible Notes due 2020.
The 10.5% Senior Notes pay interest on a semi-annual basis at a rate of 10.5% per year and mature on November 1, 2026. Prior to November 1, 2021, we may redeem some or all of the 10.5% Senior Notes at any time at a make-whole redemption price. On or after November 1, 2021, we may redeem some or all of the 10.5% Senior Notes at a premium that will decrease over time, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. In addition, any time prior to November 1, 2021, we may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate outstanding amount of the 10.5% Senior Notes with the net proceeds of certain equity offerings at 110.5% of the aggregate principal amount of the 10.5% Senior Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, if at least 60% of the aggregate principal amount of the 10.5% Senior Notes originally issued remains outstanding after such redemption, and the redemption occurs within 90 days of the closing of such equity offering. In the event of a change of control, as defined in the indenture governing the 10.5% Senior Notes (the “2026 Indenture”), each holder of the 10.5% Senior Notes may require the Company to make an offer to repurchase some or all of its 10.5% Senior Notes at a repurchase price equal to 101% of their aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase. If the Company sells certain assets and does not apply the proceeds as required pursuant to the 2026 Indenture, it must offer to repurchase the 10.5% Senior Notes at the prices listed in the 2026 Indenture.
The 10.5% Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed subject to certain customary automatic release provisions on a joint and several basis by all of our wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries that are engaged in the conduct of our cigarette businesses, and by DER Holdings LLC, through which the Company indirectly owns a 100% interest in Douglas Elliman as of December 31, 2020. DER Holdings LLC does not guarantee our 5.75% Senior Secured Notes.
The 2026 Indenture contains covenants that restrict the payment of dividends and certain other distributions subject to certain exceptions, including exceptions for (1) dividends and other distributions in an amount up to 50% of our consolidated net income, plus certain specified proceeds received by the Company, if no event of default has occurred, and we are in compliance with a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the 2026 Indenture) of at least 2.0 to 1.0, and (2) dividends and other distributions in an unlimited amount, if no event of default has occurred and we are in compliance with a Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2026 Indenture) no greater than 4.0 to 1.0. As a result, absent an event of default, we can pay dividends if the Net Leverage ratio is below 4.0 to 1.0, regardless of the value of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio at the time. The 2026 Indenture also restricts our ability to incur debt if our Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is less than 2.0 to 1.0, and restricts our ability to secure debt to the extent doing so would cause our Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2026 Indenture) to exceed 3.75 to 1.0, unless the 10.5% Senior Notes are secured on an equal and ratable basis. In addition, the 2026 Indenture
restricts our ability to spin-off or transfer New Valley and its subsidiaries as a whole, or DER Holdings LLC and its subsidiaries (including Douglas Elliman) as a whole, unless (1) such spin-off or transfer complies with the covenants restricting mergers and asset sales, or (2) our Net Leverage Ratio is no greater than 4.0 to 1.0. Our Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is defined in the 2026 Indenture as the ratio of our Consolidated EBITDA to our Fixed Charges (each as defined in the 2026 Indenture). Our Net Leverage Ratio is defined in the 2026 Indenture as the ratio of our and our guaranteeing subsidiaries’ total debt less our cash, cash equivalents, and the fair market value of our investment securities, long-term investments, investments in real estate, net, and investments in real estate ventures, to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the 2026 Indenture. Our Secured Leverage Ratio is defined in the 2026 Indenture as the ratio of our and our guaranteeing subsidiaries’ total secured debt, to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the 2026 Indenture. The following table summarizes the requirements of these financial test and the extent to which we satisfied these requirements as of December 31, 2020.
As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all of the debt covenants related to the 2026 Indenture.
Guarantor Summarized Financial Information. Vector Group Ltd. (the “Issuer”) and its wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries that are engaged in the conduct of its cigarette business (the “Subsidiary Guarantors”) have filed a shelf registration statement for the offering of debt and equity securities on a delayed or continuous basis and we are including this condensed consolidating financial information in connection therewith. Any such debt securities may be issued by us and guaranteed by our Subsidiary Guarantors. New Valley and any of its subsidiaries, other than DER Holdings LLC (the “Nonguarantor Subsidiaries”) will not guarantee any such debt securities. Both the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Nonguarantor Subsidiaries are wholly-owned by the Issuer. The Condensed Consolidating Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2020 and the related Condensed Consolidating Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 of the Issuer, Subsidiary Guarantors and the Nonguarantor Subsidiaries are set forth in Exhibit 99.2.
Presented herein are the Summarized Combined Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 and the related Summarized Combined Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 for the Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors (collectively, the “Obligor Group”). The summarized combined financial information is presented after the elimination of: (i) intercompany transactions and balances among the Obligor Group, and (ii) equity in earnings from and investments in the Nonguarantor Subsidiaries.
Summarized Combined Balance Sheets:
Summarized Combined Statements of Operations:
Liggett Financing. Liggett did not enter into any equipment financing arrangements in 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Liggett Credit Facility. In January, 2015, Liggett and 100 Maple LLC (“Maple”), a subsidiary of Liggett, entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (“Wells Fargo”), as agent and lender. The Credit Agreement governed a $60,000 credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) that consisted of a revolving credit facility (the “Revolver”) and a $3,600 term loan (the “Term Loan”) that was within the $60,000 commitment under the Credit Facility and reduced the amount available under the Revolver.
In connection with the issuances of our 6.125% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 in January 2017, and our 10.5% Senior Notes in November 2018, Liggett and Maple entered into amendments to the Credit Agreement to update certain defined terms contained in the Credit Agreement relating to issuances of new notes.
On October 31, 2019, Liggett and Maple amended the Credit Agreement to, among other things, (i) extend its maturity to January 31, 2025, (ii) update the borrowing base, to adjust the advance rates in respect of eligible inventory and add certain eligible real property and (iii) reflect the repayment in full of the Term Loan. Accordingly, the Term Loan portion of the Credit Agreement no longer exists.
As of October 31, 2019, all borrowings under the Credit Agreement are limited to a borrowing base equal to the sum of (i) the lesser of (x) $10,000 and (y) 85% of eligible trade receivables less certain reserves; plus (ii) 80% of the value of eligible inventory consisting of packaged cigarettes plus (iii) the lesser of (x) 65% of Liggett’s eligible cost of inventory consisting of leaf tobacco less certain reserves and (y) 85% of the appraised liquidation value of eligible inventory plus (iv) 60% of the fair market value of eligible real property. The obligations under the Credit Agreement are collateralized on a first priority basis by all inventories, receivables and certain other personal property of Liggett and Maple, a mortgage on Liggett’s manufacturing facility and certain real property of Maple, subject to certain permitted liens.
As of December 31, 2020, there was no outstanding balance under the Credit Agreement. Availability as determined under the Credit Agreement was approximately $60,000 based on eligible collateral at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, Liggett was in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility; Liggett’s EBITDA, as defined, were $250,531 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The term of the Credit Agreement now expires on January 31, 2025. Loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.25%. The interest rate applicable to this Credit Agreement at December 31, 2020 was 2.39%.
The Credit Agreement, as amended, permitted the guaranty of our 6.125% Senior Secured Notes due 2025, and permits the guaranty of our 5.75% Senior Secured Notes and our 10.5% Senior Notes, by each of Liggett and Maple. Wells Fargo, Liggett, Maple and the collateral agent for the holders of our 6.125% Senior Secured Notes have entered into an intercreditor agreement, pursuant to which the liens of such collateral agent on the assets that are subject to the Credit Agreement are subordinated to the liens of Wells Fargo on such assets. The intercreditor agreement permits any other subsidiary of the Company that guarantees the 5.75% Senior Secured Notes to become party thereto if such subsidiary becomes a borrower under the Credit Agreement.
The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limit Liggett’s, Maple’s and their subsidiaries’ ability to incur, create or assume certain indebtedness, to incur or assume certain liens, to purchase, hold or acquire certain investments, to declare or make certain dividends and distributions and to engage in certain mergers, consolidations and asset sales, including a restriction on Liggett’s ability to pay cash dividends unless Liggett’s average borrowing availability, as defined under the Credit Agreement, for the 30-day period prior to the payment of the dividend, and after giving effect to the dividend, was at least $5,000 and no event of default had occurred under the Credit Agreement, including Liggett’s compliance with the covenants in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement also requires compliance with specified financial covenants, including that Liggett’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as defined under the Credit Agreement, on a trailing twelve month basis, shall not be less than $100,000 if Liggett’s excess availability, as defined under the Credit Agreement, is less than $20,000. The covenants also require that
annual capital expenditures, as defined under the Credit Agreement (before a maximum carryover amount of $10,000), shall not exceed $20,000 during any fiscal year. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. Liggett was in compliance with all of these covenants as of December 31, 2020 and Liggett’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as defined under the Credit Agreement, was $250,531 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default.
Anticipated Liquidity Obligations. We and our subsidiaries have significant indebtedness and debt service obligations. As of December 31, 2020, we and our subsidiaries had total outstanding indebtedness of $1,430,573 ($1,455,573 as adjusted for our January 2021 refinancing), of which $555,000 of our 10.5% Senior Notes mature in 2026, and $875,000 of our 5.75% Senior Secured Notes mature in 2029. There is a risk that we will not be able to generate sufficient funds to repay our debt. If we cannot service our fixed charges, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
We believe that our cigarette and real estate operations are positive cash-flow-generating units and will continue to be able to sustain their operations without any significant liquidity concerns.
In order to meet the above liquidity requirements as well as other anticipated liquidity needs in the normal course of business, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $352,800, investment securities at fair value of approximately $169,800 and availability under Liggett’s credit facility of approximately $60,000 as of December 31, 2020. Management currently anticipates that these amounts, as well as expected cash flows from our operations, proceeds from public and/or private debt and equity financing to the extent available, management fees and other payments from subsidiaries should be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs over the next 12 months. We may acquire or seek to acquire additional operating businesses through merger, purchase of assets, stock acquisition or other means, or to make other investments, which may limit our liquidity otherwise available.
The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $1,647 as of January 1, 2020 and increased $6 during the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to accruals for state tax audits offset by the expiration of various state statutes of limitations and settlements. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $391 as of January 1, 2019 and increased $1,256 during the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to accruals for state tax audits offset by the expiration of various state statutes of limitations.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have various agreements in which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters. Generally, these indemnification clauses are included in contracts arising in the normal course of business under which we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations related to such matters as title to assets sold and licensed or certain intellectual property rights. Payment by us under such indemnification clauses is generally conditioned on the other party making a claim that is subject to challenge by us and dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular contract. Further, our obligations under these arrangements may be limited in terms of time and/or amount, and in some instances, we may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by us. It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnification agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts of each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not been material. As of December 31, 2020, we were not aware of any indemnification agreements that would or are reasonably expected to have a current or future material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
As of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding approximately $11,585 of letters of credit, collateralized by certificates of deposit. The letters of credit have been issued as security deposits for leases of office space, to secure the performance of our subsidiaries under various insurance programs and to provide collateral for various subsidiary borrowing and capital lease arrangements.
We have a leaf inventory management program whereby, among other things, we are committed to purchase certain quantities of leaf tobacco. The purchase commitments are for quantities not in excess of anticipated requirements and are at prices, including carrying costs, established at the commitment date. At December 31, 2020, Liggett had tobacco purchase commitments of approximately $14,903. We have a single source supply agreement for reduced ignition propensity cigarette paper through 2022.
Future machinery and equipment purchase commitments at Liggett were $2,870 at December 31, 2020.
Market Risk
We are exposed to market risks principally from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices. We seek to minimize these risks through our regular operating and financing activities and our long-term investment strategy. Our market risk management procedures cover all market risk sensitive financial instruments.
As of December 31, 2020, approximately $25,000 of our outstanding debt at face value had variable interest rates determined by various interest rate indices, which increases the risk of fluctuating interest rates. Our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our variable rate borrowings, which could adversely affect our cash flows. As of December 31, 2020, there was no outstanding balance on the Liggett Credit Facility which also has variable interest rates. As of December 31, 2020, we had no interest rate caps or swaps. Based on a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates (1%), our annual interest expense could increase or decrease by approximately $250.
We held debt securities available for sale totaling $91,204 as of December 31, 2020. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. Adverse market conditions could have a significant impact on the value of these investments.
On a quarterly basis, we evaluate our debt securities available for sale and equity securities without readily determinable fair values that do not qualify for the NAV practical expedient to determine whether an impairment has occurred. If so, we also make a determination if such impairment is considered temporary or other-than-temporary. We believe that the assessment of temporary or other-than-temporary impairment is facts-and-circumstances driven. The impairment indicators that are taken into consideration as part of our analysis include (a) a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, or business prospects of the investee, (b) a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the investee, (c) a significant adverse change in the general market condition of either the geographical area or the industry in which the investee operates, and (d) factors that raise significant concerns about the investee’s ability to continue as a going concern, such as negative cash flows from operations, working capital deficiencies, or noncompliance with statutory capital requirements or debt covenants.
Equity Security Price Risk
As of December 31, 2020, we held various investments in equity securities with a total fair value of $78,599, of which $44,381 represents equity securities at fair value and $34,218 represents long-term investment securities at fair value. The latter securities represent long-term investments in various investment partnerships. These investments are illiquid and their ultimate realization is subject to the performance of the underlying entities. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements, respectively, for more details on equity securities at fair value and long-term investment securities at fair value. The impact to our consolidated statement of operations related to equity securities fluctuates based on changes in their fair value.
We record changes in the fair value of equity securities in net income. To the extent that we continue to hold equity securities, our operating results may fluctuate significantly. Based on our equity securities held as of December 31, 2020, a hypothetical decrease of 10% in the price of these equity securities would reduce the fair value of the investments and, accordingly, our net income by approximately $7,860.

Legislation, Regulation, Taxation and Litigation
In the United States, tobacco products are subject to substantial and increasing legislation, regulation, taxation, and litigation, which have a negative effect on revenue and profitability.
The cigarette industry continues to be challenged on numerous fronts. The industry faced increased pressure from anti-smoking groups and continued smoking and health litigation, the effects of which, at this time, we are unable to quantify. Product liability litigation, particularly in Florida in the Engle progeny cases, continues to adversely affect the cigarette industry. See Item 1. “Business - Legislation and Regulation”, Item 1A. “Risk Factors”, Item 3. “Legal Proceedings” and Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements, which contain a description of litigation.
