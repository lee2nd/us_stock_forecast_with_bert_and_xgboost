Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our audited financial statements financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the “Risk factors” section of this Annual Report, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. You should carefully read the “Risk factors” section of this Annual Report to gain an understanding of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Please also see the section entitled “Special note regarding forward-looking statements.”
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is designed to provide material information relevant to an assessment of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, including an evaluation of the amounts and certainty of cash flows from operations and from outside sources. This section is designed to focus on material events and uncertainties known to management that are reasonably likely to cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future operating results or of future financial condition. This includes descriptions and amounts of matters that have had a material impact on reported operations, as well as matters that are reasonably likely based on management’s assessment to have a material impact on future operations.
Overview
Our primary focus is to transform diagnostic testing through innovative molecular diagnostic products that enable customers to deploy accurate, reliable, low cost and rapid molecular testing at the point-of-care for infectious diseases and other conditions.
We are developing the Talis One system (Talis One, the Talis One system or platform), that leverages expertise across chemistry, biology, engineering and software, to create a fully integrated, and cloud-enabled, portable molecular diagnostic solution that customers can rapidly deploy when are where needed. The Talis One system incorporates core proprietary technologies into a compact, easy-to-use instrument, that utilizes single use test cartridges and software, including a central cloud database, which are designed to work together to provide levels of testing accuracy equivalent to a central laboratory. We intend to commercialize Talis One system as an integrated system comprising single use consumables, an instrument and software. Our commercial strategy will focus on building and expanding an installed base of Talis One instruments and driving utilization of our Talis One assay kits to generate revenue from the purchase of such products. Subject to marketing authorization, our first commercial test will be a rapid point-of-care molecular diagnostic to detect SARS-CoV-2 directly from a patient sample in less than 30 minutes (COVID-19 test). We are also developing assays for the detection of other respiratory infections that could be included as a panel test with our COVID-19 test as well as tests for infections related to women’s health and sexually transmitted infections.
Our products will require marketing authorization from the FDA prior to commercialization. Due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, we plan to pursue marketing authorization for our COVID-19 test under an EUA rather than initially pursuing 510(k) clearance or other forms of marketing authorization under the FDA’s standard medical device authorities.
We have invested in automated cartridge manufacturing lines capable of producing one million Talis One cartridges per month for the COVID-19 assay, which are scheduled to begin to come on-line in the first quarter of 2021 and we expect will scale to full capacity through 2021. These manufacturing lines will be located at our contract manufacturers’ sites and operated by our contract manufacturing partners. We have also ordered 5,000 Talis One instruments from our instrument contract manufacturer through the first half of 2021.
Since our inception in 2013, we have devoted substantially all our efforts to research and development activities, manufacturing capabilities, raising capital, building our intellectual property portfolio and providing general and administrative support for these operations. We have principally financed our operations through the
issuance and sale of shares of our convertible preferred stock to outside investors in private equity financings as well as the issuance of convertible promissory notes and receipts from government grants. Prior to our initial public offering we received $351.5 million from investors in our preferred stock financings and the sale of convertible promissory notes that converted in such financings. Additionally, on February 17, 2021, the Company raised $232.6 million through an initial public offering to finance operations going forward.
We have incurred recurring losses since our inception, including net losses of $91.1 million and $27.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $172.9 million. We expect to continue to generate operating losses and negative operating cash flows for the foreseeable future if and as we:
•
continue the research and development of our platform and assays for additional diseases;
•
initiate clinical trials for, or additional preclinical development of, our platform;
•
further develop and refine the manufacturing processes for our platform;
•
change or add manufacturers or suppliers of materials used for our platform;
•
seek marketing authorizations;
•
seek to identify and validate diagnostic assays for other disease states;
•
obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property portfolio;
•
hire and deploy a salesforce;
•
seek to attract and retain new and existing skilled personnel;
•
create additional infrastructure to support our operations as a public company and incur increased legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses; and
•
experience delays or encounter issues with any of the above.
In addition, if we obtain marketing authorization for our platform, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution. As a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our operating activities. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operating activities through a combination of equity offerings, debt and grant revenue. Adequate funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.
If we are unable to obtain funding, we will be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs, product portfolio expansion or commercialization efforts, which could adversely affect our business prospects, or we may be unable to continue operations. Although we continue to pursue these plans, there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining sufficient funding on terms acceptable to us to fund continuing operations, if at all.
As of December 31, 2020, we had unrestricted cash of $138.5 million. We expect that our cash of $138.5 million as of December 31, 2020 along with the proceeds from our initial public offering will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least the next 12 months. We may need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our long-term business plan. We may seek additional funding through the issuance of our common stock, other equity or debt financings, or collaborations or partnerships with other companies. The amount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including the pace and results of our research efforts for our assays and development and manufacturing activities. We may not be able to raise additional capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Any failure to raise capital as and when needed would compromise our ability to execute on our business plan and may cause us to significantly delay or scale back our operations.
We outsource essentially all of our manufacturing. Design work, prototyping and pilot manufacturing are performed in-house before outsourcing to third party contract manufacturers. Our outsourced production strategy is intended to drive rapid scalability and avoid the high capital outlays and fixed costs related to constructing and operating a manufacturing facility. Certain of our suppliers of components and materials are single source suppliers.
To support our anticipated commercial launch, we have invested in automated cartridge manufacturing production lines for our Talis One cartridges. Those assets deemed to have an alternative future use have been capitalized as property and equipment while those assets determined to not have an alternative future use have been expensed. The automated cartridge manufacturing lines are capable of producing one million Talis One cartridges per month, which we expect will scale to full capacity through 2021.
COVID-19 pandemic
Since it was reported to have surfaced in December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread across the world and has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 have intensified and governments around the world, including in the United States, Europe and Asia, have implemented travel restrictions, social distancing requirements, stay-at-home orders and have delayed the commencement of non-COVID-19-related clinical trials, among other restrictions. As a result, the current COVID-19 pandemic has presented a substantial public health and economic challenge around the world and is affecting our employees, patients, communities and business operations, as well as contributing to significant volatility and negative pressure on the U.S. economy and in financial markets.
We expect that COVID-19 precautions will directly or indirectly impact the timeline for some of our planned clinical trials for our non-COVID-19 related products in development and we are continuing to assess the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our current and future business and operations, including our expenses and clinical trials, as well as on our industry and the healthcare system.
As a result of the outbreak, many companies have experienced disruptions in their operations and in markets served. We are considered an essential business and therefore the impact to our operations has been limited. To date, we have initiated some and may take additional temporary precautionary measures intended to help ensure our employees’ well-being and minimize business disruption. For the safety of our employees and their families, we have temporarily reduced the presence of our employees in our labs. Certain of our third-party service providers have also experienced shutdowns or other business disruptions. We are continuing to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our current and future business and operations, including our expenses and planned clinical trial and other development timelines, as well as on our industry and the healthcare system.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, or similar pandemics and outbreaks, we have and may in the future experience severe disruptions, including:
•
interruption of or delays in receiving products and supplies from the third parties we rely on to, among other things, manufacture components of our instruments, due to staffing shortages, production slowdowns or stoppages and disruptions in delivery systems, which may impair our ability to sell our products and consumables;
•
limitations on our business operations by the local, state, or federal government that could impact our ability to sell or deliver our instruments and consumables;
•
delays in customers’ purchasing decisions and negotiations with customers and potential customers;
•
business disruptions caused by workplace, laboratory and office closures and an increased reliance on employees working from home, travel limitations, cyber security and data accessibility limits, or communication or mass transit disruptions; and
•
limitations on employee resources that would otherwise be focused on the conduct of our activities, including because of sickness of employees or their families or the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people.
Three vaccines for COVID-19 have been authorized for emergency use by the FDA as of March 2021. While we do not foresee the authorizations having an immediate and near-term impact on the demand for COVID-19 tests, the vaccines could reduce the future demand for such tests depending on the effectiveness of the vaccines.
Components of our results of operations
Revenue
To date, we have not generated any revenue from sales of our Talis One system. If our development efforts for our system are successful and result in regulatory approval, we expect to generate revenue in the future from product sales of our Talis One instruments and single use cartridges. Our business model is focused on driving the adoption of the Talis One system. Customers would gain access to our instrument via a direct sales model or a reagent rental model. Under direct platform sales, our customers would directly purchase our Talis One instrument and make subsequent independent purchases of our cartridges. This would include, during our early customer engagements, a fully paid workflow license to practice the desired workflow(s) in a specific field of use. In addition, we would also offer platform support to the extent customers require further system and workflow optimization following platform implementation. When we place a system under a reagent rental agreement, we plan to install equipment in the customer’s facility without a fee and the customer agrees to purchase our cartridges at a stated price over the term of the reagent rental agreement. Some of these agreements could include minimum purchase commitments. Under a reagent rental model, we plan to retain title to the equipment and such title is transferred to the customer at no additional charge at the conclusion of the initial arrangement. The cost of the instrument under the agreement is expected to be recovered in the fees charged for consumables, to the extent sold, over the term of the agreement.
We cannot predict if, when, or to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of our system. We may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for our system. Growth and predictability of recurring revenue is impacted by the mix between these options. It is our goal and expectation that recurring revenue will grow over time, both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of our revenue.
Grant revenue
To date, all of our revenue has been derived from government grants, which includes an April 2018 subaward grant from Boston University as part of the CARB-X initiative, a May 2018 grant from the NIH to support our advancement of a Diagnostics via Rapid Enrichment, Identification, and Phenotypic Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing of Pathogens from Blood project (NIH grant), a July 2020 subaward grant from the University of Massachusetts Medical School for Phase 1 of the NIH’s RADx initiative and a $25.4 million contract from the NIH directly for Phase 2 of the RADx initiative. The CARB-X, NIH grant and RADx initiative included initial funding of $4.4 million through September 2019, $1.3 million through April 2019, and $10.1 million based on achieving certain milestones, respectively. The initial funding term of the CARB-X grant was extended through September 30, 2020 and our initial funding was increased by $1.2 million. We also exercised our second one-year option under the NIH grant, extending the term through April 30, 2021. Under the CARB-X and NIH grant there is the possibility of an additional $2.8 million of funding through June 2021 and an additional $2.2 million of funding through April 2023, respectively. Under RADx there is the possibility of an additional $16.5 million of funding through July 2021.
These grants are not in scope of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606) as the government entities and/or government-sponsored entities are not customers under the agreements.
Grant funds received from third parties are recorded as revenue if we are deemed to be the principal participant in the arrangement. If we are not the principal participant, the funds from grants are recorded as a reduction to research and development expense. Reimbursable costs paid prior to being billed are recorded as unbilled grant receivables. Funds received in advance are recorded as deferred grant revenue. Our management has determined that we are the principal participant under our grant agreements, and accordingly, we record amounts earned under these arrangements as grant revenue.
Operating expenses
Research and development expenses
Research and development expenses consist primarily of internal and external costs incurred for our research activities, the development of our platform, investment in manufacturing capabilities as well as costs incurred pursuant to our government grants and include:
•
salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, for personnel engaged in research and development functions;
•
the cost of laboratory supplies and developing and manufacturing of our platform;
•
contract services, other outside costs and costs to develop our technology capabilities;
•
facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs;
•
cost of outside consultants, including their fees and related travel expenses, engaged in research and development functions;
•
expenses related to regulatory affairs; and
•
fees related to our scientific advisory board.
We expense research and development costs as incurred. Costs for external development activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information provided to us by our vendors. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual agreements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in our financial statements as prepaid or accrued research and development expenses. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses and expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.
Until future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized we do not capitalize pre-launch inventory costs prior to completion of marketing authorization unless the regulatory review process has progressed to a point that objective and persuasive evidence of regulatory approval is sufficiently probable, and future economic benefit can be asserted. We record such costs to research and development costs, or if used in marketing evaluations reported to general and administrative expense. A number of factors are taken into consideration, based on management’s judgment, including the current status in the regulatory approval process, potential impediments to the approval process, anticipated R&D initiatives and risk of technical feasibility, viability of commercialization and marketplace trends.
Prior to receiving an EUA, costs of property and equipment related to scaling up our manufacturing capacity for commercial launch are recorded to research and development expense when the asset does not have an alternative future use.
Research and development activities are central to our business model. We expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase for the foreseeable future as we initiate clinical trials for our platform, ramp-up our manufacturing and commercialization efforts and continue to discover and develop platforms and assays for other infectious diseases and disease states. There are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any assay we may develop in the future for other diseases or disease states, including future trial design and various regulatory requirements, many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time based on our stage of development.
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in our executive, finance, corporate and business development and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include professional fees for legal, patent, accounting, information technology, auditing, tax and consulting services, travel expenses and facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs.
We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our continued research and development and potential commercialization and sales of our platform. We also expect to incur increased expenses associated with being a public company, including costs of
accounting, audit, legal, regulatory and tax compliance services, director and officer insurance costs, and investor and public relations costs.
Other income (expense)
Other income (expense), net primarily consists of interest expense on a convertible promissory note held during 2019 as well as the change in estimated fair value of our convertible notes. We elected the fair value option to account for these convertible notes and fluctuations in the estimated fair value of our convertible notes were based on the remeasurement at each reporting period until conversion and/or settlement. In December 2019, we converted the convertible notes’ aggregate contractually calculated principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, of $19.0 million into 6,937,252 shares of Series D-2 convertible preferred stock at a conversion price of $2.74 per share.
Results of operations
Comparison for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
The following table summarizes our results of operations:
Grant revenue
Our revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 relates to the CARB-X and NIH grants and the RADx initiative. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, $0.6 million, $1.1 million and $9.3 million of revenue was recognized related to the CARB-X, NIH and RADx grants, respectively. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, $3.1 million and $0.8 million of revenue was recognized related to the CARB-X and NIH grants, respectively. The changes in revenue recognized for the grants period over period were primarily a result of achieving RADx development targets during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 offset by a reduction in revenue as a result of the expiration of the CARB-X grant. The increase in revenue of $9.3 million relating to the RADx initiative was offset by approximately $2.6 million between December 31, 2019 and 2020 as a result of the completion of the CARB-X grant in 2020.
Research and development expenses
Substantially all of our research and development expenses incurred for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 were related to the development of our first potential commercial product utilizing the Talis One system, a rapid, point-of-care molecular diagnostic test to detect COVID-19 directly from a patient sample.
Research and development expenses were $89.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, compared to $23.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $65.2 million. The increase was primarily due to increases of $40.9 million related to the ramp up of manufacturing efforts, an increase of $11.9 million in instrument expenses, an increase $6.6 million relating to Talis One cartridges for the COVID-19 assay, and an increase of $6.4 million related to personnel related expenses, including stock compensation expenses, as we increased full-time and temporary headcount. These increases were offset by a $0.8 million decrease in contracting expenses relating to research and development. We expect our research and development expenses to
increase over the near term as we continue to scale up our manufacturing capacity in anticipation of commercial launch of the Talis One system.
The ramp up of the Company’s manufacturing efforts, which began in the middle of 2020, is expected to result in a significant increase in our research and development expenses through regulatory approval and launch of our initial products is achieved. As of December 31, 2020, we have incurred approximately $40.9 million related to such manufacturing scale-up costs. We expect to incur approximately $72.8 million of additional costs in the near term, of which we expect approximately $52.8 million to be recognized in research and development expense until we receive an EUA, at which point we will start capitalizing these costs. The Company plans to submit an EUA application for the Talis One system and COVID-19 assay cartridges in Q2 2021. See “Liquidity and capital resources- Future funding requirements” below for additional information.
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses were $13.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, compared to $6.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $6.2 million. The increase was primarily due to increased personnel related expenses of $3.9 million, including salaries and wages and stock compensation expenses, as we hired new administrative employees, and increased outside services, audit, legal and other expenses of $2.2 million related to corporate and intellectual property activities.
Other income (expense)
Other income was $0.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, compared to other expense of $0.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The change of $0.8 million was primarily due to the change in the estimated fair value of the convertible notes of $0.8 million between their issuance and settlement in 2019. The overall change in fair value was primarily driven by the change in the estimated fair value of our preferred stock over this period.
Liquidity and capital resources
Sources of liquidity
On February 17, 2021, we completed our initial public offering (IPO), pursuant to which we issued and sold 13,800,000 shares of our common stock and an additional 2,070,000 shares pursuant to the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares of our common stock, at a public offering price of $16.00 per share. The net proceeds from the IPO were $232.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses.
Since inception and through December 31, 2020, we have raised $351.5 million from the sale of convertible preferred stock and the issuance of convertible promissory notes, which we have used to fund our operations. In the first half of 2020, we received net proceeds of $24.9 million related to issuances of our Series C-1, D-1, and D-2 convertible preferred stock. In the second half of 2020, we issued and sold 2,289,899 shares and 11,187,189 shares of our Series E-1 and Series E-2, for net proceeds of $99.7 million and 4,859,897 and 9,958,539 shares of our Series and Series convertible preferred stock, respectively, for net proceeds of $123.6 million.
In the second half of 2020, we were awarded a $25.4 million contract from the NIH for Phase 2 of its RADx initiative, of which, $8.9 million had been received as of December 31, 2020.
Between June 2020 and August 2020, we executed and amended a standby letter of credit (LOC) loan with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (JPMC) for up to $33.0 million, as terms of collateral that were required by one of our contract manufacturing organizations. The LOC was set to expire on December 31, 2020 but automatically extended to December 31, 2021 when we did not terminate the agreement 90 days prior to the original expiration date. Interest on any borrowings under the LOC agreement is equal to the lesser of (a) Prime plus 2% and (b) the highest rate permitted by applicable law and is payable on demand. The LOC requires us to maintain a cash balance of $34.7 million as collateral.
As of December 31, 2020, we had unrestricted cash of $138.5 million. We believe our cash balance as of December 31, 2020 and our proceeds from IPO of $232.6 million is sufficient for our operations for at least the next 12 months based on our existing business plan and our ability to control the timing of significant expense commitments.
Future funding requirements
We do not have any commercial-scale manufacturing facilities, and expect to rely on third parties to manufacture the Talis One system and related cartridges. We have entered into, and expect to enter into additional, agreements with contract manufacturers to support our manufacturing scale up. We will also need engage third-party logistics providers to manage the movement of materials between suppliers and contract manufacturers and for finished goods warehousing. We also intend to invest in additional manufacturing capacity to meet market demand if the Talis One system is approved for marketing. The ramp up of these manufacturing efforts, which began in the middle of 2020, is expected to result in a significant increase in our research and development expenses until regulatory approval of our products is achieved.
We do not yet have any products approved for sale, and we have never generated any revenue from contracts with customers. We do not expect to generate any meaningful revenue unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize our Talis One system. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue from the commercialization of Talis One system, if ever, we expect to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings or debt financings.
To date, our primary uses of cash have been to fund operating expenses, primarily research and development expenditures. Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay these expenses, as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses. We currently have no other ongoing material financing commitments, such as other lines of credit or guarantees. We have recently increased our spending on automated cartridge manufacturing scale-up and instrument manufacturing, and expect expenses related to manufacturing to increase significantly as we prepare for a potential commercial launch as early as the second quarter of 2021. We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue the research and development of, continue or initiate clinical trials of, and seek marketing approval for, our platform. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for our platform, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to program sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution to the extent that such sales, marketing and distribution are not the responsibility of any future collaborators. We expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. Accordingly, we may choose to obtain additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or future commercialization efforts.
Since our inception, we have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations. We have an accumulated deficit of $172.9 million through December 31, 2020. We expect to incur substantial additional losses in the future as we conduct and expand our research and development, manufacturing and commercialization activities. Based on our planned operations, we expect that our unrestricted cash of $138.5 million as of December 31, 2020, together with the proceeds from our February 2021 initial public offering, will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least 12 months after these financial statements are issued. However, we may need to raise additional capital through equity or debt financing, or potential additional collaboration proceeds prior to achieving commercialization of our products. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to successfully secure sources of financing and ultimately achieve profitable operations.
We have based our projections of operating capital requirements on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect and we may use all our available capital resources sooner than we expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of the Talis One system, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our operating capital requirements. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:
•
our ability to receive, and the timing of receipt of, an EUA for our COVID-19 test;
•
the effectiveness and availability of the three vaccines that were authorized as of March 2021;
•
the amount of capital, and related timing of payments, required to build sufficient inventory of our Talis One system and test cartridges in advance of and during commercial launch;
•
the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, for our platform if we receive marketing approval;
•
limitations of, or interruptions in, the quality or quantity of materials from our third party suppliers;
•
our ability to implement an effective manufacturing, marketing and commercialization operation;
•
the scope, progress, results and costs of our ongoing and planned operations;
•
the costs associated with expanding our operations;
•
the number and development requirements of assays for other diseases or disease states that we may pursue;
•
intervention, interruptions or recalls by government or regulatory agencies;
•
enhancements and disruptive advances in the diagnostic testing industry;
•
our estimates and forecasts of the market size addressable by our Talis One system;
•
security breaches, data losses or other disruptions affecting our information systems;
•
the regulatory and political landscape upon the launch of our commercialization of the Talis One system;
•
the revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our products if approved, including additional working capital requirements if we pursue a reagent rental model for our Talis One instrument;
•
our ability to establish strategic collaborations; and
•
the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims.
Cash flows
The following table summarizes our cash flows for each of the periods presented:
Operating activities
During the year ended December 31, 2020, cash used in operating activities was $87.0 million, resulting primarily from our net loss of $91.1 offset by non-cash items of $5.1 million (primarily made up of stock-based compensation of $3.7 million and depreciation expense of $0.8 million), an increase in prepaid research and development of $11.5 million and increases in accounts payable of $3.2 million and accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $7.3 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was $24.3 million, resulting primarily from our net loss of $27.5 million, partially offset by non-cash items of $2.5 million (primarily changes in the estimated fair value of convertible notes of $0.8 million, stock-based compensation of $1.0 million, and depreciation expense of $0.7 million) and a net increase of $0.6 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities.
Investing activities
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we used $8.2 million and $0.6 million of cash, respectively, for investing activities related to purchases of property and equipment.
Financing activities
During the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $246.8 million primarily consisting of $248.2 million of proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock consisting of net proceeds of $24.9 million from the second tranche payment of 2019 issuance of Series C-1 convertible preferred stock, Series D-1 and D-2 convertible preferred stock, net proceeds of $99.7 million from our issuance of Series E-1 and E-2 convertible preferred stock, and $123.6 million from the issuance of our Series and convertible preferred stock offset by $1.5 million of deferred initial public offering costs.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was $39.6 million, primarily consisting of $15.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes that were subsequently converted into Series D-2 convertible preferred stock, $18.1 million of net proceeds from the sale of our Series C-1 convertible preferred stock in, $1.9 million of net proceeds from the sale of our Series D-1 convertible preferred stock, and $4.6 million of net proceeds from the sale of our Series D-2 convertible preferred stock.

In January 2021, we entered into a lease agreement that expires in May 2032 for office space in Redwood City, California, with expected occupancy to commence in the fourth quarter of 2021. In January 2021, we also entered into a lease that expires in February 2033 for laboratory space in Chicago, Illinois, with expected occupancy to commence in the second quarter of 2021.
Between June 2020 and August 2020, we executed and amended a LOC with JPMC for up to $33.0 million, as terms of collateral that were required by one of our contract manufacturing organizations. The LOC was set to expire on December 31, 2020 but automatically extended to December 31, 2021 when we did not terminate the agreement 90 days prior to the original expiration date.
Apart from the contracts with payment commitments that we have reflected in the table, we have entered into other contracts in the normal course of business with certain contract manufacturing organizations and other third parties for manufacturing services. Payments due upon cancellation consist only of payments for services provided and expenses incurred, including non-cancelable obligations of our service providers, up to the date of cancellation.
Critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates
This management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, costs and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in greater detail in Note 2 to our financial statements appearing within Item 8 of this Annual Report, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.
Equity transactions
We record convertible preferred stock at fair value on the dates of issuance, net of issuance costs. We have classified convertible preferred stock as temporary equity in the accompanying balance sheets due to terms that may require redemption of the shares in cash upon certain change in control events that are not solely within our control, including our sale or transfer. The carrying values of the convertible preferred stock will be adjusted to their liquidation preferences at such time it becomes probable that such a redemption triggering event will occur. We also evaluate our convertible preferred stock to determine where any of their contractual terms require bifurcation and separate recognition from the underlying shares in accordance with the embedded derivative accounting guidance.
Between November 2019 and December 2019, we entered into a series of transactions (Equity Transactions) with our existing preferred equity stockholders and other investors to (i) raise new capital in a sale of three new series of convertible preferred stock and (ii) restructure our capital structure. All existing holders of our convertible preferred stock were given the opportunity to participate in the new financing but existing convertible preferred stockholders that did not participate in the financing were subject to dilution. The steps of the Equity Transactions that impacted the existing stockholders were evaluated as a single transaction because they occurred concurrently and in contemplation of each other. We concluded that the these combined transactions resulted in the extinguishment of our Series A convertible preferred stock, Series B convertible preferred stock, and Series C convertible preferred stock because the Series C-1 convertible preferred stock, Series D-1 convertible preferred stock and Series D-2 convertible preferred stock issued to our existing investors were considered to be substantially different from the Series A convertible preferred stock, Series B convertible preferred stock and Series C convertible preferred stock. In determining if an extinguishment or modification of these shares occurred, we elected a policy to evaluate if changes to the preferred shares adds, removes, or significantly changes a substantive contractual term (e.g., one that is at least reasonably possible of being exercised), or fundamentally changes the nature of the preferred shares. This evaluation includes the consideration of both the expected economics as well as the business purpose for the amendment. More specifically, the Series C-1 convertible preferred stock received by existing stockholders has a significantly higher liquidation preference than the Series A convertible preferred stock, Series B convertible preferred stock and Series C convertible preferred stock, respectively. Together with the Series C-1 convertible preferred stock, existing stockholders also received common stock and paid additional cash through the Equity Transactions, causing the equity investments held by our preferred stockholders after the Equity Transaction to be substantially different than their equity investments prior to the Equity Transactions.
When mezzanine equity-classified preferred shares are extinguished, the difference between (1) the fair value of the consideration transferred to the holders of the preferred shares (i.e., the cash or the fair value of new instruments issued) and (2) the carrying amount of the preferred shares (net of issuance costs) are subtracted from (or added to) net income (loss) to arrive at income available to common stockholders in the calculation of earnings per share attributable to our common stockholders. In addition to the effect on earnings per share attributable to our common stockholders, extinguishment accounting will result in adjustments within equity but will not result in recognition of any amounts in net income (loss).
The estimated fair value of our convertible preferred stock, for purposes of evaluating the extinguishment resulting from the Equity Transactions, was based on the guidelines outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. The estimated fair value of the convertible preferred stock was based on a hybrid between the probability weighted expected return and option pricing methods, estimating the probability weighted value across multiple scenarios, but using the option pricing method to estimate the allocation of value within one or more of those scenarios. The assumptions we use in the valuation model are based on future expectations combined with management judgment. In the absence of a public trading market for our convertible preferred stock, our management exercised significant judgment and considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of convertible preferred stock, including the following factors:
•
a contemporaneous independent valuation of our common stock performed at periodic intervals by an independent third-party valuation firm;
•
prices at which we sold shares of convertible preferred stock and the superior rights and preferences of the convertible preferred stock relative to our common stock;
•
timing and likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or sale of our company in light of prevailing market conditions;
•
volatility as estimated based on the average volatility for comparable publicly traded diagnostic companies over a period equal to the expected term of a liquidity event (comparable companies are chosen based on their similar size, stage in the life cycle or area of specialty); and
•
a risk-free interest rate based on the U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues corresponding with the estimated period of time to a liquidity event.
The assumptions underlying these valuations represent our management’s best estimates based on application of these approaches and careful consideration of advice from a third-party valuation firm. Such estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of significant judgment.
Grant revenue
Grants awarded to us for research and development by government entities are outside the scope of the contracts with customers and contributions guidance. This is because these granting entities are not considered to be customers and are not receiving reciprocal value for their grant support provided to us. These grants provide us with payments for certain types of expenditures in return for research and development activities or for meeting certain development milestones over a contractually defined period. For efforts performed under these grant agreements, our policy is to recognize revenue when it is reasonably assured that the grant funding will be received as evidenced through the existence of a grant arrangement, amounts eligible for reimbursement are determinable and have been incurred and paid, the applicable conditions under the grant arrangements have been met, and collectability of amounts due is reasonably assured. Costs of grant revenue are recorded as a component of research and development expenses in our statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
Grant funds received from third parties are recorded as revenue if we are deemed to be the principal participant in the arrangement. If we are not the principal participant, the funds from grants are recorded as a reduction to research and development expense. Reimbursable costs paid prior to being billed are recorded as unbilled grant receivables. Funds received in advance are recorded as deferred grant revenue. We have determined that we are the principal participant under our grant agreements, and accordingly, we record amounts earned under these arrangements as grant revenue.
Research and development expenses
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses include certain payroll and personnel expenses, laboratory supplies, consulting costs, external contract research and development expenses, allocated overhead and facility occupancy costs. Costs to develop our technologies, including software, are recorded as research and development expense except for costs that meet the criteria to be capitalized as internal-use software costs. These expenses relate to both our sponsored programs as well as costs
incurred pursuant to grants. Non-refundable advance payments made for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are deferred and capitalized and recognized as expense as the goods are received or the related services are rendered.
We do not capitalize pre-launch inventory costs until future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized. Capitalizing pre-launch inventory costs will not occur prior to obtaining an EUA or other FDA clearance or marketing authorization unless the regulatory review process has progressed to a point that objective and persuasive evidence of regulatory approval is sufficiently probable, and future economic benefit can be asserted. We record such costs as research and development expenses, or if used in marketing evaluations records such costs as general and administrative expenses. A number of factors are taken into consideration, based on our management’s judgment, including the current status in the regulatory approval process, potential impediments to the approval process, anticipated research and development initiatives and risk of technical feasibility, viability of commercialization and marketplace trends.
In 2020, we began developing production lines to automate the production of our Talis One cartridges for the COVID-19 assay with the intention to scale up our manufacturing capabilities to meet the high demand expected in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In Q2 2021, we plan to submit a request for EUA to the FDA for our Talis One system with COVID-19 molecular diagnostic assay for the automated detection of nucleic acid from the SARS-CoV-2 virus in nasal swab samples from individuals suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider Approximately $40.9 million of the high capacity production equipment, purchased as part of our effort to scale up our manufacturing capacity, is highly specialized for the manufacturing of our Talis One cartridges and was determined not to have an alternative future use. All materials, equipment, and external consulting costs associated with developing aspects of the production line that do not have an alternative future use are expensed as research and development costs until regulatory approval or clearance is obtained. Materials, equipment, and external consulting costs associated with developing aspects of the production line that are deemed to have an alternative future use are capitalized as property and equipment, assessed for impairment and depreciated over their related useful lives. These research and development costs, including expenditures for property and equipment with no alternative future use, are classified as operating cash outflows within our statements of cash flows.
For certain research and development services where we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost from the third-party contracted service providers, we are required to estimate the extent of the services that have been performed on our behalf and the associated costs incurred at each reporting period. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary.
Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have not been any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses.
Fair value option
We have elected the fair value option to account for our convertible notes that were issued during and settled during 2019 and recorded these convertible notes at fair value with changes in fair value recorded as a component of other income (expense), net in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss. As a result of applying the fair value option, direct costs and fees related to the convertible notes were expensed as incurred and were not deferred. We concluded that it was appropriate to apply the fair value option to the convertible notes because there were no non-contingent beneficial conversion options related to the convertible notes. The probability-adjusted model used in valuing the fair value of our convertible debt is based on significant unobservable inputs, including but not limited to:
•
Timing and probability of a qualified financing event, which is defined as financing event through the issuance of shares for total gross proceeds of at least $45.0 million in cash;
•
discount rates; and
•
fair value of the underlying convertible preferred stock.
Increases or decreases in the fair value of the convertible notes can result from updates to assumptions such as the expected timing or probability of a qualified financing event, or changes in discount rates. Judgment is used in determining these assumptions as of the initial valuation date and at each subsequent reporting period. Updates to assumptions could have a significant impact on our results of operations in any given period. The convertible notes were settled in December 2019.
Stock-based compensation
We measure stock-based compensation expense for stock options granted to our employees and directors on the date of grant and recognize the corresponding compensation expense of those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. Our stock-based payments include stock options. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period, on a straight-line basis. From time to time, we may grant stock options to employees, including executive officers, that vest upon the satisfaction of both service-based and performance-based vesting conditions. We recognize stock-based compensation over the requisite service period using the accelerated attribution method for awards with a performance condition if the performance condition is deemed probable of being met. Stock-based compensation expense is classified in the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive loss based on the function to which the related services are provided. We recognize stock-based compensation expense for the portion of awards that have vested. Forfeitures are recorded as they occur.
We estimate the fair value of stock options granted to our employees and directors on the grant date, and the resulting stock-based compensation expense, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of subjective assumptions which determine the fair value of stock option awards. These assumptions include:
•
Expected term. The expected term of options represents the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding. Our historical stock option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate an expected term due to lack of sufficient data. For granted “at-the-money” stock options, we estimate the expected term by using the simplified method. The simplified method calculates the expected term as the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the options.
•
Expected volatility. Prior to our IPO, there has been no public market for our common stock, and as a result we do not have any trading history of our common stock, expected volatility is estimated based on the average volatility for comparable publicly traded diagnostic companies over a period equal to the expected term of the stock option grants. The comparable companies are chosen based on their similar size, stage in the life cycle or area of specialty.
•
Risk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of the stock option grants.
•
Expected dividend yield. We have never paid dividends on our common stock and have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock. Therefore, we use an expected dividend yield of zero.
Prior to our IPO, there has been no public market for our common stock. As such, the estimated fair value of the common stock underlying our stock options was determined by our board of directors, with input from management, considering our most recently available third-party valuations of common stock and our board of directors’ assessment of additional objective and subjective factors that it believed were relevant, and factors that may have changed from the date of the most recent valuation through the date of the grant, which intended all options granted to be exercisable at a price per share not less than the per share fair value of our common stock underlying those options on the date of grant. We believe that our board of directors has the relevant experience and expertise to determine the fair value of our common stock. Prior to our initial public offering, given the absence of a public trading market for our common stock, the valuations of our common stock were determined in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. The Practice Aid identifies various available methods for allocating enterprise value across classes and series of capital stock to determine the estimated fair
value of common stock at each valuation date. In accordance with the Practice Aid, our board of directors considered the following methods:
•
Current value method. Under the Current Value Method, our value is determined based on our balance sheet. This value is then first allocated based on the liquidation preference associated with preferred stock issued as of the valuation date, and then any residual value is assigned to the common stock.
•
Option-pricing method. Under the option-pricing method, shares are valued by creating a series of call options with exercise prices based on the liquidation preferences and conversion terms of each equity class. The estimated fair values of the preferred and common stock are inferred by analyzing these options.
•
Probability-weighted expected return method. The probability-weighted expected return method, is a scenario-based analysis that estimates value per share based on the probability-weighted present value of expected future investment returns, considering each of the possible outcomes available to us, as well as the economic and control rights of each share class.
The assumptions we use in the valuation model are based on future expectations combined with management judgment. In the absence of a public trading market, our board of directors with input from management exercised significant judgment and considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of our common stock as of the date of each option grant, including the following factors:
•
contemporaneous independent valuations performed at periodic intervals by an independent third-party valuation firm;
•
the prices at which we sold shares of preferred stock and the superior rights and preferences of the preferred stock relative to our common stock at the time of each grant;
•
the progress of our research and development programs, including the status and results of preclinical studies for our platform;
•
our stage of development and commercialization and our business strategy;
•
external market conditions affecting the diagnostics industry and trends within the diagnostics industry;
•
the lack of an active public market for our common stock; and
•
the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or sale of our company in light of prevailing market conditions.
The assumptions underlying these valuations represented our board of directors and management develop best estimates based on application of these approaches and the assumptions underlying these valuations, giving careful consideration to the advice from our third-party valuation expert. Such estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of significant judgment. As a result, if factors or expected outcomes change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our equity-based compensation could be materially different. Following the closing of our initial public offering, our board of directors will determine the fair market value of our common stock based on its closing price as reported on the date of grant on the primary stock exchange on which our common stock is traded.
In March 2020, we offered to reprice the unexercised stock options of each employee or non-employee director with an exercise price equal to $6.38 or higher per share to the estimated fair market value of our Class A Common Stock on March 13, 2020, $1.51. The repriced options were subject to the same terms as the original granted options, except for the new exercise price. As a result of the offering, we modified the exercise price of stock options for the purchase of 407,415 shares of common stock with a weighted average exercise price of $15.55 per share, by cancelling these options and reissuing stock options with an exercise price of $1.51 per share to purchase 407,415 shares of common stock. The calculation of the incremental compensation expense is based on the excess of the fair value of the award measured immediately before and after the modification. As a result of the modification, we recognized incremental compensation expense of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $0.1 million of the incremental expense relating to the unvested shares remained unrecognized as of December 31, 2020.
The intrinsic value of all outstanding options as of December 31, 2020 was approximately $91.1 million, based on the assumed initial public offering price of $16.00 per share, of which approximately $14.8 million is related to vested options and approximately $76.3 million is related to unvested options.
Off-balance sheet arrangements
As of December 31, 2020, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
Recently issued accounting pronouncements
A description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results of operations is disclosed in Note 2 to our audited financial statements included within Item 8 of this Annual Report.
Emerging growth company status
In April 2012, the JOBS Act was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company may take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Therefore, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we may adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-public companies instead of the dates required for other public companies. However, we may early adopt these standards, for example we elected to early adopt ASC 842, Leases.
In addition, as an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:
•
reduced disclosure about the compensation paid to our executive officers;
•
not being required to submit to our stockholders’ advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements;
•
an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; and
•
an exemption from new or revised financial accounting standards until they would apply to private companies and from compliance with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotation.
We may take advantage of these exemptions for up to the last day of the fiscal year ending after the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company on the date that is the earliest of (1) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more; (2) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of our initial public offering; (3) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (4) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC. We may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these exemptions.
We are also a “smaller reporting company” meaning that the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million and our annual revenue was less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $250 million or (ii) our annual revenue was less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million. If we are a smaller reporting company at the time we cease to be an emerging growth company, we may continue to rely on
exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company we may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report and, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation.
