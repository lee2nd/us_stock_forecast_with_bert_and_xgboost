This includes the increase of $10.1 million from recent acquisitions and a decrease of $1.5 million related to the unfavorable impact of exchange rates. Excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, the net sales decrease in international sales was $215.7 million, or 33.2%. The decline in both domestic and international sales reflects the impacts of COVID-19. This was most prevalent in the second quarter of 2020 and despite decline over prior year gradually recovered in the second half of the year.

As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses amounted to 21.2% in fiscal 2020 and 20.1% in fiscal 2019.
Selling, general and administrative expenses reflect increased costs of $30.2 million associated with acquisitions, including $7.2 million of non-cash intangible amortization expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $35.7 million related to compensation costs and commissions and $59.2 million due to controllable cost reductions primarily within professional fees, travel and entertainment, convention costs, and advertising. Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of $0.5 million. The decreases were partially offset by a $11.5 million increase related to higher non-cash share based compensation and$5.8 million related to increased allowances for doubtful accounts given the current market conditions. The prior year expenses also included $10.1 million related to transition costs with the former Chairman and CEO upon his retirement in February 2019.

See Note 13, Restructuring and Acquisition Integration Initiatives, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on restructuring initiatives.
INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations decreased $189.6 million to $324.4 million in fiscal 2020 from $514.0 million in fiscal 2019. Operating income as a percentage of net sales amounted to 12.9% in 2020 as compared to 17.4% in 2019. The decrease in operating income resulted from the impacts of COVID-19. Operating income in fiscal 2019 included the gain on litigation settlement, offset by the transition costs related to the former Chairman and CEO. Operating income in fiscal 2020 included impairment charges related to intangible assets, fixed assets, and assets held for sale.
Income from operations in 2020 included $127.7 million of non-cash expenses, including $39.1 million of depreciation expense, $69.0 million of intangible amortization related to acquisitions and $19.6 million of stock based compensation.

Net interest expense and deferred financing decreased $4.0 million to $78.6 million in fiscal 2020 from $82.6 million in fiscal 2019 reflecting the reduction in the average interest rates under the Credit Facility and benefit from the Convertible Notes, offset by higher non-cash interest from the lower interest rate on Convertible Notes. Net periodic pension benefit (other than service costs and curtailment) increased $10.3 million to $40.0 million in fiscal 2020 from $29.7 million in fiscal 2019, related to the increase in discount rate used to calculate the interest cost and lower expected returns on assets driven by lower asset values for fiscal 2019. During fiscal 2020 a curtailment cost of approximately $14.7 million was recognized as a result of closing the AGA Group Pension Scheme to future pension accruals.
INCOME TAXES. A tax provision of $60.8 million, at an effective rate of 22.7%, was recorded for fiscal 2020 as compared to $110.4 million at an effective rate of 23.9%, in fiscal 2019. In comparison to the prior year, the tax provision reflects favorable tax adjustments for deferred tax rate changes and adjustments for the finalization of 2019 tax returns. The effective rates in 2020 and 2019 are higher than the federal tax rate of 21% primarily due to state taxes and foreign tax rate differentials.

Net interest expense and deferred financing increased $23.9 million to $82.6 million in fiscal 2019 from $58.7 million in fiscal 2018 reflecting higher interest rates and higher debt balances related to the funding of acquisitions. Net periodic pension benefit (other than service costs) increased $9.2 million to $28.9 million in fiscal 2019 from $38.1 million in fiscal 2018, related to the increase in discount rate used to calculate the interest cost and lower expected returns on assets driven by lower asset values for fiscal 2019.
INCOME TAXES. A tax provision of $110.4 million, at an effective rate of 23.9%, was recorded for fiscal 2019 as compared to $106.4 million at an effective rate of 25.1%, in fiscal 2018. In comparison to the prior year the tax provision reflects favorable tax adjustments for a refund of foreign taxes, enacted tax rate changes in several foreign jurisdictions and adjustments for the finalization of 2018 tax returns. The effective rates in 2019 and 2018 are higher than the federal tax rate of 21% primarily due to state taxes, non-deductible expenses and foreign tax rate differentials.
Financial Condition and Liquidity
Total cash and cash equivalents increased by $173.6 million to $268.1 million at January 2, 2021 from $94.5 million at December 28, 2019.

OPERATING ACTIVITIES. Net cash provided by operating activities after changes in assets and liabilities amounted to $524.8 million as compared to $377.4 million in the prior year.
During fiscal 2020, sales volumes were significantly lower as compared to 2019 due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily in the Commercial Foodservice Equipment Group. Lower earnings generated less income and associated cash flows. However, reductions in working capital requirements generated more than offsetting cash flow benefits. Net cash used to fund changes in assets and liabilities amounted to $174.9 million in 2020, primarily related to lower receivables, reductions in inventory levels, the amount and timing of payments, as well as increases in employer payroll tax accruals from the CARES Act.
In connection with the company’s acquisition activities during the year, the company added assets and liabilities from the opening balance sheets of the acquired businesses in its consolidated balance sheets and accordingly these amounts are not reflected in the net change in working capital.
INVESTING ACTIVITIES. During 2020, net cash used for investing activities amounted to $106.8 million. This included $79.6 million primarily for the 2020 acquisitions of RAM, Deutsche, Wild Goose and United Foodservice Equipment Zhuhai.

The company then entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the "Capped Call Transactions") in an aggregate amount of $104.7 million. A portion of the net proceeds from the offering of the Convertible Notes was used to prepay $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of its term loan obligations and to execute an amendment to the Credit Facility. The company incurred approximately $11.0 million of debt issuance costs, in aggregate, for amendments to the Credit Facility. The company’s borrowing activities during 2020 included $48.5 million of net repayments under its Credit Facility.
Additionally, the company repurchased $85.9 million of Middleby common shares during 2020. This was comprised of $16.2 million to repurchase 176,242 shares of Middleby common stock that were surrendered to the company for withholding taxes related to restricted stock vestings and $69.7 million used to repurchase 896,965 shares of its common stock under a repurchase program.
At January 2, 2021, the company was in compliance with all covenants pursuant to its borrowing agreements. The company has run various scenarios to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and continues to believe that its future cash generated from operations, together with its capacity under its Credit Facility and its cash on hand, will provide adequate resources to meet its working capital needs and cash requirements and maintain compliance with financial covenants in its Credit Facility for at least the next 12 months.
Contractual Obligations
The company's contractual cash payment obligations are set forth below (dollars in thousands):
The company has obligations to make $34.8 million of estimated contingent purchase price payments to the sellers that were deferred in conjunction with various acquisitions.
As of January 2, 2021, the company had $1.1 billion outstanding under its Credit Facility. The average interest rate on this debt, inclusive of hedging instruments, amounted to 3.97% at the end of the period. As of January 2, 2021, the company also has $4.4 million of debt outstanding under various foreign credit facilities and $1.4 million of other debt arrangements. The estimated interest payments reflected in the table above assume that the level of debt and average interest rate on the company’s revolving credit line under its Credit Facility does not change until the facility reaches maturity. The estimated payments also assume that relative to the company’s foreign borrowings and other debt arrangements: all scheduled term loan payments are made; the level of borrowings does not change; and the average interest rates remain at their January 2, 2021 rates. As of January 2, 2021, the company has $747.5 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes outstanding that bear interest semi-annually in arrears at a rate of 1.00% per annum. The Convertible Notes will mature on September 1, 2025 unless they are redeemed, repurchased or converted prior to such date in accordance with their terms. Also reflected in the table above is $17.4 million of payments to be made related to the company’s interest rate swap agreements in 2021.
As indicated in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the company’s projected benefit obligation under its defined benefit plans exceeded the plans’ assets by $469.5 million at the end of 2020 as compared to $289.1 million at the end of 2019. The unfunded benefit obligations were comprised of a $21.4 million underfunding of the company's U.S. Plans and $448.1 million underfunding of the company’s Non-U.S. Plans. The company made minimum contributions required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) of $1.6 million and $1.2 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, to the company’s U.S. Plans. The company expects to continue to make minimum contributions to the U.S. Plans as required by ERISA, of $0.6 million in 2021. The company expects to contribute $4.7 million to the Non-U.S. Plans in 2021.
The company places purchase orders with its suppliers in the ordinary course of business. These purchase orders are generally to fulfill short-term manufacturing requirements of less than 90 days and most are cancelable with a restocking penalty. The company has no material long-term purchase contracts or minimum purchase obligations with any supplier.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The company has no activities, obligations or exposures associated with off-balance sheet arrangements.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized when the control of the promised goods or services are transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services.
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and represents the unit of account. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The company’s contracts can have multiple performance obligations or just a single performance obligation. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the contract’s transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using the company’s best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract.
Within the Commercial Foodservice Equipment and Residential Foodservice Equipment Groups, the estimated standalone selling price of equipment is based on observable prices. Within the Food Processing Equipment Group, the company estimates the standalone selling price based on expected cost to manufacture the good or complete the service plus an appropriate profit margin.
Control may pass to the customer over time or at a point in time. In general, the Commercial Foodservice Equipment and Residential Foodservice Equipment Groups recognize revenue at the point in time control transfers to their customers based on contractual shipping terms. Revenue from equipment sold under our long-term contracts within the Food Processing Equipment group is recognized over time as the equipment is manufactured and assembled. Installation services provided in connection with the delivery of the equipment are also generally recognized as those services are rendered. Over time transfer of control is measured using an appropriate input measure (e.g., costs incurred or direct labor hours incurred in relation to total estimate). These measures include forecasts based on the best information available and therefore reflect the company's judgment to faithfully depict the transfer of the goods.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out method for the majority of the company’s inventories. The company evaluates the need to record valuation adjustments for inventory on a regular basis. The company’s policy is to evaluate all inventories including raw material, work-in-process, finished goods, and spare parts. Inventory in excess of estimated usage requirements is written down to its estimated net realizable value. Inherent in the estimates of net realizable value are estimates related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, possible alternative uses, and ultimate realization of potentially excess inventory.
Goodwill and Indefinite-Life Intangibles
The company’s business acquisitions result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets, which are a significant portion of the company’s total assets. Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Identifiable intangible assets are recognized separately from goodwill and include trademarks and trade names, technology, customer relationships and other specifically identifiable assets. Trademarks and trade names are deemed to be indefinite-lived. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are subject to impairment testing.
On an annual basis on the first day of the fourth quarter, or more frequently if triggering events occur, the company performs an impairment assessment for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. The company considers qualitative factors to assess if it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets is below the carrying value.
In conducting a qualitative assessment, the company analyzes a variety of events or factors that may influence the fair value of the reporting unit including, but not limited to: the results of prior quantitative assessments performed; changes in the carrying amount of the reporting unit; actual and projected revenue and operating margin; relevant market data for both the company and its peer companies; industry outlooks; macroeconomic conditions; liquidity; changes in key personnel; and the company's competitive position. Significant judgment is used to evaluate the totality of these events and factors to make the determination of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-life intangible is less than its carrying value.
Goodwill Valuations
The reporting units at which we test goodwill for impairment are our operating segments. These consist of the Commercial Foodservice Equipment Group, the Food Processing Equipment Group and the Residential Kitchen Equipment Group. If the fair value is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss, if any, is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of goodwill.
In performing a quantitative assessment, if required, the company estimates each reporting unit's fair value under an income approach using a discounted cash flow model. The income approach uses each reporting unit's projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that are discounted using a market participant discount rate based on a weighted-average cost of capital. The financial projections reflect management's best estimate of economic and market conditions over the projected period including forecasted revenue growth, operating margins, tax rate, capital expenditures, depreciation, amortization and changes in working capital requirements. Other assumptions include discount rate and terminal growth rate. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to their respective carrying values. Additionally, the company validates the estimates of fair value under the income approach by comparing the fair value estimate using a market approach. A market approach estimates fair value by applying cash flow multiples to the reporting unit's operating performance. The multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics of the reporting units. The company considers the implied control premium and conclude whether it is reasonable based on other recent market transactions.
The company performed a qualitative assessment as of September 27, 2020 over all three reporting units and determined it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are greater than the carrying amounts. As a result of the financial performance indicators for the Commercial Foodservice reporting unit, the company completed a quantitative analysis. The fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by more than 100% and no impairment of goodwill was recognized. As a result of the qualitative assessment for the other two segments, the company determined it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are greater than the carrying amounts.
In estimating the fair value of its reporting units, management relies on a number of factors, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable transactions and other market data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying them in the impairment tests of goodwill. If actual results are not consistent with management's estimate and assumptions, a material impairment could have an adverse effect on the company's financial condition and results of operations.
Indefinite-Life Intangible Valuations
In performing a quantitative assessment of indefinite-life intangible assets other than goodwill, primarily trademarks and trade names, we estimate the fair value of these intangible assets using the relief-from-royalty method which requires assumptions related to projected revenues from our long-range plans; assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the trademark; and a discount rate using a market based weighted-average cost of capital. If the estimated fair value of the indefinite-life intangible asset is less than its carrying value, we would recognize an impairment loss.
Based on the qualitative assessment as of September 27, 2020, the company identified several trademarks and trade names with indicators of potential risk for impairment and performed quantitative assessment. In performing the quantitative analysis on these trademark assets, significant assumptions used in our relief-from-royalty model included revenue growth rates, assumed royalty rates and the discount rate, which are discussed further below.
•Revenue growth rates relate to projected revenues from our long-range plans and vary from brand to brand. Adverse changes in the operating environment or our inability to grow revenues at the forecasted rates may result in a material impairment charge.
•In determining royalty rates for the valuation of our trademarks, we considered factors that affect the assumed royalty rates that would hypothetically be paid for the use of the trademarks. The most significant factors in determining the assumed royalty rates include the overall role and importance of the trademarks in the particular industry, the profitability of the products utilizing the trademarks, and the position of the trademarked products in the given market segment.
•In developing discount rates for the valuation of our trademarks, we used the market based weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for higher relative level of risks associated with doing business in other countries, as applicable, as well as the higher relative levels of risks associated with intangible assets.
As a result of quantitative testing the company recognized $11.6 million of impairment charges associated with several trademarks, none of which were individually material. The gross value of the trademarks tested, including the impaired trademarks, was approximately $90.0 million. The fair values of the other trademarks tested with no impairment per the analyses, exceeded their carrying values by more than 20%. The company believes the assumptions utilized within the quantitative analysis are reasonable.
The company performed a qualitative assessment as of September 27, 2020 over all the other trademarks and trade names and determined it is more likely than not that the fair value of its other indefinite-life intangible assets are greater than the carrying amounts.
The company continues to monitor the global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic to assess the outlook for demand of its products and the impact on its business and financial performance. If actual results are not consistent with management's estimate and assumptions, a material impairment charge of our trademarks and trade names could occur, which could have an adverse effect on the company's financial condition and results of operations.
Convertible Debt
The company issued convertible debt with debt and equity components. The company evaluated the different components and features of the hybrid instrument and determined whether certain elements were embedded derivative instruments which require bifurcation. Components of convertible debt instruments that upon conversion may be settled fully in cash or partly in cash based on a net-share settlement basis are accounted for separately as long-term debt and equity when the conversion feature of the convertible bonds constitute an embedded equity instrument. When an equity instrument is identified, proceeds from issuance are allocated between debt and equity by measuring first the liability component and then determining the equity component as a residual amount. The liability component is measured as the fair value of a similar nonconvertible debt, which results in the recognition of a debt discount. In subsequent periods, the company will amortize the debt discount to interest expense, net within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, using the effective interest method based on the expected maturity of the debt. The equity component is reported in additional paid-in capital within the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders' Equity and is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification.
The company allocated transaction costs related to the issuance of convertible debt using the same proportions as the proceeds from the convertible debt. Transaction costs attributable to the liability component are recorded as a direct deduction from the related debt liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are amortized to interest expense, net within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings over the term of the convertible debt using the effective interest rate method. Transaction costs attributable to the equity component are netted within additional paid-in capital within the Consolidated Statement of Stockholders' Equity.
For additional information regarding the company's convertible debt, see Note 5, Financing Arrangements, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Pension Benefits
The company sponsors pension benefits to certain employees. The accounting for these plans depends on assumptions made by management, which are used by actuaries the company engages to calculate the projected and accumulated obligations and the annual expense recognized for these plans. These assumptions include expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and discount rates.
The amount of unrecognized actuarial gains and losses recognized in the current year’s operations is based on amortizing the unrecognized gains or losses for each plan that exceed the larger of 10% of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets, also known as the corridor. The amount of unrecognized gain or loss that exceeds the corridor is amortized over the average future service of the plan participants or the average life expectancy of inactive plan participants for plans where all or almost all of the plan participants are inactive. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension obligations and our future expense.
Income taxes
The company provides deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws. The company’s deferred and other tax balances are based on management’s interpretation of the tax regulations and rulings in numerous taxing jurisdictions. Income tax expense and liabilities recognized by the company also reflect its best estimates and assumptions regarding, among other things, the level of future taxable income, the effect of the company’s various tax planning strategies and uncertain tax positions. Future tax authority rulings and changes in tax laws, changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the company. The company follows the provisions under ASC 740-10-25 that provides a recognition threshold and measurement criteria for the financial statement recognition of a tax benefit taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Tax benefits are recognized only when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the benefits will be sustained on examination. Tax benefits that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured using a probability weighting of the largest amount of tax benefit that has greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Whether the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is met for a particular tax benefit is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances evaluated in light of all available evidence as of the balance sheet date.
