ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Overview - 2020 Versus 2019
Analysis of 2020 Earnings. Net income and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) for 2020 were $41.2 million and $1.72, respectively. Dividends per share increased 5.7% from $.70 for 2019 to $.74 for 2020. ROA and ROE for 2020 were 1.00% and 10.47%, respectively, compared to .99% and 10.61%, respectively, for 2019.
Net income for 2020 was $41.2 million, a decrease of $352,000, or .8%, as compared to 2019. The decrease is mainly due to an increase in the provision for credit losses of $3.0 million partially offset by increases in net interest income of $1.9 million, or 1.9%, and noninterest income, before securities gains, of $933,000, or 8.8%.
The increase in net interest income is mainly attributable to a reduction in deposit rates in response to decreases in the federal funds target rate to near zero as well as significant declines in rates across the entire yield curve. Declines in the cost of savings, NOW and money market deposits and interest-bearing liabilities far outpaced the decline in yield on securities and loans which are generally not subject to immediate repricing with changes in market interest rates. The increase in net interest income was also attributable to income from SBA PPP loans and a favorable shift in the mix of funding as an increase in average checking deposits and a decline in average interest-bearing liabilities resulted in average checking deposits comprising a larger portion of total funding. Average checking deposits include a portion of the proceeds of PPP loans.
Net interest margin for 2020 was 2.64%, an increase of 7 basis points over 2019. The increase was mainly attributable to our ability to reduce the rates paid on interest-bearing deposits faster than interest-earning assets repriced downward and a deleveraging transaction completed in the third quarter of 2020.
The provision for credit losses was $3.0 million for 2020 on a CECL basis as compared to $33,000 for 2019 on an incurred loss basis. The provision for the current year was primarily attributable to the pandemic and reflected higher historical loss rates, economic conditions and net chargeoffs, partially offset by a decline in the outstanding loan balance of residential and commercial mortgages. The provision for 2019 was driven mainly by net chargeoffs, partially offset by declines in outstanding loans and lower growth rate trends.
The increase in noninterest income, before securities gains, of $933,000 is primarily attributable to an increase in the non-service components of the Bank’s defined benefit pension plan and income relating to a transition payment from an independent broker-dealer for the initial conversion of the Bank’s retail broker and advisory accounts. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in service charges on deposit accounts due to the pandemic. Management remains focused on revenue enhancement initiatives; however, the pandemic has negatively affected most categories of noninterest income.
Noninterest expense, before debt extinguishment costs, increased $58,000 in 2020 as compared to 2019. Excluding executive severance and retirement charges of $2.6 million in 2019, the increase over 2019 was primarily due to increases in compensation and benefit costs mainly related to normal salary adjustments and hiring of lending and credit staff.
The increase in income tax expense of $96,000 is attributable to an increase in the effective tax rate (income tax expense as a percentage of pre-tax book income) from 16.5% in 2019 to 16.8% in 2020 as tax-exempt income from municipal securities and BOLI in the current year declined as a percentage of pre-tax earnings when compared to 2019.
Asset Quality. The Bank’s ACL to total loans (“reserve coverage ratio”) on a CECL basis was 1.01% at January 1, 2020, 1.09% at March 31, 1.08% at June 30 and September 30 and 1.09% at December 31, 2020. Excluding PPP loans, the reserve coverage ratio increased 12 basis points during 2020 to 1.13% at year end. The increase is mainly due to current and forecasted economic conditions and higher historical loss rates. Gross loan chargeoffs and recoveries were $2.7 million and $584,000, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Nonaccrual loans amounted to $1.1 million, or .04% of total loans outstanding, at December 31, 2020, compared to $888,000, or .03%, at December 31, 2019. The increase in nonaccrual loans is mainly due to three new nonaccrual loans, partially offset by one loan returned to accrual status and paydowns. Troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) amounted to $1.3 million, or .04% of total loans outstanding, at December 31, 2020. Of the TDRs, $815,000 are performing in accordance with their modified terms and $494,000 are nonaccrual and included in the aforementioned amount of nonaccrual loans. Loans past due 30 through 89 days amounted to $1.4 million, or .05% of total loans outstanding, at December 31, 2020, compared to $2.9 million, or .09%, at December 31, 2019.
During the second and third quarters of 2020, the Bank provided payment deferrals in the form of loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial disruption and economic hardship as a result of the pandemic. At December 31, 2020, all such loans have resumed making payment and are current except for seven loans that were charged-off totaling $440,000 and one loan that was past due 30 to 89 days in the amount of $41,000. Additionally, three loans totaling $862,000 were in nonaccrual status at year end.
The Bank’s mortgage securities are backed by mortgages underwritten on conventional terms, with 16% of these securities being full faith and credit obligations of the U.S. government and the balance being obligations of U.S. government sponsored entities. The remainder of the Bank’s securities portfolio principally consists of high quality, general obligation municipal securities rated AA or better by major rating agencies and investment grade corporate bonds of large U.S. financial institutions. In selecting securities for purchase, the Bank uses credit agency ratings for screening purposes only and then performs its own credit analysis. On an ongoing basis, the Bank periodically assesses the credit strength of the securities in its portfolio and makes decisions to hold or sell based on such assessments.
Key Strategic Initiatives and Challenges We Face. Our strategy is focused on increasing shareholder value through loan and deposit growth, the maintenance of strong credit quality, a strong efficiency ratio and an optimal amount of capital. Key strategic initiatives include building on our relationship banking business, growing fee income, enhancing our brand, highlighting our digital offerings and refining our branch strategy.
During the fourth quarter we opened a new branch in Riverhead, Long Island, successfully launched an updated branding initiative including multimedia advertising and an interactive custom designed website to better support our customers’ electronic banking services and digital banking needs. In addition, the Bank recently partnered with an independent broker-dealer to enhance our customers’ access to a comprehensive set of investment products as well as investment management, trust and advisory services.
The interest rate and economic environment continues to exert substantial pressure on net interest income, net interest margin, earnings, profitability metrics, loans outstanding and the Bank’s ability to grow. These items could be negatively impacted by yield curve inversion, low yields available on loans and securities and potential credit losses arising from current economic conditions. The recent resurgence of the coronavirus and persistent economic challenges such as the level of short and long-term interest rates, elevated unemployment and underemployment, suboptimal gross domestic product measures, higher vacancies and delinquent rents are particular risks to future financial performance. Among other things, very low interest rates have caused an acceleration of residential mortgage loan repayments and repricing which are expected to continue into 2021.
Overview - 2019 Versus 2018
Analysis of 2019 Earnings. Net income and EPS for 2019 were $41.6 million and $1.67, respectively. Dividends per share increased 9.4% from $.64 for 2018 to $.70 for 2019. ROA and ROE for 2019 were .99% and 10.61%, respectively, compared to 1.00% and 11.09%, respectively, for 2018.
Net income for 2019 was $41.6 million, remaining relatively unchanged from 2018. Earnings for 2019 included decreases in net interest income and noninterest income, before securities losses in 2018, of $2.3 million and $2.1 million, respectively, and increases in the provision for loan losses of $1.8 million, noninterest expense of $1.1 million, including executive severance and retirement charges, and income tax expense of $3.2 million.
The decline in net interest income of $2.3 million occurred as yield curve flattening and inversion led management to slow loan and overall balance sheet growth. A decline in the federal funds target rate during 2019 to the year-end level of 1.50% to 1.75% started to provide some relief on the cost of total interest-bearing liabilities. However, the increase in the cost of total interest-bearing liabilities in 2019 outpaced the increase in the yield on total interest-earning assets. When comparing 2019 to the prior year, the cost of total interest-bearing liabilities increased by 28 basis points while the yield on total interest-earning assets only increased by 12 basis points. Overall, net interest margin declined 7 basis points to 2.57% in 2019.
Management’s decision to slow loan growth in 2019 resulted in a small increase in the average balance of loans when comparing the current year and prior year and a reduction in loans outstanding during 2019. Growth in the average balance of loans was funded by increases in the average balances of interest-bearing deposits and stockholders’ equity, and a decrease in securities. These sources of funds were also used to reduce the average balance of total borrowings. The growth in deposits and reduction in borrowings were mainly the result of using brokered CDs as a lower cost alternative to FHLB advances.
The increase in the provision for loan losses of $1.8 million versus the prior year was primarily due to an improvement in economic conditions in 2018 and higher net chargeoffs in 2019, partially offset by a decrease in outstanding loans in 2019 versus an increase in 2018.
The decrease in noninterest income, before securities losses in 2018, of $2.1 million was primarily attributable to a BOLI death benefit in 2018, a decline in the non-service cost components of the Bank’s defined benefit pension plan and a gain on the sale of bank premises in 2018. Partially offsetting these items was an increase in service charges on deposit accounts primarily related to higher overdraft and maintenance and activity charges. Management implemented initiatives to increase fee income on deposit accounts and was focused on growing noninterest income from existing and potential new sources.
Noninterest expense increased $1.1 million versus 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expense and technology and professional services fees, partially offset by decreases in FDIC insurance expense and marketing expense. The increase in salaries and employee benefits included executive severance and retirement charges in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the forfeiture of certain stock-based compensation awards in 2018. These items were partially offset by a decrease in special salary-related items recorded in 2019 and 2018 and a decline in retirement plan expense. The increase in occupancy and equipment expense was mainly due to higher rent and other operating costs on the Bank’s facilities and equipment and the cost of an environmental remediation. The increase in technology and professional services fees included an increase in consulting fees related to a revenue enhancement project. The decrease in FDIC insurance expense was due to FDIC assessment credits received by the Bank during the third and fourth quarters of 2019. The decrease in marketing expense was due to fewer branch openings.
Income tax expense increased $3.2 million and the effective tax rate increased to 16.5% from 10.9% when comparing 2019 and 2018. These increases were primarily attributable to a decline in 2019 in tax-exempt income from municipal securities and BOLI and the recognition in 2018 of state and local net operating loss carryforwards, higher excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and tax savings resulting from a cost segregation study. The increase in income tax expense also reflected higher pre-tax earnings in 2019 as compared to 2018.
Asset Quality. The Bank’s ACL to total loans was .94% at year end 2018 versus .92% at December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to reductions in historical loss rates and growth rates on certain pools of loans, as well as decreases in both the three-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) and office vacancy rates on several pools of loans.
The credit quality of the Bank’s loan portfolio remained excellent. Nonaccrual loans amounted to $888,000, or .03% of total loans outstanding, at December 31, 2019, compared to $2.1 million, or .07%, at December 31, 2018. The decrease in nonaccrual loans was mainly due to loans returned to accrual status and paydowns. TDRs amounted to $1.5 million, or .05% of total loans outstanding, at December 31, 2019. Of the TDRs, $1.1 million were performing in accordance with their modified terms and $465,000 were nonaccrual and included in the aforementioned amount of nonaccrual loans. Loans past due 30 through 89 days amounted to $2.9 million, or .09% of total loans outstanding, at December 31, 2019, compared to $909,000, or .03%, at December 31, 2018.
Application of Critical Accounting Policies
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported asset and liability balances and revenue and expense amounts. Our determination of the ACL is a critical accounting estimate because it is based on our subjective evaluation of a variety of factors at a specific point in time and involves difficult and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. In the event that management’s estimate needs to be adjusted based on, among other things, additional information that comes to light after the estimate is made or changes in circumstances, such adjustment could result in the need for a significantly different ACL and thereby materially impact, either positively or negatively, the Bank’s results of operations.
The Bank’s Allowance for Credit Losses Committee (“ACL Committee”), which is a management committee chaired by the Chief Credit Officer, meets on a quarterly basis and is responsible for determining the ACL after considering, among other things, the results of credit reviews performed by the Bank’s independent loan review consultants and the Bank’s credit department. In addition, and in consultation with the Bank’s Chief Financial Officer, the ACL Committee is responsible for implementing and maintaining accounting policies and procedures surrounding the calculation of the required allowance. The Loan Committee reviews and approves the Bank’s Loan Policy at least once each calendar year. The Bank’s ACL is reviewed and ratified by the Loan Committee on a quarterly basis and is subject to periodic examination by the OCC whose safety and soundness examination includes a determination as to the adequacy of the allowance to absorb current expected credit losses within its portfolio.
The ACL is a valuation amount that is deducted from the loans’ amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the Bank’s loan portfolio. The allowance is established through provisions for credit losses charged against income. When available information confirms that specific loans, or portions thereof, are uncollectible, these amounts are charged against the ACL, and subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.
Management estimates the ACL balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical loss information from the Bank’s own loan portfolio has been compiled since December 31, 2007 and generally provides a starting point for management’s assessment of expected credit losses. A historical look-back period that begins in 2007 covers an entire economic cycle and impacts the average historical loss rates used to calculate the final ACL. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level or term as well as for current and potential future changes in economic conditions over a one year to two year forecasting horizon, such as unemployment rates, GDP, vacancy rates, home prices or other relevant factors. The immediate reversion method is applied for periods beyond the forecasting horizon. The ACL is an amount that management currently believes will be adequate to absorb expected lifetime losses in the Bank’s loan portfolio. The process for estimating credit losses and determining the ACL as of any balance sheet date is subjective in nature and requires material estimates and judgements. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.
The ACL is measured on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Management segregates its loan portfolio into eleven distinct pools: (1) commercial and industrial; (2) small business credit scored; (3) multifamily; (4) owner-occupied; (5) other commercial real estate; (6) construction and land development; (7) residential mortgage; (8) revolving home equity; (9) consumer; (10) municipal loans; and (11) SBA PPP loans. The vintage method is applied to measure the historical loss component of lifetime credit losses inherent in most of its loan pools. For the revolving home equity and small business credit scored pools, the migration method was selected to measure historical losses; no historical loss method was applied to the SBA PPP loan pool. Management believes that the methods selected fairly reflect the historical loss component of expected losses inherent in the Bank’s loan portfolio. However, since future losses could vary significantly from those experienced in the past, on a quarterly basis management adjusts its historical loss experience to reflect current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. In doing so, management considers a variety of general qualitative and quantitative factors and then subjectively determines the weight to assign to each in estimating losses. The factors include, among others: (1) changes in lending policies and procedures; (2) experience, ability and depth of lending staff; (3) trends in the nature and volume of loans; (4) changes in the quality of the loan review function; (5) delinquencies; (6) environmental risks; (7) current and forecasted economic conditions as judged by things such as national and local unemployment levels and GDP; (8) changes in the value of underlying collateral as judged by things such as median home prices and forecasted vacancy rates in the Bank’s service area; and (9) direction and magnitude of changes in the economy. The Bank’s ACL allocable to its loan pools results primarily from these qualitative and quantitative adjustments to historical loss experience. Because of the nature of the qualitative factors and the difficulty in assessing their impact, management’s resulting estimate of losses may not accurately reflect lifetime losses in the portfolio.
Loans that do not share similar risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Such disparate risk characteristics may include internal or external credit ratings, risk ratings, collateral type, size of loan, effective interest rate, term, geographic location, industry or historical or expected loss pattern. Estimated losses for loans individually evaluated are based on either the fair value of collateral or the discounted value of expected future cash flows. For all collateral dependent loans evaluated on an individual basis, credit losses are measured based on the fair value of the collateral. In estimating the fair value of real estate collateral, management utilizes appraisals or evaluations adjusted for costs to dispose and a distressed sale adjustment, if needed. Estimating the fair value of collateral other than real estate is also subjective in nature and sometimes requires difficult and complex judgements. Determining expected future cash flows can be more subjective than determining fair values. Expected future cash flows could differ significantly, both in timing and amount, from the cash flows actually received over the loan’s remaining life. Individually evaluated loans are not included in the estimation of credit losses from the pooled portfolio.
TDRs are individually evaluated for loss and generally reported at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan’s effective rate at inception. However, if a TDR is considered to be a collateral dependent loan, the loan is reported at the fair value of the collateral.
Net Interest Income
Average Balance Sheet; Interest Rates and Interest Differential. The following table sets forth the average daily balances for each major category of assets, liabilities and stockholders’ equity as well as the amounts and average rates earned or paid on each major category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The average balances of investment securities include unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, and the average balances of loans include nonaccrual loans.
(1) Tax-equivalent basis. Interest income on a tax-equivalent basis includes the additional amount of interest income that would have been earned if the Corporation's investment in tax-exempt loans and investment securities had been made in loans and investment securities subject to federal income taxes yielding the same after-tax income. The tax-equivalent amount of $1.00 of nontaxable income was $1.27 for each period presented using the statutory federal income tax rate of 21%.
Rate/Volume Analysis. The following table sets forth the effect of changes in volumes and rates on tax-equivalent interest income, interest expense and net interest income. The changes attributable to a combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate.
Net Interest Income - 2020 Versus 2019
Net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis was $104.7 million in 2020, an increase of $1.4 million, or 1.4%, from $103.2 million in 2019. The increase in net interest income is mainly attributable to a reduction in deposit rates in response to decreases in the federal funds target rate to near zero as well as significant declines in rates across the entire yield curve. The cost of savings, NOW and money market deposits declined 54 basis points to .54% and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities declined 42 basis points to 1.12%. These decreases far outpaced the 18 basis point decline in yield on securities and loans which are generally not subject to immediate repricing with changes in market interest rates. The increase in net interest income was also attributable to income from SBA PPP loans of $3.7 million and a favorable shift in the mix of funding as an increase in average checking deposits of $158.4 million and a decline in average interest-bearing liabilities of $214.6 million resulted in average checking deposits comprising a larger portion of total funding. Average checking deposits include a portion of the proceeds of PPP loans.
The decline in yield on securities and loans of 42 basis points and 12 basis points, respectively, was mainly attributable to an increase in prepayment speeds on mortgage-backed securities, lower yields available on securities purchases and loan originations, acceleration of loan prepayments and refinancing on residential mortgages and downward repricing of corporate bonds. While the economic impact of the pandemic caused the outstanding balance of loans to shrink during the first nine months of 2020, outstanding mortgage loans grew $26.7 million, or 1%, during the fourth quarter. For the year, the average balance of loans decreased $107 million, or 3.3%, and the average balance of investment securities declined $52.2 million, or 6.8%. The average balance of loans includes $112.6 million of PPP loans at a weighted average yield earned in 2020 of 3.25%. Through year-end 2020, the Bank had $25.2 million, or 15%, of its PPP loans forgiven by the SBA. The decrease in loans and securities resulted in a notable increase in cash and cash equivalents on the Balance Sheet. The mortgage loan pipeline was $74 million at December 31, 2020.
Net interest margin for 2020 was 2.64%, an increase of 7 basis points over 2019. The increases were mainly attributable to our ability to reduce the rates paid on interest-bearing deposits faster than interest-earning assets repriced downward and a deleveraging transaction completed in the third quarter of 2020. However, the current low reinvestment rates on securities and loans, a highly competitive lending environment, and the elevated pace of prepayments and refinancings on residential mortgages could continue to exert downward pressure on net interest income and margin.
Net Interest Income - 2019 Versus 2018
Net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis was $103.2 million in 2019, a decrease of $2.9 million, or 2.7%, from $106.1 million in 2018. The decline in net interest income occurred as yield curve flattening and inversion led management to slow loan and overall balance sheet growth. Three 25 basis point decreases in the federal funds target rate during 2019 to the year-end level of 1.50% to 1.75% started to provide some relief on the cost of total interest-bearing liabilities. However, the increase in the cost of total interest-bearing liabilities in 2019 outpaced the increase in the yield on total interest-earning assets. When comparing 2019 to the prior year, the cost of total interest-bearing liabilities increased by 28 basis points while the yield on total interest-earning assets only increased by 12 basis points. Overall, net interest margin declined 7 basis points to 2.57% for 2019 from 2.64% for 2018.
Between mid-2018 and year-end 2019, management was proactive in addressing net interest margin stabilization. Actions taken through year-end 2019 included, among others:
Downward repricing of certain interest-bearing deposits
Reducing overall balance sheet growth by slowing loan growth and the related need for funding
Changing the mix of loans being originated to higher yielding commercial mortgages from lower yielding residential mortgages
Hiring additional lenders to grow commercial and industrial loans
Restructuring the securities portfolio and deleveraging the balance sheet
Hedging a portion of short-term borrowings with interest rate swaps
Shifting between FHLB advances and brokered CDs to reduce funding costs.
Management’s decision to slow loan growth resulted in a small increase of $40.0 million, or 1.3%, in the average balance of loans when comparing 2019 to 2018 and a reduction of $75.2 million in loans outstanding during 2019. Growth in the average balance of loans was funded by increases in the average balances of interest-bearing deposits of $120.3 million, or 5.4%, and stockholders’ equity of $16.7 million, or 4.5%, and a decrease in securities of $36.2 million, or 4.5%. These sources of funds were also used to reduce the average balance of total borrowings by $128.8 million, or 20.7%. The growth in deposits and reduction in borrowings were mainly the result of using brokered CDs as a lower cost alternative to FHLB advances. Substantial contributors to the growth in the average balance of stockholders’ equity were net income and the issuance of shares under the Corporation’s DRIP, particularly during the first half of 2018, partially offset by cash dividends declared and common stock repurchases which began in December 2018.
Noninterest Income
Noninterest income includes service charges on deposit accounts, Investment Management Division income, gains or losses on sales of securities and other assets, income on BOLI, and all other items of income, other than interest, resulting from the business activities of the Corporation.
Noninterest income before securities gains increased $933,000, or 8.8%, when comparing 2020 to 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the non-service components of the Bank’s defined benefit pension plan of $1.0 million and income of $370,000 relating to a transition payment from an independent broker-dealer for the initial conversion of the Bank’s retail broker and advisory accounts. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in service charges on deposit accounts of $252,000 due to the pandemic. Management remains focused on revenue enhancement initiatives; however, the pandemic has negatively affected most categories of noninterest income.
Noninterest income before securities gains and losses decreased $2.1 million, or 16.4%, in 2019 as compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to:
BOLI death benefit in 2018 of $565,000
Decline in the non-service cost components of the Bank’s defined benefit pension plan of $823,000
Gain on the sale of bank premises in 2018 of $1.2 million
Partially offsetting these items was an increase in service charges on deposit accounts of $580,000 primarily related to higher overdraft and maintenance and activity charges. Management implemented initiatives to increase fee income on deposit accounts and was focused on growing noninterest income from existing and potential new sources.
Noninterest Expense
Noninterest expense is comprised of salaries and employee benefits and other personnel expense, occupancy and equipment expense and other operating expenses incurred in supporting the various business activities of the Corporation.
Noninterest expense, before debt extinguishment costs, increased $58,000 in 2020 as compared to 2019. Excluding executive severance and retirement charges of $2.6 million in 2019, the increase over 2019 was $2.6 million. The $2.6 million increase was primarily due to increases in compensation and benefit costs mainly related to normal salary adjustments and hiring of lending and credit staff. The increase over 2019 also includes charges related to the closure and consolidation of six branches of $476,000 and technology and service contract termination costs related to our Investment Management Division of $315,000, partially offset by declines in consulting and marketing costs of $352,000 and $242,000, respectively.
Noninterest expense increased $1.1 million, or 1.8%, when comparing 2019 to 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and employee benefits of $646,000, or 1.8%, occupancy and equipment expense of $218,000, or 1.9%, and technology and professional services fees of $779,000, partially offset by decreases in FDIC insurance expense of $653,000 and marketing expense of $510,000. The increase in salaries and employee benefits included executive severance and retirement charges of $2.6 million ($2.0 million after-tax, or $.08 per share) in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the forfeiture of certain stock-based compensation awards in 2018. These items were partially offset by a decrease of $1.5 million due to special salary-related items recorded in 2019 and 2018 and a decline in retirement plan expense of $313,000. The increase in occupancy and equipment expense was mainly due to higher rent and
other operating costs on the Bank’s facilities and equipment and the cost of an environmental remediation. The increase in technology and professional services fees included an increase in consulting fees of $454,000 mainly related to a revenue enhancement project. The decrease in FDIC insurance expense was due to FDIC assessment credits received by the Bank during the third and fourth quarters of 2019. The decrease in marketing expense was due to fewer branch openings.
2020 and 2018 Deleveraging and Securities Portfolio Restructuring Transactions
During 2020, the Bank eliminated some inefficient leverage by selling mortgage-backed securities with a carrying value of $64.5 million and using the proceeds along with excess cash of $66.8 million to prepay long-term debt of $128.7 million. The transactions resulted in an overall net loss of $3,000 with the gain on sale of securities and loss on extinguishment of debt essentially the same at $2.6 million each. The deleveraging benefited net interest margin by approximately 10 basis points beginning in the fourth quarter and improved leverage capital.
During 2018, the Bank sold $274.4 million of available-for-sale securities to improve the securities portfolio yield and net interest margin and eliminate inefficient leverage. The proceeds were reinvested in mortgage-backed securities and corporate bonds and used to pay down overnight borrowings. The loss on the 2018 securities sales totaled $10.4 million ($7.5 million after-tax) and the payback period, excluding the deleveraging transaction, was approximately 2.0 years. Because these transactions were completed toward the end of the year, they had only a partial impact on interest income and net interest margin for 2018.
Income Taxes
The Corporation’s effective tax rate was 16.8% and 16.5% in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The effective tax rate reflects the tax benefits derived from the Bank’s municipal securities portfolio, ownership of BOLI and maintenance of a captive REIT.
2020 Versus 2019. The increase in income tax expense of $96,000 is attributable to an increase in the effective tax rate from 16.5% in 2019 to 16.8% in 2020 as tax-exempt income from municipal securities and BOLI in the current year declined as a percentage of pre-tax earnings when compared to 2019.
2019 Versus 2018. Income tax expense increased $3.2 million and the effective tax rate increased to 16.5% from 10.9% when comparing 2019 and 2018. These increases are primarily attributable to a decline in the current year in tax-exempt income from municipal securities and BOLI and the recognition in 2018 of state and local net operating loss carryforwards, higher excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and tax savings resulting from a cost segregation study. The increase in income tax expense also reflects higher pre-tax earnings in 2019 as compared to 2018.
Financial Condition
Total assets were $4.1 billion at December 31, 2020, a decrease of $28.7 million, or .7%, from the previous year end. The decrease was primarily attributable to declines in loans of $154.8 million, or 4.9%, and securities of $34.8 million, or 5.0%, partially offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $172.2 million. Total deposits were $3.3 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $177.6 million, or 5.6%, from December 31, 2019. The growth in deposits is comprised of an increase in noninterest-bearing checking deposits of $296.1 million, or 32.5%, partially offset by decreases in savings, NOW and money market deposits of $41.4 million, or 2.4%, and time deposits of $77.1 million, or 15.1%. Total borrowings decreased $222.1 million, or 42.0%, due to decreases in short-term borrowings of $130.6 million and long-term debt of $91.5 million. Stockholders’ equity increased $18.0 million, or 4.6% from December 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to net income, partially offset by dividends declared and shares repurchased.
Investment Securities. The following table presents the estimated fair value of available-for-sale securities and amortized cost of held-to-maturity securities at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
The following table presents the maturities and weighted average tax equivalent yields of the Bank’s available-for-sale investment securities at December 31, 2020. Yields on available-for-sale securities have been computed based on amortized cost.
(1) Maturities shown are stated maturities, except in the case of municipal securities, which are shown at the earlier of their stated maturity or pre-refunded dates. Securities backed by mortgages, which include the pass-through mortgage securities and collateralized mortgage obligations shown above, are expected to have substantial periodic repayments resulting in weighted average lives considerably shorter than would be surmised from the above table.
During the fourth quarter of 2020, corporate bonds totaling $82.4 million began to reprice on a quarterly basis to the ten-year swap rate and had a weighted average yield of 1.21% at December 31, 2020. In the fourth quarter of 2021, corporate bonds totaling $30.7 million with a weighted average yield of 5.10% at December 31, 2020 will begin to reprice on a quarterly basis to the ten-year swap rate.
During 2020, the Bank received cash dividends of $1.7 million on its FRB and FHLB stock, representing an average yield of 6.14%.
Loans. The composition of the Bank’s loan portfolio is set forth below.
Maturity and rate information for commercial and industrial loans outstanding at December 31, 2020 is set forth below.
Asset Quality. The Corporation has identified certain assets as risk elements. These assets include nonaccrual loans, other real estate owned, loans that are contractually past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest payments and still accruing and TDRs. These assets present more than the normal risk that the Corporation will be unable to eventually collect or realize their full carrying value. Information about the Corporation’s risk elements is set forth below.
The following table sets forth the gross interest income that would have been recorded under their original terms on nonaccrual loans and troubled debt restructurings and the actual amounts recorded for the years indicated.
The past due status of a loan is based on the contractual terms in the loan agreement. Unless a loan is well secured and in the process of collection, the accrual of interest income is discontinued when a loan becomes 90 days past due as to principal or interest payments. The accrual of interest income on a loan is also discontinued when it is determined that the borrower will not be able to make principal and interest payments according to the contractual terms of the current loan agreement. When the accrual of interest income is discontinued on a loan, any accrued but unpaid interest is reversed against current period income.
COVID-19 Loan Modifications. During the second and third quarters of 2020, the Bank provided payment deferrals in the form of loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial disruption and economic hardship as a result of the pandemic. As of December 31, 2020, all such loans have resumed making payments and are current except for seven loans that were charged-off totaling $440,000 and one loan that was 30 to 89 days past due in the amount of $41,000. Additionally, three loans totaling $862,000 were in nonaccrual status at year end. Payments received from borrowers for COVID-19 loan modifications are first applied to interest accrued during the deferral period until such interest is recovered and then toward their contractual repayment schedule. Under the CARES Act, these modifications are not considered TDRs.
In addition to the Bank’s past due, nonaccrual and restructured loans, the disclosure of other potential problem loans can be found in “Note C - Loans” to the Corporation’s consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-K.
Loan Risk Ratings. Risk ratings of the Corporation’s loans are set forth in the tables below. Risk ratings are defined in “Note C - Loans” to the Corporation’s consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-K. Deposit account overdrafts are not assigned a risk rating.
Allowance and Provision for Credit Losses. On January 1, 2020, the Bank recorded a $2.9 million credit to the ACL to establish a beginning balance of $32.2 million, or 1.01% of total loans, using the CECL methodology. The Bank’s reserve coverage ratio on a CECL basis was 1.09% at March 31, 1.08% at June 30 and September 30 and 1.09% at December 31, 2020. Excluding PPP loans, the reserve coverage ratio increased 12 basis points during 2020 to 1.13% at year end. The increase is mainly due to current and forecasted economic conditions and higher historical loss rates. Nonaccrual loans, TDRs and loans past due 30 through 89 days remain at low levels.
During 2020, the Bank had loan chargeoffs of $2.7 million, recoveries of $584,000 and recorded a provision for credit losses of $3.0 million. The provision in the current period was largely attributable to the pandemic and includes $4.2 million related to higher historical loss rates and economic conditions and $2.1 million for net chargeoffs, partially offset by a decline in outstanding loan balances of residential and commercial mortgages.
During 2019, the Bank had loan chargeoffs and recoveries of $1.6 million and $51,000, respectively, and recorded a provision for loan losses of $33,000. The provision in 2019 was driven mainly by net chargeoffs partially offset by declines in outstanding loans and lower growth rate trends.
The ACL is an amount that management currently believes will be adequate to absorb expected lifetime losses in the Bank’s loan portfolio. As more fully discussed in the “Application of Critical Accounting Policies” section of this discussion, the process for estimating credit losses and determining the ACL as of any balance sheet date is subjective in nature and requires material estimates and judgements. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Other detailed information on the Bank’s loan portfolio and ACL can be found in “Note C - Loans” to the Corporation’s consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-K.
The following table sets forth the Bank’s ACL.
The following table sets forth the allocation of the Bank’s total ACL by loan type.
The pandemic continues to present substantial challenges for the Bank and its customers. The amount of future chargeoffs and provisions for credit losses will be affected by, among other things, economic conditions on Long Island and in NYC. Such conditions could affect the financial strength of the Bank’s borrowers and will affect the value of real estate collateral securing the Bank’s mortgage loans. Loans secured by real estate represent approximately 92% of the Bank’s total loans outstanding at December 31, 2020. The majority of these loans are collateralized by properties located on Long Island and in the boroughs of NYC. While business activity in the NYC metropolitan area has started to improve, the pace of the recovery is slow and remains uncertain. These challenges may result in higher drawdowns by customers on the Bank’s lending commitments and higher past due and nonaccrual loans, TDRs and credit losses.
Future provisions and chargeoffs could also be affected by environmental impairment of properties securing the Bank’s mortgage loans. At the present time, management is not aware of any environmental pollution originating on or near properties securing the Bank’s loans that would materially affect the carrying value of such loans.
Deposits and Other Borrowings. Total deposits grew $177.6 million, or 5.6%, to $3.3 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase is attributable to growth in noninterest-bearing checking deposits of $296.1 million, or 32.5%, partially offset by decreases in savings, NOW and money market deposits of $41.4 million, or 2.4%, and time deposits of $77.1 million, or 15.1%.
The remaining maturities of the Bank’s time deposits at December 31, 2020 can be found in “Note E - Deposits” to the Corporation’s consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-K.
Borrowings include short-term and long-term FHLB borrowings and borrowings under repurchase agreements. Total borrowings decreased $222.1 million from $528.2 million in 2019 to $306.1 million at year-end 2020, comprised of decreases in short-term borrowings of $130.6 million and long-term debt of $91.5 million. Short-term borrowings are used to, among other things, offset the seasonal outflow of deposits. The decrease in long-term debt includes maturities of $82.8 million and early extinguishments of $128.7 million, partially offset by new fixed rate long-term FHLB borrowings of $120.0 million.
Capital. Stockholders’ equity totaled $407.1 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $18.0 million from $389.1 million at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to net income of $41.2 million, partially offset by dividends declared of $17.6 million and shares repurchased of $7.9 million.
The Corporation and the Bank elected to adopt the CBLR framework in 2020. As a qualifying community banking organization, the Corporation and the Bank may opt out of the CBLR framework in any subsequent quarter by completing its regulatory agency reporting using the traditional capital rules.
The Corporation’s ROE was 10.47%, 10.61% and 11.09% for the years ending December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively and its ROA was 1.00%, .99% and 1.00%, respectively. Book value per share increased 5.2% during 2020 to $17.11 at December 31, 2020. Book value per share was $16.26 and $15.27 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The Corporation’s capital management policy is designed to build and maintain capital levels that exceed regulatory standards and appropriately provide for growth. The Leverage Ratios of the Corporation and the Bank at December 31, 2020 were 9.97% and 9.98%, respectively. The Corporation and the Bank elected the optional five-year transition period provided by the federal banking agencies for recognizing the regulatory capital impact of the implementation of CECL.
The Corporation has a stock repurchase program under which it is authorized to purchase up to $65 million in shares of its common stock from time to time through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or in any other manner that is compliant with applicable securities laws. During 2020, the Corporation repurchased 377,200 shares of its common stock at a total cost of $7.9 million. Total repurchases completed since the commencement of the program amount to 2,140,600 shares at a cost of $47.6 million.
Cash Flows and Liquidity
Cash Flows. During 2020, the Corporation’s cash and cash equivalent position increased by $172.2 million, from $39.0 million at December 31, 2019 to $211.2 million at December 31, 2020. The increase occurred primarily because cash provided by deposit growth, paydowns of securities and loans and operations exceeded cash used to repay borrowings, repurchase common stock and pay cash dividends.
Liquidity. The Bank has a board committee approved liquidity policy and liquidity contingency plan, which are intended to ensure that the Bank has sufficient liquidity at all times to meet the ongoing needs of its customers in terms of credit and deposit outflows, take advantage of earnings enhancement opportunities and respond to liquidity stress conditions should they arise.
Based on securities and loan collateral in place at the FRBNY and FHLBNY, the Bank had borrowing capacity of approximately $1.7 billion at December 31, 2020, which includes $134 million of unencumbered available-for-sale securities.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations
The Corporation’s off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations at December 31, 2020 are summarized in the table that follows. Since some of the commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are expected to expire without being drawn upon and, with respect to unused home equity, small business credit scored and certain other lines, can be frozen, reduced or terminated by the Bank based on the financial condition of the borrower, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Corporation believes that its current sources of liquidity are more than sufficient to fulfill the obligations it has at December 31, 2020 pursuant to off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations.
Commitments to extend credit and letters of credit arise in the normal course of the Bank’s business of meeting the financing needs of its customers and involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets.
The Bank's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and letters of credit is represented by the contractual notional amount of these instruments. The Bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments to extend credit, and generally uses the same credit policies for letters of credit, as it does for on-balance sheet instruments such as loans.
The purchase obligations shown in the preceding table are pursuant to contracts that the Bank has with providers of data processing and telecommunications services.
Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices
The consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary effect of inflation on the operations of the Corporation is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike industrial companies, most of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, changes in interest rates generally have a more significant effect on the performance of a financial institution than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and changes in prices. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, which are beyond the control of the Corporation, including the influence of domestic and foreign economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. government and federal agencies, particularly the FRB, and foreign governments.
Impact of Issued But Not Yet Effective Accounting Standards
