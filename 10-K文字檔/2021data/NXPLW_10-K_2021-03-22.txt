Recent Events
March 2021 Financing
On March 5, 2021, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the “March 2021 NPA”) by and between the Company and one individual accredited investor (the “Lender”). Pursuant to the terms of the March 2021 NPA, the Company sold a convertible promissory note with a principal amount of $350,000 (the “March 2021 Note”). The March 2021 Note is a general, unsecured obligation of the Company and bears simple interest at a rate of 7% per annum, and matures on the third anniversary of the date of issuance (the “Maturity Date”), to the extent that the March 2021 Note and the principal amount and any interest accrued thereunder have not been converted into shares of the Company’s common stock. In the event that any amount due under the March 2021 Note is not paid as and when due, such amount will accrue interest at the rate of 12% per year, simple interest, non-compounding, until paid. The Company may not pre-pay or redeem the March 2021 Note other than as required by the Agreement. The Noteholder have an optional right of conversion such that a Noteholder may elect to convert his March 2021 Note, in whole or in part, outstanding as of such time, into the number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of the Company’s common stock as determined by dividing the indebtedness under the March 2021 Note price equal to the lesser of (a) $1.50 per share, and (b) a 30% discount to the price of the common stock in the qualified transaction. Following an event of default, the conversion price shall be adjusted to be equal to the lower of: (i) the then applicable conversion price or (ii) the price per share of 85% of the lowest traded price for the Company’s common stock during the 15 trading days preceding the relevant conversion. In addition, subject to the ownership limitations, if a qualified transaction is completed, without further action from the Noteholder, on the closing date of the qualified transaction, 50% of the principal amount of this March 2021 Note and all accrued and unpaid interest shall be converted into Company common stock at a conversion price equal to the 30% discount to the offering price in such qualified transaction, which price shall be proportionately adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends or similar events. A “Qualified Transaction” refers the completion of the public offering of the Company’s securities stock with gross proceeds of at least $10,000,000 pursuant to which the Company’s securities become registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or a merger with a company listed on the Nasdaq or Canadian stock exchanges, as amended. The Noteholder is granted registration rights and pre-emptive rights. In addition, the March 2021 NPA includes customary events of default, including, among others: (i) non-payment of amounts due thereunder, (ii) non-compliance with covenants thereunder, (iii) bankruptcy or insolvency. The Company’s issuance of the March 2021 Note under the terms of the March 2021 NPA was made pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act as a transaction by an issuer not involving a public offering. The investor in the March 2021 Note is an “accredited investor” as such term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act. There were no discounts or brokerage fees associated with this offering. The Company used the offering proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes.
Executive Employment Agreements
On March 11, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors approved and adopted the terms and provisions of employment agreements for David Phipps, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, and Thomas Seifert, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer.

The 2020 Equity Incentive Plan
On August 21, 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors approved and adopted the Company’s 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”). The purpose of the Plan is to provide a means for the Company to continue to attract, motivate and retain management, key employees, directors and consultants. The Plan provides that up to a maximum of 2,250,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, subject to adjustment, are available for issuance under the Plan. On December 31, 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors approved and adopted an amendment that increases the maximum from 2,250,000 to 4,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. Following the adoption of the Plan, the Board approved issuances of certain stock options to its executives, directors and employees under the Plan. Specifically, the stock options issued to David Phipps, CEO (1,500,000), Thomas Seifert, CFO (250,000) and Hector Delgado, a Board member (50,000), all have an exercise price of $0.25 per share, respectively, fully vest upon issuance and expire on December 30, 2030. In addition, the Board approved additional 850,000 stock options to the Company’s 6 key employees and consultants, on the same terms as those issued to the Company’s officers and director.
December 2020 Financing
On December 1, 2020, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the “December 2020 NPA”) by and among the Company and certain lenders set forth on the lender schedule to the December 2020 NPA (the “Lenders”). Pursuant to the terms of the December 2020 NPA, the Company sold an aggregate principal amount of $244,000 of its convertible promissory notes (the “December 2020 Notes”). The December 2020 Notes are general, unsecured obligations of the Company and bear simple interest at a rate of 6% per annum, and mature on the third anniversary of the date of issuance (the “Maturity Date”), to the extent that the December 2020 Notes and the principal amounts and any interest accrued thereunder have not been converted into shares of the Company’s common stock. In the event that any amount due under the December 2020 Notes is not paid as and when due, such amounts will accrue interest at the rate of 12% per year, simple interest, non-compounding, until paid. The Company may not pre-pay or redeem the December 2020 Notes other than as required by the Agreement. The December 2020 Note holders have an optional right of conversion such that a Noteholder may elect to convert his December 2020 Note, in whole or in part, outstanding as of such time, into the number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of the Company’s common stock as determined by dividing the outstanding indebtedness by $0.25, subject to certain adjustments. This optional right of conversion is subject to a beneficial ownership limitation of 9.99% of the number of shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the share issuance upon conversion. The holders of the December 2020 Notes are granted demand registration rights and pre-emptive rights. In addition, the December 2020 NPA includes customary events of default, including, among others: (i) non-payment of amounts due thereunder, (ii) non-compliance with covenants thereunder, (iii) bankruptcy or insolvency. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, a majority of the Holders may accelerate the maturity of the Indebtedness. The Company used the offering proceeds for business development, investment in increased inventory and other strategic growth initiatives, including market expansion and personnel recruitment.
COVID-19 UK Loan
On April 20, 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company, approved for its wholly owned UK subsidiary, Global Telesat Communications LTD (“GTC”), to apply for a Coronavirus Interruption Loan, offered by the UK government, for an amount up to £250,000. On July 16, 2020 (the “Issue Date”), GTC, entered into a Coronavirus Interruption Loan Agreement (“Debenture”) by and among the Company and HSBC UK Bank PLC (the “Lender”) for an amount of £250,000, or USD$341,625 at an exchange rate of GBP:USD of 1.3665. The Debenture bears interest beginning July 16, 2021, at a rate of 3.99% per annum over the Bank of England Base Rate (0.1% as of July 16, 2020), payable monthly on the outstanding principal amount of the Debenture. The Debenture has a term of 6 years from the date of drawdown, July 15, 2026, the “Maturity Date”. The first repayment of £4,166.67 (exclusive of interest) will be made 13 month(s) after July 16, 2020. Voluntary prepayments are allowed with 5 business days’ written notice and the amount of the prepayment is equal to 10% or more of the Limit or, if less, the balance of the debenture. The Debenture is secured by all GTC’s assets as well as a guarantee by the UK government, with the proceeds of the Debenture are to be used for general corporate and working capital purposes. The Debenture includes customary events of default, including, among others: (i) non-payment of amounts due thereunder, (ii) non-compliance with covenants thereunder, (iii) bankruptcy or insolvency (each, an “Event of Default”). Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Debenture becomes payable upon demand.
Going Concern
The report of our independent registered public accounting firm that accompanies our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 contain a going concern qualification in which such firm expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We had net cash used in operations of $861,981 during the year ended December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $13,878,553, negative working capital of $144,058 and net loss of $2,763,375 during the year ended December 31, 2020. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the issuance of the financial statements. Without additional capital, we will be unable to achieve our business objectives, and may be forced to curtail our operations, reduce headcount, and/or temporarily cease our operations until requisite capital is secured. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible effects on recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from our inability to continue as a going concern.
COVID-19 Update
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) a global pandemic prompting government-imposed quarantines, suspension of in-person attendance of academic programs, and cessation of certain travel and business closures. The United States has entered a recession as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may prolong and exacerbate the negative impact on us. Although we expect the availability of vaccines and various treatments with respect to COVID-19 to have an overall positive impact on business conditions in the aggregate over time, the exact timing of these positive developments is uncertain. In December 2020, the United States began distributing two vaccines that, in addition to other vaccines under development, are expected to help to reduce the spread of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 once they are widely distributed. If the vaccines prove less effective than currently understood by the scientific community and the United States Food and Drug Administration, or if there are problems with the acceptance, availability, timing or other difficulties with widely distributing the vaccines, the pandemic may last longer, and could continue to impact our business for longer, than we currently expect. In response to COVID-19, governmental authorities have implemented numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, prohibitions on group events and gatherings, shutdowns of certain businesses, curfews, shelter in place orders and recommendations to practice social distancing. Although many governmental measures have had specific expiration dates, some of those measures have already been extended more than once, and there is considerable uncertainty regarding the duration of such measures and the implementation of any potential future measures, especially if cases increase across the United States, with the potential for additional challenges resulting from the emergence of new variants of COVID-19, some of which may be more transmissible than the initial strain. Such measures have impacted, and may continue to affect, our workforce, operations, suppliers and customers. We reduced the size of our workforce following the onset of COVID-19 and may need to take additional actions to further reduce the size of our workforce in the future; such reductions incur costs, and we can provide no assurance that we will be able to rehire our workforce in the event our business experiences a subsequent recovery. We took steps to curtail our operating expenses and conserve cash. We may elect or need to take additional remedial measures in the future as the information available to us continues to develop, including with respect to our workforce, relationships with our third-party vendors, and our customers. There is no certainty that the remedial measures we have implemented to date, or any additional remedial steps we may take in the future, will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by COVID-19. Further, such measures could potentially materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and create additional risks for us. Any escalation of COVID-19 cases across many of the markets we serve could have a negative impact on us. Specifically, we could be adversely impacted by limitations on our employees to perform their work due to illness caused by the pandemic or local, state, or federal orders requiring our stores to close or employees to remain at home; limitation of carriers to deliver our product to customers; product shortages; limitations on the ability of our customers to conduct their business and purchase our products and services; and limitations on the ability of our customers to pay us in a timely manner. These events could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
The ultimate magnitude of COVID-19, including the full extent of the material negative impact on our financial and operational results, will depend on future developments, such as the duration and severity of the pandemic, the extent of any additional increases in cases across the United States, and the related length of its impact on the global economy, as well as the timing and availability of effective medical treatments and vaccines, which remain uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. The resumption of our normal business operations may be delayed or constrained by lingering effects of COVID-19 on our customers, suppliers and/or third-party service providers. Furthermore, the extent to which our mitigation efforts are successful, if at all, is not currently ascertainable. Due to the daily evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic and the responses to curb its spread, we cannot predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and results of operations, but our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows have already been materially adversely impacted, and we anticipate they will continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and its negative effects on global economic conditions. Any recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic impact may also be slowed or reversed by a variety of factors, such as any increase in COVID-19 infections. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of its national and, to some extent, global economic impact, including the current recession and any recession that may occur in the future.
The success of our business depends on our global operations, including our supply chain and consumer demand, among other things. As a result of COVID-19, we have experienced shortages in inventory due to manufacturing issues, a reduction in the volume of sales in some parts of our business, such as rental sales and direct website sales, and a reduction in personnel due to lockdown related issues. Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 reflect this impact; however, we expect that this trend may continue and the full extent of the impact is unknown. In recent months, some governmental agencies in the US and Europe, where we produce the largest percentage of our sales, have lifted certain restrictions. However, if customer demand continues to be low, our future equipment sales, subscriber activations and sales margin will be impacted. We have implemented several measures to minimize the impact on our operations and sustain our liquidity position, including receiving support through the US payroll protection program loan (“PPP”), a low interest, fixed rate loan provided under the UK’s Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan (“CBILS”) and the deferral of certain UK taxes. We have also worked with our product suppliers to ensure we will continue to have sufficient inventory levels on hand to meet consumer demand.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s applications of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for our company include accounting for stock-based compensation.
Stock Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of the Share-Based Payment Topic of ASC 718 which requires recognition in the consolidated financial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the period the employee or director is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting period). The ASC also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award.
Pursuant to ASC Topic 718, for share-based payments to consultants and other third-parties, compensation expense is determined at the “measurement date.” The expense is recognized over the vesting period of the award. Until the measurement date is reached, the total amount of compensation expense remains uncertain. The Company initially records compensation expense based on the fair value of the award at the reporting date. Further, ASC Topic 718, provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in Topic 718, such as the repricing of share options, which would revalue those options and the accounting for the cancellation of an equity award whether a replacement award or other valuable consideration is issued in conjunction with the cancellation. If not, the cancellation is viewed as a replacement and not a modification, with a repurchase price of $0.
Use of Estimates
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the statements of financial condition, and revenues and expenses for the years then ended. Actual results may differ significantly from those estimates. Significant estimates made by management include, but are not limited to, the assumptions used to calculate stock-based compensation, derivative liabilities and common stock issued for services.
Effect of Exchange Rate on Results
The Company’s reporting currency is U.S. Dollars. The accounts of one of the Company’s subsidiaries, GTCL, is maintained using the appropriate local currency, Great British Pound, as the functional currency. All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at balance sheet date, shareholders’ equity is translated at historical rates and revenue and expense accounts are translated at the average exchange rate for the year or the reporting period. The translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity, captioned as accumulated other comprehensive (loss) gain. Transaction gains and losses arising from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the statements of operations.
The relevant translation rates are as follows: for the year ended December 31, 2020 closing rate at 1.3665 US$: GBP, yearly average rate at 1.286618 US$: GBP, for the year ended December 31, 2019 closing rate at 1.3262 US$: GBP, yearly average rate at 1.276933 US$: GBP.
GTCL represents 64.1% of total company sales and as such, currency rate variances have an impact on results. For the year ended December 31, 2020 the net effect on revenues were impacted by the differences in exchange rate from yearly average exchange of 1.276933 to 1.286618. Had the yearly average rate remained, sales would have been lower by $35,347. GTCL comparable sales in GBP, its home currency, decreased 8.0% or £251,733, from £3,142,634 to £2,890,901 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019.
GTCL represents 68.4% of total company sales and as such, currency rate variances have an impact on results. For the year ended December 31, 2019 the net effect on revenues were impacted by the differences in exchange rate from yearly average exchange of 1.296229 to 1.276933. Had the yearly average rate remained, sales would have been higher by $156,037. GTCL comparable sales in GBP, its home currency, increased 3.9% or £117,666, from £3,024,967 to £3,142,634 for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018.
Results of Operations
Net Revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, revenues generated were approximately $5,689,796 and $5,869,558, a decrease of $179,762 or 3.1%. Revenues were derived primarily from the sales of satellite phones, locator beacons, GPS trackers, terminals, accessories and additional and recurring airtime plans. Comparable sales for Orbital Satcom Corp. increased 9.9% or $183,531, from $1,856,625 to $2,040,156. Comparable sales for GTCL decreased 9.1% or $363,292, from $4,012,932 to $3,649,640. The overall sales increase is attributable to increased sales through Amazon storefronts and product selections, which constituted 73.3% and 56.9% of our total sales for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Approximately 73.3% of our products are sold on Amazon and are subject to Amazon’s terms of service and various other Amazon seller policies that apply to third parties selling products on Amazon’s marketplace. Amazon’s terms of service provide, among other things, that it may terminate or suspend its agreement with any seller or any of its services being provided to a seller at any time and for any reason. In addition, if Amazon determines that any seller’s actions or performance, including ours, may result in violations of its terms or policies, or create other risks to Amazon or to third parties, then Amazon may in its sole discretion withhold any payments owed for as long as Amazon determines any related risk to Amazon or to third parties persist. Further, if Amazon determines that any seller’s, including our, accounts have been used to engage in deceptive, fraudulent or illegal activity, or that such accounts have repeatedly violated its policies, then Amazon may in its sole discretion permanently withhold any payments owed. In addition, Amazon in its sole discretion may suspend a seller account and product listings if Amazon determines that a seller has engaged in conduct that violates any of its policies. Any limitation or restriction on our ability to sell on Amazon’s platform could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. We also rely on services provided by Amazon’s fulfillment platform which provides for expedited shipping to the consumer, an important aspect in the buying decision for consumers. Any inability to market our products for sale with delivery could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Failure to remain compliant with the fulfillment practices on Amazon’s platform could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
Cost of Sales. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, cost of revenues decreased to $4,464,476 compared to $4,646,180 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $181,704 or 3.9%. We expect our cost of revenues to increase during fiscal 2021 and beyond, as we expand our operations and begin generating additional revenues under our current business. However, we are unable at this time to estimate the amount of the expected increases. Gross profit margins during the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were 21.5% and 20.8%, respectively. The increase in margin was attributable to new product lines with higher margins.
Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $3,259,200, an increase of $924,494, or 39.6%, from total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019, of $2,334,706.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $694,361 and $761,237 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, representing a decrease of $66,875 or 8.8%. The decrease is primarily attributable to a 2019 impairment of research and development for $50,000 for the Company’s impairment of its investment on February 19, 2015, for its dual mode tracker, which it has yet to launch. Additionally, there was a decrease in travel between the Company’s offices in the UK to US directly associated with US and UK government lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We anticipate that travel expenses will increase after the COVID-19 travel restrictions are lifted.
Salaries, wages and payroll taxes were $769,391 and $732,498 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, representing an increase of $36,893, or 5.0%. The increase was attributable to an increase in personnel.
Stock based compensation for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were non-cash expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded $830,900 and $0 for stock-based compensation. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the expense was for the issuance of 2,752,000 fully vested options to purchase shares of the Company’s stock to management and a director with an average exercise price of $0.24.
Professional fees were $669,622 and $565,643 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, representing an increase of $103,979 or 18.4%. The increase was primarily due to the issuance of 30,000 shares of the Company’s stock to consultants valued at $74,000, a decrease of legal expenses of $26,770, an increase of investor relations fees of $17,500 and a decrease in accounting fees of $21,205 and a reduction of public company expense of $8,564.
Depreciation and amortization expenses were $294,926 and $275,328 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, representing an increase of $19,598, or 7.1%. The increase was attributable to depreciation associated to the company’s investment in updating Company websites.
We expect our expenses in each of these areas to continue to increase during fiscal 2021 and beyond as we expand our operations and begin generating additional revenues under our current business. However, we are unable at this time to estimate the amount of the expected increases.
Total Other (Income) Expense. Our total other expenses were $729,495 and $267,681 during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 respectively, representing an increase of $461,813 or 173.0%. The increase was attributable to the Company’s increase in interest expense of $728,529, which is primarily due to an increase in notes payable and convertible debt offset by a decrease of $69,677 in the fair value of derivative instruments related to convertible debt and increases of $134,584 in gain on the extinguishment of debt and $38,355 in exchange rate variances.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Since inception we have incurred and continue to incur significant losses from operations. Historically, we have financed our operations through various financings. If we continue to incur negative cash flow from sources of operating activities for longer than expected, our ability to continue as a going concern could be in substantial doubt and we will require additional funds through debt facilities, and/or public or private equity or debt financings to continue operations. The Company is working to secure financing to continue to support the Company’s businesses and meet all of its financial obligations. The Company can provide no assurance as to the successful conclusion of the financing. Furthermore, the Company is aggressively looking to reduce costs of its operations as well as eliminating certain corporate overhead expenses to maximize income. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to obtain the capital we require on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us. Without additional capital, we will be unable to achieve our business objectives, and may be forced to curtail our operations, reduce headcount, and/or temporarily cease our operations until requisite capital is secured.
Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. At December 31, 2020, we had a cash balance of $728,762 and negative working capital is approximately $144,058. We reported a net increase in cash for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019 of $653,400 primarily as a result of net cash proceeds received from payroll protection loans, UK COVID-19 loans and convertible debt, offset by the use of cash in operations.
We do not believe that our existing working capital and our future cash flows from operating activities will provide sufficient cash to enable us to meet our operating needs and debt requirements for the next twelve months.
