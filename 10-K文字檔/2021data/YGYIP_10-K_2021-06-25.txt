Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operation should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Where possible, we have tried to identify these forward-looking statements by using words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “intends,” or similar expressions. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements due to important factors and risks including, but not limited to, those set forth under “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report. All share and per share numbers reflect the one-for-twenty reverse stock split that we effected on June 5, 2017.
Overview
At December 31, 2019, we operated in three segments: (i) the direct selling segment, where products are offered through a global distribution network of preferred customers and distributors, (ii) the commercial coffee segment, where products are sold directly to businesses, the distribution of processed green coffee beans and provides milling services for unprocessed green coffee beans, and (iii) the commercial hemp segment, where we manufacture proprietary systems to provide end-to-end extraction and processing that allow for the conversion of hemp feed stock into hemp oil and hemp extracts. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we derived approximately 86.1% of our revenue from direct sales, approximately 13.3% of our revenue from our commercial coffee sales and approximately 0.6% of our revenue from our commercial hemp business. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we derived approximately 85.5% of our revenue from direct sales and approximately 14.5% of our revenue from our commercial coffee sales.
In the direct selling segment, we sell health and wellness, beauty product and skin care, scrap booking and story booking items, packaged food products, other service-based products on a global basis and more recently our Hemp FX™ hemp-derived CBD product line and offer a wide range of products through an international direct selling network. Our direct sales are made through our network, which is a web-based global network of customers and distributors. Our independent sales force markets a variety of products to an array of customers, through friend-to-friend marketing and social networking. We consider our company to be an e-commerce company whereby personal interaction is provided to customers by our independent sales network. Initially, our focus was solely on the sale of products in the health, beauty and home care market through our marketing network; however, we have since expanded our selling efforts to include a variety of other products in other markets. Our direct selling segment offers approximately 5,500 products to support a healthy lifestyle.
We have expanded our operations through a series of acquisitions of the assets of other direct selling companies including their product lines and sales forces. We have also substantially expanded our distributor base by merging the assets that we have acquired under our web-based independent distributor network, as well as providing our distributors with additional new products to add to their product offerings.
We also engage in the commercial sale of roasted coffee products, the distribution of green coffee beans and provide milling services, through CLR. CLR sells roasted and unroasted coffee and produces coffee under its own Café La Rica brand, Josie’s Java House brand and Javalution brands. CLR also produces and sells coffee under a variety of private labels through major national sales outlets and major customers including cruise lines and office coffee service operators, as well as through our direct selling business. CLR acquired the Siles in 2014, a coffee plantation and dry-processing facility located in Matagalpa, Nicaragua, an ideal coffee growing region that is historically known for high quality coffee production. The dry-processing facility is approximately 26 acres and the plantation is approximately 500 acres and produces 100 percent Arabica coffee beans that are shade grown, Rainforest Alliance Certified™ and Fair Trade Certified™. The plantation, dry-processing facility and existing U.S. based coffee roaster facilities allows CLR to control the coffee production process from field-to-cup.
In the commercial hemp segment, we are a manufacturer of commercial hemp-based CBD extraction and post-processing equipment, and end-to-end processor of CBD isolate, distillate, water soluble isolate and water-soluble distillate. We develop, manufacture and sell equipment and related services to customers which enable them to extract CBD oils from hemp stock. We provide hemp growers, feedstock suppliers, and CBD crude oil producers the use of equipment, intellectual capital, production consultancy, tolling services, and wholesale CBD channel sales capabilities. We are also engaged in hemp-based CBD extraction technology including tolling processing which converts hemp biomass to hemp extracts such as CBD oil, distillate and isolate. We offer customers turnkey manufacturing solutions in extraction services and end-to-end processing systems. In addition, we own a laboratory testing facility that provides us with a broad range of capabilities in regard to formulation, quality control, and testing standards with our CBD products, including potency analysis for our supply partners of hemp derived CBD products.
We conduct our operations primarily in the U.S. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, approximately 15% and 14%, respectively, of our revenues were derived from sales outside the U.S.
Overview of Significant Events
Public Offering. Between September and December 2019, we closed two tranches of our Series D offering, pursuant to which we issued and sold a total of 578,898 shares of our 9.75% Series D preferred stock at a weighted average price to the public of $24.05 per share, less underwriting discounts and commissions, pursuant to the terms of the underwriting agreement that we entered into with the Benchmark Company, LLC (“Benchmark”) as representative of the several underwriters. The 578,898 shares of Series D preferred stock that were sold included 43,500 shares sold pursuant to the overallotment option that we granted to the underwriters that was exercised in full. In January 2020, the Company issued an additional 11,375 shares of Series D preferred stock upon the partial exercise by the underwriters.
The Series D preferred stock was approved for listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “YGYIP,” and had commenced trading on Nasdaq September 20, 2019. The net proceeds from this offering were approximately $12,269,000 after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses which were paid by us. Trading in the Series D preferred stock was suspended on Nasdaq on November 20, 2020, and on February 2, 2021, the Series D preferred stock was removed from listing on Nasdaq, effective at the opening of the trading session on February 12, 2021. Our Series D preferred stock is now traded on OTC Pink market under the same symbol YGYIP.
Stock Offerings. In February 2019, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with one accredited investor that had a substantial pre-existing relationship with us pursuant to which we sold 250,000 shares of our common stock at an offering price of $7.00 per share. Pursuant to the purchase agreement, we also issued to the investor a three-year warrant to purchase 250,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $7.00. We received proceeds of $1,750,000 from the stock offering. Consulting fees for arranging the purchase agreement include the issuance of 5,000 shares of restricted shares of our common stock and a three-year warrant priced at $10.00 per share convertible into 100,000 shares of the Company’s common stock upon exercise. (See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.)
In June 2019, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with one accredited investor that had a substantial pre-existing relationship with us pursuant to which we sold 250,000 shares of common stock at an offering price of $5.50 per share. We received proceeds of $1,375,000 from the stock offering. (See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.)
At-the-Market Equity Offering Program. In January 2019, we entered into an at-the-market offering agreement (the “ATM agreement”) with Benchmark pursuant to which we may sell from time to time, at our option, shares of our common stock through Benchmark, as sales agent, for the sale of up to $60,000,000 of shares of our common stock. We are not obligated to make any sales of common stock under the ATM agreement and we cannot provide any assurances that we will issue any shares pursuant to the ATM agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we received approximately $102,000 from the sale of 17,524 shares of common stock under the ATM agreement. We are not currently eligible to register the offer and sale of our securities using a registration statement on Form S-3 and therefore cannot make sales under the ATM agreement until such time as we once again become S-3 eligible.
Convertible Notes. Between February and July 2019, we closed five tranches related to the January 2019 private placement debt offering, pursuant to which we offered for sale up to $10,000,000 in principal amount of notes (the “2019 PIPE Notes”), with each investor receiving 2,000 shares of common stock for each $100,000 invested. We entered into subscription agreements with thirty-one accredited investors that had a substantial pre-existing relationship with us pursuant to which we received aggregate gross proceeds of $3,090,000 and issued 2019 PIPE Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $3,090,000 and an aggregate of 61,800 shares of common stock. The placement agent received 15,450 shares of common stock for the closed tranches as compensation. Each 2019 PIPE Note matures 24 months after issuance, bears interest at a rate of 6.00% per annum, and the outstanding principal is convertible into shares of common stock at any time after the 180th day anniversary of the issuance of the 2019 PIPE Notes, at a conversion price of $10.00 per share, subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassification of the common stock. The 2019 PIPE Notes are secured by all equity in KII. (See Note 7 & Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.)
Promissory Notes. In March 2019, we entered into a two-year secured promissory note with two accredited investors with whom we had a substantial pre-existing relationship with and from whom we raised cash proceeds in the aggregate of $2,000,000. The promissory notes are secured by all equity in KII. In consideration of the promissory notes, we issued 20,000 shares of our common stock for each $1,000,000 invested as well as for each $1,000,000 invested five-year warrants to purchase 20,000 shares of our common stock at a price per share of $6.00. The promissory notes pay interest at a rate of 8.00% per annum and interest is paid quarterly in arrears with all principal and unpaid interest due at maturity on March 18, 2021. We issued in the aggregate 40,000 shares of common stock and 40,000 warrants with the Notes. (See Note 6 & Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.)
In March 2020, we closed the initial tranche related to our March 2020 private placement debt offering, pursuant to offering up to an aggregate of $5,000,000 in principal amount together with up to 250,000 shares of common stock with each investor receiving 50,000 shares of common stock for each $1,000,000 invested. On March 20, 2020, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) with one accredited investor with whom we had a substantial pre-existing relationship, pursuant to which we issued a note in the principal amount of $1,000,000, due December 31, 2020. The note matures 9 months after issuance and bears interest at a rate of 18% per annum. In addition, we issued 50,000 shares of our common stock in connection with this Note. (See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.)
Small Business Administration - Paycheck Protection Program Loan. In April 2020, our three segments participated in the recent “The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”)”, and the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”) due to losses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. We received cash in the aggregate of $3,763,295 from qualified Small Business Administrators (“SBA”) lenders. In addition, under the SBA loans, our Direct Selling segment qualified for mortgage assistance, whereby our corporate office’s mortgage has been paid directly from the SBA lenders. We qualified for the mortgage payment program for a period of six months. As of June 30, 2020, the SBA has paid approximately $50,000 directly to our mortgage holder. On November 5, 2020, KII received relief of $622,500 related its loan. On April 21, 2021, CLR received a second PPP loan in the amount of $632,895, payable within 60 months if relief for the loan is not granted.
We are in communication with the SBA lenders in regard to the potential liability we will incur (if any) in respect for repayment of the loans and consideration of any portion of loans forgiveness of the debt.
H&H transactions
Mill Construction Agreement
In January 2019, to accommodate CLR's green coffee purchase contract, CLR entered into an agreement with H&H and H&H Export, Mr. Hernandez and Ms. Orozco, collectively referred to as the Nicaraguan Partner, pursuant to which the Nicaraguan Partner agreed to transfer the Matagalpa Property to be owned 50% by the Nicaraguan Partner and 50% by CLR. In consideration for the land acquisition we issued to H&H Export, 153,846 shares of common stock. The fair value of the shares issued was $1,200,000 and was based on the stock price on the date of issuance of the shares. In addition, the Nicaraguan Partner and CLR agreed to contribute $4,700,000 each toward construction of a processing plant, office, and storage facilities on the Matagalpa Property for processing coffee in Nicaragua. The addition of the mill will accommodate CLR’s green coffee contract commitments. For the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, CLR made payments of $2,150,000 and $900,000, respectively, towards the Matagalpa Mill project. At December 31, 2019, CLR contributed a total of $3,050,000 towards the Matagalpa Mill project, in addition $391,117 was paid for operating equipment and the Nicaraguan Partner contributed a total of $1,922,000. CLR’s remaining portion of $1,650,000 was paid during 2020, including an additional $912,606 related to operating equipment. As of the date of this filing, the Matagalpa Mill is in construction and was not ready for full operations.
In January 2019, we issued 295,910 shares of our common stock to H&H Export to pay for certain working capital, construction and other payables. In connection with the issuance, we over issued 121,649 shares of common stock, resulting in the net issuance of common stock to settle payables of 174,261 shares. H&H Export agreed to reimburse CLR for the over issuance of the 121,649 shares of common stock in cash. At December 31, 2019, the value of the shares was approximately $397,000 based on the stock price at December 31, 2019. Management has reviewed the amount due and in conjunction with the impact of the underlying COVID crisis and has determined that the receivable balance of $397,000, was more than likely to be uncollected as of December 31, 2019, and therefore the full amount was recognized as an allowance for collectability at the end of December 31, 2019. (See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements under “Other Related Party Transactions” for further discussion related to H&H Export.)
H&H Advance
In December 2018, CLR advanced $5,000,000 to H&H Export to provide services in support of a five-year contract for the sale and processing of 41 million pounds of green coffee beans on an annual basis. The services include providing hedging and financing opportunities to producers and delivering harvested coffee to CLR’s mills. In March 2019, this advance was converted to a $5,000,000 loan agreement as a note receivable and bears interest at 9.00% per annum and is due and payable by H&H Export at the end of each year’s harvest season, but no later than October 31 for any harvest year. In October 2019, CLR and H&H Export amended the March 2019 agreement in terms of the maturity date such that all outstanding principal and interest is due and payable at the end of the 2020 harvest (or when the 2020 season’s harvest was exported and collected), but never to be later than November 30, 2020. Management reviewed the security against the loan and the impact of the underlying COVID crisis and determined that the full amount of the note receivable including interest of approximately $5,340,000, was not collected as of December 31, 2020, and therefore $5,340,000 was recognized as an allowance for collectability at the end of December 31, 2019. (See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements under “Other Related Party Transactions” for further discussion related to H&H Export.)
Amendment to Operating and Profit-Sharing Agreement
In January 2019, CLR entered into an amendment to the March 2014 operating and profit-sharing agreement with the owners of H&H Export. In addition, CLR and H&H Export, Mr. Hernandez and Ms. Orozco have restructured their profit-sharing agreement in regard to profits from green coffee sales and processing that increased CLR’s profit participation by an additional 25%. Under the new terms of the agreement with respect to profit generated from green coffee sales and processed from La Pita, a leased mill, or the Matagalpa Mill, now will provide for a split of profits of 75% to CLR and 25% to the Nicaraguan Partner, after certain conditions are met. In addition, H&H Export has sold to CLR its espresso brand Café Cachita in consideration of the issuance of 100,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. The shares of common stock issued were valued at $7.50 per share. Profit-sharing expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $1,060,000 compared to a profit-sharing benefit of $910,000 in the same period last year, which is recorded in accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets at each respective year.
Joint Venture Agreement in Nicaragua for Hemp Processing Center between the CLR and KII and Nicaraguan partner
On April 20 and July 29, 2020, CLR and KII (the “U.S. Partners”) entered into agreements (“Hemp Joint Venture Agreement”) with H&H Export and Fitracomex, Inc. (“Fitracomex”) (collectively “The Nicaraguan Partners”) and established the Hemp Joint Venture (the “Nicaraguan Hemp Grow and Extractions Group” or the “Hemp Joint Venture”).
The agreement calls for H&H Export to contribute the 2,200-acre Chaguitillo Farms in Sebaco-Matagalpa, Nicaragua which will be owned by H&H Export and the U.S. Partners on a 50/50 basis separate from the Hemp Joint Venture.
The agreement calls for Nicaraguan Partners to contribute the excavation and preparation for hemp growth of the 2,200 acres, installation of electrical service, and the construction of 45,000 square feet of buildings to be used for office, processing, storage, drying and green house space.
The U.S. Partners will contribute all the necessary extraction equipment to convert hemp to crude oil and will also provide the feminized hemp seeds for the pilot grow program, along with their expertise in the hemp business. The U.S. Partners will also provide all necessary working capital as required.
Additionally, we agreed, subject to the approval of The Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) to issue 1,500,000 shares of our restricted common stock, $0.001 par value, to Fitracomex. In accordance with the Hemp Joint Venture Agreement, in July 2020 we issued to Fitracomex the agreed upon shares of restricted common stock. We also agreed to issue warrants to Fitracomex for the purchase 5,000,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of US $1.50, exercisable for a term of five (5) years after completion of the construction and upon the approval by our stockholders of the proposed issuance. In addition, we agreed to use our best efforts to register the resale of the shares of our common stock issued to Fitracomex under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and make any necessary applications with Nasdaq to list the shares.
The U.S. Partners and H&H Export will serve as the managing partners with all business decisions will require prior consent and agreement of both parties. The Net Profits and Net Losses for each fiscal period shall be allocated among the partners as follows: twenty five percent (25%) to the Nicaraguan Partners and seventy five percent (75%) to the U.S. Partners.
Acquisitions During the Years Ended 2019 and 2018
In November 2019, we acquired certain assets of BeneYOU. BeneYOU is a nutritional and beauty product company that brings customers and distributors of brands of Jamberry which offers a line of nail products, the brand Avisae which focuses on gut health and the brand M.Global which delivers hydration products. (See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.)
In February 2019, KII acquired substantially all the assets of Khrysos Global and all the outstanding equity of INXL and INXH. The collective business manufactures proprietary systems to provide end-to-end extraction and processing that allow for the conversion of hemp feed stock into hemp oil and hemp extracts. (See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.)
In March 2018, we acquired certain assets of ViaViente. ViaViente is the distributor of The ViaViente Miracle, a highly concentrated, energizing whole fruit puree blend that is rich in antioxidants and naturally occurring vitamins and minerals. (See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.)
In February 2018, we acquired certain assets and certain liabilities of Nature Direct. Nature Direct, is a manufacturer and distributor of essential oil based nontoxic cleaning and care products for personal, home and professional use. (See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.)
Going Concern
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared and presented on a basis assuming we will continue as a going concern. At December 31, 2019, we had a significant accumulated deficit and we have experienced significant losses and incurred negative cash flows for the last few years. Net cash used in operating activities was $14,337,000 and $12,352,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $4,463,000 at December 31, 2019. We do not currently believe that our existing cash resources are sufficient to meet our anticipated needs over the next twelve months from the date hereof. Based on our current cash levels and our current rate of cash requirements, we will need to raise additional capital and/or will need to further reduce our expenses from current levels. Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued a report that includes an explanatory paragraph referring to our recurring losses from operations (anticipated continued losses in the future) and net capital deficiency that raise substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern without additional capital becoming available.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates; including those related to collection of receivables, inventory obsolescence, sales returns and non-monetary transactions such as stock and stock options issued for services, deferred taxes and related valuation allowances, fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations, asset impairments, useful lives of property, equipment and intangible assets and value of contingent acquisition debt. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue from product sales when the following five steps are completed: i) Identify the contract with the customer; ii) Identify the performance obligations in the contract; iii) Determine the transaction price; iv) Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and v) Recognize revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied. (See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.)
We ship the majority of our direct selling segment products directly to the distributors primarily via UPS, USPS or FedEx and receives substantially all payments for these sales in the form of credit card transactions. We regularly monitor our use of credit card or merchant services to ensure that its financial risk related to credit quality and credit concentrations is actively managed. Revenue is recognized upon passage of title and risk of loss to customers when product is shipped from the fulfillment facility. We ship the majority of our commercial coffee segment and commercial hemp segment products via common carrier and invoice our customers for the products. Revenue is recognized when the title and risk of loss is passed to the customer under the terms of the shipping arrangement, typically, FOB shipping point. In addition, our commercial coffee segment records revenue at net for providing milling services of green coffee beans at the CLR mill. Our commercial hemp segment records revenue also related to lab testing services which are billed upon release of results or delivery of product.
Sales revenue and a reserve for estimated returns are recorded net of sales tax.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Certain of our financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventories, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and deferred revenue are carried at cost, which is considered to be representative of their respective fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. Our notes payable and derivative liabilities are carried at estimated fair value. (See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.)
Derivative Financial Instruments
We do not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market or foreign currency.
We review the terms of convertible debt and equity instruments we issue to determine whether there are derivative instruments, including an embedded conversion option that is required to be bifurcated and accounted for separately as a derivative financial instrument. In circumstances where a host instrument contains more than one embedded derivative instrument, including a conversion option, that is required to be bifurcated, the bifurcated derivative instruments are accounted for as a single, compound derivative instrument. Also, in connection with the sale of convertible debt and equity instruments, we may issue freestanding warrants that may, depending on their terms, be accounted for as derivative instrument liabilities, rather than as equity.
Derivative instruments are initially recorded at fair value and are then revalued at each reporting date with changes in the fair value reported as non-operating income or expense. When the convertible debt or equity instruments contain embedded derivative instruments that are to be bifurcated and accounted for as liabilities, the total proceeds allocated to the convertible host instruments are first allocated to the fair value of all the bifurcated derivative instruments. The remaining proceeds, if any, are then allocated to the convertible instruments themselves, usually resulting in those instruments being recorded at a discount from their face value. (See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.)
The discount from the face value of the convertible debt, together with the stated interest on the instrument, is amortized over the life of the instrument through periodic charges to interest expense, using the effective interest method.
Inventory and Cost of Revenues
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method. We record an inventory reserve for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon historical turnover, market conditions and assumptions about future demand for its products. When applicable, expiration dates of certain inventory items with a definite life are taken into consideration.
Cost of revenues includes the cost of inventory, shipping and handling costs incurred in connection with shipments to customers, direct labor and benefits costs, royalties associated with certain products, transaction merchant fees and depreciation on certain assets.
Operating and Financing Leases
The Company leases certain office space, warehouses, distribution centers, manufacturing centers, and equipment. A contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment (an identified asset) for a period of time in exchange for consideration.
In general, the Company’s leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that generally vary from one to ten years. The exercise of lease renewal options is generally at the Company’s sole discretion. The depreciable life of assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term, unless there is a transfer of title or purchase option reasonably certain of exercise.
The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Leases with an initial term of twelve months or less are not recorded on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, and the Company does not separate non-lease components from lease components. Lease cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Finance lease right-of-use assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, as the Company does believe that it is reasonably certain that options which transfer ownership will be exercised. In general, for the majority of the Company’s material leases, the renewal options are not included in the calculation of its right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, as the Company does not believe that it is reasonably certain that these renewal options will be exercised. Periodically, the Company assesses its leases to determine whether it is reasonably certain that these options and any renewal options could be reasonably expected to be exercised.
The majority of the Company’s leases are for real estate and equipment. In general, the individual lease contracts do not provide information about the rate implicit in the lease. Because the Company is not able to determine the rate implicit in its leases, it instead generally uses its incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of lease liabilities. In determining its incremental borrowing rate, the Company reviewed the terms of its leases, its senior secured credit facility, swap rates, and other factors.
Business Combinations
We account for business combinations under the acquisition method and allocate the total purchase price for acquired businesses to the tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair values. When a business combination includes the exchange of our common stock, the value of the common stock is determined using the closing market price at the date such shares were tendered to the selling parties. The fair values assigned to tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management or third-party estimates and assumptions that utilize established valuation techniques appropriate for our industry and each acquired business. Goodwill is recorded as the excess, if any, of the aggregate fair value of consideration exchanged for an acquired business over the fair value (measured at the acquisition date) of total net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired. A liability for contingent consideration, if applicable, is recorded at fair value at the acquisition date. In determining the fair value of such contingent consideration, management estimates the amount to be paid based on probable outcomes and expectations on financial performance of the related acquired business. The fair value of contingent consideration is reassessed quarterly, with any change in the estimated value charged to operations in the period of the change. Increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations can result from changes in actual or estimated revenue streams, discount periods, discount rates, and probabilities that contingencies will be met.
Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets, including property and equipment and definite lived intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Costs incurred to renew or extend the life of a long-lived asset are reviewed for capitalization. All finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the pattern in which the estimated economic benefits of the assets are realized, over their estimated useful lives. We evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their net book value may not be recoverable. We first consider whether indicators of impairment are present. If indicators are present, we perform a recoverability test by comparing the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset (group) in question to its carrying amount (as a reminder, entities cannot record an impairment for a held and used asset unless the asset first fails this recoverability test). If the undiscounted cash flows used in the test for recoverability are less than the long-lived assets (group’s) carrying amount, we then determine the fair value of the long- lived asset (group) and recognize an impairment loss, if any, if the carrying amount of the long-lived asset (group) exceeds its fair value. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a loss on impairment of intangible assets related to our acquisitions of BeautiControl, Inc. and Future Global Vision, Inc. and recorded a loss on impairment of intangible assets of approximately $2,550,000 and $625,000, respectively. While these charges had no impact on our business operations, cash balances or operating cash flows, they resulted in significant losses during the reporting periods. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we determined that there were indicators of impairment present for long-lived assets related to our commercial hemp segment, as result a test for recoverability concluded that the carrying amount of the long-lived asset (group) did not exceed its fair value. As a result, we recorded a loss on impairment of intangible assets related to our acquisition of Khrysos Global of approximately $8,461,000. (See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.)
Goodwill
Goodwill is recorded as the excess, if any, of the aggregate fair value of consideration exchanged for an acquired business over the fair value (measured at the acquisition date) of total net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. We first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If the qualitative assessment determines it is necessary, we will perform a quantitative impairment test shall be used to identify goodwill impairment and measure the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized (if any). We determined no impairment of our goodwill occurred for the year ended December 31, 2018.
At the end of 2019 the qualitative testing determined that a quantitative test was not required for our direct selling segment and our commercial coffee segment. The quantitative testing for our commercial hemp segment led us recognizing a loss on impairment of goodwill of $6,831,000.
Stock-based Compensation
We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Board ("ASC") Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, which establishes accounting for equity instruments exchanged for employee services. Under such provisions, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the calculated fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense, under the straight-line method, over the vesting period of the equity grant. Forfeitures are recorded as they occur. The Company uses the Black-Scholes to estimate the fair value of stock options. The use of a valuation model requires the Company to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected volatility is calculated based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock price over the expected term of the option. The expected life is based on the contractual life of the option and expected employee exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of the grant.
Income Taxes
We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method which includes the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements. Under this approach, deferred taxes are recorded for the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial statement and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. The effects of future changes in income tax laws or rates are not anticipated.
Results of Operations
Year ended December 31, 2019 compared to year ended December 31,
Revenues
For the year ended December 31, 2019, our revenues decreased approximately $15,003,000 to $147,442,000 as compared $162,445,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we derived 86.1% of our revenues from our direct sales, 13.3% of revenues from our commercial coffee sales and 0.6% of our revenues from our commercial hemp sales. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we derived 85.5% of our revenues from our direct sales and 14.5% of our revenues from our commercial coffee sales.
Revenues in the direct selling segment decreased by approximately $11,844,000 to $127,011,000 as compared to $138,855,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was attributed to a decrease of $14,255,000 in revenues from existing business, partially offset by revenues from new acquisitions of $2,411,000. The decrease in existing business was primarily due to a decline in the number of ordering preferred customers, partially offset by an increase in distributor revenues.
Revenues in the commercial coffee segment decreased by approximately $4,046,000 to $19,544,000 as compared to $23,590,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was attributed to a decrease in our green coffee business of $4,819,000 primarily driven by the shift in revenue away from green coffee sales to revenues related to mill processing services that were partially offset by increased revenues of $773,000 from our roasted coffee business. For the year ended December 31, 2019, CLR recorded revenues from green coffee milling and processing services of $6,416,000 to H&H Export; with the related green coffee to be resold by H&H Export. Additionally, we recorded revenue from the sale of processed green coffee of $1,046,000.
CLR recorded net revenues from processed green coffee of approximately $12,281,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018, of which $3,938,000 was to H&H Export, to be resold by H&H Export. Revenues in roasted coffee increased 6.8% to $12,082,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Revenue in the commercial hemp segment from our Khrysos Global acquisition were approximately $887,000.
The following table summarizes our revenue by segment (in thousands):

Cost of Revenues
For the year ended December 31, 2019, cost of revenues decreased approximately $13,931,000 or 20.7% to $53,482,000 as compared to $67,413,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Cost of revenues in the direct selling segment decreased by approximately $3,094,000 or 7.0% to $40,851,000 when compared to the same period last year, primarily due to the decrease in revenues discussed above, partially offset by an increase in inventory adjustments to increase the inventory reserve.
Cost of revenues in the commercial coffee segment decreased by approximately $12,132,000 or 51.7% to $11,336,000 when compared to the same period last year, primarily due to the shift in revenue to milling and processing services for 2019 when compared to 2018. As revenue for milling services does not contain a cost of goods sold component, this shift in revenue from green coffee processed sales to milling and processing services lowers our cost of revenue. Cost of revenues for processed green coffee the year ended December 31, 2019 was credit of $754,000 as a result of a pricing adjustment related to a price per pound settlement. During the year ended December 31, 2018, cost of revenues for processed green coffee sales were $11,747,000. Cost of revenues for roasted coffee sales the year ended December 31, 2019 increased 3.1% to approximately $12,090,000 compared to $11,721,000 during the year ended December 31, 2018.
Cost of revenues in the commercial hemp segment from our Khrysos Global acquisition was approximately $1,295,000.
Gross Profit (Loss)
For the year ended December 31, 2019, gross profit decreased approximately $1,072,000 or 1.1% to $93,960,000 as compared to $95,032,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to 63.7% compared to 58.5% in the same period last year.
Gross profit in the direct selling segment decreased by approximately $8,750,000 or 9.2% to $86,160,000 when compared to the same period last year, primarily as a result of the decrease in revenues discussed above and the increase in inventory adjustments to increase the inventory reserve. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues in the direct selling segment decreased to 67.8% compared to 68.4% in the same period last year.
Gross profit in the commercial coffee segment increased by approximately $8,086,000 to $8,208,000 when compared to the same period last year. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues in the commercial coffee segment increased to 42.0% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 0.5% in the same period last year. The increase in gross profit in the commercial coffee segment was primarily due to the overall increase in the processing and milling of unprocessed green coffee that in turn drove higher gross profits from the combination of processed green coffee sales and revenues on milling and processing services during the year ended December 31, 2019, offset by the gross loss in the roasted coffee. Gross profit from the sales of processed green coffee was $1,800,000 and $534,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Gross profits from milling and processing services was $6,416,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recognized a loss related to roasted coffee of $8,000 and $412,000, respectively.
Gross loss in the commercial hemp segment from our Khrysos Global acquisition was approximately $408,000. Gross loss as a percentage of revenues in the commercial hemp segment was 46.0%.

Percentages denoted as N/A do not contain prior period comparatives
Operating Expenses
For the year ended December 31, 2019, our operating expenses increased by approximately $50,078,000 or 51.3% to $147,747,000 as compared to $97,669,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase included $12,892,000 in stock and equity-based compensation expense that was recorded in the first quarter of 2019 for options granted that were fully vested at the time of issuance when compared to the prior year that did not have such grants. Excluding the effect of stock and equity-based compensation expense in the first quarter of 2019, operating expenses would have increased by 35.1%.
Distributor Compensation
For the year ended December 31, 2019, the distributor compensation paid to our independent distributors in the direct selling segment decreased by approximately $4,599,000 or 7.5% to $56,488,000 as compared to $61,087,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in revenues. Distributor compensation as a percentage of direct selling revenues increased to 44.5% as compared to 44.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Sales and Marketing
For the year ended December 31, 2019, the sales and marketing expense increased by approximately $769,000 or 5.7% to $14,167,000 as compared to $13,398,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase included $471,000 in stock and equity-based compensation expense that was recorded in the first quarter of 2019 for options granted that were fully vested at the time of issuance when compared to the prior year that did not have such grants. Excluding the effect of stock and equity-based compensation expense in the first quarter of 2019, sales and marketing expense would have increased by 2.2%.
Sales and marketing expenses in the direct selling segment increased by approximately $363,000 or 2.9% to $12,823,000 as compared to $12,460,000 for the same period last year. The increase included $471,000 in stock and equity-based compensation expense that was recorded in the first quarter of 2019 for options granted that were fully vested at the time of issuance when compared to the prior year that did not have such grants. Excluding the effect of stock and equity-based compensation expense in the first quarter of 2019, sales and marketing expense in the direct selling segment would have decreased by 0.9%.
Sales and marketing expenses in the commercial coffee segment increased by approximately $180,000 or 19.2% to $1,118,000 as compared to $938,000 for the same period last year, primarily due to increased advertising costs and compensation expense.
Sales and marketing expenses in the commercial hemp segment were approximately $226,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
General and Administrative
For the year ended December 31, 2019, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $39,616,000 or 208.9% to $61,800,000 from $20,009,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase included $12,421,000 in stock and equity-based compensation expense that was recorded in the first quarter of 2019. Excluding the effect of this stock and equity-based compensation expense in the first quarter of 2019, general and administrative expense would have increased by 146.8%.
General and administrative expenses in the direct selling segment increased approximately $20,226,000 or 122.9 to $36,680,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $16,454,000 for the same period last year. These increases were primarily the result of increases in accounting and computer consulting costs and costs associated with the contingent liability revaluation of $6,937,000. Other increases included $10,996,000 in stock and equity-based compensation expense that was recorded in the first quarter of 2019 for options granted that were fully vested at the time of issuance when compared to the prior year that did not have such grants. Excluding the effect of stock and equity-based compensation expense in the first quarter of 2019, general and administrative expenses in the direct selling segment would have increased by 56.1%. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the contingent debt revaluation adjustment included gains of $2,520,000 related to the revaluation our acquisition of BeautiControl, Inc. and $1,246,000 related to the elimination of the contingent liability associated with our acquisition of Nature’s Pearl Corporation due to breach of the asset purchase agreement by the seller.
General and administrative expenses in the commercial coffee segment increased by approximately $17,469,000 or 491.4% to $21,024,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $3,555,000 for the same period last year. This increase included $1,425,000 in stock and equity-based compensation expense that was recorded in the first quarter of 2019. Excluding the effect of stock and equity-based compensation expense recorded in the first quarter of 2019, general and administration expense in the commercial coffee segment would have increased by 451.3%. Also contributing was the increase in profit-sharing expense of $1,970,000 as well as higher wages and warehouse storage costs in 2019 compared to the same period last year.
At December 31, 2019 CLR's accounts receivable balance for customer related revenue by H&H Export were approximately $8,707,000, of which the full amount was past due at December 31, 2019. As a result, the Company has reserved $7,871,000 as bad debt related to this accounts receivable which is net of collections through December 31, 2020. (See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements under “Other Related Party Transactions” for further discussion related to H&H Export.)
In addition, CLR recorded a reserve against an outstanding receivable due from Alain Hernandez related to the over issuance of shares against the amounts payable. Management has reviewed the amount due and in conjunction with the impact of the underlying COVID crisis and has determined that the net amount of the amount receivable for $397,000, is more than likely to be uncollected as of December 31, 2019, and therefore approximately $397,000 has been recognized as an allowance for collectability at the end of December 31, 2019. (See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements under “Other Related Party Transactions” for further discussion related to H&H Export.)
In December 2018, CLR advanced $5,000,000 to H&H Export to provide services in support of a five-year contract for the sale and processing of green coffee beans. In March 2019, this advance was converted to a $5,000,000 loan agreement as a note receivable. Management reviewed the security against the loan and the impact of the underlying COVID crisis and determined that the full amount of the note receivable including interest of approximately $5,340,000, was not collected as of December 31, 2020, and therefore $5,340,000 was recognized as an allowance for collectability at the end of December 31, 2019. (See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements under “Other Related Party Transactions” for further discussion related to H&H Export.)
General and administrative expense in the commercial hemp segment from our Khrysos Global acquisition was approximately $4,096,000 and was primarily related to wages and general office costs.
Loss on Impairment of Intangible Assets
For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a loss on impairment of intangible assets related to our acquisition of Khrysos Global of approximately $8,461,000. (See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.)
For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a loss on impairment of intangible assets related to our acquisitions of BeautiControl, Inc. and Future Global Vision, Inc. and recorded a loss on impairment of intangible assets of approximately $2,550,000 and $625,000, respectively. (See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.)
Loss on Impairment of Goodwill
During the fourth quarter of 2019, we recorded a loss on impairment of goodwill of $6,831,000 related to the commercial hemp segment. The impairment was driven by a decline in the estimated fair value primarily due to the reduction in the profitability forecasts, as well as increased working capital requirements which increased its carrying value. (See Note 2 & Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.)
Operating Loss
For the year ended December 31, 2019, our operating loss increased by approximately $51,150,000 to an operating loss of $53,787,000 as compared to $2,637,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in our operating loss included $12,892,000 in stock and equity-based compensation expense recorded in the first quarter of 2019 as discussed above under operating expenses. Excluding the effect of stock and equity-based compensation expense in the first quarter of 2019, the operating loss would have been $40,821,000 or an increase of $36,009,000 compared to the same period last year which was primarily due to the lower revenue and higher operating expenses including the loss on impairment of goodwill and intangible assets as discussed above.
Total Other Income (Expenses), Net
For the year ended December 31, 2019, total net other income was approximately $1,808,000 as compared to net other expense of $17,017,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in net other income of $18,825,000 was due to the increase in the change in the fair value of derivative liabilities, the decrease in net interest expense, the loss on the modification of warrants recorded in 2019 and the loss on induced debt conversion and the extinguishment loss on debt recorded in 2018.
The change in fair value of derivative liabilities increased by approximately $10,147,000 to $5,502,000 in other income for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $4,645,000 in other expense for the year ended December 31, 2018. Various factors are considered in the pricing models we use to value the warrants including our current stock price, the remaining life of the warrants, the volatility of our stock price, and the risk-free interest rate. Future changes in these factors may have a significant impact on the computed fair value of our derivative liabilities. As such, we expect future changes in the fair value of the warrants and may vary significantly from period to period. (See Note 8 & Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.)
Net interest expense decreased by approximately $3,766,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $2,818,000 compared to $6,584,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Interest expense the year ended December 31, 2019 included: (i) interest payments to investors associated with our private placements and debt transactions, (ii) interest payments related to our Crestmark agreement, (iii) interest payments related to our short-term note, and (iv) interest paid for other operating debt. Non-cash interest of amortization expense and other non-cash interest, offset by interest income.
Interest expense in 2018 included: (i) interest payments related to investors associated with our private placement transactions, (ii) interest payments related to our short-term note, (iii) interest payments related to our Crestmark agreement and, (iv) interest paid for other operating debt. Non-cash interest includes amortization expense and other non-cash interest, offset by interest income.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a loss on modification of warrants of approximately $876,000 related to warrant modifications from inducement of shares and the change in the terms of the warrants. (See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.)
During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a non-cash loss on an induced debt conversion as a result of an exchange of debt for common stock. An investor in our 2014 private placement exchanged their 2014 PIPE Note with a principal balance of $4,000,000 for 747,664 shares of common stock in October 2018. We concluded that the 2014 PIPE Note should be recognized as a debt modification for an induced conversion of convertible debt and we recognized all remaining unamortized discounts of approximately $679,000 immediately subsequent to October 2018 as interest expense and recorded a loss on the debt exchange in the amount of $4,706,000 with the corresponding entry through equity. (See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.)
During 2018, we also recorded a non-cash extinguishment loss on debt of approximately $1,082,000 as a result of the triggering of the automatic conversion of the 2017 PIPE Notes associated with our 2017 private placement to common stock. This loss represents the difference between the carrying value of the 2017 PIPE Notes and embedded conversion feature and the fair value of the shares that were issued. The fair value of the shares issued was based on the stock price on the date of the conversion. (See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.)
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using statutory tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the effective date of the change. At December 31, 2019, we have evaluated the realizability of the deferred tax asset, based upon achieved and estimated future results and through consideration of all positive and negative evidences and have determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. A valuation allowance remains on the U.S. state and foreign tax attributes that are likely to expire before realization. We have approximately $75,000 in refundable credits, and expects that a substantial portion will be refunded between 2020 and 2021. As such, we do not have a valuation allowance relating to the refundable AMT credit carryforward.
We recognized an income tax provision of approximately $9,000 which was our estimated federal, state and foreign income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to an income tax provision of $416,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The difference between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate of 21% was due to the permanent differences, change in valuation allowance, state taxes (net of federal benefit), and foreign tax rate differential.
Net Loss
For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company reported a net loss of approximately $51,988,000 and $20,070,000, respectively. The increase in net loss of $31,918,000 when compared to the prior period was due to the increase in operating loss of $48,975,000, partially offset by the decrease in net other expense of $16,650,000 and a decrease in the income tax provision of $407,000 as discussed above.
Adjusted EBITDA
EBITDA (earnings or loss before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) as adjusted to remove the effect of stock-based compensation expense, equity-based compensation expense, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, the change in the fair value of the derivatives, the loss on the modification of warrants, the loss on impairment of goodwill, the loss on impairment of intangible assets, the loss on induced debt conversion, the loss on induced debt conversion, and the loss on extinguishment of debt or "Adjusted EBITDA." Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of approximately $15,447,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $7,013,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with our results under GAAP and the accompanying reconciliations, provides useful information about our period-over-period results. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because management believes it provides additional information with respect to the performance of our fundamental business activities and is also frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of comparable companies. We also rely on Adjusted EBITDA as a primary measure to review and assess the operating performance of our company and our management team.
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. We calculate adjusted EBITDA by taking net income, and adding back the expenses related to interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, equity-based compensation expense, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, change in the fair value of the warrant derivative, loss on modification of warrants, loss on impairment of goodwill, loss on impairment of intangible assets, loss on induced debt conversion, and loss on extinguishment of debt, and as each of those elements are calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as a substitute for net income (loss) (as determined in accordance with GAAP) for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance or financial position, as Adjusted EBITDA is not defined by GAAP.
A reconciliation of our adjusted EBITDA to net loss is included in the table below (in thousands):
Liquidity and Capital Resources

Contractual Obligations
The following table summarizes our expected contractual obligations and commitments subsequent to December 31, 2019 (in thousands):
“Operating lease liabilities” include costs of certain office space, warehouses, distribution centers and manufacturing centers and imputed interest. These costs generally provide that property taxes, insurance, and maintenance expenses are our responsibility. Such expenses are not included in the operating lease amounts that are outlined in the table above. (See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.)
“Finance lease liabilities” include costs of equipment and imputed interest. These costs generally provide that maintenance expenses are our responsibility. Such expenses are not included in the operating lease amounts that are outlined in the table above. (See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.)
“Line of credit” includes the principal balance of our line of credit and bears interest based upon a year of 360-days with interest being charged for each day the principal amount is outstanding including the date of actual payment. The interest rate is a rate equal to the prime rate plus 2.50% with a floor of 6.75%. At December 31, 2019, the interest rate was 7.25%. In addition, other fees are incurred for the maintenance of the loan in accordance with the line of credit. Other fees may be incurred in the event the minimum loan balance of $2,000,000 is not maintained. Such fees are not included in the line of credit amounts that are outlined in the table above. The line of credit was effective until November 16, 2020 and will continue to be effective for additional one-year terms unless written notice of termination is provided to Crestmark not less than thirty days to the end of any renewal term. The balances in the above table do not include interest expense related to line of credit. (See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.)
“Notes payable” includes the principal balance of several borrowings as follows: (i) a credit note in the amount of $5,000,000 entered into with Mr. Grover which bear interest at a rate of 8.00% per annum and matures in December 2020, (ii) the remaining principal balance of approximately $3,143,000 at December 31, 2019 on a mortgage for our corporate office property which bears interest rate at the prime rate plus 2.50% per annum, or 7.50% at December 31, 2019,and matures in 2038 (iii) two promissory notes totaling $2,000,000 which bear interest at a rate of 8.00% per annum and matures in March 2021, in February 2021, respectively and were extended by way of an amendment to the notes to extend the maturity date to March 2022 which is reflected in the table above. In addition, we agreed to increase the interest rate to 16% per annum, (iv) an acquisition asset purchase liability in the amount of approximately $1,027,000 at December 31, 2019 with no interest rate or stated maturity, (v) the remaining principal balance of approximately $440,000 at December 31, 2019 on a mortgage for a 45-acre tract of land in Groveland, FL (“Groveland”), which bear interest at 6.00% per annum and matures in February 2024. This property was not available-for-sale at December 31, 2019, and was subsequently sold in 2021, (vi) a mortgage note assumed from the Khrysos Global acquisition in the amount of $350,000 which bear interest at 8.00% per annum with all principal due at maturity in September 2021, (vii) the remaining principal balance of approximately$178,000 at December 31, 2019 on a mortgage note for property in Clermont, FL was assumed from the Khrysos Global acquisition which bear interest at 7.00% and matures in June 2023.

The outstanding 2019 PIPE Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.00% per annum and paid quarterly in arrears with all principal and unpaid interest due between February and July 2021. On February 18, 2021, the 2019 Notes that were maturing in February and March 2021 were extended by way of an amendment to the convertible notes, whereby we agreed to make certain principal payments as agreed upon within the amendment, extending the maturity dates between February 2022 and March 2022 which is reflected in the table above. In addition, we agreed to increase the interest rate between 12% and 16% per annum. (See Note 7 & Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.)
The balances in the above table do not include interest expense related to the applicable convertible notes payable.
“Contingent acquisition debt” relates to contingent liabilities related to business acquisitions. Generally, these liabilities are payments to be made in the future based on a level of revenue derived from the sale of products. These numbers are estimates and actual numbers could be higher or lower because many of our contingent liabilities relate to payments on sales that have no maximum payment amount. In many of those transactions, we have recorded a liability for contingent consideration as part of the purchase price. All contingent consideration amounts are based on management’s best estimates utilizing all known information at the time of the calculation. (See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.)
“Purchase obligations” are minimum future purchase commitments for green coffee to be used in our commercial coffee segment. Each individual contract requires us to purchase and take delivery of certain quantities at agreed upon prices and delivery dates. The contracts contain provisions whereby any delays in taking delivery of the purchased product will result in additional charges related to the extended warehousing of the coffee product. The fees can average approximately $0.01 per pound for every month of delay. To-date we have not incurred such fees.
“Construction obligations” include the remaining obligations towards our Matagalpa Mill construction agreement entered into in January 2019. CLR has agreed to contribute $4,700,000 towards the Matagalpa Mill. As of December 31, 2019, CLR contributed a total of $3,050,000 towards the Matagalpa Mill project, in addition $391,117 was paid for operating equipment. CLR’s remaining portion of $1,650,000 was paid in 2020, including an additional $912,606 for operating equipment. At December 31, 2019, the Matagalpa Mill was not ready for full operations.
Future Liquidity Needs
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared and presented on a basis assuming we will continue as a going concern. At December 31, 2019, we had a significant accumulated deficit and we have experienced significant losses and incurred negative cash flows for the last few years. Net cash used in operating activities was $15,014,000 and $12,352,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $4,463,000 at December 31, 2019. We do not currently believe that our existing cash resources are sufficient to meet our anticipated needs over the next twelve months from the date hereof. Based on our current cash levels and our current rate of cash requirements, we will need to raise additional capital and/or will need to further reduce our expenses from current levels. Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued a report that includes an explanatory paragraph referring to our recurring losses from operations (anticipated continued losses in the future) that raise substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern.
Historically, we have financed our operations primarily through revenue generated from sales of our products and the public and private sales of our securities and we expect to continue to seek to obtain required capital in a similar manner. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we did not generate sufficient capital from operations to satisfy our expenses. We have spent, and expect to continue to spend, a substantial amount of funds in connection with implementing our business strategy. Additionally, we may seek to access the public or private equity markets when conditions are favorable due to our long-term capital requirements. If we are unable to obtain additional capital (which is not assured at this time), our long-term business plan may not be met, and we may not be able to fulfill our debt obligations. Our ability to raise capital through the sale of securities may be limited by the rules of the SEC and Nasdaq that place limits on the number and dollar amount of securities that may be sold. We do not have any commitments from third parties for funding. A failure otherwise to raise additional funds when needed in the future could result in us being unable to complete planned operations, or forced to delay, discontinue or curtail product development, forego sales and marketing efforts, and forego licensing in attractive business opportunities. Our ability to raise capital through the sale of securities may be limited by the rules of the SEC and Nasdaq that place limits on the number and dollar amount of securities that may be sold. There can be no assurances that we will be able to raise the funds needed on favorable terms, if at all, especially in light of the fact that we will not be able to sell securities registered on our registration statement on Form S-3 until at least June 1, 2022 and thereafter until such time the market value of our voting securities held by non-affiliates is $75 million or more or our common stock is once again listed on a national securities exchange.
In January 2019, we entered into the ATM agreement with Benchmark, as sales agent, pursuant to which we may sell from time to time, at our option, shares of our common stock through Benchmark, for the sale of up to $60,000,000 of shares of our common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold 17,524 shares of common stock under the ATM agreement and received net proceeds of approximately $102,000. We are not currently eligible to register the offer and sale of our securities using a registration statement on Form S-3 and therefore cannot make sales under the ATM agreement until such time as we once again become S-3 eligible.
In February 2019, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with one accredited investor that had a substantial pre-existing relationship with us pursuant to which we sold 250,000 shares of our common stock at an offering price of $7.00 per share. Pursuant to the purchase agreement, we also issued to the investor a three-year warrant to purchase 250,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $7.00. We received proceeds of $1,750,000 from the stock offering. In June 2019, we entered into a second securities purchase agreement with this same accredited investor pursuant to which we sold 250,000 shares of common stock at an offering price of $5.50 per share. We received gross proceeds of $1,375,000.
Between February and July 2019, we closed five tranches related to the 2019 private placement debt offering, pursuant to which we offered for sale up to $10,000,000 in principal amount of notes (the “2019 PIPE Notes”), with each investor receiving 2,000 shares of common stock for each $100,000 invested. We entered into subscription agreements with thirty-one accredited investors, that had a substantial pre-existing relationship with us, pursuant to which we received aggregate gross proceeds of $3,090,000 and issued 2019 PIPE Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $3,090,000 and an aggregate of 61,800 shares of common stock. The 2019 PIPE Notes are secured by all equity in KII. (See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.)
In March 2019, we entered into a two-year secured promissory note (“Note” or “Notes”) with two accredited investors that had a substantial pre-existing relationship with us pursuant to which we raised cash proceeds in the aggregate of $2,000,000. At December 31, 2019, the outstanding principal balance of the Notes was $2,000,000. The Notes are secured by all equity in KII. In conjunction with the Notes, we also issued 20,000 shares of our common stock for each $1,000,000 invested and a five-year warrant to purchase 20,000 shares of common stock at a price of $6.00 per share for each $1,000,000 invested. We issued in the aggregate 40,000 shares of common stock and 40,000 warrants with the Notes. (See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.)
Between September and December 2019, we closed two tranches of our Series D offering, pursuant to which we issued and sold a total of 578,898 shares of our 9.75% Series D preferred stock at a weighted average price to the public of $24.05 per share, less underwriting discounts and commissions, pursuant to the terms of the underwriting agreement that we entered into with Benchmark as representative of the several underwriters. The 578,898 shares of Series D preferred stock that were sold included 43,500 shares sold pursuant to the overallotment option that we granted to the underwriters that was exercised in full. At December 31, 2019, 36,809 overallotment shares were outstanding and were issued to the underwriters in January 2020. The net proceeds from this offering were approximately $12,269,000 after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses which were paid by us.
In March 2020, we closed one tranche related to our March 2020 private placement debt offering, pursuant to which we offered for sale up to $5,000,000 in principal amount (the “2020 PIPE Offering”), of senior secured promissory notes (the “Note or Notes”) with each investor receiving 50,000 shares of common stock for each $1,000,000 invested at an original issue discount of two percent. The Notes bears interest at a rate of 18.00% per annum. In March 2020, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with Daniel J. Mangless pursuant to which we issued a Note in the principal amount of $1,000,000, due December 31, 2020. Mr. Mangless received 50,000 shares of the Company’s stock from the Company in connection with his investment. (See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.)
We do not believe that our existing cash resources are sufficient to meet our anticipated needs over the next twelve months from the date hereof. We are also considering additional alternatives, including, but not limited to equity financings and debt financings. Depending on market conditions, we cannot be sure that additional capital will be available when needed or that, if available, it will be obtained on terms favorable to us or to our stockholders.
Failure to raise additional funds from the issuance of equity securities and failure to implement cost reductions could adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern. There can be no assurance that any cost reductions implemented will correct our going concern issue. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
There were no off-balance sheet arrangements at either December 31, 2019 or 2018.
