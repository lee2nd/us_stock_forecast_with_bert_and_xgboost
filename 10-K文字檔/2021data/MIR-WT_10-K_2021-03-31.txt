Item 7.A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk.
As of December 31, 2020, we were not subject to any material market or interest rate risk. The net proceeds of the Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants held in the Trust Account, were invested in money market funds that meet certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act. Due to the short-term nature of these investments, we believe there was no associated material exposure to interest rate risk.
We have not engaged in any hedging activities since our inception. We do not expect to engage in any hedging activities with respect to the market risk to which we are exposed.
