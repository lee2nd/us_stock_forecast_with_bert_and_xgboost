Overview
Until January 21, 2021, the Company was a blank check company. On the Closing Date, the Company consummated its previously announced business combination. Additional information regarding the Business Combination and related transactions is set forth in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 22, 2021.
The Business Combination is a subsequent event that occurred after the periods for which the financial information herein is presented.

The Company’s financial statement presentation to be included in quarterly and annual filings with the SEC on Forms 10-Q and 10-K with respect to periods subsequent to the Business Combination will include the consolidated financial statements of UWM and its subsidiaries for periods prior to the completion of the Business Combination and of the Company for periods from and after the Closing Date. The financial information included in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” reflects the historical operations of the Company, the legal acquirer, unless otherwise noted.
Results of Operations
For the calendar year ended December 31, 2020, and the period from June 12, 2019 (inception) to December 31, 2019, we had a net loss attributable to common shares of ($5,807,306) and ($39,002), respectively. Our activities during these periods mainly consisted of identifying and evaluating prospective acquisition candidates for a Business Combination. We generated $1,101,134 and $0 in interest income for the calendar year ended December 31, 2020 and the period from June 12, 2019 (inception) to December 31, 2019, respectively.
Balance Sheet
As indicated in the accompanying financial statements, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $50,573 and $1,120, respectively, in cash outside of the Trust Account.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
In July 2019, the Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 11,500,000 Founder Shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.002 per share. Subsequently, the Sponsor transferred an aggregate of 75,000 Founder Shares to our independent directors. On March 9, 2020, following the expiration of the unexercised portion of the underwriter’s over-allotment option, the Sponsor forfeited 875,000 Founder Shares so that the remaining Founder Shares held by our Initial Stockholders represented 20.0% of the outstanding shares upon completion of our Public Offering.
On January 28, 2020, we consummated our Public Offering of 42,500,000 Units at a price of $10.00 per Unit, including 2,500,000 Units as a result of the underwriter’s partial exercise of their over-allotment option, generating gross proceeds of $425,000,000. On the IPO Closing Date, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 5,250,000 Private Placement Warrants, each exercisable to purchase one share of Common Stock at $11.50 per share, to the Sponsor, at a price of $2.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds, before expenses, of $10,500,000. After deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions (excluding the Deferred Discount, which amount was paid upon consummation of the Business Combination) and the estimated offering expenses, the total net proceeds from our Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants were $426,055,000 of which $425,000,000 (or $10.00 per share sold in the Public Offering) was placed in the Trust Account. The amount of proceeds not deposited in the Trust Account was $1,055,000 at the closing of our Public Offering. Interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account may be released to us to fund our working capital requirements plus additional amounts released to us to fund our Regulatory Withdrawals (subject to an annual limit of $1,100,000, for a maximum of 24 months) and/or additional amounts necessary to pay our franchise and income taxes.
On July 16, 2019, the Sponsor loaned us an aggregate of $150,000 by the issuance of an unsecured promissory note for $300,000 to cover expenses related to the Public Offering. On December 31, 2019, the outstanding balance on the loan was $150,000. On January 25, 2020, the Sponsor loaned us an additional $150,000 to cover expenses related to the Public Offering. These Notes were non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of June 30, 2020 or the completion of the Public Offering. The carrying amount of the Notes approximates fair value because of their short maturity. These Notes were repaid in full upon the completion of the Public Offering.
On September 29, 2020, the Sponsor made available to the Company a loan of up to $1,000,000 pursuant to a promissory note issued by the Company to the Sponsor. The proceeds from the note were used for on-going operational expenses and certain other expenses in connection with the Business Combination. The note is unsecured, non-interest bearing and matures on the earlier of: (i) June 30, 2021 or (ii) the date on which the Company consummates the Proposed Business Combination. As of December 31, 2020, the amount advanced by Sponsor to the Company was $1,000,000.
As indicated in the accompanying financial statements, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $50,573 and $1,120, respectively, in cash outside of the Trust Account.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had current liabilities of $5,197,819 and $426,496, respectively and negative working capital of ($4,963,357) and $(14,002), respectively, largely due to amounts owed to professionals, consultants, advisors and others who were working on seeking a Business Combination.
Off-balance sheet financing arrangements
We had no obligations, assets or liabilities which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2020 and 2019. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements.
We had not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or entered into any non-financial agreements involving assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Contractual obligations
We did not have any long-term debt obligations, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations, purchase obligations or long-term liabilities other than as accrued in the December 31, 2020 balance sheet and other than an administrative services agreement to pay a monthly recurring expense of $20,000 to The Gores Group for office space, utilities and secretarial support. The administrative services agreement terminated upon the completion of the Business Combination.
The underwriters were entitled to underwriting discounts and commissions of 5.5%, of which 2.0% ($8,500,000) was paid at the IPO Closing Date, and 3.5% ($14,875,000) was deferred. The Deferred Discount
became payable to the underwriter from the amounts held in the Trust Account upon completion of the Business Combination, pursuant to the terms of the underwriting agreement. The underwriter was not entitled to any interest accrued on the Deferred Discount.
