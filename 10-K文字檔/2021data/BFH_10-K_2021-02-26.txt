Item 7.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Overview
We are a leading provider of data-driven marketing, loyalty and payment solutions serving large, consumer-based industries. We create and deploy customized solutions that measurably change consumer behavior while driving business growth and profitability for some of today’s most recognizable brands. We help our partners create and increase customer loyalty across multiple touch points using traditional, digital, mobile and emerging technologies. We operate under two segments-LoyaltyOne and Card Services. Our LoyaltyOne business owns and operates the AIR MILES Reward Program, Canada’s most recognized loyalty program, and Netherlands-based BrandLoyalty, a global provider of tailor-made loyalty programs for grocers. Our Card Services business is a comprehensive provider of market-leading private label, co-brand, general purpose and business credit card programs, digital payments, including Bread, and Comenity-branded financial services. Effective March 31, 2019, our Epsilon segment was treated as a discontinued operation, and was subsequently sold on July 1, 2019.
Year in Review
● Effective January 1, 2020, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 326, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses,” and applied a current expected credit loss, or CECL, model to determine our allowance for loan loss, which is measured over the estimated life of the credit card and loan receivable. Our adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020 resulted in an increase in our allowance for loan loss at adoption of $644.0 million, which was recorded through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings, net of taxes. See Note 8, “Credit Card and Loan Receivables,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
● In January 2020, we sold Precima, a provider of retail strategy and customer data applications and analytics, for total consideration of approximately $43.8 million. Precima was included in our LoyaltyOne segment.
● During 2020, we paid dividends and dividend equivalent rights of $60.6 million.
● During 2020, we sold one credit card portfolio for cash consideration of $289.5 million.
● We launched our direct-to-consumer Comenity-branded general purpose credit card, the Comenity CardSM, which provides Alliance Data with an additional product to both attract and retain our cardholders.
● In October 2020, we entered into an agreement to transition hosting of our credit card processing services to Fiserv, a leading global provider of payments and financial services technology solutions.
● In December 2020, we completed the acquisition of Bread for aggregate consideration of approximately $491.0 million, net of cash and restricted cash acquired, subject to closing purchase price adjustments. Bread provides technology solutions for merchants to provide digital purchase financing options to customers in the form of installment credit as well as credit and debit multi-pay solutions. Bread is included in our Card Services segment.
COVID-19 Update
In the first quarter of 2020, the WHO declared the current coronavirus, or COVID-19, outbreak to be a global pandemic. In response to this declaration and the rapid spread of COVID-19, international, provincial, federal, state and local government or other authorities have imposed varying degrees of restrictions on social and commercial activity in an effort to improve health and safety. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, first and foremost, we have prioritized the health and safety of our associates. Effective teleworking protocols are in place for approximately 95% of our associates.
COVID-19 restrictions have adversely impacted and continue to adversely impact our associates, our business partners, and our customers, which has negatively impacted our financial performance, as revenue and adjusted EBITDA, net significantly declined from the prior year. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company offered forbearance programs, which provide for short-term modifications in the form of payment deferrals and late fee waivers to borrowers who were current with their payments prior to any relief. However, in the third and fourth quarter of 2020, we began to experience a gradual recovery in the economy coupled with the holiday season. Credit sales and AIR
MILES reward miles issued and redeemed all increased sequentially in the third and fourth quarter of 2020. Further, credit metrics remained resilient, reflecting strong payment trends across our consumer borrower base, which may have benefitted from government economic stimulus programs, and delinquency rates improved in the second half of the year. Nonetheless, we continue to monitor the evolving situation and guidance from international, provincial, federal, state and local government and public health authorities. Despite the emergence of vaccines, surges in COVID-19 cases, including variants of the strain, such as those recently experienced in Europe and the United States, may cause people to self-quarantine or governments to shut down nonessential businesses again. Given the dynamic nature of this situation, we cannot reasonably estimate the impacts of COVID-19 on our future results of operations or cash flows at this time.
Consolidated Results of Operations
*
not meaningful
Year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019
Revenue. Total revenue decreased $1,059.9 million, or 19%, to $4,521.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $5,581.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The net decrease was due to the following:
● Services. Revenue decreased $98.6 million, or 46%, to $116.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to the sale of Precima in January 2020, which resulted in a $79.3 million decrease in revenue as compared to the prior year. Service revenue also declined by $43.4 million due to lower volumes. These decreases were offset in part by a $32.6 million increase in merchant fee revenue due to decreased royalty payments to our retailers.
● Redemption. Revenue decreased $164.2 million, or 26%, to $473.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as redemption revenue from our short-term loyalty programs decreased $158.1 million due to a decline in
programs in markets across most regions due to the impact of COVID-19. In response to COVID-19, certain of our customers have delayed their short-term loyalty programs.
● Finance charges, net. Revenue decreased $797.1 million, or 17%, to $3,931.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decline was due to a 13% decrease in normalized average receivables that decreased revenue by $617.5 million, and an approximate 110 basis point decrease in finance charge yield, which decreased revenue by $179.6 million. The decrease in normalized average receivables was due to a 20% decline in credit sales compared to the prior year due to COVID-19 and sales of credit card portfolios. The decrease in finance charge yield was due primarily to forbearance programs offered, including waivers of late fees, in response to COVID-19, as well as the lowering of market interest rates.
Cost of operations. Cost of operations decreased $610.5 million, or 23%, to $2,077.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $2,687.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The net decrease was due to the following:
● Within the LoyaltyOne segment, cost of operations decreased $270.8 million, including a $149.9 million decrease in cost of redemptions due to the decline in redemption revenue discussed above and restructuring and other charges incurred in the prior year. Additionally, the sale of Precima in January 2020 resulted in a $78.4 million decrease in cost of operations excluding the gain on sale, and cost of operations decreased due to cost saving initiatives executed in 2019 and 2020, with a reduction of expenses across several categories.
● Within the Card Services segment, cost of operations decreased $339.6 million, including a $182.2 million decrease in valuation adjustments to certain portfolios within credit card receivables held for sale, a $92.1 million decrease in payroll and benefits costs due to cost saving initiatives executed in the fourth quarter of 2019 and in 2020, a $61.3 million decrease in marketing expense due to the decline in volumes, and a $81.7 million decline in various other credit card costs due to reductions in volume, including a reduction in fraud losses, and cost saving initiatives. These decreases were offset in part by a $23.5 million decrease in gains recognized on sales of credit card portfolios as compared to the prior year and $63.7 million in asset impairment charges recorded in 2020, related to certain deferred contract costs, fixed assets and right of use assets.
Provision for loan loss. Provision for loan loss increased $78.7 million, or 7%, to $1,266.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $1,187.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, due to a higher allowance for loan loss related to estimated lifetime losses under the CECL model, including the projected impacts of COVID-19. This was offset in part by the decline in credit card and loan receivables of $2.7 billion.
General and administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased $44.9 million, or 30%, to $105.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $150.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, due to cost saving initiatives implemented in 2019 and 2020, which among other items included reduced headcount, office space, charitable contributions and overall corporate overhead costs. In addition, the prior year was impacted by $37.9 million in restructuring charges incurred related to our Corporate reorganization.
Depreciation and other amortization. Depreciation and other amortization increased $18.6 million, or 23%, to $98.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $79.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, due to $24.7 million in accelerated depreciation expense of fixed assets associated with certain real estate properties that have ceased use but intend to sublease. See Note 13, “Property and Equipment,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. This increase was offset in part by certain fully amortized capitalized software.
Amortization of purchased intangibles. Amortization of purchased intangibles decreased $10.9 million, or 11%, to $85.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $96.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to certain fully amortized intangible assets, including portfolio premiums.
Loss on extinguishment of debt. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a $71.9 million loss on extinguishment of debt resulting from the $49.9 million redemption price of the senior notes and the write-off of $22.0 million of deferred issuance costs related to the July 2019 early extinguishment of $1.9 billion of outstanding senior notes and an amendment to the credit agreement that was effective upon the consummation of the sale of Epsilon.
Interest expense, net. Total interest expense, net decreased $75.1 million, or 13%, to $493.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $569.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The net decrease was due to the following:
● Securitization funding costs. Securitization funding costs decreased $47.5 million due to lower average borrowings, which decreased funding costs by approximately $55.9 million, offset in part by higher average interest rates, due to the timing of asset-backed debt maturities, which increased funding costs by approximately $8.4 million.
● Interest expense on deposits. Interest expense on deposits decreased $6.1 million due to lower average balances outstanding, which decreased funding costs by approximately $19.4 million, offset in part by higher average interest rates, due to the maturity of lower rate deposits, which increased funding costs by approximately $13.3 million.
● Interest expense on long-term and other debt, net. Interest expense on long-term and other debt, net decreased $21.5 million primarily due to a $72.4 million decrease in interest expense on term debt due to lower average borrowings, as well as a result of an amendment to the credit agreement, which included a $493.8 million repayment in September 2020. This decrease was offset in part by a $48.8 million increase in interest expense due to the issuance of senior notes in December 2019 and September 2020.
Taxes. Provision for income taxes decreased $66.3 million, or 40%, to $99.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $165.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily related to a $343.9 million reduction in earnings before taxes in the current year. The effective tax rate for the current year was 25.2% as compared to 22.5% for the prior year. The lower effective tax rate in the prior year included a decrease in tax reserves resulting from a change in accounting method for tax purposes. See Note 22, “Income Taxes,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
Loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes. Loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes was $81.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to resolution of a loss contingency as described in Note 18, “Commitments and Contingencies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes was $294.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, due to the after-tax loss on the sale of Epsilon completed July 1, 2019 and a $32.9 million initial estimate for the loss contingency referenced above.

Segment Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, net
*
not meaningful
Year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019
Revenue. Total revenue decreased $1,059.9 million, or 19%, to $4,521.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $5,581.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was due to the following:
● LoyaltyOne. Revenue decreased $268.3 million, or 26%, to $764.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as revenue from our short-term loyalty programs decreased $161.4 million due to a decline in programs in markets across most regions due to the impact of COVID-19. Additionally, the sale of Precima in January 2020 resulted in a $79.3 million decrease in revenue. Redemption revenue and servicing revenue in our coalition loyalty program were negatively impacted by a 10% decline in AIR MILES reward miles issued and a 29% decline in AIR MILES reward miles redeemed.
● Card Services. Revenue decreased $791.3 million, or 17%, to $3,756.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, driven by a $797.1 million decrease in finance charges, net due to a decline in credit card and loan receivables due to lower sales volumes resulting from COVID-19 and portfolios sold in 2019 and 2020, and a decrease in yield due to forbearance programs offered in response to COVID-19 and interest rate cuts.
Adjusted EBITDA, net. Adjusted EBITDA, net decreased $499.8 million, or 39%, to $771.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $1,271.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The net decrease was due to the following:
● LoyaltyOne. Adjusted EBITDA, net decreased $58.3 million, or 24%, to $186.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, due to lost margin on the revenue declines discussed above, offset in part by improved expense management, including cost saving initiatives executed in 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the $8.0 million gain on the sale of Precima, net of transaction costs was excluded from adjusted EBITDA, net. For the year ended December 31, 2019, restructuring and other charges of $50.8 million were excluded from adjusted EBITDA, net.
● Card Services. Adjusted EBITDA, net decreased $452.7 million, or 40%, to $667.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to the decrease in revenue as discussed above and a $78.7 million increase in provision for loan loss due to the impact of COVID-19, as well as the implementation of the CECL model, offset in part by a $2.7 billion decline in credit card and loan receivables. These decreases were offset in part by a $182.2 million decrease in valuation adjustments to certain portfolios within credit card receivables held for sale and reductions in cost of operations due to cost saving initiatives executed in the fourth quarter of 2019 and in 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, asset impairments of $63.7 million were excluded from adjusted EBITDA, net. For the year ended December 31, 2019, restructuring and other charges of $29.4 million were excluded from adjusted EBITDA, net.
● Corporate/Other. Adjusted EBITDA, net improved $11.2 million to a loss of $81.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to cost saving initiatives implemented in 2019 and 2020, which among other items included reduced headcount, office space, charitable contributions and overall corporate overhead costs. For the year ended December 31, 2020, strategic transaction costs of $15.2 million were excluded from adjusted EBITDA, net. For the year ended December 31, 2019, loss on extinguishment of debt of $71.9 million, restructuring and other charges of $37.9 million and strategic transaction costs of $10.7 million were excluded from adjusted EBITDA, net.
Year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018

Asset Quality
Our delinquency and net charge-off rates reflect, among other factors, the credit risk of our credit card and loan receivables, the success of our collection and recovery efforts, and general economic conditions.
Delinquencies. An account is contractually delinquent if we do not receive the minimum payment by the specified due date. Our policy is to continue to accrue interest and fee income on all accounts, except in limited circumstances, until the balance and all related interest and other fees are paid or charged-off, typically at 180 days delinquent for credit card receivables and 120 days delinquent for installment loan receivables. After an account becomes 30 days past due, a proprietary collection scoring algorithm automatically scores the risk of the account becoming further delinquent. The collection system then recommends a collection strategy for the past due account based on the collection score and account balance and dictates the contact schedule and collections priority for the account. If we are unable to make a collection after exhausting all in-house collection efforts, we may engage collection agencies and outside attorneys to continue those efforts.
The following table presents the delinquency trends of our credit card and loan receivables portfolio based on the principal balances of our credit card and loan receivables:
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have offered forbearance programs, which provide for short-term modifications in the form of payment deferrals and late fee waivers to borrowers who were current as of their most recent billing cycle prior to the announcement of the forbearance programs. Those accounts receiving forbearance relief may not advance to the next delinquency cycle, including eventually to charge-off, in the same timeframe that would have occurred had the forbearance relief not been granted.
Net Charge-Offs. Our net charge-offs include the principal amount of losses that are deemed uncollectible, less recoveries and exclude charged-off interest, fees and fraud losses. Charged-off interest and fees reduce finance charges, net while fraud losses are recorded as an expense. Credit card receivables, including unpaid interest and fees, are charged-off in the month during which an account becomes 180 days contractually past due, except in the case of customer bankruptcies or death. Installment loan receivables, including unpaid interest, are charged-off when a loan is 120 days past due. Credit card receivables, including unpaid interest and fees, associated with customer bankruptcies or death are charged-off in each month subsequent to 60 days after the receipt of notification of the bankruptcy or death, but in any case, not later than the 180-day contractual time frame.
The net charge-off rate is calculated by dividing net charge-offs of principal receivables for the period by the average credit card and loan receivables for the period. Average credit card and loan receivables represent the average balance of the cardholder receivables at the beginning of each month in the periods indicated. The following table presents our net charge-offs for the periods indicated:
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary sources of liquidity include cash generated from operating activities, our credit agreements and issuances of debt or equity securities, our securitization programs and deposits issued by Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank. In addition to our efforts to renew and expand our current liquidity sources, we continue to seek new funding sources.
Our primary uses of cash are for ongoing business operations, repayments of our debt, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, any stock repurchases and dividends.
We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases or exchanges for other securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors, and may be funded through the issuance of debt securities. The amounts involved may be material.
We believe that internally generated funds and other sources of liquidity discussed below will be sufficient to meet working capital needs, capital expenditures, and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, continued volatility in the financial and capital markets due to COVID-19 may limit our access to or increase our cost of capital or make capital unavailable on terms acceptable to us or at all.
Cash Flow Activity
Operating Activities. We generated cash flow from operating activities of $1,882.7 million and $1,217.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The year-over-year increase in operating cash flows of $665.0 million was due to an increase in working capital and the impact of the sale of Epsilon.
Investing Activities. Cash provided by investing activities was $1,774.3 million and $2,860.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Significant components of investing activities are as follows:
● Credit card and loan receivables. Cash increased $1,783.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to a decrease in credit card and loan receivables in 2020 resulting from lower sales volumes due to COVID-19, as strong payment rates were maintained. Cash decreased $2,586.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to growth in credit card and loan receivables.
● Proceeds from sale of businesses. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we received cash consideration of $26.7 million from the sale of Precima. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we received cash consideration of $4,409.7 million from the sale of Epsilon.
● Payments for acquired businesses. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we paid cash consideration of $266.8 million for the acquisition of Bread on December 3, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we paid cash consideration of $6.7 million for the acquisition of Blispay on February 7, 2019.
● Purchase of credit card portfolios. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we paid cash consideration of $924.8 million to acquire four credit card portfolios. No credit card portfolios were acquired in 2020.
● Proceeds from sale of credit card portfolios. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we received cash consideration of $289.5 million from the sale of a credit card portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we received cash consideration of $2,061.8 million from the sale of thirteen credit card portfolios.
● Capital expenditures. Cash paid for capital expenditures was $54.0 million and $142.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2019 included $55.8 million related to our divested Epsilon segment, which was presented as a discontinued operation in the prior year. We anticipate capital expenditures to continue to be less than 3% of annual revenue.
Financing Activities. Cash used in financing activities was $4,166.5 million and $4,091.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Significant components of financing activities are as follows:
● Debt. Cash decreased $44.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to repayments of our term loans. In September 2020, we issued $500.0 million in senior notes and used the net proceeds of $493.8 million to make a prepayment of our term debt under our amended credit agreement. Cash decreased $2,870.5 million as a
result of net repayments for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the July 2019 early extinguishment of $1.9 billion outstanding senior notes upon consummation of the sale of Epsilon and the mandatory payment of $500.0 million on our revolving credit facility. In December 2019, we issued $850.0 million in senior notes, of which the net proceeds of $833.0 million were used to make a prepayment of our term debt under the credit agreement.
● Non-recourse borrowings of consolidated securitization entities. Cash decreased $1,676.5 million and $367.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, due to net repayments and maturities under the asset-backed term notes and conduit facilities as well as declines in credit card and loan receivables for the year ended December 31, 2020.
● Deposits. During the year ended December 31, 2020, cash decreased $2,370.0 million due to net maturities of deposits. During the year ended December 31, 2019, cash increased $355.6 million due to net issuances of deposits. The volume of deposits as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was impacted by changes in credit card and loan receivables in the respective years.
● Dividends. Cash paid for quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents was $60.6 million and $127.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In the second quarter of 2020, the quarterly dividend was reduced from $0.63 to $0.21 per common share.
● Treasury shares. Cash paid for treasury shares was $976.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. We did not repurchase any shares of our outstanding common stock for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Debt
Credit Agreement
In September 2020, we amended our credit agreement to (a) increase the maximum total leverage ratio, (b) decrease the minimum interest coverage ratio, and (c) increase the maximum permitted average delinquency ratios, for the periods ending March 31, 2021 through June 30, 2022, and to make certain other amendments. The amendment also required us to prepay the term loans upon consummation of the offering of the Senior Notes due 2026 with a prepayment in an amount equal to the net proceeds from the offering, which obligation was satisfied in full with a prepayment of $493.8 million. The prepayment was first applied to the scheduled quarterly installments payable in September 2020 and December 2020, and second, to the bullet payment of the term loans due at maturity. See Note 17, “Debt,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
At December 31, 2020, we had $1,484.3 million in term loans outstanding and a $750.0 million revolving line of credit. As of December 31, 2020, we had no amounts outstanding under our revolving line of credit and total availability of $750.0 million. Our total leverage ratio, as defined in our credit agreement, was under 2.5 to 1 at December 31, 2020, as compared to the maximum covenant ratio of 3.5 to 1.
As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with our debt covenants.
BrandLoyalty Credit Agreement
In April 2020, BrandLoyalty terminated its existing facility and entered into a new credit agreement that provides for a committed revolving line of credit of €30.0 million ($36.6 million as of December 31, 2020), an uncommitted revolving line of credit of €30.0 million ($36.6 million as of December 31, 2020), and an accordion feature permitting BrandLoyalty to request an increase in either the committed or uncommitted line of credit up to €80.0 million ($97.7 million as of December 31, 2020) in aggregate. The revolving lines of credit mature in April 2023, subject to BrandLoyalty’s request to extend for two additional one-year terms at the absolute discretion of the lenders at the time of such requests. As of December 31, 2020, there were no amounts outstanding under these revolving lines of credit.
Senior Notes
In September 2020, we issued and sold $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.000% senior notes due January 15, 2026. The Senior Notes due 2026 accrue interest on the principal amount at the rate of 7.000% per annum from September 22, 2020, payable semi-annually in arrears, on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on
March 15, 2021. The Senior Notes due 2026 will mature on January 15, 2026, subject to earlier repurchase or redemption.
See Note 17, “Debt,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our debt.
Funding Sources
Deposits
We utilize money market deposits and certificates of deposit to finance the operating activities, including funding for our non-securitized credit card and loan receivables, and fund securitization enhancement requirements of our bank subsidiaries, Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank. In April 2019, Comenity Capital Bank launched a consumer retail deposit platform, Comenity Direct™, to the public; retail deposits comprised approximately $1.7 billion of our $9.8 billion deposits outstanding at December 31, 2020.
Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank offer non-maturity deposit programs through contractual arrangements with various financial counterparties. As of December 31, 2020, Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank had $3.8 billion in money market deposits outstanding with interest rates ranging from 0.38% to 3.50%. Money market deposits are redeemable on demand by the customer and, as such, have no scheduled maturity date.
Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank issue certificates of deposit in denominations of at least $100,000 and $1,000, respectively, in various maturities ranging between January 2021 and December 2025 and with effective annual interest rates ranging from 0.15% to 3.75%. As of December 31, 2020, we had $6.0 billion of certificates of deposit outstanding. Certificate of deposit borrowings are subject to regulatory capital requirements.
Securitization Programs
We sell a majority of the credit card receivables originated by Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank to certain master trusts. These securitization programs are a principal vehicle through which we finance Comenity Bank’s and Comenity Capital Bank’s credit card receivables. Historically, we have used both public and private term asset-backed securitization transactions as well as private conduit facilities as sources of funding for our securitized credit card receivables. Private conduit facilities have been used to accommodate seasonality needs and to bridge to completion of asset-backed securitization transactions.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, $1.7 billion of asset-backed term notes matured and were repaid, of which $228.2 million were retained by us and eliminated from the consolidated balance sheets.
We have access to committed undrawn capacity through three conduit facilities to support the funding of our credit card and loan receivables through the trusts. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we reduced the commitments under our conduit facilities by $1.5 billion and extended the respective maturities to April 2022 and October 2022. As of December 31, 2020, total capacity under the conduit facilities was $3.2 billion, of which $2.2 billion had been drawn and was included in non-recourse borrowings of consolidated securitization entities in the consolidated balance sheets.
With the acquisition of Bread in December 2020, we assumed two warehouse facilities used to fund their securitized loan receivables. In December 2020, one of the warehouse facilities was terminated and we repaid $28.5 million owed under the agreement. The second warehouse facility was amended to a secured loan facility with an outstanding balance of $86.3 million at December 31, 2020. The secured loan facility accrues interest on the principal amount at the rate of LIBOR plus an applicable margin. The principal amount is due upon maturity in November 2022, with prepayment permitted.
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $11.2 billion of securitized credit card and loan receivables. Securitizations require credit enhancements in the form of cash, spread deposits, additional receivables and subordinated classes. The credit enhancement is principally based on the outstanding balances of the series issued by the trusts and by the performance of the credit card and loan receivables in the trusts.
The following table shows the maturities of borrowing commitments as of December 31, 2020 for the trusts by year:
(1) Amount represents borrowing capacity, not outstanding borrowings.
(2) Total amounts do not include $1.1 billion of debt issued by the trusts, which was retained by us and has been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.
Early amortization events as defined within each asset-backed securitization transaction are generally driven by asset performance. We do not believe it is reasonably likely that an early amortization event will occur due to asset performance. However, if an early amortization event were declared, the trustee of the particular trust would retain the interest in the receivables along with the excess interest income that would otherwise be paid to our bank subsidiary until the investors were fully repaid. The occurrence of an early amortization event would significantly limit or negate our ability to securitize additional credit card and loan receivables.
We have secured and continue to secure the necessary commitments to fund our credit card and loan receivables. However, certain of these commitments are short-term in nature and subject to renewal. There is not a guarantee that these funding sources, when they mature, will be renewed on similar terms or at all as they are dependent on the availability of the asset-backed securitization and deposit markets at the time.
See Note 17, “Debt,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our securitized debt.
Stock Repurchase Programs
We had an authorized stock repurchase program to acquire up to $1.1 billion of our outstanding common stock from July 5, 2019 through June 30, 2020. At December 31, 2019, we had $347.8 million remaining under the stock repurchase program. The stock repurchase program expired on June 30, 2020, and $347.8 million of this program expired unused. During 2020, the Company did not repurchase any shares of its outstanding common stock under its authorized stock repurchase program.
Dividends
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.63 per share for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and $0.21 per share for each of the three months ended June 30, 2020, September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2020 of $60.1 million and $0.5 million in cash related to dividend equivalent rights, for a total of $60.6 million.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, we paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.63 per share of $126.3 million and $1.1 million in cash related to dividend equivalent rights, for a total of $127.4 million.
On January 28, 2021, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share on our common stock, payable on March 18, 2021 to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 12, 2021.
Contractual Obligations
In the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. Our future cash payments associated with our contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments by type and period as of December 31, 2020 are summarized below:
(1) The deposits, non-recourse borrowings of consolidated securitization entities and long-term and other debt represent our estimated debt service obligations, including both principal and interest. Interest was based on the interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2020, applied to the contractual repayment period.
(2) ASC 740 obligations do not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $314.2 million, of which the timing remains uncertain.
(3) Purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and specifying all significant terms, including the following: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and approximate timing of the transaction. The purchase obligation amounts disclosed above represent estimates of the minimum for which we are obligated and the time period in which cash outflows will occur. Purchase orders and authorizations to purchase that involve no firm commitment from either party are excluded from the above table. Purchase obligations include sponsor commitments under our AIR MILES Reward Program, minimum payments under support and maintenance contracts and agreements to purchase other goods and services.
We believe that we will have access to sufficient resources to meet these commitments.
Inflation and Seasonality
Although we cannot precisely determine the impact of inflation on our operations, we do not believe that we have been significantly affected by inflation. For the most part, we have relied on operating efficiencies from scale, technology and expansion in lower cost jurisdictions in select circumstances, as well as decreases in technology and communication costs, to offset increased costs of employee compensation and other operating expenses. With respect to seasonality, our revenues, earnings and cash flows are affected by increased consumer spending patterns leading up to and including the holiday shopping period in the fourth quarter and, to a lesser extent, during the first quarter as credit card and loan receivable balances are paid down.
Legislative and Regulatory Matters
Comenity Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the State of Delaware and the FDIC. Comenity Capital Bank is subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by both the FDIC and the State of Utah. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, both Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of its assets and liabilities as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by these regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Both Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank are limited in the amounts that they can pay as dividends to ADSC.
On September 10, 2019, Comenity Capital Bank submitted a bank merger application to the FDIC seeking the FDIC’s approval to merge Comenity Bank with and into Comenity Capital Bank as the surviving bank entity. On the same date, Comenity Capital Bank and Comenity Bank each submitted counterpart bank merger applications to the Utah Department of Financial Institutions and the Delaware Office of the State Bank Commissioner, respectively, in
connection with the proposed merger. The merger application remains subject to regulatory review and approval and no guarantee can be provided as to the outcome or timing of such review.
Quantitative measures established by regulations to ensure capital adequacy require Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 and total capital to risk weighted assets and of Tier 1 capital to average assets. Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank are considered well capitalized. The actual capital ratios and minimum ratios as of December 31, 2020 are as follows:
Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank have adopted the option provided by the interim final rule issued by joint federal bank regulatory agencies, which largely delays the effects of CECL on its regulatory capital for two years, after which the effects will be phased-in over a three-year period from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. Under the interim final rule, the amount of adjustments to regulatory capital deferred until the phase-in period includes both the initial impact of our adoption of CECL at January 1, 2020 and 25% of subsequent changes in our allowance for credit losses during each quarter of the two-year period ended December 31, 2021.
Regulation RR adopted by the FDIC, the SEC, the Federal Reserve and certain other federal regulators mandates a minimum five percent risk retention requirement for securitizations. Such risk retention requirements may limit our liquidity by restricting the amount of asset-backed securities we are able to issue or affecting the timing of future issuances of asset-backed securities; we satisfy such risk retention requirements by maintaining a seller’s interest calculated in accordance with Regulation RR.
Discussion of Critical Accounting Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies that are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We continually evaluate our judgments and estimates in determination of our financial condition and operating results. Estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements and, accordingly, actual results could differ from these estimates, sometimes materially. Critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and require management’s most subjective judgments. The primary critical accounting estimates are described below.
Allowance for Loan Loss.
Effective January 1, 2020, we adopted ASC 326 on a modified retrospective approach and applied a CECL model to determine our allowance for loan loss. The allowance for loan loss is an estimate of expected credit losses, measured over the estimated life of our credit card and loan receivables that considers forecasts of future economic conditions in addition to information about past events and current conditions. The estimate under the CECL model is significantly influenced by the composition, characteristics and quality of our portfolio of credit card and loan receivables, as well as the prevailing economic conditions and forecasts utilized. The estimate of the allowance for loan loss includes an
estimate for uncollectible principal as well as unpaid interest and fees. Charge-offs of principal amounts, net of recoveries are deducted from the allowance. The allowance is maintained through an adjustment to the provision for loan loss and is evaluated for appropriateness. Prior to January 1, 2020, our allowance for loan loss was determined utilizing an incurred loss model under ASC 450, “Contingencies.”
In estimating our allowance for loan loss, for each identified group, we utilize various models and estimation techniques based on historical loss experience, current conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts and other relevant factors. These models utilize historical data and applicable macroeconomic variables with statistical analysis and behavioral relationships with credit performance. Our quantitative estimate of expected credit losses under CECL is impacted by certain forecasted economic factors. We consider the forecast used to be reasonable and supportable over the estimated life of the credit card and loan receivables, with no reversion period. In addition to the quantitative estimate of expected credit losses, we also incorporate qualitative adjustments for certain factors such as Company-specific risks, changes in current economic conditions that may not be captured in the quantitatively derived results, or other relevant factors to ensure the allowance for loan loss reflects our best estimate of current expected credit losses.
If we used different assumptions in estimating current expected credit losses, the impact to the allowance for loan loss could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. For example, a 100 basis point increase in the allowance as a percentage of the amortized cost of our credit card and loan receivables could have resulted in a change of approximately $164.9 million in the allowance for loan loss at December 31, 2020, with a corresponding change in the provision for loan loss.
Revenue Recognition.
We recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. In that determination, under ASC 606, we follow a five-step model that includes: (1) determination of whether a contract, an agreement between two or more parties that creates legally enforceable rights and obligations, exists; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognition of revenue when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.
We enter into contracts with customers that may include multiple performance obligations. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. If the standalone selling price is not directly observable, we estimate the standalone selling price based on either the adjusted market assessment or cost plus a margin approach.
Certain of our contracts may provide for variable consideration. We estimate these amounts based on either the expected amount or most likely amount to be provided to the customer to determine the transaction price for the contract. The estimation method is consistent for contracts with similar terms and is applied consistently throughout each contract. The estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of the anticipated performance and all information that is reasonably available.
AIR MILES Reward Program. The AIR MILES Reward Program collects fees from its sponsors based on the number of AIR MILES reward miles issued and, in limited circumstances, the number of AIR MILES reward miles redeemed. Because management has determined that the earnings process is not complete at the time an AIR MILES reward mile is issued, the recognition of redemption and service revenue is deferred. Under certain of our contracts, a portion of the consideration is paid to us upon the issuance of AIR MILES reward miles and a portion is paid at the time of redemption and therefore, we do not have a redemption obligation related to these contracts.
Total consideration from the issuance of AIR MILES reward miles is allocated to three performance obligations: redemption, service, and brand, based on a relative standalone selling price basis.
The estimated standalone selling price for the redemption and the service performance obligations are based on cost plus a reasonable margin. The estimated standalone selling price of the brand performance obligation is determined using a relief from royalty approach. Accordingly, management determines the estimated standalone selling price by considering multiple inputs and methods, including discounted cash flows and available market data in consideration of applicable margins and royalty rates to utilize. The number of AIR MILES reward miles issued and redeemed are
factored into the estimates, as management estimates the standalone selling prices and volumes over the term of the respective agreements in order to determine the allocation of consideration to each performance obligation delivered. The redemption performance obligation incorporates the expected number of AIR MILES reward miles to be redeemed, and therefore, the amount of redemption revenue recognized is subject to management’s estimate of breakage, or those AIR MILES reward miles estimated to be unredeemed by the collector base. Additionally, the estimated life of an AIR MILES reward mile impacts the timing of revenue recognition.
Breakage and the life of an AIR MILES reward mile are based on management’s estimate after viewing and analyzing various historical trends including vintage analysis, current run rates and other pertinent factors, such as the impact of macroeconomic factors and changes in the program structure.
For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, our estimated breakage rate remained 20%. Our cumulative redemption rate, which represents program to date redemptions divided by program to date issuance, is 69% as of December 31, 2020. We expect the ultimate redemption rate will approximate 80% based on our historical redemption patterns, statistical regression models, and consideration of enacted program changes, as applicable.
For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, our estimated life of an AIR MILES reward mile remained 38 months. We estimate that a change to the estimated life of an AIR MILES reward mile of one month would impact revenue by approximately $4 million. Any future changes in collector behavior could result in further changes in our estimates of breakage or life of an AIR MILES reward mile.
As of December 31, 2020, we had $1,004.0 million in deferred revenue related to the AIR MILES Reward Program that will be recognized in the future. Further information is provided in Note 3, “Revenue,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Goodwill.
We test goodwill for impairment annually, or when events and circumstances change that would indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
For the 2020 annual impairment test, we performed a quantitative analysis for the Card Services reporting unit and the reporting units within the LoyaltyOne segment, identified as BrandLoyalty and LoyaltyOne excluding BrandLoyalty. The fair value of the reporting units was estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on management's estimates of forecasted cash flows, with those cash flows discounted to present value using rates commensurate with the risks associated with those cash flows. The valuation includes assumptions related to revenue growth and profit performance, capital expenditures, the discount rate and other assumptions that are judgmental in nature. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the results of our tests for goodwill impairment. We determined there was no impairment of goodwill on these reporting units.
As of December 31, 2020, we had goodwill of approximately $1,369.6 million. The following table presents the percentage by which fair value of the reporting units exceeded carrying value as of the 2020 annual impairment test and goodwill for each respective reporting unit as of December 31, 2020:
As with all assumptions, there is an inherent level of uncertainty and actual results, to the extent they differ from those assumptions, could have a material impact on fair value. For example, a reduction in customer demand would impact our assumed growth rate resulting in a reduced fair value, or multiples for similar type reporting units could deteriorate due to changes in technology or a downturn in economic conditions. Potential events or circumstances could
have a negative effect on the estimated fair value. The loss of a major customer or program could have a significant impact on the future cash flows of the reporting unit(s).
We do not currently believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in estimates or assumptions used to test goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and continuing uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, future deterioration in the economy could adversely impact our reporting units and result in a goodwill impairment charge that could be material.
Income Taxes.
We account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 740, “Income Taxes.” The application of income tax law is inherently complex. Laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous. As such, we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures. Interpretations of, and guidance surrounding, income tax laws and regulations change over time. Changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of income. See Note 22, “Income Taxes,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail on our uncertain tax positions and further information regarding ASC 740.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See “Recently Issued Accounting Standards” under Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of certain accounting standards that we have recently adopted and certain accounting standards that we have not yet been required to adopt and may be applicable to our future financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.
