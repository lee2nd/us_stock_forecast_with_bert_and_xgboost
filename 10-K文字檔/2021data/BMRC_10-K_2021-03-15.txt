Forward-Looking Statements
The disclosures set forth in this item are qualified by important factors detailed in Part I captioned Forward-Looking Statements and ITEM 1A captioned Risk Factors of this report and other cautionary statements set forth elsewhere in the report.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The SEC requires us to disclose "critical accounting policies" defined as those that are both most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and imprecise. We consider accounting estimates to be critical to our financial results if (i) the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain, (ii) management could have applied different assumptions during the reported period, and (iii) changes in the accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur in the future and could have a material impact on our financial statements.
Management has determined the following accounting policies to be critical:

Executive Summary
Annual earnings were $30.2 million in 2020 compared to $34.2 million in 2019. Diluted earnings were $2.22 per share in 2020, compared to $2.48 per share in 2019.
The following are highlights of operating and financial performance for the year ended December 31, 2020:
•The Bank achieved total loan growth of $245.3 million, or 13% in 2020, to $2.089 billion at December 31, 2020, from $1.843 billion at December 31, 2019. SBA PPP loans outstanding at December 31, 2020 were $291.6 million.
•Credit quality remains strong with non-accrual loans representing 0.44% of the Bank's loan portfolio as of December 31, 2020. The adoption of CECL in the fourth quarter of 2020 resulted in an increase to the allowance for credit losses on loans of $748 thousand and a $1.1 million increase to the allowance for unfunded loan commitments. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for additional information.
•Deposits grew $167.8 million, or 7%, to $2.504 billion at December 31, 2020, compared to $2.336 billion at December 31, 2019. Non-interest bearing deposits grew by $225.8 million in 2020, or 20%, and made up 54% of total deposits at year-end. Cost of deposits remained low at 0.11% in 2020, compared to 0.20% in 2019.
•Net interest income totaled $96.7 million and $95.7 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The $1.0 million increase in 2020 was primarily due to SBA PPP loans and lower rates on interest-bearing deposits, largely offset by lower yields on earning-assets. The tax-equivalent net interest margin decreased to 3.55% in 2020, compared to 3.98% in 2019. The 43 basis point decrease was primarily due to lower yields across interest-earning asset categories, partially offset by lower rates on interest-bearing deposits.
•The efficiency ratio was 57.06% in 2020, up from 55.33% in 2019. Contributing to this increase was the decrease in net interest margin, higher provision for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments, and lower income from service charges on deposit accounts and ATM fees in 2020.
•For the year ended December 31, 2020, return on assets and return on equity were 1.04% and 8.60%, respectively, compared to 1.34% and 10.49% in the prior year.
•All capital ratios exceeded regulatory requirements. The total risk-based capital ratio for Bancorp was 16.0% at December 31, 2020 up from 15.1% at December 31, 2019. Tangible common equity to tangible assets was 11.3% at both December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 (See footnote 8, ITEM 6, Selected Financial Data, for the definition of this non-GAAP financial measure). The total risk-based capital ratio for the Bank was 15.8% at December 31, 2020 and 14.6% at December 31, 2019.
•The Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.23 per share on January 22, 2021. This was the 63rd consecutive quarterly dividend paid by Bank of Marin Bancorp. The cash dividend was paid on February 12, 2021 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 5, 2021.
•Our strong capital and liquidity position afforded us the opportunity to eliminate a high cost funding source. On March 15, 2021 we redeemed the $2.8 million subordinated debenture, which carried a rate of 5.68% in 2020. The redemption consisted of $4.1 million principal balance, quarterly interest due, and $1.3 million in accelerated accretion of purchase discount. The contractual interest rate on the subordinated debenture was 3-month LIBOR plus 1.40%, or 1.62% as of December 31, 2020.
COVID-19 Pandemic-Related Response Update - We have remained open and responded to customer needs throughout 2020. We more than doubled our charitable contributions to non-profit organizations in our community to over $1.0 million in 2020. In March 2020, we began waiving all ATM and overdraft fees and cancelling early withdrawal penalties for time certificate of deposits when allowed by law. We accommodated loan payment relief requests for borrowers with financial hardships and lowered interest rate floors on commercial Prime Rate loans. Under the provisions of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act") of 2020, Bank of Marin originated over 1,800 PPP loans to small businesses, reaching nearly 28,000 employees in our markets. In 2021, we are once again diligently working with our customers to accommodate requests for round two of PPP
loans under the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act ("Economic Aid Act"), which became law in December of 2020.
Paycheck Protection Program - While the PPP affords us an opportunity to assist our customers and community and requires a large of amount of human resources, the PPP loans do not pose a significant amount of risk of loss to the Bank as they are 100% guaranteed by the SBA. As of December 31, 2020, there were 1,777 PPP loans outstanding totaling $291.6 million, net of $5.4 million in unearned fees. During the fourth quarter Bank of Marin opened a secure PPP loan forgiveness application portal and gave all PPP borrowers access to apply. As of December 31, 2020 we received SBA loan forgiveness payments totaling $10.9 million for 35 loans that were forgiven. Of the total PPP loans remaining, 74% (1,309 loans) totaling $58.7 million are less than or equal to $150 thousand and have access to streamlined forgiveness processing. On January 19, 2021, the Bank launched the application process and began accepting loan requests for the second round of PPP, as revised by the Economic Aid Act. As of March 11, 2021, we have received 974 loan applications totaling $131.6 million.
Payment Relief - During 2020, in accordance with section 4013 of the CARES Act, subsequently amended by the Economic Aid Act, we elected to apply the temporary accounting relief provisions for loan modifications that met certain criteria, which would otherwise be designated as TDRs under existing GAAP. Of the 269 loans totaling $402.9 million granted payment relief since the onset of the pandemic, 222 loans or $324.2 million have resumed normal payments and 18 loans or $7.7 million paid off. As of December 31, 2020, 21 borrowing relationships with 29 loans totaling $71.0 million had requested additional payment relief. We know each of these clients very well and monitor their loans closely, and anticipate that the vast majority will work through current adverse conditions and resume making full payments. The following table summarizes these loans by industry or collateral type.
Looking forward into the new year, with a low cost and stable deposit base, opportunities for loan growth, and our unwavering commitment to relationship banking, we believe we are well-positioned to navigate the remaining stages of the pandemic and build new capabilities. We have ample liquidity and capital to support organic growth and acquisitions in coming years. Acquisitions remain a component of our strategic plan and we will continue to evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities that fit with our culture and add value for our shareholders. Our disciplined credit culture and relationship-focused banking continue to be critical components of our success.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Net Interest Income
Net interest income is the interest earned on loans, investment securities and other interest-earning assets minus the interest expense incurred on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is affected by changes in general market interest rates and by changes in the amounts and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Interest rate changes can create fluctuations in net interest income and/or margin due to an imbalance in the timing of repricing or maturity of assets or liabilities. We manage interest rate risk exposure with the goal of minimizing the effect of interest rate volatility on net interest income.
Net interest margin is expressed as net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Net interest rate spread is the difference between the average rate earned on total interest-earning assets and the average rate incurred on total interest-bearing liabilities. Both of these measures are reported on a taxable-equivalent basis. Net interest margin is the higher of the two because it reflects interest income earned on assets funded with non-interest-bearing sources of funds, which include demand deposits and stockholders’ equity.
The following table compares interest income, average interest-earning assets, interest expense, and average interest-bearing liabilities for the periods presented. The table also presents net interest income, net interest margin and net interest rate spread for the years indicated.
Table 2 Analysis of Changes in Net Interest Income
The following table presents the effects of changes in average balances (volume) or changes in average rates on tax-equivalent net interest income for the years indicated. Volume variances are equal to the increase or decrease in average balances multiplied by prior period rates. Rate variances are equal to the increase or decrease in rates multiplied by prior period average balances. Mix variances are attributable to the change in yields or rates multiplied by the change in average balances.
2020 Compared to 2019
Net interest income totaled $96.7 million and $95.7 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The $1.0 million increase in 2020 was primarily due to SBA PPP loans and lower rates on interest-bearing deposits, largely offset by lower yields on earning-assets, except for investment securities where we collected prepayment penalties on called securities in 2020. Notable balance increases occurred in interest-earning deposits with other banks, commercial real estate loans and deposits. The tax-equivalent net interest margin decreased 43 basis points to 3.55% in 2020, from 3.98% in 2019 for the reasons already mentioned and as shown in the above table. Additionally, the SBA PPP loans lowered the 2020 net interest margin by 6 basis points.
On March 15, 2021, we redeemed the $2.8 million subordinated debenture. The redemption consisted of $4.1 million principal balance, quarterly interest due, and $1.3 million in accelerated accretion of purchase discount. The contractual interest rate on the subordinated debenture was 3-month LIBOR plus 1.40%, or 1.62% as of December 31, 2020.
2019 Compared to 2018
Net interest income totaled $95.7 million and $91.5 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase of $4.2 million in 2019 was primarily due to higher average loan balances and assets yields across all categories and the early redemption of a high-rate subordinated debenture in the fourth quarter of 2018. Positive variances were partially offset by higher balances and rates on money market accounts. The tax-equivalent net interest margin increased eight basis points to 3.98% in 2019 compared to 3.90% in 2018 for the same reasons.
Market Interest Rates
Market interest rates are, in part, based on the target federal funds interest rate (the interest rate banks charge each other for short-term borrowings) implemented by the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee ("FOMC").
In response to the evolving risks to economic activity posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the FOMC made two emergency cuts totaling 150 basis points to the federal funds rate in March 2020. The federal funds target rate range resided between 0.0% to 0.25% for the majority of 2020, putting downward pressure on our asset yields and net interest margin. In each of its July, September and October 2019 meetings, the FOMC lowered the federal
funds target rate by 0.25% to a range of 1.50% to 1.75% at the end of 2019. During 2018, the FOMC made four 25-basis-point increases to a range of 2.25% to 2.50% as of December 2018.
A low interest rate environment will continue to put downward pressure on asset yields and net interest margin to be fully seen in future periods. See
