ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
General Overview
The Company is a leading independent provider of equipment and technology to the upstream oil and gas industry. With operations in approximately 573 locations across six continents, NOV designs, manufactures and services a comprehensive line of drilling, well servicing and offshore construction equipment; sells and rents drilling motors, specialized downhole tools, and rig instrumentation; performs inspection and internal coating of oilfield tubular products; provides drill cuttings separation, management and disposal systems and services; and provides expendables and spare parts used in conjunction with the Company’s large installed base of equipment. NOV also manufactures coiled tubing and high-pressure fiberglass and composite tubing and sells and rents advanced in-line inspection equipment to makers of oil country tubular goods. More recently, by applying its deep knowledge in technology, the Company has helped advance the transition toward sustainable energy. The Company has a long tradition of pioneering innovations which improve the cost-effectiveness, efficiency, safety, and environmental impact of oil and gas operations.
NOV’s revenue and operating results are principally directly related to the level of worldwide oil and gas drilling and production activities and the profitability and cash flow of oil and gas companies and drilling contractors, which in turn are affected by current and anticipated prices of oil and gas. Oil and gas prices have been and are likely to continue to be volatile. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors”. The Company conducts its operations through three business segments: Wellbore Technologies, Completion & Production Solutions and Rig Technologies. See Item 1. “Business”, for a discussion of each of these business segments.
Unless indicated otherwise, results of operations are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year financial statements in order for them to conform with the 2020 presentation. The Company discloses Adjusted EBITDA (defined as Operating Profit excluding Depreciation, Amortization and Other Items) in its periodic earnings press releases and other public disclosures to provide investors additional information about the results of ongoing operations. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations in Results of Operations for an explanation of our use of non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to their corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Operating Environment Overview
NOV’s results are dependent on, among other things, the level of worldwide oil and gas drilling, well remediation activity, the price of crude oil and natural gas, capital spending by exploration and production companies and drilling contractors, worldwide oil and gas inventory levels and, to a lesser degree, the level of investment in wind and geothermal energy products . Key industry indicators for the past three years include the following:

The average crude oil price for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $42.46 per barrel, and natural gas was $2.50 per mmbtu.
At February 5, 2021, there were 563 rigs actively drilling in North America, compared to the fourth quarter average of 400 rigs, an increase of 41 percent. The price for West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil was $56.852 per barrel at February 5, 2021, an increase of 34 percent from the fourth quarter of 2020 average. The price for natural gas was $2.86 per mmbtu at February 5, 2021, an increase of 15 percent from the fourth quarter of 2020 average.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
NOV Inc. generated revenue of $6.09 billion in 2020, which was lower from the prior year as COVID-19 related restrictions decreased economic activity, sharply lowering oil and gas prices, and declining drilling activity worldwide led to a 28 percent decline in revenue. Average 2020 worldwide rig count (as measured by Baker Hughes) decreased significantly when compared to 2019.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company reported an operating loss of $2,425 million compared to an operating loss of $6,279 million in 2019, and a net loss attributable to the Company of $2,542 million, or $6.62 per share compared to a net loss of $6,095 million or $15.96 per share during 2019.
For the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2020, revenue was $1.33 billion, a $57 million or four percent decrease compared to the third quarter of 2020. The Company reported a net loss of $347 million, or $0.90 per fully diluted share, a decrease of $292 million, or $0.76 per fully diluted share, from the third quarter of 2020. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, revenue decreased $954 million or 42 percent, and net income increased $38 million.
During the fourth quarter of 2020, third quarter of 2020, and fourth quarter of 2019, pre-tax other items: goodwill, intangible and long-lived asset impairment charges, inventory charges, severance accruals, and other charges and credits (collectively “Other Items”), were $236 million, $62 million, and $537 million, respectively. Excluding the Other Items from all periods, fourth quarter 2020 Adjusted EBITDA was $17 million, compared to $71 million in the third quarter of 2020 and $288 million in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Segment Performance
Wellbore Technologies
Wellbore Technologies generated revenues of $373 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of three percent from the third quarter of 2020 and a decrease of 51 percent from the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase in revenues resulted from increased drilling activity levels in North America partially offset by declines in international and offshore markets. Operating loss, which included $46 million in Other Items, was $78 million. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $9 million sequentially and $131 million from the prior year to $12 million, or 3.2 percent of sales.
Completion & Production Solutions
Completion & Production Solutions generated revenues of $546 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, a decrease of nine percent from the third quarter of 2020 and a decrease of 32 percent from the fourth quarter of 2019. Lower backlog and logistical disruptions from COVID-19-related restrictions contributed to the sequential decline. Operating loss, which included $43 million in Other Items, was $31 million. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $35 million sequentially and $68 million from the prior year to $28 million, or 5.1 percent of sales.
New orders booked improved 27 percent sequentially to $215 million, representing a book-to-bill of 66 percent when compared to the $328 million of orders shipped from backlog. Backlog for capital equipment orders for Completion & Production Solutions at December 31, 2020 was $696 million.
Rig Technologies
Rig Technologies generated revenues of $437 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, a decrease of three percent from the third quarter of 2020 and a decrease of 42 percent from the fourth quarter of 2019. Declining offshore drilling activity levels resulting in lower capital equipment backlog contributed to the sequential decline in revenues. Operating loss, which included $132 million in Other Items, was $132 million. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $9 million sequentially and $93 million from the prior year to $19 million, or 4.3 percent of sales.
New orders booked during the quarter totaled $190 million, representing a book-to-bill of 105 percent when compared to the $181 million of orders shipped from backlog. At December 31, 2020, backlog for capital equipment orders for Rig Technologies was $2.7 billion.
Oil & Gas Equipment and Services Market and Outlook
Following approximately two and a half years of steady improvements in oil prices and global drilling activity levels, prices declined sharply during the fourth quarter of 2018 due to stronger than expected growth in U.S. production and concerns regarding the global economy. As a result of reduced budgets, and despite a modest recovery in commodity prices, drilling activity levels in the U.S. declined throughout 2019 resulting in the first double digit percentage decrease in the average annual rig count since 2016. While the North American market deteriorated, the new-found capital austerity and fiscal discipline exhibited by U.S. operators along with declining production from underinvestment in overseas markets and rapidly growing demand for LNG inspired greater levels of confidence from international oil and gas companies. The industry entered 2020 anticipating higher international
and offshore activity levels would mostly offset the ongoing effects of capital austerity in the North American land marketplace.
During the first quarter of 2020, the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak rapidly spread across the world, driving sharp demand destruction for crude oil as countries took measures to curtail activity to slow the spread of the outbreak. In response to declining market share, members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producing countries (OPEC+), including Russia, increased production into the already oversupplied market, decimating oil prices and rapidly filling worldwide storage facilities. In April 2020, OPEC+ began to reduce production, which had only a muted positive effect on oil prices due to market concerns that the cuts were significantly less than the demand destruction caused by COVID-19. As a result, companies across the industry responded with severe capital spending budget cuts, cost cuts, personnel layoffs, facility closures and bankruptcy filings. The COVID-19 virus continued to spread throughout 2020, extending depressed demand, uncertainty and additional spending reductions by the entire oil and gas industry as the U.S. rig count fell to its lowest level since 1940 in August of 2020. In response to the economic destruction caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments implemented stimulus programs to aid individuals and businesses. The size, method and effectiveness of these programs varies greatly and, although generally helpful to the economy, they have not restored prior levels of demand for oil and gas.
During the fourth quarter of 2020 rising activity levels in the U.S. drove higher revenues for NOV’s short-cycle businesses in North America. These modest improvements were offset by a decline in international drilling activity and limited demand for capital equipment. Management expects industry activity levels and spending by customers to remain depressed during the beginning of 2021, as demand destruction from COVID-19 persists, but is optimistic that improving commodity prices, rising activity, and the actions NOV is taking to position its business for the future will result in improved profitability over the course of 2021. NOV remains committed to streamlining operations and improving organizational efficiencies while focusing on investing in innovative products and services, including environmentally friendly technologies, that are responsive to the longer-term needs of our customers. We believe this strategy will further advance the Company’s competitive position, regardless of the market environment.
Results of Operations
The following table summarizes the Company’s revenue and operating profit (loss) by operating segment (in millions):
Years Ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019
Wellbore Technologies
Revenue from Wellbore Technologies for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1,867 million, a decrease of $1,347 million (-42%) compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
Operating loss from Wellbore Technologies was $858 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $2,693 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Operating loss percentage for 2020 was -46.0% compared to an operating loss percentage of -110.5% percent in 2019.
Other Items included in operating loss for Wellbore Technologies were $849 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $3,794 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Completion & Production Solutions
Revenue from Completion & Production Solutions for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $2,433 million, a decrease of $338 million (-12%) compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
Operating loss from Completion & Production Solutions was $977 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to an operating loss of $1,934 million for 2019, an increase of $957 million. Operating loss percentage for 2020 was -40.2% compared to -69.8% in 2019.
Included in operating loss are Other Items related to impairment charges, inventory charges, severance accruals and other charges and credits. Other items included in operating loss for Completion & Production Solutions was $1,132 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $2,042 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The Completion & Production Solutions segment monitors its capital equipment backlog to plan its business. New orders are added to backlog only when the Company receives a firm written order for major completion and production components or a signed contract related to a construction project. The capital equipment backlog was $695 million at December 31, 2020, a decrease of $610 million, or 47 percent from backlog of $1,305 million at December 31, 2019. Numerous factors may affect the timing of revenue out of backlog. Considering these factors, the Company reasonably expects approximately $621 million of revenue out of backlog in 2021 and approximately $74 million of revenue out of backlog in 2022 and thereafter. At December 31, 2020, approximately 63 percent of the capital equipment backlog was for offshore products and approximately 88 percent of the capital equipment backlog was destined for international markets.
Rig Technologies
Revenue from Rig Technologies for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1,919 million, a decrease of $763 million (-28%) compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
Operating loss from Rig Technologies was $362 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $162 million compared to 2019. Operating loss percentage for 2020 was -18.9% compared to -19.5% in 2019.
Included in operating loss are Other Items related to severance and facility closures, and asset write-downs. Other Items included in operating loss for Rig Technologies were $402 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $784 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The Rig Technologies segment monitors its capital equipment backlog to plan its business. New orders are added to backlog only when the Company receives a firm written order for major drilling rig components or a signed contract related to a construction project. The capital equipment backlog was $2.7 billion at December 31, 2020, a decrease of $325 million, or 11 percent, from backlog of $3.0 billion at December 31, 2019. Numerous factors may affect the timing of revenue out of backlog. Considering these factors, the Company reasonably expects approximately $556 million of revenue out of backlog in 2021 and the remaining in 2022 and thereafter. At December 31, 2020, approximately 24% of the capital equipment backlog was for offshore products and approximately 90 percent of the capital equipment backlog was destined for international markets.
Eliminations and corporate costs
Eliminations and corporate costs were $228 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $270 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This change is primarily due to a decrease in intersegment sales. Sales from one segment to another generally are priced at estimated equivalent commercial selling prices; however, segments originating an external sale are credited with the full profit to the Company. Eliminations and corporate costs include intercompany transactions conducted between the three reporting segments that are eliminated in consolidation, as well as corporate costs not allocated to the segments. Intercompany transactions within each reporting segment are eliminated within each reporting segment.
Other income (expense), net
Other income (expense), net was income of $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to expense of $90 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in expense was primarily due to lower foreign exchange losses for 2020.
Provision for income taxes
The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 8.7%, compared to 5.7% for 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020 the effective tax rate was negatively impacted by the impairment of nondeductible goodwill and the establishment of additional valuation allowances for current year losses and other tax attributes, partially offset by the release of valuation allowance as a result of (a) the carryback of $591 million of US net operating losses from 2019 to 2014 pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economy Security Act (CARES Act) and (b) the filing of an amended US tax return to deduct foreign tax credits and carryback the resulting $287 million US net operating loss from 2016 to 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the effective tax rate was negatively impacted by the impairment of nondeductible goodwill and the establishment of additional valuation allowance partially offset by the reduction in uncertain tax positions due to settlements.

The following tables set forth the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most comparable GAAP financial measure (in millions):
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At December 31, 2020, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $1,692 million, and total debt of $1,834 million. At December 31, 2019, cash and cash equivalents were $1,171 million and total debt was $1,989 million. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $1,037 million of the $1,692 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries and the earnings associated with this cash could be subject to foreign withholding taxes and incremental U.S. taxation. If opportunities to invest in the U.S. are greater than available cash balances that are not subject to income tax, rather than repatriating cash, the Company may choose to borrow against its revolving credit facility.
The Company has a $2.0 billion, five-year unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires on October 30, 2024. The Company has the right to increase the commitments under this agreement to an aggregate amount of up to $3.0 billion upon the consent of only those lenders holding any such increase. Interest under the multicurrency facility is based upon LIBOR, NIBOR or CDOR plus 1.125% subject to a ratings-based grid or the U.S. prime rate. The credit facility contains a financial covenant regarding maximum debt-to-capitalization ratio of 60%. As of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 28.4% and had no outstanding letters of credit issued under the facility, resulting in $2.0 billion of available funds.
The Company also has a $150 million bank line of credit for the construction of a facility in Saudi Arabia. Interest under the bank line of credit is based upon LIBOR plus 1.40%. The bank line of credit contains a financial covenant regarding maximum debt-to-equity ratio of 75%. As of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance.
On August 25, 2020, the Company completed a cash tender offer for $217.3 million of its 2.60% unsecured Senior Notes using available cash balances. The Company paid $226 million, which included a redemption premium of $7.6 million as well as accrued and unpaid interest of $1.3 million. As a result of the redemption, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $8.2 million, which included the redemption premium of $7.6 million and non-cash charges of $0.6 million attributable to the write-off of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs.
The Company’s outstanding debt at December 31, 2020 was $1,834 million and consisted of $182 million in 2.60% Senior Notes, $493 million in 3.60% Senior Notes, $1,089 million in 3.95% Senior Notes, no commercial paper borrowings, and other debt of $70 million. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2020.
The Company had $446 million of outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2020 that are under various bilateral letter of credit facilities. Letters of credit are issued as bid bonds, advanced payment bonds and performance bonds
The following table summarizes our net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities for the periods presented (in millions):
Significant sources and uses of cash during 2020
•
Cash flows provided by operating activities was $926 million. This included changes in the primary components of our working capital (receivables, inventories, and accounts payable), primarily related to strong collections on accounts receivable.
•
Capital expenditures were $226 million.
•
We paid $19 million in dividends to our shareholders.
Oil and Gas Market Downturn and COVID-19 Pandemic
Since the oil and gas market downturn began in late 2014, the Company has maintained a continuous process of actively managing its strategy, structure and resources to the changing market conditions and new realities. The Company has closed or realigned hundreds of facilities, reduced headcount, sharply lowered costs and reviewed all product lines for acceptable returns in the evolved market. Additionally, the Company has proactively reduced the balances and extended the maturity profile of its debt. In the fall of 2019, the Company retired $1 billion of notes
due 2022 for cash, issued $500 million of notes due 2029 and extended the maturity of its undrawn credit facility to 2024. In August 2020, the Company completed a tender on $217 million of the remaining 2022 notes, further reducing its amount of debt outstanding. While aggressively matching size and spend to the market, and protecting its balance sheet, the Company has continued investing in new products and technologies that enable its customers to improve their operational efficiencies.
When the COVID-19 global pandemic and OPEC+ actions further depressed oil prices and industry activity beginning in March of 2020, the Company’s prior prudent actions helped ensure adequate available resources. Management intends to continue managing the business to the market realities to ensure the Company’s access to capital remains sufficient. See Item 1A Risk Factors.
Other
The effect of the change in exchange rates on cash was a decrease of ($2) million, ($8) million and ($44) million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
We believe that cash on hand, cash generated from operations and amounts available under our credit facilities and from other sources of debt will be sufficient to fund operations, working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, dividends and financing obligations.
We intend to pursue additional acquisition candidates, but the timing, size or success of any acquisition effort and the related potential capital commitments cannot be predicted. We continue to expect to fund future cash acquisitions primarily with cash flow from operations and borrowings, including the unborrowed portion of the revolving credit facility or new debt issuances, but may also issue additional equity either directly or in connection with acquisitions. There can be no assurance that additional financing for acquisitions will be available at terms acceptable to us.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $57 million of unrecognized tax benefits. This represents the tax benefits associated with various tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, on domestic and international tax returns that have not been recognized in our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution. Due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with these unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. For further information related to unrecognized tax benefits, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
In preparing the financial statements, we make assumptions, estimates and judgements that affect the amounts reported. We periodically evaluate our estimates and judgements that are most critical in nature which are related to revenue recognition under long-term construction contracts; allowance for doubtful accounts; inventory reserves; impairments of long-lived assets (excluding goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets); impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets; purchase price allocation of acquisitions; service and product warranties and income taxes. Our estimates are based on historical experience and on our future expectations that we believe are reasonable. The combination of these factors forms the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results are likely to differ from our current estimates and those differences may be material.
Revenue Recognition
The majority of the Company’s revenue streams record revenue at a point in time when a performance obligation has been satisfied by transferring control of promised goods or services to a customer. Products and services are sold or rented based upon a fixed or determinable price and do not generally include significant post-delivery obligations. Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type. We have elected to apply the practical expedient that does not require an adjustment for a financing component if, at contract inception, the period between when we transfer the promised goods or service to the customer and when the customer pays for the goods or service is one year or less. Shipping and handling costs are recognized when incurred and are treated as costs to fulfill the original performance obligation.
Revenue is often generated from contracts that include multiple performance obligations. Using significant judgement, the Company considers the degree of customization, integration and interdependency of the related products and services when assessing distinct performance obligations within one contract. Stand-alone selling price (“SSP”) for each distinct performance obligation is generally determined using the price at which the products and services would be sold separately to the customer. Discounts, when provided, are allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services.
For revenue that is not recognized at a point in time, the Company follows accounting guidance for revenue recognized over time, as follows:
Revenue Recognition under Long-term Construction Contracts
Revenue is recognized over-time for certain long-term construction contracts in the Completion & Production Solutions and Rig Technologies segments. These contracts include custom designs for customer-specific applications that are unique and require significant engineering efforts. Revenue is recognized as work progresses on each contract. Right to payment is enforceable for performance completed to date, including a reasonable profit.
We generally use the cost-to-cost (input) measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of assets to the customer which occurs as we incur costs. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, progress towards completion of each contract is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Revenues, including estimated fees or profits, are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. These costs include labor, materials, subcontractors’ costs, and other direct costs. Any expected losses on a project are recorded in full in the period in which the loss becomes probable.
These long-term construction contracts generally include a significant service of integrating a complex set of tasks and components into a single project or capability, so are accounted for as one performance obligation.
Estimating total revenue and cost at completion of long-term construction contracts is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgement. It is common for our long-term contracts to contain late delivery fees, work performance guarantees, and other provisions that can either increase or decrease the transaction price. We estimate variable consideration as the most likely amount we expect to receive. We include variable consideration in the estimated transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur, or when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Our estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based on an assessment of our anticipated performance and historical, current and forecasted information that is reasonably available to us. Net revenue recognized from performance obligations satisfied in previous periods was $41 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to change orders.
Service and Repair Work
For service and repair contracts, revenue is recognized over time. We generally use the output method to measure progress on service contracts due to the manner in which the customer receives and derives value from the services provided. For repair contracts, we generally use the cost-to-cost measure of progress because it best depicts the transfer of assets to the customer.
Remaining Performance Obligations
Remaining performance obligations represent the transaction price of firm orders for all revenue streams for which work has not been performed on contracts with an original expected duration of one year or more. We do not disclose the remaining performance obligations of royalty contracts, service contracts for which there is a right to invoice, and short-term contracts that are expected to have a duration of one year or less.
As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $3,693 million. The Company expects to recognize approximately $905 million in revenue for the remaining performance obligations in 2021 and $2,788 million in 2022 and thereafter.
Costs to Obtain and Fulfill a Contract
We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract, such as sales commissions, with a customer when we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. Costs to fulfill a contract, such as set-up and mobilization costs, are also capitalized when we expect to recover those costs. These contract costs are deferred and amortized over the period of contract performance. Total capitalized costs to obtain and fulfill a contract and the related amortization were immaterial during the periods presented and are included in other current and long-term assets on our consolidated balance sheets. We apply the practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the amortization period would have been one year or less.
Inventory Reserves
Inventory is carried at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. The Company reviews historical usage of inventory on-hand, assumptions about future demand and market conditions, current cost and estimates about potential alternative uses, which are limited, to estimate net realizable value. The Company’s inventory consists of finished goods, spare parts, work in process, and raw materials to support ongoing manufacturing operations and the Company’s large installed base of highly specialized oilfield equipment. The Company’s estimated carrying value of inventory depends upon demand largely driven by levels of oil and gas well drilling and remediation activity, which depends in turn upon oil and gas prices, the general outlook for economic growth worldwide, available financing for the Company’s customers, political stability and governmental regulation in major oil and gas producing areas, and the potential obsolescence of various types of equipment we sell, among other factors.
Based on an update of our assumptions at each point in time related to estimates of future demand, during 2020, 2019, and 2018 we recorded charges for additions to inventory reserves of $367 million, $659 million, and $49 million, respectively, consisting primarily of obsolete and surplus inventories. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, inventory reserves totaled $577 million and $843 million, or 29.1% and 27.7% of gross inventory, respectively.
Throughout the downturn the Company has continued to invest in developing and advancing products and technologies, contributing to the obsolescence of certain older products in a dramatically-shifted and more highly competitive recovering market, but also ensuring that the portfolio of products and services offered by the Company will meet customer needs in 2021 and beyond.
We will continue to assess our inventory levels and inventory offerings for our customers, which could require the Company to record additional allowances to reduce the value of its inventory. Such changes in our estimates or assumptions could be material under weaker market conditions or outlook.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets (Excluding Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets)
Long-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment and identified intangible assets, comprise a significant amount of the Company’s total assets. The Company makes judgements and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of these assets, including amounts to be capitalized, depreciation and amortization methods and estimated useful lives.
The carrying values of these assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows. We estimate the fair value of these intangible and fixed assets using an income approach. This requires the Company to
make long-term forecasts of its future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review. These forecasts require assumptions about demand for the Company’s products and services, future market conditions and technological developments. The forecasts are dependent upon assumptions regarding oil and gas prices, the general outlook for economic growth worldwide, available financing for the Company’s customers, political stability in major oil and gas producing areas, and the potential obsolescence of various types of equipment we sell, among other factors. The financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our income forecast. Changes to these assumptions, including, but not limited to: sustained declines in worldwide rig counts below current analysts’ forecasts, collapse of spot and futures prices for oil and gas, significant deterioration of external financing for our customers, higher risk premiums or higher cost of equity, or any other significant adverse economic news could require a provision for impairment in a future period.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded $513 million in impairment charges related to long-lived assets. See Note 6 - Asset Impairments (Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.
Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
The Company has approximately $1.5 billion of goodwill and $0.2 billion of other intangible assets with indefinite lives as of December 31, 2020. Generally accepted accounting principles require the Company to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets might be impaired. Events or circumstances which could indicate a potential impairment include (but are not limited to) a significant sustained reduction in worldwide oil and gas prices or drilling; a significant sustained reduction in profitability or cash flow of oil and gas companies or drilling contractors; a sustained reduction in the market capitalization of the Company; a significant sustained reduction in capital investment by drilling companies and oil and gas companies; or a significant sustained increase in worldwide inventories of oil or gas.
The Company performs its goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test based on the Company’s discounted cash flow analysis. The discounted cash flow is based on management’s forecast of operating performance for each reporting unit. The two main assumptions used in measuring goodwill impairment, which bear the risk of change and could impact the Company’s goodwill impairment analysis, include the cash flow from operations from each of the Company’s individual Reporting Units and the weighted average cost of capital. The starting point for each of the reporting unit’s cash flow from operations is the detailed annual plan or updated forecast. Cash flows beyond the specific operating plans were estimated using a terminal value calculation, which incorporated historical and forecasted financial cyclical trends for each reporting unit and considered long-term earnings growth rates. The financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate. During times of volatility, significant judgement must be applied to determine whether credit changes are a short-term or long-term trend.
While the Company primarily uses the discounted cash flow method to assess fair value, the Company uses the comparable companies and representative transaction methods to validate the discounted cash flow analysis and further support management’s expectations, where possible. The valuation techniques used in the annual test were consistent with those used during previous testing. The inputs used in the annual test were updated for current market conditions and forecasts.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded $3,509 million in impairment charges to goodwill and $103 million in charges to indefinite-lived intangible assets. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a $1,295 million in impairment charges to goodwill and $83 million in charges to indefinite-lived intangible assets. See Note 6 - Asset Impairments (Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.
Income Taxes
The Company is U.S. registered and is subject to income taxes in the U.S. The Company operates through various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world. Income taxes have been recorded based upon the tax laws and rates of the countries in which the Company operates and income is earned.
The Company’s annual tax provision is based on taxable income, statutory rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. The determination and evaluation of the annual tax provision and tax positions involves the interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. It requires significant judgement and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount, timing and character of income, deductions and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, and treaties, foreign currency exchange restrictions or the Company’s level of operations or profitability in each jurisdiction could impact the tax liability in any given year. The Company also operates in many jurisdictions where the tax laws relating to the pricing of transactions between related parties are open to interpretation, which could potentially result in aggressive tax authorities asserting additional tax liabilities with no offsetting tax recovery in other countries.
The Company maintains liabilities for estimated tax exposures in jurisdictions of operation. The annual tax provision includes the impact of income tax provisions and benefits for changes to liabilities that the Company considers appropriate, as well as related interest. Tax exposure items primarily include potential challenges to intercompany pricing and certain operating expenses that may not be deductible in foreign jurisdictions. These exposures are resolved primarily through the settlement of audits within these tax jurisdictions or by judicial means. The Company is subject to audits by federal, state and foreign jurisdictions which may result in proposed assessments. The Company believes that an appropriate liability has been established for estimated exposures under the guidance in ASC Topic 740 “Income Taxes” (“ASC Topic 740”). However, actual results may differ materially from these estimates. The Company reviews these liabilities quarterly and to the extent audits or other events result in an adjustment to the liability accrued for a prior year, the effect will be recognized in the period of the event.
The Company currently has recorded valuation allowances that the Company intends to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in the Company’s valuation allowances. The realization of remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income. Any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that the Company record an additional valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on future earnings.
After considering the impact of losses incurred in 2020, the Company has determined that it no longer has net undistributed earnings subject to a permanent reinvestment assertion.
