Overview
First Financial Northwest Bank is a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Financial Northwest and, as such, comprises substantially all of the activity for First Financial Northwest. First Financial Northwest Bank was a community-based savings bank until February 4, 2016, when the Bank converted to a Washington state chartered commercial bank reflecting the commercial banking services it now provides to its customers. The Bank primarily serves King, Snohomish, Pierce and Kitsap counties, Washington through its full-service banking office and headquarters in Renton, Washington, as well as six retail branches in King County, Washington, five retail branches in Snohomish County, Washington, and two retail branches in Pierce County, Washington at December 31, 2020. The Bank purchased four of these branches in 2017 and acquired $74.7 million in deposits (the “Branch Acquisition”). The Branch Acquisition expanded our retail footprint and provided an
opportunity to extend our unique brand of community banking into those communities. In addition, the Bank opened a new branch office in Issaquah, Washington in March 2021.
The Bank’s business consists predominantly of attracting deposits from the general public, combined with borrowing from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines (“FHLB”) and raising funds in the wholesale market, then utilizing these funds to originate one-to-four family residential, multifamily, commercial real estate, construction/land, business, and consumer loans.
Our current business strategy emphasizes commercial real estate, construction, one-to-four family residential, and multifamily lending. With the current low interest rate environment, we are not aggressively pursuing longer term assets, but rather are focused on financing shorter term loans and loans with adjustable interest rates. During 2020, repayments of loans moderately outpaced originations of new loans and refinances, resulting in net loans receivable of $1.10 billion at December 31, 2020, as compared to $1.11 billion at December 31, 2019. Originations of construction/land loans were $62.4 million in 2020 as compared to $110.0 million in 2019, resulting in this portfolio decreasing to $92.2 million at December 31, 2020 as compared to $113.7 million at December 31, 2019. We anticipate that construction/land lending will continue to be a strong element of our total loan portfolio in future periods. We will continue to take a disciplined approach in our construction/land lending by concentrating our efforts on residential loans to builders known to us, including multifamily loans to developers with proven success in this type of construction. These loans typically mature in six to eighteen months and funding is usually not fully disbursed at origination, therefore the impact to net loans receivable is generally minimal in the short term.
We have also geographically expanded our loan portfolio through loan purchases or loan participations of commercial and multifamily real estate loans, as well as consumer classic car loans, that are outside of our primary market area. Through our efforts to geographically diversify our loan portfolio with direct loan originations, loan participations, or loan purchases, our portfolio includes $140.7 million of loans to borrowers or secured by properties located in 43 other states, including concentrations in California, Utah, Oregon, Georgia and Florida of $34.8 million, $16.0 million, $11.4 million, $8.4 million and $8.0 million, respectively at December 31, 2020.
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2020, was $8.6 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, compared to $10.4 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2019. The most significant contributor to this decrease was a $2.2 million increase in the provision for loan losses in 2020. primarily as a result of changes in qualitative economic factors utilized to calculate our general reserves for the ALLL and declines in the risk grades on certain loans, reflecting the probable loan losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic based upon the financial conditions and economic outlook that existed as of December 31, 2020. Net interest income increased by $1.6 million, primarily as a result of reductions in the cost of our deposit liabilities. Noninterest expenses increased by $2.1 million, reflecting continued growth in our operations.
Our primary source of revenue is interest income, which is the income that we earn on our loans and investments. Interest expense is the interest that we pay on our deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense. Changes in levels of interest rates affect interest income and interest expense differently and, thus, impacts our net interest income. First Financial Northwest Bank is generally liability-sensitive, meaning our interest-bearing liabilities reprice at a faster rate than our interest-earning assets. The significant 150 basis point reduction in the targeted federal funds rate during the quarter ended March 31, 2020 resulted in a larger impact to our interest-earning assets than to our interest-bearing liabilities, thereby decreasing our net interest margin to 3.15% for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 3.19% for the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, our net interest margin was adversely impacted by the low loan yields from the PPP loan portfolio. The ongoing low interest rate environment is expected to continue to put downward pressure on loan yields and the yields on other floating rate interest earning assets as well. Further, because the length of the COVID-19 pandemic and the efficacy of the extraordinary measures put in place to address its economic consequences are unknown, until the pandemic subsides, the Company expects its net interest income and net interest margin may be adversely affected in the near term, if not longer.
An offset to net interest income is the provision for loan losses, or the recapture of the provision for loan losses, that is required to establish the ALLL at a level that adequately provides for probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio. As our loan portfolio increases, or due to an increase for probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio, our ALLL may increase, resulting in a decrease to net interest income after the provision. Improvements in loan risk ratings, increases in property values, or receipt of recoveries of amounts previously charged off may partially or fully offset any required increase to ALLL due to loan growth or an increase in probable loan losses. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had a provision of $1.9 million as compared to a recapture of provision of $300,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The provision was primarily the result of the downgrade in the loan risk ratings of $61.0 million of loans, primarily loans receiving an additional COVID-19 related
payment deferral under the CARES Act combined with increases in probable loan losses for all loan categories in response to the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, with higher potential impact allocated to commercial real estate and construction/land portfolios. The recapture of provision for loan losses in 2019 was primarily the result of a construction/land loan with a balance of $12.5 million at December 31, 2019, that was technically in default and classified as impaired, however, the Bank’s impairment analysis concluded there were no anticipated losses from the loan at that time, and therefore, funds previously allocated in the ALLL to this loan were recaptured. The construction portion of this loan was fully funded and completed in 2020, and was rolled into a permanent commercial real estate loan. At December 31, 2020, this loan was current on its payments and was performing according to the terms of the loan. We will continue to monitor our loan portfolio and make adjustments to our ALLL as we deem necessary.
Noninterest income is generated from various loan or deposit fees, increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance (“BOLI”), and revenue earned on our wealth management brokerage services. This income is increased or partially offset by any net gain or loss on sales of investment securities. Our noninterest income increased $301,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to a $603,000 increase in loan related fees, partially offset by a $216,000 decrease in the wealth management revenue and a $65,000 decrease in net gain on sales of investments.
Our noninterest expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits, professional fees, regulatory assessments, occupancy and equipment, and other general and administrative expenses. Salaries and employee benefits consist primarily of the salaries and wages paid to our employees, payroll taxes, expenses for retirement, and other employee benefits. OREO-related expenses consist primarily of maintenance and costs of utilities for the OREO inventory, market valuation adjustments, build-out expenses, gains and losses from OREO sales, legal fees, real estate taxes, and insurance related to the properties included in the OREO inventory. Professional fees include legal services, auditing and accounting services, computer support services, and other professional services in support of strategic plans. Occupancy and equipment expenses, which are the fixed and variable costs of buildings and equipment, consist primarily of lease expenses, real estate taxes, depreciation expenses, maintenance, and costs of utilities. Also included in noninterest expense are changes to the Company’s unfunded commitment reserve which are reflected in general and administrative expenses. This unfunded commitment reserve expense can vary significantly each quarter, based on the amount believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses related to unfunded credit facilities, and reflects changes in the amounts that the Company has committed to fund but has not yet disbursed. Our noninterest expenses increased $2.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to a $791,000 increase in data processing expenses, a $525,000 increase in occupancy and equipment expenses, and a $444,000 increase in salaries and employee benefits.
COVID-19 Related Information
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bank is committed to providing assistance to its customers. Under the CARES Act, the Bank is providing certain short-term loan modifications. In addition, the Bank is participating in the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) as a lender. Some of the PPP loans we originated were for our existing customers, however we also provided PPP loans to those in our community who have not had a banking relationship with us in the past. The initial deadline for PPP loan applications to the SBA was August 8, 2020. Under this program, we funded 462 applications totaling $52.1 million of loans in our market areas and began processing applications for loan forgiveness in the fourth quarter of 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had received approval for forgiveness on 146 PPP loans totaling $11.2 million. At December 31, 2020, the Bank held 372 PPP loans totaling $41.3 million to qualifying businesses in its market areas, which included $434,000 of forgiven loans awaiting payments from the SBA. The CAA, 2021 renewed and extended the PPP until March 31, 2021, by authorizing an additional $284.5 billion for the program. As a result, in January 2021, the Bank began accepting and processing loan applications under this second PPP program. The SBA has recently released a simplified forgiveness process for PPP loans of $150,000 or less. At December 31, 2020 the Bank held 307 PPP loans of $150,000 or less with a combined balance of $13.5 million. We will also continue working with our customers to assist them with accessing other borrowing options, including SBA and other government sponsored lending programs, as appropriate.
The CARES Act and related bank regulatory guidance provided that short-term modifications of loans as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, made on a good faith basis to borrowers who were current as defined under the CARES Act prior to any relief, are not TDRs. This includes short-term modifications (e.g. generally up to 6 months) such as payment deferrals, fee waivers, extensions of repayment terms, or other delays in payment that are insignificant. To qualify as an eligible loan under the CARES Act, as amended by the CAA, 2021, a loan modification must be (1) related to the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) executed on a loan that was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019; and (3) executed between March 1, 2020, and the earlier of (A) 60 days after the date of termination of the National Emergency by the President or (B) January 1, 2022.
The primary method of relief granted by the Company is to allow the borrower to defer their loan payments for three to six months. Certain borrowers are allowed to pay interest only or have payment deferrals for periods longer than six months depending upon their specific circumstances. Deferred principal and interest amounts are added as a balloon payment due at the original maturity date or payoff of the loan.
At December 31, 2020, total loans with modifications granted were $45.2 million, or 4.0% of total loans outstanding. At that date, $90.8 million of total loans receivable that previously received a loan modification had resumed making normal scheduled loan payments. As of December 31, 2020, $44.4 million in loans had been granted modifications of greater than six months, of which $30.5 million were for loans in the hotel/motel category. In addition, eight loans, totaling $14.2 million, had been granted a second, third, or fourth payment deferment period.
The following table shows the balance of loans remaining on COVID-19 payment deferral modification at December 31, 2020, in accordance with the CARES Act:

Total loans with modifications granted were $45.2 million, or 4.0% of total loans outstanding, at December 31, 2020, including $44.4 million in loans that had been granted modifications of greater than six months, of which $30.5 million were for loans in the hotel/motel category. Prior to their modifications, the loans included in the above table were current on their loan payments. The Bank is monitoring its loan portfolio for delinquencies of loans that have not requested modifications under the CARES Act.
Business Strategy
Our long-term business strategy is to operate and grow First Financial Northwest Bank as a well-capitalized and profitable community bank, offering one-to-four family residential, commercial and multifamily, construction/land, consumer and business loans along with a diversified array of deposit and other products and services to individuals and businesses in our market areas. We intend to accomplish this strategy by leveraging our established name and franchise, capital strength, and loan production capability by:
•Capitalizing on our intimate knowledge of our local communities to serve the convenience and needs of customers, and delivering a consistent, high-quality level of professional service;
•Offering competitive deposit rates and developing customer relationships to diversify our deposit mix, growing lower cost deposits, attracting new customers, and expanding our footprint in the geographical area we serve;
•Utilizing wholesale funding sources, including but not limited to FHLB advances and acquiring deposits in the national brokered certificate of deposit market, to assist with funding needs and interest rate risk management efforts, as needed;
•Managing our loan portfolio to minimize concentration risk and diversify the types of loans within the portfolio;
•Managing credit risk to minimize the risk of loss and interest rate risk to optimize our net interest margin; and
•Improving profitability through disciplined pricing, expense control and balance sheet management, while continuing to provide excellent customer service.
As noted above, one of the Bank’s strategic initiatives seek to diversify our loan portfolio and broaden growth opportunities consistent with its current risk tolerance levels and asset/liability objectives. The Bank has created an SBA department, with the goal of achieving SBA preferred lender status in 2021, which would provide the Bank with delegated loan approval as well as closing and most servicing and liquidation authority, enabling the Bank to make loan decisions more rapidly. In addition, the Bank plans to increase originations of the business loan portfolio, which may include business lines of credit, business term loans, equipment financing, and a focus on industry specific loans, such as green energy financing. In conjunction with the growth of business loans, the Bank seeks to service these customers with their business deposits as well.
Critical Accounting Policies
Critical accounting policies are those that involve significant judgments and assumptions by management and that have, or could have, a material impact on our income or the carrying value of our assets. The following are our critical accounting policies.
Allowance for Loan Losses. Management recognizes that loan losses may occur over the life of a loan and that the ALLL must be maintained at a level necessary to absorb specific losses on impaired loans and probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Our methodology for analyzing the ALLL consists of two components: general and specific allowances. The general allowance is determined by applying factors to our various groups of loans. Management considers factors such as charge-off history, the current and expected economic conditions, borrower’s ability to repay, the regulatory environment, competition, geographic and loan type concentrations, policy and underwriting standards, nature and volume of the loan portfolio, management’s experience level, our loan review and grading systems, the value of underlying collateral, and the level of problem loans in assessing the ALLL. Specific allowances result when management performs an impairment analysis on a loan when it determines it is probable that all contractual amounts of principal and interest will not be paid as scheduled. The analysis usually occurs when a loan has been classified as substandard or placed on nonaccrual status or is a TDR because the borrower has been granted a rate concession. If the market value less costs to sell (“market value”) of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, impairment is recognized by establishing a specific reserve in the ALLL for the loan or by adjusting an existing reserve amount. The amount of the specific reserve is computed using current appraisals, listed sales prices, and other available information less costs to complete, if any, and costs to sell the property. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available or as future events differ from predictions. In addition, specific reserves may be created upon a loan’s restructuring, based on a discounted cash flow analysis, comparing the present value of the anticipated repayments under the restructured terms to the outstanding principal balance of the loan.
Our Board of Directors’ Internal Asset Review Committee reviews and recommends for approval the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis, and any related provision or recapture of provision for loan losses, and the full Board of Directors approves the provision or recapture after considering the Committee’s recommendations. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses which is charged against current period earnings. When analysis of the loan portfolio warrants, the allowance is decreased and a recapture of provision of loan losses is included in current period earnings.
We believe that the ALLL is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period-to-period requiring management to make assumptions about probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The impact of an unexpected large loss could deplete the allowance and potentially require increased provisions to replenish the allowance, thereby reducing earnings. For additional information see Item 1A. “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Lending - Our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio,” in this Form 10-K.
Valuation of OREO. Real estate properties acquired through foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure are recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell. Fair value is generally determined by management based on a number of factors, including third-party appraisals of fair value in an orderly sale. Accordingly, the valuation of OREO is subject to significant external and internal judgment. If the carrying value of the loan at the date a property is transferred into OREO exceeds the fair value less estimated costs to sell, the excess is charged to the ALLL. Management periodically reviews OREO values to determine whether the property continues to be carried at the lower of its recorded book value or fair value, net of estimated costs to sell. Any further decreases in the value of OREO are considered valuation adjustments and are charged to noninterest expense in the Consolidated Income Statements. Expenses and income from the maintenance and operations and any gains or losses from the sales of OREO are included in noninterest expense.
Deferred Taxes. Deferred tax assets arise from a variety of sources, the most significant being expenses recognized in our financial statements but disallowed in the tax return until the associated cash flow occurs, and write-downs in the value of assets for financial statement purposes that are not deductible for tax purposes until the asset is sold or deemed worthless.
When warranted, we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that can be recognized in line with the relevant accounting standards. The level of deferred tax asset recognition is influenced by management’s assessment of our historic and future profitability profile. At each balance sheet date, existing assessments are reviewed and, if necessary, revised to reflect changed circumstances. In a situation where income is less than projected or recent losses have been incurred, the relevant accounting standards require convincing evidence that there will be sufficient future tax capacity. For additional information regarding our deferred taxes, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8.
Other-Than-Temporary Impairments on the Market Value of Investments. Declines in the fair value of available-for-sale or held-to-maturity investments below their cost that is deemed to be other-than-temporary results in a reduction in the carrying amount of such investments to their fair value. A charge to earnings and an establishment of a new cost basis for the investment is made. Unrealized investment losses are evaluated at least quarterly to determine whether such declines should be considered other-than-temporary and therefore be subject to immediate loss recognition. Although these evaluations involve significant judgment, an unrealized loss in the fair value of a debt security is generally deemed to be temporary when the fair value of the investment security is below the carrying value primarily due to changes in interest rates and there has not been significant deterioration in the financial condition of the issuer. Other factors that may be considered in determining whether a decline in the value of a debt security is other-than-temporary include ratings by recognized rating agencies; the extent and duration of an unrealized loss position; actions of commercial banks or other lenders relative to the continued extension of credit facilities to the issuer of the security; the financial condition, capital strength and near-term prospects of the issuer and recommendations of investment advisers or market analysts. Therefore, deterioration of market conditions could result in impairment losses recognized within the investment portfolio.
Fair Value. Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework associated with the level of pricing observability utilized in measuring financial instruments at fair value. The degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability. Financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of pricing observability and a lesser degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value. Conversely, financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted will generally have little or no pricing observability and a higher degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value. Pricing observability is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established and the characteristics specific to the transaction. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 for additional information about the level of pricing transparency associated with financial instruments carried at fair value.
Derivatives and Hedge Accounting. The Bank recognizes its interest rate swaps as cash flow hedge derivative instruments, and as such, reports the net fair value as an asset or liability. Fair value is based on dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation. The derivatives are marked to their fair value through other comprehensive income. The net gain or loss on derivatives is reclassified into earnings in the same income statement line item that is used to present the earnings effect of hedged items.
Intangible Assets. The Company incurred goodwill and a core deposit intangible asset through the Branch Acquisition during 2017. These assets were booked at fair value at the time of the acquisition. Goodwill is evaluated annually for
impairment, with any impairment recognized as noninterest expense. The core deposit intangible is amortized into noninterest expense.

The $45.8 million increase in total assets during 2020 was primarily a result $60.1 million of deposit growth providing excess liquidity invested in interest-earning deposits. Additional factors in our asset growth are described below.
Interest-earning deposits with banks. Our interest-earning deposits with banks, consisting primarily of funds held at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, increased by $59.6 million to $72.5 million at December 31, 2020 from December 31, 2019. Loan repayments and deposit growth late in 2020 resulted in surplus funds held at the Federal Reserve at year end. We monitor the balance of these funds daily in relation to our expected funding needs and will reinvest the excess in higher interest-earning assets in 2021.
Investments available-for-sale. Our investments available-for-sale decreased by $9.1 million, or 6.6%, during 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we had sales and maturities on $12.1 million of our securities, with an average yield of 2.88%. The sales of investments available-for-sale generated a net gain of $86,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The proceeds were partially reinvested in $13.4 million of investments with an expected yield of 3.34%. The decrease in the targeted federal funds rate in the second half of 2019 and first quarter of 2020 contributed to a decrease in the average yield on investment securities to 2.42% for 2020 from 3.11% in 2019. Securities purchased in 2020 included $7.9 million in fixed rate and $5.5 million in variable rate securities. In addition to the purchase and redemption activity, we received principal repayments of $12.8 million on our investments available-for-sale during 2020.
The effective duration of our securities portfolio increased to 2.55% at December 31, 2020 as compared to 2.54% at December 31, 2019. Effective duration is a measure that attempts to quantify the anticipated percentage change in the value of an investment (or portfolio) in the event of a 100 basis point change in market yields. Since the Bank’s portfolio includes securities with embedded options (including call options on bonds and prepayment options on mortgage-backed securities), management believes that effective duration is an appropriate metric to use as a tool when analyzing the Bank’s investment securities portfolio, as effective duration incorporates assumptions relating to such embedded options, including changes in cash flow assumptions as interest rates change.
Loans receivable. Net loans receivable decreased by $7.9 million during 2020 to $1.10 billion. During the year ended December 31, 2020, multifamily loans decreased $36.2 million, construction/land loans decreased $21.5 million and commercial real estate loans decreased $9.9 million. Partially offsetting these declines, business loans increased by $42.9 million, or 113.5% increase, as a result of PPP loans originated during the year. The Bank originated PPP loans to both new and existing customers, and held $41.3 million of these loans at December 31, 2020. In addition, consumer loans increased $10.4 million, or 34.5%, as the Bank increased its portfolio of classic or collectible car loans.
During 2020, we supplemented our loan originations and participations by purchasing $22.1 million in loans, which included $19.4 million of performing classic or collectible car loans. The loans were purchased at an average premium of 3.6% and included $1.2 million of loans secured by commercial real estate property located in Connecticut, reflecting our efforts to geographically diversify our loan portfolio with loans meeting our investment and credit quality objectives.
During 2020, our nonperforming loans increased to $2.1 million at December 31, 2020 from $95,000 at December 31, 2019. as a result of one $2.1 million multifamily loan that was placed on nonaccrual status during 2020. Foreclosure proceedings were started during 2020, but were subsequently placed on hold as the borrower has a purchase and sale agreement on the underlying collateralized property that is expected to close in March 2021. The Bank does not expect to incur a loss on this loan. Nonperforming loans as a percent of our total loans increased to 0.19% at December 31, 2020, from 0.01% at December 31, 2019. Adversely classified loans, defined as substandard or below, increased to $2.6 million at December 31, 2020, from $629,000 at December 31, 2019. The following table presents a breakdown of our nonperforming assets:

We continued to focus on reducing our nonperforming assets through loan work outs or pursuing foreclosure. Foregone interest during the year ended December 31, 2020 relating to nonperforming loans totaled $82,000. There was no LIP related to nonperforming loans at December 31, 2020 or 2019. OREO remained at $454,000 at both December 31, 2020, and 2019. We did not foreclose on any properties during either 2020 or 2019. The stability in our nonperforming assets reflects the quality of our loan portfolio and our commitment to identify any problem loans and take prompt actions to turn nonperforming assets into performing assets.
Allowance for loan and lease losses. We believe that we use the best information available to establish the ALLL, and that the ALLL as of December 31, 2020 was adequate to absorb the probable and inherent losses in the loan portfolio at that date. While we believe the estimates and assumptions used in our determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future, or that the actual amount of future provisions will not exceed the amount of past provisions, or that any increased provisions that may be required will not adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Future additions to the allowance may become necessary based upon changing economic conditions, the level of problem loans, business conditions, credit concentrations, increased loan balances, or changes in the underlying collateral of the loan portfolio. In addition, the determination of the amount of our ALLL is subject to review by bank regulators as part of the routine examination process that which may result in the establishment of additional loss reserves or the charge-off of specific loans against established loss reserves based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination. Uncertainties relating to our ALLL are heightened as a result of the risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The ALLL was $15.2 million, or 1.36% of total loans receivable at December 31, 2020, as compared to $13.2 million, or 1.18% of total loans receivable at December 31, 2019. The following table details activity and information related to the ALLL for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.

Intangible assets. As a result of our Branch Acquisition in 2017, the Bank recognized goodwill of $889,000 and a core deposit intangible (“CDI”) of $1.3 million. Goodwill was calculated as the excess purchase price of the branches over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at August 25, 2017. The Company performed an impairment analysis at December 31, 2020, and determined that no impairment of goodwill and CDI existed. However, if adverse economic conditions or the decrease in the Company’s stock price and market capitalization as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic were to be deemed sustained rather than temporary, it may significantly affect the fair value of our goodwill.
The CDI was provided by a third party valuation service and represents the fair value of the customer relationships that provide a low-cost source of funding. The analysis was performed on the acquired noninterest-bearing checking, interest-bearing checking, savings, and money market accounts. The initial ratio of CDI to the acquired balances of core deposits was 2.23%. This amount will amortize into noninterest expense on an accelerated basis over ten years and had a balance of $824,000 at December 31, 2020.
Deposits. During the year ended December 31, 2020, deposits increased $60.1 million from December 31, 2019. Details of deposit balances and their concentrations are as follows:

Total deposits $ 1,093,633 100.0 % $ 1,033,534 100.0 %
The $60.1 million growth in retail deposits during 2020 was primarily the result of PPP disbursed funds remaining unused in borrower deposit accounts and due to organic deposit growth as we continued to focus on core deposit growth. Money market accounts grew by $87.6 million as the Bank competitively priced these products to increase these funding sources. In addition, interest-bearing demand accounts grew by $42.3 million and noninterest-bearing demand accounts grew by $38.4 million due in part to deposits related to PPP loans, as well as changes in customer spending habits as a result of COVID-19. Partially offsetting this growth, certificates of deposit decreased $15.5 million as management elected to utilize liquidity gained from lower cost deposits to reduce its balances of higher cost certificates of deposit in a managed runoff of these funds.
During 2020, growth in retail deposits with our expanded branch network allowed the Bank to reduce brokered certificates of deposit as a source of funds. In addition, the Bank exercised its call option on $24.5 million of brokered certificates of deposit, thereby reducing these brokered certificates of deposit to zero at December 31, 2020 from $94.4 million at December 31, 2019. While brokered certificates of deposit may carry a higher cost than our retail certificates, the Bank may utilize this source of funding in the future due to the enhanced call features on some of these deposits that assists us in our efforts to manage interest rate risk.
At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we held $59.2 million and $34.0 million in public funds, respectively, of which $31.7 million were retail certificates of deposit. These funds were secured at December 31, 2020 with the Washington State Public Deposit Protection Commission by $23.4. million in pledged investment securities.
Advances. We use advances from the FHLB as an alternative funding source to manage interest rate risk and to leverage our balance sheet. Total FHLB advances at December 31, 2020 were $120.0 million as compared to $137.7 million at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2020, our FHLB advances consisted of $60.0 million of fixed-rate three-month advances that renew quarterly, and $60.0 million of fixed-rate one-month advances that renew monthly, that are utilized in cash flow hedge agreements, as described below. At December 31, 2020, the Bank did not hold any purchased Fed Funds. The short-term nature of our advances and overnight FHLB advances provides us flexibility to adjust the level of our borrowings as our customer deposit balances change consistent with our asset/liability objectives. Our average borrowings during 2020 were $125.4 million. At December 31, 2020, all of our FHLB advances were due to mature in less than two months.
Cash Flow Hedge. To assist in managing interest rate risk, the Bank entered into six interest rate swap agreements with qualified institutions designated as cash flow hedge instruments. The agreements have an aggregate notional amount of $120.0 million, are for terms ranging from one to eight years with individual notional amounts ranging from $10.0 million to $50.0 million, and a weighted-average fixed rate of 1.22%. The remaining maturity of these agreements is from 10 months to seven years. In addition, the Bank entered into two forward-starting interest rate swap agreements with an effective date of October 25, 2021, notional amounts of $15.0 million and $10.0 million, for seven and eight years, respectively, and a weighted-average fixed rate of 0.80%.
Under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements, the Bank pays a fixed interest rate and in return receives an interest payment based on the corresponding LIBOR index, which resets quarterly or monthly, depending on the hedge term. Concurrently, the Bank borrowed a fixed rate FHLB advance that will be renewed quarterly or monthly, as designated by the hedge agreement, at the fixed interest rate at that time. Effectiveness of the interest rate swap is evaluated quarterly with any ineffectiveness recognized as a gain or a loss on the income statement in noninterest income. A change in the fair value of the cash flow hedge created by the interest rate swap agreements is recognized as an other asset or other liability on the balance sheet with the tax-effected portion of the change included in other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2020, we recognized a $2.8 million fair value liability as a result of the increase in market value of the interest rate swap agreements.
The Bank has confirmed our adherence to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol (“Protocol”) to prepare for the cessation of LIBOR by the end of 2021. The Protocol provides a mechanism for parties to bilaterally amend their existing derivatives transactions to incorporate ISDA’s fallback terms, providing for a clear transition from Libor to SOFR.
Stockholders’ Equity. Total stockholders’ equity remained stable at $156.3 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019. Increases to stockholders’ equity for the year ended December 31, 2020, included $8.6 million of net income and $1.6 million in net stock-based compensation. These increases were more than offset by a decrease to additional paid-in-capital of $5.7 million for the repurchase of 544,626 shares of stock, at an average price of $10.44 per share, and $3.9 million in shareholder cash dividends. In addition, accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, decreased by $547,000 as a result of declines in the fair value of our derivatives and available-for-sale investments. Further, additional shares of common stock were issued from authorized shares due to restricted stock awards in 2020 totaling 28,548 shares, resulting in a decrease to additional paid-in-capital of $73,000.
Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019
Net Interest Income. Net interest income in 2020 was $40.5 million, a $1.6 million or 4.0% increase from $38.9 million in 2019, due primarily to an $5.1 million decrease in interest expense partially offset by a $3.5 million decrease in interest income. Interest income decreased during the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of the decrease in average yield of interest-earning assets to 4.36% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 4.88% for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of the significant 150 basis point decrease in the targeted federal funds rate in March
2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the ongoing historically low interest rate environment putting downward pressure on adjustable rate instruments combined with the impact of the low loan yields of the PPP loan portfolio. Average interest-earning assets increased $65.1 million, funded by a $36.1 million increase in average interest-bearing liabilities. The average cost of these funds decreased to 1.41% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 1.92% for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of the lower interest rate environment for much of 2020 and an improvement in the Company’s deposit mix. Specifically, average balances in lower cost interest bearing demand deposits increased to $92.8 million in 2020 compared to $50.5 million in 2019. In addition, average balances in noninterest bearing liabilities increased to $93.6 million from $63.7 million in 2019. These increases allowed the Company to reduce its higher cost brokered certificates of deposit, with average balances declining to $30.5 million in 2020 from $134.0 million in 2019. Our interest-bearing liabilities reprice faster than our interest-earning assets in response to changes in market interest rates, mitigating the four basis point reduction in our net interest margin to 3.15% for the year ended December 31, 2020, from 3.19% for the year ended December 31, 2019. For more information, see “ Asset and Liability Management and Market Risk.”

Total interest-earning assets $ 1,286,181 4.36 % $ 1,221,039 4.88 % $ (3,506)
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the $2.1 million decrease in loan interest income was the result of a decrease in the average loan yield to 4.69% for the year ended December 31, 2020, from 5.15% for the prior year. Partially offsetting the decrease in yield, the average balance of loans receivable increased $59.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. However, a large portion of this increase was the result of $52.1 million PPP loans originated during the year ended December 31, 2020. Prepayments of these loans or amounts forgiven by the SBA may increase the loan yield in periods of payoff with recognition of unamortized fees and costs. The impact to our loan yields is expected to cease completely after the payoff or maturity of these loans.
Interest income from investments available-for-sale decreased $1.2 million during 2020 primarily as a result of a decrease in the average balance of our investments and a decrease in the average yield to 2.42% from 3.11% as approximately half of our investment portfolio was comprised of variable rate securities which repriced during the lower interest rate environment existing throughout most of 2020. In addition, the average balance of these investments decreased $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to last year.
Interest income on interest-earning deposits decreased $241,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of a decrease in the average yield to 0.21% for the year ended December 31, 2020, from 2.15% for the year ended December 31, 2019, partially offset by an $11.5 million increase in the average balance of these deposits.

Total interest-bearing liabilities $ 1,112,461 1.41 % $ 1,076,383 1.92 % $ (5,067)
Interest expense decreased $5.1 million to $15.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $20.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in interest expense during 2020 was primarily a result of the decrease in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits of 48 basis points and the decrease in the average cost of our FHLB borrowings of 78 basis points reflecting lower market interest rates. The cost of interest-bearing deposits decreased between the periods, as a combined result of the declining interest rate environment and an increase in lower-cost demand deposits. The average balances of interest-bearing deposits increased by $40.6 million although growth in our branch network allowed us to repay substantially all of our higher cost brokered certificate of deposit.
The average cost of our retail deposits decreased as a result of a lower interest rate environment and the improvement in the Company’s deposit mix noted earlier. Money market interest expense decreased by $1.5 million as a result of a 69 basis point decrease in the average cost of these funds partially offset by an $86.2 million increase in the average balance. The cost of retail and brokered certificates of deposit decreased by 12 and 7 basis points, respectively, as maturing deposits repriced down in the lower interest rate environment that existed during the final three quarters of 2020. Our average balance of brokered certificates of deposit decreased by $103.6 million during 2020 as reduced loan demand allowed these balances to be replaced by lower cost alternatives, including noninterest bearing and interest bearing demand accounts. Likewise, this growth in our lower cost demand deposits allowed the Bank to pay down certain FHLB advances, resulting in a $4.5 million decrease in the average balance of these borrowings for 2020. The average cost of FHLB advances declined 78 basis points between the years, resulting in borrowing interest expense decreasing by $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to prior year.
Provision for Loan Losses. Our provision for loan losses was $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a recapture of provision of $300,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, resulting in an increase in the ALLL to total loans to 1.36% at December 31, 2020, from 1.18% at December 31, 2019. The provision in 2020 was primarily the result of COVID-19 related adjustments to qualitative economic factors considered in evaluating the ALLL against the probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio, along with reduction in loan grades on a portion of our commercial real estate portfolio, including $61.0 million in loans that were downgraded due in large part to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, any relationship that requested a COVID-19 related second loan payment deferral received additional scrutiny which resulted in some of these loans being downgraded. Higher adjustments were also made for our commercial real estate and construction/land portfolios to reflect the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic.
In comparison, the recapture of provision in 2019 was primarily the result of a construction/land loan with a balance of $12.5 million at December 31, 2019, that was in default and classified as impaired, however, the Bank’s impairment analysis concluded there were no anticipated losses from the loan at that time, and therefore funds previously allocated in the ALLL to this loan were recaptured. In addition, although total loans increased in 2019, the impact to the provision from this loan growth was offset by a shift in our loan concentrations to lower risk categories and a reduction in the historical risk loss factor related to the collateral on certain loan types.
Noninterest Income. Noninterest income increased $301,000 to $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The following table provides a detailed analysis of the changes in the components of noninterest income:
Year Ended
December 31, 2020 Change from
December 31, 2019 Percentage
Change
(Dollars in thousands)
Deposit related fees $ 755 $ 22 3.0 %
Loan related fees 1,947 603 44.9

BOLI change in cash surrender value 982 (12) (1.2)
Wealth management revenue 663 (216) (24.6)
Other 9 (31) (77.5)
Total noninterest income $ 4,442 $ 301 7.3 %
The largest change to our noninterest income was the $603,000 increase on loan related fees primarily as a result of loan prepayment penalties that increased by $838,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Partially offsetting this increase was a $233,000 decline in loan related interest rate swap servicing fees. The Bank has an interest rate swap program for commercial loan customers, under which the customer participates in an interest rate swap with a third party broker institution for which the Bank receives a fee that is recognized at the time the loan is originated. The decline in 2020 was primarily due to the reduced customer demand for these interest rate swaps in 2020 compared to 2019.
Wealth management revenue decreased by $216,000 in 2020, primarily as a result of a significant decline in face-to-face meetings during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, reducing opportunities for additional income. This line of business assists the Bank with providing options to our customers to more fully support their financial needs. Total assets managed by our wealth management division decreased to $88.0 million at December 31, 2020, from $96.0 million at December 31, 2019.
Our BOLI noninterest income remained stable with a slight decrease of $12,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. We recognized the net $982,000 increase in cash surrender value of these policies as noninterest income, which assists in offsetting expenses for employee benefits.
The Bank sold certain available-for-sale securities during the year ended December 31, 2020, resulting in an $86,000 gain. In comparison, sales of investments for the year ended December 31, 2019, resulted in a $151,000 gain. During 2020, selected securities were strategically sold, with the funds reinvested in securities and loans that were expected to improve the Company’s total return on investments. These sales resulted in net gains at the time of sale and were impacted favorably in part by the Federal Reserve’s aggressive purchases of mortgage backed securities, which in turn resulted in more favorable pricing on securities sold in 2020.
Deposit related fees of $755,000 were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020, a $22,000 increase over the prior year. As a result of our deposit growth and corresponding increase in customer transactions, our transactional based fee revenue also increased.
Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense increased $2.1 million to $32.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $30.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The following table provides a detailed analysis of the changes in the components of noninterest expense:
Year Ended

Change
(Dollars in thousands)
Salaries and employee benefits $ 20,039 $ 444 2.3 %

Marketing 197 (142) (41.9)
Other general and administrative 2,510 175 7.5
Total noninterest expense $ 32,513 $ 2,095 6.9 %
The primary contributor to the increase in noninterest expense was our continued focus on product and branch expansion, including the implementation of a new online banking platform. For the year ended December 31, 2020, salary and employee benefits increased by $444,000 to $20.0 million due in part to a $1.3 million net increase from salaries, commissions and employees incentives reflecting in large part increased staffing at our new branches. Partially offsetting these increases, stock based compensation decreased $574,000, primarily due to the lower common stock price used to calculate the expense for ESOP shares allocated to employees for 2020. In addition, retirement benefit related expenses declined $184,000 from the prior year.
Occupancy and equipment expense increased $525,000 to $4.2 million during 2020 primarily as a result of the addition of two new branch locations in 2020 and additional expenses relating to COVID-19 enhancements made throughout our branch network. Lease expense increased by $185,000 and depreciation expense increased by $178,000, primarily as a result of additional leasehold improvements and fixed assets related to opening the new branches.
Data processing expense increased by $791,000 primarily as a combined result of increased loan and deposit transaction volume, and the implementation of a new online banking platform, as discussed above.
Regulatory assessments increased by $240,000 during 2020, as compared to 2019, as the application of $282,000 in FDIC small bank assessment credits reduced expenses in 2019. Partially offsetting these increases, marketing expenses decreased $142,000 during 2020, primarily due to a reduction in sponsored events due to the stay-at-home orders and other meeting limitations imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Federal Income Tax Expense. We recorded a $1.9 million federal income tax provision for 2020, compared to $2.6 million for 2019. The decrease in federal income tax provision for 2020 was primarily the result of a $2.4 million decrease in pretax net income.

Asset and Liability Management and Market Risk
General. Our Board of Directors has approved an asset/liability management policy to guide management in maximizing interest rate spread by managing the differences in terms between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities while maintaining acceptable levels of liquidity, capital adequacy, interest rate risk, credit risk, and profitability. The policy established an Investment, Asset/Liability Committee (“ALCO”) comprised of certain members of senior management and the Board of Directors. The Committee’s purpose is to communicate, coordinate and manage our asset/liability position consistent with our business plan and Board-approved policies. The ALCO meets quarterly to review various areas including:
•economic conditions;
•interest rate outlook;
•asset/liability mix;
•interest rate risk sensitivity;
•current market opportunities to promote specific products;
•historical financial results;
•projected financial results; and
•capital position.
The Committee also reviews current and projected liquidity needs. As part of its procedures, the Committee regularly reviews interest rate risk by forecasting the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income and the market value of portfolio equity, which is defined as the net present value of an institution’s existing assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments and evaluating such impacts against the maximum potential change in the market value of portfolio equity that is authorized by the Board of Directors.
Our Risk When Interest Rates Change. The rates of interest we earn on assets and pay on liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time. Market interest rates change over time. Our loans generally have longer maturities than our deposits. Accordingly, our results of operations, like those of other financial institutions, are impacted by
changes in interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities. The risk associated with changes in interest rates and our ability to adapt to these changes is known as interest rate risk and is our most significant market risk.
We have utilized the following strategies in our efforts to manage interest rate risk:
•we are originating shorter term, higher yielding loans, whenever possible;
•we have attempted, where possible, to increase balances of non-maturity deposits with less rate sensitivity;
•we have invested in securities with relatively short average lives, generally less than eight years;
•we have added adjustable-rate loans to our loan portfolio;
•we have added brokered certificates of deposit with a call option as a funding source; and
•we have utilized interest rate swaps to effectively fix the rate on $120.0 million of FHLB advances.
How We Measure the Risk of Interest Rate Changes. We monitor our interest rate sensitivity on a quarterly basis by measuring the impact of changes to net interest income in multiple rate environments. Management retains the services of a third party consultant with over 30 years of experience in asset-liability management to assist in its interest rate risk and asset-liability management. Management uses various assumptions to evaluate the sensitivity of our operations to changes in interest rates. Although management believes these assumptions are reasonable, the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities on net interest income and the market value of portfolio equity could vary substantially if different assumptions were used or actual results differ from these assumptions. Although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react differently to changes in market interest rates. The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types of assets and liabilities lag behind changes in market interest rates. Non-uniform changes and fluctuations in market interest rates across various maturities will also affect the results presented. In addition, certain assets, such as adjustable-rate mortgage loans, have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Further, a portion of our adjustable-rate loans have interest rate floors below which the loan’s contractual interest rate may not adjust. Approximately 51.5% of our net loans were adjustable-rate loans at December 31, 2020. At that date, $362.8 million, or 63.1%, of these loans with a weighted-average interest rate of 4.54% were at their floor interest rate. The inability of our loans to adjust downward can contribute to increased income in periods of declining interest rates. However, when loans are at their floors, there is a further risk that our interest income may not increase as rapidly as our cost of funds during periods of increasing interest rates. Further, in the event of a significant change in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate from those assumed. Finally, the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase. We consider all these factors in monitoring our interest rate exposure.
The assumptions we use are based upon a combination of proprietary and market data that reflect historical results and current market conditions. These assumptions relate to interest rates, prepayments, deposit decay rates and the market value of certain assets under the various interest rate scenarios. We use market data to determine prepayments and maturities of loans, investments and borrowings and use our own assumptions on deposit decay rates except for time deposits. Time deposits are modeled to reprice to market rates upon their stated maturities. We also assume that non-maturity deposits can be maintained with rate adjustments not directly proportionate to the change in market interest rates, based upon our historical deposit decay rates, which are substantially lower than market decay rates. We have observed in the past that our deposit accounts during changing rate environments have relatively lower volatility and less than market rate changes. When interest rates rise, we do not have to raise interest rates proportionately on less rate sensitive accounts to retain these deposits. These assumptions are based upon our analysis of our customer base, competitive factors, and historical experience.
Our income simulation model examines changes in net interest income in scenarios where interest rates were assumed to remain at their base level, instantaneously increase by 100, 200 and 300 basis points or decline immediately by 100 basis points. A decline by 200 and 300 basis points is not reported as the current targeted federal funds rate is between 0.00% and 0.25%.
The following table illustrates the estimated change in our net interest income over the next 12 months from December 31, 2020, that would occur in the event of an immediate change in interest rates equally across all maturities, with no effect given to any steps that we might take to counter the effect of that interest rate movement.

__________
(1)No rates in the model are allowed to go below zero. Given the relatively low level of market interest rates, a calculation for a decrease of greater than 100 basis points has not been prepared.
(2)The net portfolio value is the difference between the present value of the discounted cash flows of assets and liabilities and represents the market value of the Company’s equity for any given interest rate scenario. Net portfolio value is useful for determining, on a market value basis, how equity changes in response to various interest rate scenarios. Large changes in net portfolio value reflect increased interest rate sensitivity and generally more volatile earnings streams.
(3)The increase or decrease in the estimated net portfolio value at the indicated interest rates compared to the net portfolio value assuming no change in interest rates.
(4)Net portfolio value divided by the market value of assets.
(5)The increase or decrease in the net portfolio value divided by the market value of assets.
(6)The market value of assets represents the value of assets under the various interest rate scenarios and reflects the sensitivity of those assets to interest rate changes.
The net interest income and net portfolio value tables presented above are predicated upon a stable balance sheet with no growth or change in asset or liability mix. In addition, the net portfolio value is based upon the present value of discounted cash flows using our estimates of current replacement rates to discount the cash flows. The effects of changes in interest rates in the net interest income table are based upon a cash flow simulation of our existing assets and liabilities and assuming that delinquency rates would not change as a result of changes in interest rates, although there can be no assurance that this will be the case. Delinquency rates may change when interest rates change as a result of changes in the loan portfolio mix, underwriting conditions, loan terms or changes in economic conditions that have a delayed effect on the portfolio. Even if interest rates change in the designated amounts, there can be no assurance that our assets and liabilities would perform as assumed. Also, a change in U.S. Treasury rates in the designated amounts accompanied by a change in the shape of the Treasury yield curve would cause changes to the net portfolio value and net interest income other than those indicated above.
Liquidity
We are required to have enough cash flow in order to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure a safe and sound operation. We maintain cash flows above the minimum level believed to be adequate to meet the requirements of normal operations, including potential deposit outflows. On a daily basis, we review and update cash flow projections to ensure that adequate liquidity is maintained.
Our primary sources of funds are customer deposits, scheduled loan and investment repayments, including interest payments, maturing loans and investment securities, and advances from the FHLB. These funds, together with equity, are used to fund loans, acquire investment securities and other assets, and fund continuing operations. While maturities and the scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by the level of interest rates, economic conditions and competition. We believe that our current liquidity position, and our forecasted operating results are sufficient to fund all of our existing commitments.
The COVID-19 pandemic may impact cash flow due to payment deferrals granted to borrowers who have been negatively impacted by the pandemic. To support the origination of PPP loans, the Federal Reserve Board authorized the Paycheck Protection Program Lending Facility (“PPPLF”) to supply liquidity to participating financial institutions through term financing on a non-recourse basis at a rate of 35 basis points, with PPP loans as collateral at face value. The maturity date of this extension of credit will equal the maturity date of the pledged PPP loan. While we currently do not intend to use the PPPLF, as we held a substantial cash and cash equivalent position as a result of PPP disbursed funds remaining unused in borrower deposit accounts and due to organic deposit growth, we do have this and additional borrowings available to us from the FRB.
Liquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of business management. Excess liquidity is generally invested in short-term investments such as overnight deposits or agency or mortgage-backed securities. On a longer term basis, we maintain a strategy of investing in various lending products as described in greater detail under Item 1. “Business - Lending Activities.” At December 31, 2020, the undisbursed portion of construction LIP totaled $59.8 million and unused lines of credit were $34.8 million. In addition, we had commitments to originate loans of $6.0 million that includes a $3.9 million financial letter of credit. We use our sources of funds primarily to meet ongoing commitments, to pay maturing certificates of deposit and withdrawals on other deposit accounts, to fund loan commitments, and to maintain our portfolio of investment securities. Certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less at December 31, 2020 totaled $267.6 million. Management’s policy is to maintain deposit rates at levels that are competitive with other local financial institutions. Based on historical experience, we believe that a significant portion of maturing certificates of deposit will remain with First Financial Northwest Bank. As further funding sources, we had the ability at December 31, 2020 to borrow an additional $494.4 million from the FHLB, $82.2 million from the FRB and $75.0 million from unused lines of credit with other financial institutions to meet commitments and for liquidity purposes. See the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Item 8 of this report for further details on our cash flow activities.
We measure our liquidity based on our ability to fund our assets and to meet liability obligations when they come due. Liquidity (and funding) risk occurs when funds cannot be raised at reasonable prices, or in a reasonable time frame, to meet our normal or unanticipated obligations. We regularly monitor the mix between our assets and our liabilities to manage our liquidity and funding requirements.
Our primary source of funds is our retail deposits. When retail deposits are not sufficient to provide the funds for our assets, we use alternative funding sources. These sources include, but are not limited to, advances from the FHLB, wholesale funding, brokered deposits, federal funds purchased, and dealer repurchase agreements, as well as other short-term alternatives. We may also liquidate assets to meet our funding needs.
On a monthly basis, we estimate our liquidity sources and needs for the next twelve months. Also, we determine funding concentrations and our need for sources of funds other than deposits. This information is used by our Asset/Liability Management Committee in forecasting funding needs and investing opportunities.
Capital
Our total stockholders’ equity was $156.3 million at December 31, 2020. Consistent with our goal to operate a sound and profitable financial organization we will actively seek to maintain the Bank as a “well capitalized” institution in accordance with regulatory standards. As of December 31, 2020, First Financial Northwest Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. Regulatory capital ratios for First Financial Northwest Bank were as follows as of December 31, 2020: Total capital to risk-weighted assets was 15.57%; Tier 1 capital and Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets was 14.32%; and Tier 1 capital to total assets was 10.29%. At December 31, 2020, First Financial Northwest Bank met the financial ratios to be considered well-capitalized under the regulatory guidelines. See Item 1. “Business - How We Are Regulated - Regulation and Supervision of First Financial Northwest Bank - Capital Requirements.”
Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and the unused portions of lines of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition. Commitments to extend credit and lines of credit are not recorded as an asset or liability by us until the instrument is exercised. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had no commitments to originate loans for sale.
Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the loan agreement. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We evaluate each customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by us upon extension of credit, is based on our credit evaluation of the customer. The amount and type of collateral required varies, but may include real estate and income-producing commercial properties.
The following table summarizes our outstanding commitments to advance additional amounts pursuant to outstanding lines of credit, and to disburse funds related to our construction loans at December 31, 2020.

First Financial Northwest and its subsidiaries from time to time are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. There are currently no matters that in the opinion of management would have a material adverse effect on First Financial Northwest’s consolidated financial position, results of operation or liquidity.
We anticipate that we will continue to have sufficient funds and alternative funding sources to meet our current commitments.

Impact of Inflation
The Consolidated Financial Statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles generally require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation.
Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. The primary impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution’s performance than do general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services. In a period of rapidly rising interest rates, the liquidity and maturity structures of our assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels.
The principal effect of inflation on earnings, as distinct from levels of interest rates, is in the area of noninterest expense. Expense items such as employee compensation, employee benefits, and occupancy and equipment costs may be subject to increases as a result of inflation. An additional effect of inflation is the possible increase in dollar value of the collateral securing loans that we have made. Our management is unable to determine the extent, if any, to which properties securing loans have appreciated in dollar value due to inflation.
