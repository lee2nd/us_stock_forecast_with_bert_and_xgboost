Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following presents management’s discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition at December 31, 2020 and 2019 and the results of our operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.
In addition to historical information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause results to differ materially from management’s expectations.
Overview
We are a bank holding company headquartered in Fairfax County, Virginia. Our sole subsidiary, FVCbank, was formed in November 2007 as a community-oriented, locally-owned and managed commercial bank under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia. The Bank offers a wide range of traditional bank loan and deposit products and services to both our commercial and retail customers. Our commercial relationship officers focus on attracting small and medium sized businesses, commercial real estate developers and builders, including government contractors, non-profit organizations, and professionals. Our approach to our market features competitive customized financial services offered to customers and prospects in a personal relationship context by seasoned professionals.
On October 12, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Colombo Bank (“Colombo”). Colombo, which was headquartered in Rockville, Maryland, merged into FVCbank effective October 12, 2018, adding five banking locations in Washington, D.C., and Montgomery County and the City of Baltimore in Maryland.
Net interest income is our primary source of revenue. We define revenue as net interest income plus noninterest income. As discussed further in “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” below, we manage our balance sheet and interest rate risk exposure to maximize, and concurrently stabilize, net interest income. We do this by monitoring our liquidity position and the spread between the interest rates earned on interest-earning assets and the interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. We attempt to minimize our exposure to interest rate risk, but are unable to eliminate it entirely. In addition to managing interest rate risk, we also analyze our loan portfolio for exposure to credit risk. Loan defaults and foreclosures are inherent risks in the banking industry, and we attempt to limit our exposure to these risks by carefully underwriting and then monitoring our extensions of credit. In addition to net interest income, noninterest income is a complementary source of revenue for us and includes, among other things, service charges on deposits and loans, merchant services fee income, insurance commission income, income from bank owned life insurance (“BOLI”), and gains and losses on sales of investment securities available-for-sale.
On October 13, 2020, we announced the completion of our private placement of $20 million of our 4.875% Fixed to Floating Subordinated Notes due 2030 (the "Notes") to certain qualified institutional buyers and accredited investors. The Notes have a maturity date of October 15, 2030 and carry a fixed rate of interest of 4.875% for the first five years. Thereafter, the Notes will pay interest at 3-month SOFR plus 471 basis points, resetting quarterly. The Notes include a right of prepayment without penalty on or after October 15, 2025. The Notes have been structured to qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes. We plan to use the proceeds from the placement of the Notes for general corporate purposes, to include supporting capital ratios at the Bank, and potential repayment of a portion of the $25.0 million outstanding subordinated debt callable June 30, 2021.
Critical Accounting Policies
General
The accounting principles we apply under GAAP are complex and require management to apply significant judgment to various accounting, reporting and disclosure matters. Management must use assumptions, judgments and estimates when applying these principles where precise measurements are not possible or practical. These policies are critical because they are highly dependent upon subjective or complex judgments, assumptions and estimates. Changes in such judgments, assumptions and estimates may have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. Actual results, in fact, could differ from initial estimates.
The accounting policies we view as critical are those relating to judgments, assumptions and estimates regarding the determination of the allowance for loan losses, accounting for purchase credit-impaired loans, fair value measurements, and the valuation of other real estate owned.
Allowance for Loan Losses
We maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that represents management’s best estimate of known and inherent losses in our loan portfolio. We are not required to implement the provisions of the CECL until January 1, 2023, and are continuing to account for the allowance for loan losses under the incurred loss model. Both the amount of the provision expense and the level of the allowance for loan losses are impacted by many factors, including general and industry-specific economic conditions, actual and expected credit losses, historical trends and specific conditions of individual borrowers. Unusual and infrequently occurring events, such as weather-related disasters and health related events, such as COVID-19 pandemic and associated efforts to restrict the spread of the disease, may impact our assessment of possible credit losses. As a part of our analysis, we use comparative peer group data and qualitative factors such as levels of and trends in delinquencies, nonaccrual loans, charged-off loans, changes in volume and terms of loans, effects of changes in lending policy, experience and ability and depth of management, national and local economic trends and conditions and concentrations of credit, competition, and loan review results to support estimates.
The allowance for loan losses is based first on a segmentation of the loan portfolio by general loan type, or portfolio segments. For originated loans, certain portfolio segments are further disaggregated and evaluated collectively for impairment based on loan segments, which are largely based on the type of collateral underlying each loan. For purposes of this analysis, we categorize loans into one of five categories: commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, commercial construction, consumer residential, and consumer nonresidential loans. Typically, financial institutions use their historical loss experience and trends in losses for each loan category which are then adjusted for portfolio trends and economic and environmental factors in determining their allowance for loan losses. Since the Bank’s inception in 2007, we have experienced minimal loss history within our loan portfolio. Because of this, our allowance model uses the average loss rates of similar institutions (our custom peer group) as a baseline which is then adjusted based on our particular qualitative loan portfolio characteristics and environmental factors. The indicated loss factors resulting from this analysis are applied for each of the five categories of loans.
Our peer group is defined by selecting commercial banking institutions of similar size within Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia. This is known as our custom peer group. The commercial banking institutions comprising the custom peer group can change based on certain factors including but not limited to the characteristics, size, and geographic footprint of the institution. We have identified 22 banks for our custom peer group which are within $1 billion to $3 billion in total assets, the majority of whom are geographically concentrated in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area in which we operate, as this area has experienced more stable economic conditions than many other areas of the country. These baseline peer group loss rates are then adjusted based on an analysis of our loan portfolio characteristics, trends, economic considerations and other conditions that should be considered in assessing our credit risk. Our peer loss rates are updated on a quarterly basis.
The allowance for loan losses consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are determined to be impaired and, therefore, individually evaluated for impairment. We individually assign loss factors to all loans that have been identified as having loss attributes, as indicated by deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower or a decline in underlying collateral value if the loan is collateral dependent. We evaluate the impairment of certain loans on a loan by loan basis for those loans that are adversely risk rated. Measurement of impairment is based on the expected future cash flows of an impaired loan, which are discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, or measured on an observable market value, if one exists, or the fair value of the collateral underlying the loan, discounted to consider estimated costs to sell the collateral for collateral-dependent loans. If the net collateral value is less than the loan balance (including accrued interest and any unamortized premium or discount associated with the loan) we recognize an impairment and establish a specific reserve for the impaired loan.
Credit losses are an inherent part of our business and, although we believe the methodologies for determining the allowance for loan losses and the current level of the allowance are appropriate, it is possible that there may be unidentified losses in the portfolio at any particular time that may become evident at a future date pursuant to additional internal analysis or regulatory comment. Additional provisions for such losses, if necessary, would be recorded, and would negatively impact earnings.
Allowance for Loan Losses - Acquired Loans
Acquired loans accounted for under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 310-30
For our acquired loans, to the extent that we experience a deterioration in borrower credit quality resulting in a decrease in our expected cash flows subsequent to the acquisition of the loans, an allowance for loan losses would be established based on our estimate of future credit losses over the remaining life of the loans.
Acquired loans accounted for under ASC 310-20
Subsequent to the acquisition date, we establish our allowance for loan losses through a provision for loan losses based upon an evaluation process that is similar to our evaluation process used for originated loans. This evaluation, which includes a review of loans on which full collectability may not be reasonably assured, considers, among other factors, the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, economic conditions, historical net loan loss experience, carrying value of the loans, which includes the remaining net purchase discount or premium, and other factors that warrant recognition in determining our allowance for loan losses.
Purchased Credit-Impaired Loans
Purchased credit-impaired (“PCI”) loans, which are the loans acquired in our acquisition of Colombo, are loans acquired at a discount (that is due, in part, to credit quality). These loans are initially recorded at fair value (as determined by the present value of expected future cash flows) with no allowance for loan losses. We account for interest income on all loans acquired at a discount (that is due, in part, to credit quality) based on the acquired loans’ expected cash flows. The acquired loans may be aggregated and accounted for as a pool of loans if the loans being aggregated have common risk characteristics. A pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flow. The difference between the cash flows expected at acquisition and the investment in the loans, or the “accretable yield,” is recognized as interest income utilizing the level-yield method over the life of each pool. Increases in expected cash flows subsequent to the acquisition are recognized prospectively through adjustment of the yield on the pool over its remaining life, while decreases in expected cash flows are recognized as impairment through a loss provision and an increase in the allowance for loan losses. Therefore, the allowance for loan losses on these impaired pools reflect only losses incurred after the acquisition (representing the present value of all cash flows that were expected at acquisition but currently are not expected to be received). At December 31, 2020, we had specific reserves for impairment of three acquired loans within our allowance for loan losses totaling $196 thousand that had further deteriorated post acquisition.
We periodically evaluate the remaining contractual required payments due and estimates of cash flows expected to be collected. These evaluations, performed quarterly, require the continued use of key assumptions and estimates, similar to the initial estimate of fair value. Changes in the contractual required payments due and estimated cash flows expected to be collected may result in changes in the accretable yield and non-accretable difference or reclassifications between accretable yield and the non-accretable difference. On an aggregate basis, if the acquired pools of PCI loans perform better than originally expected, we would expect to receive more future cash flows than originally modeled at the acquisition date. For the pools with better than expected cash flows, the forecasted increase would be recorded as an additional accretable yield that is recognized as a prospective increase to our interest income on loans.
Fair Value Measurements
We determine the fair values of financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. Our investment securities available-for-sale are recorded at fair value using reliable and unbiased evaluations by an industry-wide valuation service. This service uses evaluated pricing models that vary based on asset class and include available trade, bid, and other market information. Generally, the methodology includes broker quotes, proprietary models, vast descriptive terms and conditions databases, as well as extensive quality control programs. Depending on the availability of observable inputs and prices, different valuation models could produce materially different fair value estimates. The values presented may not represent future fair values and may not be realizable.
Other Real Estate Owned
Real estate acquired through, or in lieu of, foreclosure is held for sale and is stated at fair value of the property, less estimated disposal costs, if any. Any excess of cost over the fair value less costs to sell at the time of acquisition is charged to the allowance for loan losses. The fair value is reviewed periodically by management and any writedowns are charged against current earnings. Accounting policy and treatment is consistent with accounting for impaired loans described above.
LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates
In 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced its intention to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. In December 2020, the administrator of LIBOR announced its intention to (i) cease the publication of the one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR after December 31, 2021, and (ii) cease the publication of all other tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR (one, three, six and 12 month LIBOR) after June 30, 2023. Central banks and regulators around the world have commissioned working groups to find suitable replacements for Interbank Offered Rates (“IBOR”) and other benchmark rates and to implement financial benchmark reforms more generally. These actions have resulted in uncertainty regarding the use of alternative reference rates (“ARRs”) and could cause disruptions in a variety of markets, as well as adversely impact our business, operations and financial results.
To facilitate an orderly transition from IBORs and other benchmark rates to ARRs, we have established an enterprise-wide initiative led by senior management. The objective of this initiative is to identify, assess and monitor risks associated with the expected discontinuation or unavailability of benchmarks, including LIBOR, achieve operational readiness and engage impacted clients in connection with the transition to ARRs.
COVID-19 Pandemic Discussion Matters
Employee Matters
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic stay at home orders to reduce the spread of the disease, the majority of our workforce transitioned to remote access operations towards the end of March 2020. Our information technology infrastructure has afforded our employees the ability to work predominantly remotely with little interruption as we continue to service the needs of our clients in a customer secure environment. As government imposed stay at home orders have further relaxed, more than half of our employees have returned to our offices, under social distancing guidelines requiring employees to maintain safe distances and with more frequent cleaning of our facilities and other practices encouraging a safe work environment. Management remains connected to employees through monthly company-wide conference calls and regular notifications and updates through both email and the Company’s intranet as warranted.
Branch Hours
Branch hours and availability, which were modified in consideration of the safety of our employees and clients, were reinstated during the second quarter of 2020. All of our locations have been opened with advanced safety measures and are available during our normal business hours.
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CARES Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020 and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (“Appropriations Act”) was signed into law on December 27, 2020. Among other things, the CARES Act and Appropriations Act include the following provisions impacting financial institutions:
● Community Bank Leverage Ratio. The CARES Act directed federal banking agencies to adopt interim final rules to lower the threshold under the CBLR from 9% to 8% and to provide a reasonable grace period for a community bank that falls below the threshold to regain compliance, in each case until the earlier of the termination date of the national emergency or December 31, 2020. In April 2020, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued two interim final rules implementing this directive. One interim final rule provides that, as of the second quarter 2020, banking organizations with leverage ratios of 8% or greater (and that meet the other existing qualifying criteria) may elect to use the CBLR framework. It also establishes a two-quarter grace period for qualifying community banking organizations whose leverage ratios fall below the 8% CBLR requirement, so long as the banking organization maintains a leverage ratio of 7% or greater. The second interim final rule provides a transition from the temporary 8% CBLR requirement to a 9% CBLR requirement. It establishes a minimum CBLR of 8% for the second through fourth quarters of 2020, 8.5% for 2021, and 9% thereafter, and maintains a two-quarter grace period for qualifying community banking organizations whose leverage ratios fall no more than 100 basis points below the applicable CBLR requirement.
● Temporary Troubled Debt Restructurings Relief. The CARES Act allowed banks to elect to suspend requirements under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic (for loans that were not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019) that would otherwise be categorized as a troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”), including impairment for accounting purposes, until the earlier of 60 days after the termination date of the national emergency or December 31, 2020. Federal banking agencies are required to defer to the determination of the banks making such suspension. The Appropriations Act extended this temporary relief until the earlier of 60 days after the termination date of the national emergency or January 1, 2022.
● Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program. The CARES Act created the SBA’s PPP and it was extended by the Appropriations Act. Under the PPP, money was authorized for small business loans to pay payroll and group health costs, salaries and commissions, mortgage and rent payments, utilities, and interest on other debt. The loans are provided through participating financial institutions, such as the Bank, that process loan applications and service the loans.
Loans made under the PPP are fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the SBA, whose guarantee is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. PPP loans afford borrowers forgiveness up to the principal amount of the PPP covered loan if the proceeds are used to retain workers and maintain payroll or make mortgage interest, lease and utility payments. The SBA will reimburse banks that participate in this program for any amount of a PPP covered loan that is forgiven. Because of the SBA guarantee, we are currently not reserving an allowance for loan losses for these loans.
We actively participated in originating PPP loans, and began processing applications at the inception of the program and through the program's initial expiration. As of December 31, 2020, we had originated 755 applications for approximately $170.3 million, net of deferred fees. We continue to originate PPP loans as part of the 2021 program for first and second draw loans.
Loan Portfolio Exposures
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented loan payment deferral programs to allow customers who were required to close or reduce business operations to defer loan principal and interest payments primarily for 90 days. During the first and second quarters of 2020, we modified 277 loans for a total outstanding principal balance of $360.2 million, or 24.4% of the total loan portfolio. On March 1, 2021, remaining payment deferred loans totaled $10.1 million, or 0.68% of the total loan portfolio, comprising five loans. One loan is a hotel participation loan totaling $9.7 million, one loan is SBA guaranteed totaling $334 thousand and the remaining three loans totaling $89 thousand are consumer unsecured loans.
We are closely and proactively monitoring the effects of the pandemic on our loan and deposit customers and are focused on assessing risks within the loan portfolio and working with customers to minimize losses. We consider pandemic impacted loans to include commercial real estate loans made to hotels, churches, and certain retail and special purpose asset classes. During our assessment of the allowance for loan losses, we addressed the credit risks associated with these pandemic impacted segments and those loans that have requested payment deferrals. The following table shows the number of loans and outstanding loan balances by pandemic-impacted asset class as of December 31, 2020.
COVID Impacted Loans By Asset Class
Year Ended December 31, 2020
(Dollars in thousands)
We believe that as a result of our conservative underwriting discipline at loan origination coupled with the active dialogue we have had with our borrowers, we have the ability and necessary flexibility to assist our customers through this pandemic.
Liquidity and Backup Sources
Our primary and secondary sources of liquidity remain strong. Liquid assets, which include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and investment securities available for sale, totaled $267.2 million at December 31, 2020, or 14.7% of total assets, an increase from $174.5 million, or 11.4%, at December 31, 2019. To maintain ready access to the Bank’s secured lines of credit, the Bank has pledged a portion of its commercial real estate and residential real estate loan portfolios to the FHLB and FRB. Additional borrowing capacity at the FHLB at December 31, 2020 was approximately $124.1 million. Borrowing capacity with the FRB was approximately $124.3 million at December 31, 2020. We also have unsecured federal funds purchased lines of $269.0 million available to us. We anticipate maintaining liquidity at a level sufficient to protect depositors as we endure through this pandemic.
In addition to the funding sources noted above, the Federal Reserve has established a PPP Liquidity Facility (“PPPLF”), authorized under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, that can be used to pledge PPP loans we originate as collateral under the CARES Act. Under Section 1102 of the CARES Act, a PPP loan is assigned a zero risk weighting under the risk based capital rules of the federal banking agencies. In addition, an interim rule issued on April 9, 2020 from the federal banking agencies will allow banks to neutralize the effect of PPP loans financed under the PPPLF on leverage capital ratios. We do not anticipate using this facility to provide us with additional liquidity. The interest rate on this facility is fixed at 0.35% for the term of the facility.
Share Repurchases
While our capital position remains well above the levels to be considered well capitalized for regulatory purposes, due to the heightened volatility of the stock market and uncertainty regarding the impact of COVID-19, we temporarily suspended stock repurchases on March 20, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased and cancelled a total of 487,531 shares of common stock at an average price of $14.90, totaling $7.3 million, all of which occurred during the first quarter of 2020. On January 21, 2021, we approved a new share repurchase program pursuant to which we may repurchase up to 1,080,860 shares of our common stock, or approximately 8% of our outstanding shares of common stock at December 31, 2020. The repurchase program will expire on December 31, 2021, subject to earlier termination of the program by the Board of Directors.
Risks and Uncertainties
The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted a broad range of industries in which our customers operate and could impair their ability to fulfill their financial obligations to us. The pandemic has caused significant disruptions to the U.S. economy and has disrupted banking and other financial activity in the areas we operate. While there has been no material impact to our employees to date, COVID-19 could also potentially create widespread business continuity issues for us.
The U.S. government and its agencies have taken several actions designed to cushion the economic fallout. Most notably, the CARES Act was signed into law at the end of March 2020 as a $2 trillion legislative package. The goal of the CARES Act is to prevent a severe economic downturn through various measures, including direct financial aid to American families and economic stimulus to significantly impacted industry sectors. The package also includes extensive emergency funding for hospitals and providers. In addition to the general impact of COVID-19; certain provisions of the CARES Act as well as other recent legislative and regulatory relief efforts are expected to have a material impact on our operations.
Our business is dependent upon the willingness and ability of our employees and customers to conduct banking and other financial transactions. While it is not possible to know the full universe or extent that the impact of COVID-19 and resulting measures to curtail its spread will have on our business, we are aware of the following items that are potentially material to us and our operations.
Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Our interest income could be reduced due to COVID-19. In keeping with guidance from regulators, we are actively working with COVID-19 affected borrowers to defer their payments, interest, and fees. While interest and fees will still accrue to income, through normal GAAP accounting, should eventual credit losses on these deferred payments emerge, interest income and fees accrued would need to be reversed. In such a scenario, interest income in future periods could be negatively impacted. At this time, we are unable to project the materiality of such an impact, but recognize the breadth of the economic impact may affect our borrowers’ ability to repay in future periods.
Our fee income could be reduced due to COVID-19. In keeping with guidance from regulators, we are actively working with COVID-19 affected customers to waive fees from a variety of sources, such as, but not limited to, insufficient funds and overdraft fees, ATM fees, account maintenance fees, etc. These reductions in fees are thought, at this time, to be temporary in conjunction with the length of the expected COVID-19 related economic crisis. At this time, we are unable to project the materiality of such an impact, but recognize the breadth of the economic impact is likely to impact our fee income in future periods.
Capital and Liquidity
While we believe that we have sufficient capital to withstand an extended economic recession brought about by COVID-19, our regulatory capital ratios could be adversely impacted by future credit losses. We rely on cash on hand as well as dividends from our subsidiary bank to service our debt when necessary. If our capital deteriorates such that our subsidiary bank is unable to pay dividends to us for an extended period of time, we may not be able to service our debt.
We maintain access to multiple sources of liquidity. Wholesale funding markets have remained open to us, and rates for short term funding have recently been quite low. If funding costs become elevated for an extended period of time, it could have an adverse effect on our net interest margin. If an extended recession caused large numbers of our deposit customers to withdraw their funds, we might become more reliant on volatile or more expensive sources of funding.
Asset Valuation
Currently, we do not expect COVID-19 to affect our ability to account timely for the valuation of assets on our balance sheet; however, this could change in future periods. While certain valuation assumptions and judgments will change to account for pandemic-related circumstances such as widening credit spreads, we do not anticipate significant changes in methodology used to determine the fair value of assets measured in accordance with GAAP.
COVID-19 could cause a sustained decline in our stock price or the occurrence of what management would deem to be a triggering event that could, under certain circumstances, cause us to perform a goodwill impairment test and result in an impairment charge being recorded for that period. In the event that we conclude that all or a portion of our goodwill is impaired, a non-cash charge for the amount of such impairment would be recorded to earnings. Such a charge would have no impact on tangible capital or regulatory capital.
It is possible that the lingering effects of COVID-19 could cause the occurrence of what management would deem to be a triggering event that could, under certain circumstances, cause us to perform an intangible asset impairment test and result in an impairment charge being recorded for that period. In the event that we conclude that all or a portion of our intangible assets are impaired, a non-cash charge for the amount of such impairment would be recorded to earnings. Such a charge would have no impact on tangible capital or regulatory capital.
During the fourth quarter of 2020, we engaged a third party specialist to perform an independent goodwill and other intangible assets valuation. During 2020, bank stocks in general as well as our market capitalization declined as a result of the events surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the qualitative analysis completed, we do not believe this decline is indicative of permanent deterioration of the value of the Bank, and as such, no impairment was recorded as of December 31, 2020.
Processes, Controls and Business Continuity Plan
We have invoked our Board approved Pandemic Preparedness Plan that includes a remote working strategy. We do not anticipate incurring additional material cost related to our continued deployment of the remote working strategy. No material operational or internal control challenges or risks have been identified to date. We do not anticipate significant challenges to our ability to maintain our systems and controls in light of the measures we have taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19. We do not currently face any material resource constraint through the implementation of our business continuity plans.
Lending Operations and Accommodations to Borrowers
In keeping with regulatory guidance to work with borrowers during this unprecedented situation and as outlined in the CARES Act, we executed a payment deferral program for our commercial lending clients that are adversely affected by the pandemic. Depending on the demonstrated need of the client, we are deferring either the full loan payment or the principal component of the loan payment generally for 90 days. During the first and second quarters of 2020, we modified 277 loans for a total outstanding principal balance of $360.2 million, or 24.4% of the total loan portfolio. As of March 1, 2021, remaining payment deferred loans totaled $10.1 million, or 0.68% of the total loan portfolio, comprising five loans. In accordance with the CARES Act and interagency guidance issued in March 2020, these short term deferrals are not considered TDRs.
With the passage of the PPP, administered by the SBA, we actively participated in assisting our customers with applications for resources through the program. The majority of the PPP loans we originated have a two-year term and earn interest at 1%. We believe that the majority of these loans will ultimately be forgiven by the SBA in accordance with the terms of the program. As of December 31, 2020, we have closed or approved with the SBA 755 PPP loans representing $170.3 million in funding, net of deferred fees. At December 31, 2020, PPP loans totaled $155.8 million, as loans started to be forgiven by the SBA during the fourth quarter of 2020. We continue to originate PPP loans as part of the 2021 program for first and second draw loans. It is our understanding that loans funded through PPP are fully guaranteed by the U.S. government. Should those circumstances change, we could be required to establish additional allowance for loan losses through a charge to earnings.
Credit
We are working with customers directly affected by COVID-19. We are prepared to offer short-term assistance in accordance with regulatory guidelines. As a result of the current economic environment caused by the COVID-19 virus, we are engaging in more frequent communications with borrowers to better understand their situation and the challenges faced, allowing us to respond proactively as needs and issues arise. Should economic conditions worsen, we could experience further increases in our required allowance for loan losses and record additional provision for loan loss expense. It is possible that our asset quality measures could worsen at future measurement periods if the effects of COVID-19 are prolonged.
Financial Overview
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we continued to expand our market area through organic growth, capitalizing on market disruption as a result of merger activity within the Washington MSA. In addition, as a result of our participation in the PPP, we were able to assist over 225 new customers, which has contributed to our growth during 2020 and represents future loan and deposit growth opportunities.
● Total assets increased to $1.82 billion compared to $1.54 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, an increase of $284.2 million, or 18.5%. The increase in total assets is primarily attributable to our PPP loan originations, net of fees, totaling $155.8 million at December 31, 2020.
● Total loans, net of deferred fees, increased $195.6 million, or 15.4%, from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. Asset quality remains sound with nonperforming loans and loans past due 90 days or more as a percentage of total assets being 0.31% at December 31, 2020, compared to 0.70% at December 31, 2019. Nonperforming assets, which includes nonperforming loans and OREO, as a percentage of total assets were 0.52% and 0.95%, at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
● Total deposits increased $246.8 million, or 19.2%, from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020, the increase attributable to a combination of deposits from new customer relationships (many acquired through PPP originations) as well as growth in existing customer deposits.
● Tangible book value per share at December 31, 2020 was $13.41, an increase from $12.26 at December 31, 2019.
● Net income was $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $15.8 million for the same period of 2019. Our 2020 results were impacted by a recorded impairment from branch closures totaling $676 thousand. In addition, provision for loan losses were elevated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020, increasing $3.3 million to $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019. Excluding the branch closure impairment, we would have recorded net income of $16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our 2019 results were impacted by merger-related expenses from our acquisition of Colombo totaling $102 thousand, net of tax. Excluding these merger-related expenses, we would have recorded net income of $15.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. For a reconciliation of this non-GAAP information which excludes the effect of the impairment from branch closures and merger-related expenses, please refer to the table below.

(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)
Results of Operations-Years Ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019
Overview
We recorded net income of $15.5 million, or $1.10 per diluted common share, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net income of $15.8 million, or $1.07 per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our 2020 results were impacted by one-time branch closure costs of $676 thousand and increased provision for loan losses. Excluding the branch closure costs, we would have recorded income of $16.0 million, or $1.13 per diluted common share, for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our 2019 results were impacted by additional merger-related expenses related to our acquisition of Colombo totaling $133 thousand. Excluding these merger-related expenses, we would have recorded income of $15.9 million, or $1.07 per diluted common share, for the year ended December 31, 2019. See above table for a reconciliation of GAAP net income to operating earnings (non-GAAP).
Net interest income increased $4.6 million to $52.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $48.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of decreases in the costs of interest-bearing deposits. Provision for loan losses was $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1.7 million for the same period of 2019, elevated primarily as a result of qualitative factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Noninterest income increased $345 thousand to $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $2.5 million for 2019, primarily as a result of an increase in service charges on deposit accounts and income related to bank-owned life insurance. Noninterest expense was $30.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $28.9 million for the same period of 2019. Noninterest expense increased during 2020 primarily as a result of our planned network infrastructure upgrades, branch closure costs, and an increased in FDIC insurance (which was a result of assessment credits expiring in 2019).
The return on average assets for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 0.91% and 1.09%, respectively. The return on average equity for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 8.48% and 9.32%, respectively. Excluding branch closure costs and the associated taxes recorded during 2020, return on average assets and return on average equity for the year ended December 31, 2020 would have been 0.94% and 8.77%, respectively. Excluding merger-related expenses and associated taxes recorded during 2019, return on average assets and return on average equity for the year ended December 31, 2019 would have been 1.10% and 9.38%, respectively. See above table for a reconciliation of GAAP net income to operating earnings (non-GAAP).

The level of net interest income is affected primarily by variations in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities, as well as changes in interest rates. See “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” below for further information. The following table shows the effect that these factors had on the interest earned from our interest-earning assets and interest incurred on our interest-bearing liabilities.

Net interest income, on a tax equivalent basis, is a financial measure that we believe provides a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. To derive our net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use our federal and state statutory tax rates for the periods presented. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources.
The following table provides a reconciliation of our GAAP net interest income to our tax equivalent net interest income.
Supplemental Financial Data and Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures
Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018
(Dollars in thousands)
Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $52.6 million on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, compared to $48.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $4.6 million, or 9.5%. The increase in net interest income was primarily a result of a decrease in the cost of interest-bearing deposits, reflecting our efforts to decrease deposit rates in light of the current rate environment. During March 2020, in response to market conditions as the economy was impacted by COVID-19, the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve reduced its targeted fed funds rate an unprecedented 150 basis points. We responded quickly by reducing deposit rates substantially to offset the repricing of the variable rate portion of our loan portfolio. We continue to review interest rates on deposits and other borrowed funds and reduce rates where possible.
Our net interest margin, on a tax equivalent basis, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 3.28% and 3.48%, respectively. The decrease in our net interest margin was primarily a result of the decreased rate environment during 2020, decreasing the yields on interest-earning assets, offset by the decrease in the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities.
The yield on interest-earning assets decreased 65 basis points to 4.18% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 4.83% for the same period of 2019, a result of the decreased rate environment during 2020. In addition, our origination of PPP loans during 2020, which earn an interest rate of 1% plus net deferred fees, reduced net interest margin by 5 basis points along with excess liquidity, which reduced net interest margin an additional 5 basis points, for 2020. Offsetting this decrease in yields on earning assets was a 58 basis point decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, reflecting the decreases in rates we made to help offset the decreased yields on our earning assets during 2020.
Average interest-earning assets increased by 16.2% to $1.61 billion at December 31, 2020 compared to $1.38 billion at December 31, 2019, which resulted in an increase in total interest income on a tax equivalent basis of $368 thousand, to $67.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $66.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. While volume increased during 2020, contributing $7.6 million in additional interest income, the decreases in average rate significantly impacted interest income earned, decreasing interest income by $7.2 million. The increase in our earning assets was primarily driven by an increase in average volume of loans receivable of $210.7 million, which contributed to an additional $7.4 million in interest income. Over half of the increase in loan volume was attributable to PPP loan originations, which increased our 2020 average loan balances by $114.3 million, and yielded 2.62%. The increase in interest income on loans was impacted by a decrease in yields earned on the loan portfolio, which decreased interest income $6.4 million. Average balances of nonperforming loans, which consist of nonaccrual loans, are included in the net interest margin calculation and did not have a material impact on our net interest margin in 2020 and 2019.
Total average interest-bearing deposits increased $94.2 million to $1.05 billion at December 31, 2020 compared to $952.9 million at December 31, 2019. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $120.3 million, or 44.5% to $390.7 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $270.4 million at December 31, 2019. The increase in total deposits, and specifically noninterest-bearing deposits, reflects a combination of new customer relationships (primarily from PPP originations) and as well as growth in average deposit balances from existing customers. The largest increase in average interest-bearing deposit balances was in our interest checking accounts, which increased $53.5 million compared to 2019. Average time deposits increased $1.6 million to $317.9 million as of December 31, 2020 compared to $316.2 million at December 31, 2019, as customers now prefer short-term deposit options such as interest checking accounts as a result of the low interest rate environment. Average wholesale deposits increased $26.2 million to $100.9 million as of December 31, 2020 compared to $74.7 million as of December 31, 2019, as this became a cheaper source of funding for the Bank during 2020. This change in the mix of our interest-bearing liabilities, in addition to the action taken by the Bank to reduce deposit rates during 2020, have contributed to the decrease in our cost of interest-bearing deposits to 1.18% in 2020 from 1.77% in 2019.
The cost of other borrowed funds, which include federal funds purchased, FHLB advances, and our subordinated notes used to help fund our balance sheet growth, decreased 131 basis points to 3.71% in 2020 from 5.02% in 2019. The decrease in the cost of other borrowed funds was a result of FHLB advances recorded during 2020 with an average rate of 1.15%. The average volume of other borrowed funds increased $21.2 million during 2020 to $57.9 million from $36.7 million in 2019, primarily as a result of the subordinated debt we issued during the fourth quarter of 2020 at a rate of 4.88%.
Provision Expense and Allowance for Loan Losses
Our policy is to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that represents our best estimate of inherent losses in the loan portfolio. Both the amount of the provision and the level of the allowance for loan losses are impacted by many factors, including general and industry-specific economic conditions, actual credit losses, historical trends and specific conditions of individual borrowers. We are not required to implement the provisions of CECL until January 1, 2023, and we are continuing to account for the allowance for losses under the incurred loss model.
We recorded a provision for loan losses of $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to a provision for loan losses of $1.7 million for the same period of 2019. The allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2020 was $15.0 million compared to $10.2 million at December 31, 2019. Our allowance for loan loss ratio as a percent of total loans, net of deferred fees and costs, for December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 1.02% and 0.81%, respectively. The increased provision for loan losses during 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily reflects changes in certain qualitative factors as a result of the local economic conditions resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to a slight increase in loan origination volume during 2020, excluding PPP loans. In addition, we evaluated our exposure to certain credit risks within industry segments in our loan portfolio that are most impacted by the pandemic and for those loans that have deferred payments. Industry subgroups such as retail, hotels, churches, and other commercial real estate loans were isolated within our allowance model, in addition to those loans deferring payments, and qualitative factors were adjusted to increase reserves for these loans as a result of their risk profiles. Specific reserves increased $1.7 million to $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $393 thousand at December 31, 2019, as a result of the impairment analysis completed for impaired loans during 2020.
See “Asset Quality” section below for additional information on the credit quality of the loan portfolio.
Noninterest Income
The following table provides detail for non-interest income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Non-Interest Income
Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
(Dollars in thousands)
Noninterest income includes service charges on deposits and loans, loan swap fee income, income from our BOLI policies, and other fee income, and continues to supplement our operating results. Noninterest income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $2.9 million and $2.5 million, respectively. Fee income from service charges on deposits and other fee income was $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of 9.7%, as compared $1.4 million for the same period of 2019, primarily a result of an increase in customer deposit relationships over the past year. Loan swap fees for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $378 thousand and $449 thousand, respectively. Income from BOLI increased 67.5% to $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of purchases of additional policies during 2019 totaling $20.0 million. Noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 included gains on the sale of securities available-for-sale totaling $141 thousand. These securities were sold as they had larger premiums susceptible to prepayment risk, decreasing future interest income. There were no gains on security sales during 2019. Noninterest income for 2020 and 2019 were impacted by losses on loans held for sale totaling $451 thousand and $145 thousand, respectively. Loans held for sale were comprised of consumer unsecured loans which were transferred to held for sale at the end of 2019. On April 1, 2020, we transferred these loans back to held for investment at the lower of cost or market as the market for these types of loans receded due to market volatility as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Noninterest Expense
The following table reflects the components of non-interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Non-Interest Expense
Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
(Dollars in thousands)
Noninterest expense includes, among other things, salaries and benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, professional fees, data processing, insurance and miscellaneous expenses. Noninterest expense was $30.8 million and $28.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
During the third quarter of 2020, we closed two branch office locations. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, more clients have transitioned to our electronic banking products, reducing the need to have physical branch locations to serve our customers. The right-of-use assets and leasehold improvements written off as a result of closing these locations totaled $676 thousand. Annual costs savings for the closure of these locations related to occupancy expense is expected to be approximately $350 thousand, of which, we began to see a portion of those cost savings during the fourth quarter of 2020, which contributed to the decrease in occupancy expense year-over-year. Other savings of approximately $250 thousand include salaries and benefits expense as the employees for each of these locations filled other vacant positions with the Bank, reducing the need to hire additional personnel.
Data processing and network administration expense increased $390 thousand to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as a result of planned upgrades to our network infrastructure. Loan related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $1.1 million, an increase of $611 thousand as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of legal expenses incurred to resolve several problem loans during 2020. Lastly, FDIC insurance increased $504 to $748 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily as a result of assessment credits received by the Bank expiring during 2019.
Income Taxes
We recorded a provision for income tax expense of $4.2 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Our effective tax rate for December 31, 2020 was 21.1%, compared to 20.9% for 2019. Our effective tax rate for 2019 is less than the statutory rate of 21% because of discrete tax benefits recorded as a result of exercises of nonqualified stock options during 2019.
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
Overview
At December 31, 2020, total assets were $1.82 billion, an increase of 18.5%, or $284.2 million, from $1.54 billion at December 31, 2019. Total loans receivable, net of deferred fees and costs, increased 15.4%, or $195.6 million, to $1.47 billion at December 31, 2020, from $1.27 billion at December 31, 2019. Total investment securities decreased by $15.2 million, or 10.7%, to $126.4 million at December 31, 2020, from $141.6 million at December 31, 2019. Total deposits increased 19.2%, or $246.8 million, to $1.53 billion at December 31, 2020, from $1.29 billion at December 31, 2019. From time to time, we may utilize other borrowed funds such as federal funds purchased and FHLB advances as an additional funding source for the Bank. The Bank had FHLB advances outstanding of $25.0 million and $15.0 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. At December 31, 2020, we had no federal funds purchased. Federal funds purchased at December 31, 2019 was $10.0 million.
On October 13, 2020, we announced the completion of our private placement of $20 million of our 4.875% Fixed to Floating Subordinated Notes due 2030 (the "Notes") to certain qualified institutional buyers and accredited investors. The Notes have a maturity date of October 15, 2030 and carry a fixed rate of interest of 4.875% for the first five years. Thereafter, the Notes will pay interest at 3-month SOFR plus 471 basis points, resetting quarterly. The Notes include a right of prepayment without penalty on or after October 15, 2025. The Notes have been structured to qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes. We plan to use the proceeds from the placement of the Notes for general corporate purposes, to include supporting capital ratios at the Bank, and potential repayment of a portion of the $25.0 million outstanding subordinated debt callable June 30, 2021.
Loans Receivable, Net
Total loans receivable, net of deferred fees and costs, were $1.47 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $195.6 million, or 15.4%, compared to $1.27 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase in the loans receivable portfolio was primarily attributable to PPP loan originations, net of deferred fees, totaling $153.0 million as of December 31, 2020 assisting both existing and new customers, in addition to organic loan growth primarily in our commercial real estate and commercial construction portfolios. At December 31, 2019, we had loans held for sale totaling $11.2 million compared to none for 2020. During 2019, we reclassified our unsecured consumer loan portfolio, as the earnings stream from this segment of our loan portfolio was not as expected as a result of net charge-offs totaling $647 thousand recorded during 2019. On April 1, 2020, we transferred these loans back to held for investment at the lower of cost or market as the market for these types of loans receded due to market volatility as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Commercial real estate loans totaled $790.0 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $747.7 million at December 31, 2019, an increase of $42.4 million, or 5.7%. Owner-occupied commercial real estate loans were $182.9 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $205.9 million at December 31, 2019. Nonowner-occupied commercial real estate loans were $607.5 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $547.8 million at December 31, 2019. Construction loans totaled $222.3 million at December 31, 2020, or 15.1% of total loans receivable. Of the $222.3 million in construction loans, $38.8 million are collateralized by land and there are no lot acquisition and development loans (which have a higher degree of credit risk than the remaining portion of the construction portfolio). Our commercial real estate portfolio, including construction loans is diversified by asset type and geographic concentration. We plan to manage this portion of our portfolio in a disciplined manner. We have comprehensive policies to monitor, measure, and mitigate our loan concentrations within this portfolio segment, including rigorous credit approval, monitoring and administrative practices.
The following table presents the composition of our loans receivable portfolio at each of the five years ended December 31, 2020.

Asset Quality
Nonperforming assets, defined as nonaccrual loans, loans contractually past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest and still accruing, and OREO at December 31, 2020 were $9.5 million compared to $14.6 million at December 31, 2019. Our ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets was 0.52% at December 31, 2020 compared to 0.95% at December 31, 2019. TDRs, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 totaled $97 thousand and $3.9 million, respectively. The TDR recorded during 2019 is included in our total of nonaccrual loans and nonperforming assets as of December 31, 2019. However, this TDR did pay off in full, including past due interest and late fees, during the first quarter of 2020.
Nonperforming loans, which are primarily commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans, decreased $5.1 million during 2020 as compared to 2019. Loans that we have classified as nonperforming are a result of customer specific deterioration, mostly financial in nature, and not a result of economic, industry, or environmental causes that we might see as a pattern for possible future losses within our loan portfolio. For each of our criticized assets, we conduct an impairment analysis to determine the level of additional or specific reserves required for any portion of the loan that may result in a loss. As a result of the analysis completed, we have specific reserves totaling $2.1 million and $392 thousand at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Because these loans are individually evaluated for impairment, nonperforming loans are excluded from the general reserve allocation.
We categorize loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as current financial information, historical payment experience, collateral adequacy, credit documentation, and current economic trends, among other factors. We analyze loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This analysis includes, larger non-homogeneous loans such as commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans. This analysis is performed on an ongoing basis as new information is obtained. At December 31, 2020, we had $12.1 million in loans identified as special mention within the originated loan portfolio, a decrease of $4.9 million from December 31, 2019. Special mention rated loans are loans that have a potential weakness that deserves management’s close attention; however, the borrower continues to pay in accordance with their contract. The decrease from December 31, 2019 is a result of a significant number of loans being either upgraded or having been paid off during 2020. These loans do not have a specific reserve and are considered well-secured.
At December 31, 2020, we had $17.1 million in loans identified as substandard within the originated loan portfolio, an increase of $7.3 million from December 31, 2019. The increase in substandard loans was primarily related to one loan, which is a payment deferred COVID-19 modified hotel loan. This borrower is currently making interest only payments and has agreed to continue to do so for the next 12 months. This loan also does not qualify as a TDR as this customer was current and paying as agreed upon prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and was only modified as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic which has impacted their business operations. We expect that this borrower will resume making regularly scheduled loan payments at the end of the forbearance period. Substandard rated loans are loans that are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. For each of these substandard loans, a liquidation analysis is completed. At December 31, 2020, specific reserves on originated and acquired loans totaling $2.1 million, has been allocated within the allowance for loan losses to supplement any shortfall of collateral.
We recorded annualized net charge-offs of 0.02% and 0.05% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The following tables provide additional information on our asset quality for the periods presented.

At December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no performing loans considered a potential problem loan. Potential problem loans are defined as loans that are not included in the 90 day past due, nonaccrual or adversely classified or restructured categories, but for which known information about possible credit problems causes management to be uncertain as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms which may in the future result in disclosure in the past due, nonaccrual or restructured loan categories. We take a conservative approach with respect to risk rating loans in our portfolio. Based upon the status as a potential problem loan, these loans receive heightened scrutiny and ongoing intensive risk management. Additionally, our loan loss allowance methodology incorporates increased reserve factors for certain loans that are adversely rated but not impaired as compared to the general portfolio.
As previously mentioned, we have evaluated our exposure to credit risks directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic and have identified the following subgroups of industry segments most impacted by the pandemic. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented loan payment deferral programs to allow customers who were required to close or reduce business operations to defer loan principal and interest payments primarily for 90 days. During the first and second quarters of 2020, we modified 277 loans for a total outstanding principal balance of $360.2 million, or 24.4% of the total loan portfolio. On March 1, 2021, remaining payment deferred loans totaled $10.1 million, or 0.68% of the total loan portfolio, comprising five loans. One loan is a hotel participation loan totaling $9.7 million (mentioned above in the substandard loans discussion), one loan is SBA guaranteed totaling $334 thousand and the remaining three loans totaling $89 thousand are consumer unsecured loans.
We are closely and proactively monitoring the effects of the pandemic on our loan and deposit customers and are focused on assessing risks within the loan portfolio and working with customers to minimize losses. We consider pandemic impacted loans to include commercial real estate loans made to hotels, churches, and certain retail and special purpose asset classes. During our assessment of the allowance for loan losses, we addressed the credit risks associated with these pandemic impacted segments and those loans that have requested payment deferrals. The following table shows the number of loans and outstanding loan balances by pandemic-impacted asset class as of December 31, 2020.
COVID Impacted Loans By Asset Class
Year Ended December 31, 2020

We believe that as a result of our conservative underwriting discipline at loan origination coupled with the active dialogue we have had with our borrowers, we have the ability and necessary flexibility to assist our customers through this pandemic.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had one OREO property with a fair value of $3.9 million. We are in the process of selling this property and do not expect a material gain or loss from the current fair value of the property as we recorded a $1.1 million gain on the foreclosure of the property during the year ended December 31, 2017.
While our loan growth has continued to be strong, unexpected changes in economic growth could adversely affect our loan portfolio, including causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which would adversely impact our charge-offs and provision for loan losses. Deterioration in real estate values, employment data and household incomes may also result in higher credit losses for us. Also, in the ordinary course of business, we may also be subject to a concentration of credit risk to a particular industry, counterparty, borrower or issuer. At December 31, 2020, our commercial real estate portfolio (including construction lending) was 68.8% of our total loan portfolio. A deterioration in the financial condition or prospects of a particular industry or a failure or downgrade of, or default by, any particular entity or group of entities could negatively impact our business, perhaps materially, and the systems by which we set limits and monitor the level of our credit exposure to individual entities and industries, may not function as we have anticipated.
See “Critical Accounting Policies” above for more information on our allowance for loan losses methodology.
The following tables present additional information pertaining to the activity in and allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan type and the percentage of the loan type to the total loan portfolio. The allocation of the allowance for loan losses to a category of loans is not necessarily indicative of future losses or charge-offs, and does not restrict the use of the allowance to any specific category of loans.

Investment Securities
Our investment securities portfolio is used as a source of income and liquidity. The investment portfolio consists of investment securities available-for-sale, investment securities held-to-maturity and certificates of deposit. Investment securities available-for-sale are those securities that we intend to hold for an indefinite period of time, but not necessarily until maturity. These securities are carried at fair value and may be sold as part of an asset/liability strategy, liquidity management or regulatory capital management. Investment securities held-to-maturity were $264 thousand at each of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and are those securities that we have the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are carried at amortized cost. The fair value of our investment securities available-for-sale was $126.2 million at December 31, 2020, a decrease of $15.2 million or 10.7%, from $141.3 million at December 31, 2019. We sold $13.2 million in available-for-sale investment securities during 2020 as these securities had larger premiums susceptible to prepayment risk, decreasing future interest income.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the majority of the investment securities portfolio consisted of securities rated AAA by a leading rating agency. Investment securities which carry a AAA rating are judged to be of the best quality and carry the smallest degree of investment risk. All of our mortgage-backed securities are guaranteed by either the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or the Government National Mortgage Association. Investment securities that were pledged to secure public deposits totaled $9.2 million and $11.3 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.
We complete reviews for other-than-temporary impairment at least quarterly. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, only investment grade securities were in an unrealized loss position. Investment securities with unrealized losses are a result of pricing changes due to recent and negative conditions in the current market environment and not as a result of permanent credit impairment. Contractual cash flows for the agency mortgage-backed securities are guaranteed and/or funded by the U.S. government. Municipal securities have third party protective elements and there are no negative indications that the contractual cash flows will not be received when due. We do not intend to sell nor do we believe we will be required to sell any of our temporarily impaired securities prior to the recovery of the amortized cost.
No other-than-temporary impairment has been recognized for the securities in our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019.
We hold restricted investments in equities of the FRB and FHLB. At December 31, 2020, we owned $2.4 million in FHLB stock and $4.0 million in FRB stock. At December 31, 2019, we owned $1.9 million in FHLB stock and $4.0 million in FRB stock.
The following table reflects the composition of our investment portfolio, at amortized cost, at December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.

Deposits and Other Borrowed Funds
Total deposits were $1.53 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $246.8 million, or 19.2%, from $1.29 billion at December 31, 2019. Noninterest-bearing deposits totaled $399.1 million at December 31, 2020, comprising 26.0% of total deposits and increased $92.8 million, or 30.3%, compared to December 31, 2019. The increase in total deposits during 2020 reflects a combination of new customer relationships (primarily from PPP loan originations) as well as growth in deposit balances from existing customers. At December 31, 2020, deposits from municipalities, which are secured by a letter of credit issued by the FHLB and a portion of our investment securities, represented 6.4% of our total deposits. Deposits of any individual municipality are generally limited to 5% of total assets and in the aggregate, municipalities are limited to 18% of total assets. Some of these customers utilize our treasury management services, and all maintain deposits of varying types and maturities. As such, we believe that these customers are unlikely to abruptly terminate their relationship with us. However, in the event that we were to lose all or a significant portion of the deposits of one or more of these customers, we believe that we have adequate alternative sources of liquidity to enable us to replace these funds, although the cost of such replacement sources of liquidity could be higher.
The following table provides information on our deposit composition at December 31, 2020.

The remaining maturity of time deposits at December 31, 2020 are as follows:
Wholesale deposits decreased to $50.0 million at December 31, 2020, from $100.0 million at December 31, 2019. In addition, we are a member of the IntraFi Network (“IntraFi”), which gives us the ability to offer Certificates of Deposit Account Registry Service (“CDARS”), and Insured Cash Sweep (“ICS”), products to our customers who seek to maximize FDIC insurance protection. When a customer places a large deposit with us for IntraFi, funds are placed into certificates of deposit or other deposit products with other banks in the CDARS and ICS networks in increments of less than $250 thousand so that principal and interest are eligible for FDIC insurance protection. These deposits are part of our core deposit base. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had $138.9 million and $71.4 million, respectively, in either CDARS reciprocal or ICS reciprocal products. The increase from December 31, 2019 is a result of certain customers wanting additional FDIC insurance protection as a result of the pandemic in addition to increases in customer deposit activity in these products.
The following table reports those certificates of deposit that exceed $100,000 by maturity for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Other borrowed funds, which include federal funds purchased, FHLB advances, and our subordinated notes, were $69.1 million at December 31, 2020, and $49.5 million at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2020, we had $25.0 million in FHLB advances, $44.1 million in subordinated debt, net of unamortized issuance costs, and no federal funds purchased. At December 31, 2019, we had $10.0 million in federal funds purchased, $15.0 million in FHLB advances and $24.5 million in subordinated notes.
On October 13, 2020, we announced the completion of our private placement of $20 million of our 4.875% Fixed to Floating Subordinated Notes due 2030 (the “Notes”) to certain qualified institutional buyers and accredited investors. The Notes have a maturity date of October 15, 2030 and carry a fixed rate of interest of 4.875% for the first five years. Thereafter, the Notes will pay interest at 3-month SOFR plus 471 basis points, resetting quarterly. The Notes include a right of prepayment without penalty on or after October 15, 2025. The Notes have been structured to qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes. We plan to use the proceeds from the placement of the Notes for general corporate purposes, to include supporting capital ratios at the Bank, and potential repayment of a portion of the $25.0 million outstanding subordinated debt callable June 30, 2021.
The following table reflects the short-term borrowings and other borrowed funds outstanding at December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.

Capital Resources
Capital adequacy is an important measure of financial stability and performance. Our objectives are to maintain a level of capitalization that is sufficient to sustain asset growth and promote depositor and investor confidence.
Regulatory agencies measure capital adequacy utilizing a formula that takes into account the individual risk profile of the financial institution. The minimum capital requirements are: (i) CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6%; (iii) a total risk based capital ratio of 8%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. Additionally, a capital conservation buffer requirement of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress and is applicable to our CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios. Including the conservation buffer, we currently consider our minimum capital ratios to be as follows: 7.00% for CET1; 8.50% for Tier 1 capital; and 10.50% for Total capital. Banking institutions with a ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation.
On January 1, 2020, the federal banking agencies adopted a CBLR, which is calculated by dividing tangible equity capital by average consolidated total assets. If a “qualified community bank,” generally a depository institution or depository institution holding company with consolidated assets of less than $10 billion, opts into the CBLR framework and has a leverage ratio which exceeds the CBLR threshold, which was initially set at 9%, then such bank will be considered to have met all generally applicable leverage and risk based capital requirements under Basel III, the capital ratio requirements for “well capitalized” status under Section 38 of the FDIA, and any other leverage or capital requirements to which it is subject. A bank or holding company may be excluded from qualifying community bank status base on its risk profile, including consideration of its off-balance sheet exposures; trading assets and liabilities; total notional derivatives exposures and such other facts as the appropriate federal banking agencies determine to be appropriate.
In April 2020, as required by the CARES Act, the federal banking agencies issued two interim final rules related to the CBLR framework. One interim final rule provides that, as of the second quarter of 2020, banking organizations with leverage ratios of 8% or greater (and that meet the other existing qualifying criteria) may elect to use the CBLR framework. It also establishes a two-quarter grace period for qualifying community banking organizations whose leverage ratios fall below the 8% CBLR requirement, so long as the banking organization maintains a leverage ratio of 7% or greater. The second interim final rule provides a transition from the temporary 8% CBLR requirement to a 9% CBLR requirement. It establishes a minimum CBLR of 8% for the second through fourth quarters of 2020, 8.5% for 2021, and 9% thereafter, and maintains a two-quarter grace period for qualifying community banking organizations whose leverage ratios fall no more than 100 basis points below the applicable CBLR requirement.
At January 1, 2020, we qualified for and adopted this simplified capital structure, however, there can be no assurance that satisfaction of the CBLR will provide adequate capital for our operations and growth, or an adequate cushion against increased levels of nonperforming assets or weakened economic conditions.
Shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2020 was $189.5 million, an increase of $10.4 million, compared to $179.1 million at December 31, 2019. The increase in shareholders’ equity was primarily attributable to the recognition of net income of $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Common stock issued as a result of option exercises increased shareholders’ equity by $375 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020. Accumulated other comprehensive income increased $1.1 million during 2020, primarily as a result of an increase in market value of our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio.
During the first quarter of 2020, we adopted a share repurchase program. The Company was authorized to repurchase up to 1,112,165 shares of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock, or approximately 8% of outstanding shares as of December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased and cancelled a total of 487,531 shares of common stock at an average price of $14.90, totaling $7.3 million, all of which occurred during the first quarter of 2020. Due to the uncertainty related to the potential economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we temporarily suspended share repurchases on March 20, 2020. On January 21, 2021, we approved a new share repurchase program pursuant to which we may repurchase up to 1,080,860 shares of our common stock, or approximately 8% of our outstanding shares of common stock at December 31, 2020. The repurchase program will expire on December 31, 2021, subject to earlier termination of the program by the Board of Directors.
Total shareholders’ equity to total assets for December 31, 2020 was 10.4% and for December 31, 2019 was 11.7%. Tangible book value per shares (a non-GAAP financial measure which is defined in the table below) at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 was $13.41 and $12.26, respectively. The Bank’s CBLR at December 31, 2020 was 11.65%. Total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets for the Bank was 13.43% at December 31, 2019, which was the former capitalization calculation completed prior to the adoption of CBLR. Accordingly, we were considered “well capitalized” for regulatory purposes at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.
As noted above, regulatory capital levels for the bank meets those established for “well capitalized” institutions. While we are currently considered “well capitalized,” we may from time to time find it necessary to access the capital markets to meet our growth objectives or capitalize on specific business opportunities.
As the Company is a bank holding company with less than $3 billion in assets, and which does not (i) conduct significant off balance sheet activities, (ii) engage in significant non-banking activities, and (iii) have a material amount of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), it is not currently subject to risk-based capital requirements adopted by the Federal Reserve, pursuant to the small bank holding company policy statement. The Federal Reserve has not historically deemed a bank holding company ineligible for application of the small bank holding company policy statement solely because its common stock is registered under the Exchange Act. There can be no assurance that the Federal Reserve will continue this practice.
The following tables shows the minimum capital requirement and our capital position at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 for the Bank.

Liquidity
Liquidity in the banking industry is defined as the ability to meet the demand for funds of both depositors and borrowers. We must be able to meet these needs by obtaining funding from depositors or other lenders or by converting non-cash items into cash. The objective of our liquidity management program is to ensure that we always have sufficient resources to meet the demands of our depositors and borrowers. Stable core deposits and a strong capital position provide the base for our liquidity position. We believe we have demonstrated our ability to attract deposits because of our convenient branch locations, personal service, technology and pricing.
In addition to deposits, we have access to the different wholesale funding markets. These markets include the brokered certificate of deposit market and the federal funds market. We are a member of the IntraFi Network, which allows banking customers to access FDIC insurance protection on deposits through our Bank which exceed FDIC insurance limits. We also have one-way authority with IntraFi for both their CDARs and ICS products which provides the Bank the ability to access additional wholesale funding as needed. We also maintain secured lines of credit with the FRB and the FHLB for which we can borrow up to the allowable amount for the collateral pledged. Having diverse funding alternatives reduces our reliance on any one source for funding.
Cash flow from amortizing assets or maturing assets also provides funding to meet the needs of depositors and borrowers.
We have established a formal liquidity contingency plan which establishes a liquidity management team and provides guidelines for liquidity management. For our liquidity management program, we first determine our current liquidity position and then forecast liquidity based on anticipated changes in the balance sheet. In this forecast, we expect to maintain a liquidity cushion. We also stress test our liquidity position under several different stress scenarios, from moderate to severe. Guidelines for the forecasted liquidity cushion and for liquidity cushions for each stress scenario have been established. We believe that we have sufficient resources to meet our liquidity needs.
Our primary and secondary sources of liquidity remain strong. Liquid assets, which include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and investment securities available for sale, totaled $267.2 million at December 31, 2020, or 14.7% of total assets, an increase from $174.5 million, or 11.4%, at December 31, 2019. To maintain ready access to the Bank’s secured lines of credit, the Bank has pledged a portion of its commercial real estate and residential real estate loan portfolios to the FHLB and FRB. Additional borrowing capacity at the FHLB at December 31, 2020 was approximately $124.1 million. Borrowing capacity with the FRB was approximately $124.3 million at December 31, 2020. These facilities are subject to the FHLB and the FRB approving disbursement to us. We also have unsecured federal funds purchased lines of $269.0 million available to us. We anticipate maintaining liquidity at a level sufficient to protect depositors as we endure through this pandemic, provide for reasonable growth, and fully comply with all regulatory requirements.
In addition to the funding sources noted above, the Federal Reserve has established the PPPLF, authorized under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, that can be used to pledge PPP loans we originate as collateral under the CARES Act. Under Section 1102 of the CARES Act, a PPP loan is assigned a zero risk weighting under the risk based capital rules of the federal banking agencies. In addition, an interim rule issued on April 9, 2020 from the federal banking agencies will allow banks to neutralize the effect of PPP loans financed under the PPPLF on leverage capital ratios. We do not anticipate using this facility to provide us with additional liquidity. The interest rate on this facility is fixed at 0.35% for the term of the facility.
Liquidity is essential to our business. Our liquidity could be impaired by an inability to access the capital markets or by unforeseen outflows of cash, including deposits. This situation may arise due to circumstances that we may be unable to control, such as general market disruption, negative views about the financial services industry generally, or an operational problem that affects a third party or us. Our ability to borrow from other financial institutions on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events. As discussed under the caption “Deposits and Other Borrowed Funds” above, we have a deposit concentration related to municipalities at December 31, 2020. While we believe we have a healthy liquidity position and do not anticipate the loss of deposits of any of the significant deposit customers, any of the factors discussed above could materially impact our liquidity position in the future.
Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk and Credit Risk
We are a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet.
The Bank’s maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments. We evaluate each customer’s credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis and require collateral to support financial instruments when deemed necessary. The amount of collateral obtained upon extension of credit is based on management’s evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies but may include deposits held by us, marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, and income-producing commercial properties.
Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates up to one year or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. These instruments represent obligations to extend credit or guarantee borrowings and are not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The rates and terms of these instruments are competitive with others in the market in which we do business.
Unfunded commitments under lines of credit are commitments for possible future extensions of credit to existing customers. Those lines of credit may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which we have committed.
Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments we issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing, and similar transactions. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. We hold certificates of deposit, deposit accounts, and real estate as collateral supporting those commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary.
With the exception of these off-balance sheet arrangements, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, changes in financial condition, revenue, expenses, capital expenditures, or capital resources, that is material to the business of the Company.
At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, unused commitments to fund loans and lines of credit totaled $166.3 million and $244.4 million, respectively. Commercial and standby letters of credit totaled $5.5 million and $9.0 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
As a financial institution, we are exposed to various business risks, including interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is the risk to earnings and value arising from volatility in market interest rates. Interest rate risk arises from timing differences in the repricings and maturities of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, changes in the expected maturities of assets and liabilities arising from embedded options, such as borrowers’ ability to prepay loans and depositors’ ability to redeem certificates of deposit before maturity, changes in the shape of the yield curve where interest rates increase or decrease in a nonparallel fashion, and changes in spread relationships between different yield curves, such as U.S. Treasuries and LIBOR. Our goal is to maximize net interest income without incurring excessive interest rate risk. Management of net interest income and interest rate risk must be consistent with the level of capital and liquidity that we maintain. We manage interest rate risk through an asset and liability committee (“ALCO”). ALCO is responsible for managing our interest rate risk in conjunction with liquidity and capital management.
We employ an independent consulting firm to model our interest rate sensitivity. We use a net interest income simulation model as our primary tool to measure interest rate sensitivity. Many assumptions are developed based on expected activity in the balance sheet. For maturing assets, assumptions are created for the redeployment of these assets. For maturing liabilities, assumptions are developed for the replacement of these funding sources. Assumptions are also developed for assets and liabilities that could reprice during the modeled time period. These assumptions also cover how we expect rates to change on non-maturity deposits such as interest checking, money market checking, savings accounts as well as certificates of deposit. Based on inputs that include the current balance sheet, the current level of interest rates and the developed assumptions, the model then produces an expected level of net interest income assuming that market rates remain unchanged. This is considered the base case. Next, the model determines what net interest income would be based on specific changes in interest rates. The rate simulations are performed for a two year period and include ramped rate changes of down 100 basis points to 400 basis points and up 100 basis points to 400 basis points. In both the up and down scenarios, the model assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve. The results of these simulations are then compared to the base case.
Stress testing the balance sheet and net interest income using instantaneous parallel shock movements in the yield curve of 100 to 400 basis points is a regulatory and banking industry practice. However, these stress tests may not represent a realistic forecast of future interest rate movements in the yield curve. In addition, instantaneous parallel interest rate shock modeling is not a predictor of actual future performance of earnings. It is a financial metric used to manage interest rate risk and track the movement of the Bank’s interest rate risk position over a historical time frame for comparison purposes.
At December 31, 2020, our asset/liability position was neutral based on our interest rate sensitivity model in the one-year time frame and asset sensitive in the two-year time frame. Our net interest income would decrease by 0.5% in an up 100 basis point scenario and would decrease by 0.6% in an up 400 basis point scenario over a one-year time frame. In the two-year time horizon, our net interest income would increase by 3.5% in an up 100 basis point scenario and would increase by 12.5% in an up 400 basis point scenario. This neutral asset/liability position is caused by the level of fixed-rate PPP loans we originated and the increase in non-interest demand deposits we have experienced during 2020. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, all interest rate risk stress tests measures were within our board policy established limits in each of the increased rate scenarios.
Additional information on our interest rate sensitivity for a static balance sheet over a one-year time horizon as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 can be found below.
Economic value of equity (“EVE”), measures the period end market value of assets less the market value of liabilities and the change in this value as rates change. It models simultaneous parallel shifts in market interest rates, implied by the forward yield curve. The EVE model calculates the market value of capital by taking the present value of all asset cash flows less the present value of all liability cash flows.
The interest rate risk to capital at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 is shown below and reflects that our market value of capital is in an asset position in which an increase in short-term interest rates is expected to generate higher market values of capital. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, all EVE stress tests measures were within our board policy established limits.

Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of condition of FVCBankcorp, Inc. and its Subsidiary (the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

FVCBankcorp, Inc. (the “Company”), a Virginia corporation, was formed in 2015 and is registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. The Company is headquartered in Fairfax, Virginia. The Company conducts its business activities through the branch offices of its wholly owned subsidiary bank, FVCbank (the “Bank”). The Company exists primarily for the purposes of holding the stock of its subsidiary, the Bank.
The Bank was organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia to engage in a general banking business serving the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. The Bank commenced regular operations on November 27, 2007 and is a member of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. It is subject to the regulations of the Federal Reserve System and the State Corporation Commission of Virginia. Consequently, it undergoes periodic examinations by these regulatory authorities.
Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The accounting and reporting policies of the Company are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and conform to general practices within the banking industry.
(a) Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
(b) Use of Estimates
In preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management is required to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosures of contingent assets and contingent liabilities, at of the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to accounting for business combinations and impairment testing of goodwill, the allowance for loan losses, the valuation of deferred tax assets, other-than-temporary impairment, and the valuation of other real estate owned.
(c) Accounting for Business Combinations
Business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method. The acquisition method requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded, based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including identifiable intangibles, is recorded as goodwill.
(d) Cash and Cash Equivalents
For purposes of the statements of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, amounts due from banks and federal funds sold. Generally, federal funds are purchased and sold for one day periods.

(e) Investment Securities
Debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at amortized cost when management has the positive intent and ability to hold them to maturity. Debt securities are classified as available-for-sale when they might be sold before maturity. Securities available-for-sale are carried at fair value, with unrealized holding gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income, net of tax. Equity securities are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in net income. Equity securities without readily determinable fair values are carried at cost, minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment.
Gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined using the specific identification method.
The Company regularly evaluates its securities whose values have declined below their amortized cost to assess whether the decline in fair value is other-than-temporary. The Company considers various factors in determining whether a decline in fair value is other-than-temporary including the issuer’s financial condition and/or future prospects, the effects of changes in interest rates or credit spreads, the expected recovery period and other quantitative and qualitative information. The valuation of securities for impairment is a process subject to estimation, judgment and uncertainty and is intended to determine whether declines in the fair value of investments should be recognized in current period earnings. The risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions and future changes in assessments of the aforementioned factors. It is expected that such factors will change in the future, which may result in future other-than-temporary impairments. For impairments of debt securities that are deemed to be other-than-temporary, the credit portion of an other-than-temporary impairment loss is recognized in earnings and the non-credit portion is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income in those situations where the Company does not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the security prior to recovery.
Interest income and dividends on securities are recognized in interest income on an accrual basis. Premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the effective interest method. Prepayments of the mortgages securing mortgage-backed securities may affect the yield to maturity. The Company uses actual principal prepayment experience and estimates of future principal prepayments in calculating the yield necessary to apply the effective interest method.
(f) Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses
Loans receivable that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until loan maturity or pay-off are reported at their outstanding principal balance adjusted for any charge-offs, and net of the allowance for loan losses and deferred fees and costs. Loan origination fees and certain direct origination costs are deferred and amortized as an adjustment of the yield using the payment terms required by the loan contract.
During 2018, as a result of the Company’s acquisition of Colombo, the loan portfolio was segregated between loans initially accounted for under the amortized cost method (referred to as “originated” loans) and loans acquired (referred to as “acquired” loans). The loans segregated to the acquired loan portfolio were initially measured at fair value and subsequently accounted for under either Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 310-30 or ASC Topic 310-20.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share data)
Purchased credit-impaired (“PCI”) loans, which are the non-performing loans acquired in the Company’s acquisition of Colombo, are loans acquired at a discount (that is due, in part, to credit quality). These loans are initially recorded at fair value (as determined by the present value of expected future cash flows) with no allowance for loan losses. The Company accounts for interest income on all loans acquired at a discount (that is due, in part, to credit quality) based on the acquired loans’ expected cash flows. The acquired loans may be aggregated and accounted for as a pool of loans if the loans being aggregated have common risk characteristics. A pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flow. The difference between the cash flows expected at acquisition and the investment in the loans, or the “accretable yield,” is recognized as interest income utilizing the level-yield method over the life of each pool. Increases in expected cash flows subsequent to the acquisition are recognized prospectively through adjustment to any previously recognized allowance for loan loss for that pool of loans and then through an increase in the yield on the pool over its remaining life, while decreases in expected cash flows are recognized as impairment through a loss provision and an increase in the allowance for loan losses. Therefore, the allowance for loan losses on these impaired pools reflect only losses incurred after the acquisition (representing the present value of all cash flows that were expected at acquisition but currently are not expected to be received).
The Company periodically evaluates the remaining contractual required payments due and estimates of cash flows expected to be collected for PCI loans. These evaluations, performed quarterly, require the continued use of key assumptions and estimates, similar to the initial estimate of fair value. Changes in the contractual required payments due and estimated cash flows expected to be collected may result in changes in the accretable yield and non-accretable difference or reclassifications between accretable yield and the non-accretable difference. On an aggregate basis, if the acquired pools of PCI loans perform better than originally expected, the Company would expect to receive more future cash flows than originally modeled at the acquisition date. For the pools with better than expected cash flows, the forecasted increase would be recorded as an additional accretable yield that is recognized as a prospective increase to the Company’s interest income on loans.
Loans are generally placed into nonaccrual status when they are past-due 90 days as to either principal or interest or when, in the opinion of management, the collection of principal and/or interest is in doubt. A loan remains in nonaccrual status until the loan is current as to payment of both principal and interest or past-due less than 90 days and the borrower demonstrates the ability to pay and remain current. Loans are charged-off when a loan or a portion thereof is considered uncollectible. When cash payments are received, they are applied to principal first, then to accrued interest. It is the Company’s policy not to record interest income on nonaccrual loans until principal has become current. In certain instances, accruing loans that are past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest may not go on nonaccrual status if the Company determines that the loans are well secured and are in the process of collection.
Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, loans past-due 90 days or more and other real estate owned.
The allowance for loan losses is increased or decreased by provisions for reversal of loan losses, increased by recoveries of previously charged-off loans, and decreased by loan charge-offs.
The Company maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level that represents management’s best estimate of known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio. Both the amount of the provision expense and the level of the allowance for loan losses are impacted by many factors, including general and industry-specific economic conditions, actual and expected credit losses, historical trends and specific conditions of the individual borrowers. Unusual and infrequently occurring events, such as weather-related disasters or disease epidemics or pandemics, may impact management’s assessment of possible credit losses. As a part of the analysis, the Company uses comparative peer group data and qualitative factors such as levels of and trends in delinquencies, nonaccrual loans, charged-off loans, changes in volume and terms of loans, effects of changes in lending policy, experience and ability and depth of management, national and local economic trends and conditions and concentrations of credit, competition, and loan review results to support estimates.
For purposes of monitoring the performance of the loan portfolio and estimating the allowance for loan losses, the Company’s loans receivable portfolio is segmented as follows: commercial real estate, commercial and industrial, commercial construction, consumer residential, and consumer nonresidential.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share data)
Commercial Real Estate Loans. Commercial real estate loans are secured by both owner occupied and investor owned commercial properties, including multi-family residential real estate. Collateral for this loan type includes various types of commercial real estate, including office, retail, warehouse, industrial and other non-residential types of properties.
These loans typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Additionally, the repayment of loans secured by income-producing properties is typically dependent upon the successful operation of a business or real estate project and thus may be subject to adverse conditions in the commercial real estate market or in the general economy. The Company generally requires personal guarantees or endorsements with respect to these loans and loan-to-value ratios for real estate-commercial loans generally do not exceed 80%.
Commercial and Industrial Loans. The Company makes commercial loans to qualified businesses within its market area. The commercial lending portfolio consists primarily of commercial and industrial loans for a variety of business purposes, including working capital and the financing of accounts receivable, property, plant and equipment. The Company has a government contract lending group which provides secured lending to government contracting firms and businesses based primarily on receivables from the federal government.
Commercial and industrial loans generally have a higher degree of risk than other certain types of loans. Commercial loans typically are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to repay the loan from the cash flow from its business and are secured by business assets, such as commercial real estate, accounts receivable, equipment and inventory, the values of which may fluctuate over time and generally cannot be appraised with as much precision as residential real estate. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial loans may be substantially dependent upon the commercial success of the business itself. To manage these risks, the Company’s policy is to secure commercial loans originated with both the assets of the business, which are subject to the risks described above, and other additional collateral and guarantees that may be available.
Commercial Construction Loans. The Company’s commercial construction loan portfolio consists of acquisition, development, and construction of commercial real estate, including multi-family properties. Our typical commercial construction loan involves property that will ultimately be leased to a non-owner occupant. Construction lending entails significant additional risks as they often involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Construction loans also involve additional risks since funds are advanced while the property is under construction, which property has uncertain value prior to the completion of construction. Thus, it is more difficult to accurately evaluate the total loan funds required to complete a project and related loan-to-value ratios. To reduce the risks associated with construction lending, the Company generally limits loan-to-value ratios to 80% of when-completed appraised values for owner-occupied residential or commercial properties and for investor-owned residential or commercial properties. Construction loan agreements may include provisions which allow for the payment of contractual interest from an interest reserve. Amounts drawn from an interest reserve increase the amount of the outstanding balance of the construction loan. This is an industry standard practice.
Consumer Residential. This portfolio consists primarily of home equity lines of credit (“HELOC”) that we originate in our market areas. Our HELOCs generally have a maximum loan to value of up to 85%, however, actual loan to values are typically lower than the maximum. We have also purchased portfolios of 1-4 family residential first mortgage loans on properties located in our market area for yield and diversification.
Consumer Nonresidential. The Company’s consumer nonresidential loans consist primarily of installment loans made to individuals for personal, family and household purposes. In addition, we have purchased pools of unsecured consumer loans and student loans from a third party for yield and diversification.
Consumer loans may entail greater risk than certain other types of loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciable assets, such as automobiles.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share data)
The Company’s policy for consumer loans is to accept moderate risk while minimizing losses, primarily through a careful credit and financial analysis of the borrower. In evaluating consumer loans, the Company requires its lending officers to review the borrower’s collateral and stability of income, past credit history, amount of debt currently outstanding and the impact of these factors on the ability of the borrower to repay the loan in a timely manner.
The Company’s allowance for loan losses is based first on a segmentation of its loan portfolio by general loan type, or portfolio segments. For originated loans, certain portfolio segments are further disaggregated and evaluated collectively for impairment based on loan segments, which are largely based on the type of collateral underlying each loan. For purposes of this analysis, the Company categorizes loans into one of five categories: commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, commercial construction, consumer residential, and consumer nonresidential loans. Typically, financial institutions use their historical loss experience and trends in losses for each loan category which are then adjusted for portfolio trends and economic and environmental factors in determining their allowance for loan losses. Since the Bank’s inception in 2007, the Bank has experienced minimal loss history within its loan portfolio. Because of this, the allowance model uses the average loss rates of similar institutions (a custom peer group) as a baseline which is then adjusted based on the Company’s particular qualitative loan portfolio characteristics and environmental factors. The indicated loss factors resulting from this analysis are applied for each of the five categories of loans.
The Company also maintains an allowance for loan losses for acquired loans when: (i) for loans accounted for under ASC 310-30, there is deterioration in credit quality subsequent to acquisition, and (ii) for loans accounted for under ASC 310-20, the inherent losses in the loans exceed the remaining discount recorded at the time of acquisition.
The allowance for loan losses consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are determined to be impaired and, therefore, individually evaluated for impairment. The Company determines and recognizes impairment of certain loans when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the loan agreement. A loan is not considered impaired during a period of delay in payment if the Company expects to collect all amounts due, including past-due interest. The Company individually assigns loss factors to all loans that have been identified as having loss attributes, as indicated by deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower or a decline in underlying collateral value if the loan is collateral dependent. The Company evaluates the impairment of certain loans on a loan by loan basis for those loans that are adversely risk rated. Measurement of impairment is based on the expected future cash flows of an impaired loan, which are discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, or measured on an observable market value, if one exists, or the fair value of the collateral underlying the loan, discounted to consider estimated costs to sell the collateral for collateral-dependent loans. If the net collateral value is less than the loan balance (including accrued interest and any unamortized premium or discount associated with the loan) an impairment is recognized and a specific reserve is established for the impaired loan. Loans classified as loss loans are fully reserved or charged-off.
In addition, various regulatory agencies, as part of their examination process, periodically review the Company’s allowance for loan losses. These agencies may require the Company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their risk evaluation and credit judgment. Management believes that the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2020 and 2019 is a reasonable estimate of known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio at those dates.
Loans considered to be troubled debt restructuring (“TDRs”) are loans that have their terms restructured (e.g., interest rates, loan maturity date, payment and amortization period, etc.) in circumstances that provide payment relief to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. All restructured loans are considered impaired loans and may either be in accruing status or nonaccruing status. Nonaccruing restructured loans may return to accruing status provided doubt has been removed concerning the collectability of principal and interest as evidenced by a sufficient period of payment performance in accordance with the restructured terms. Loans may be removed from the restructured category in the year subsequent to the restructuring if their revised loan terms are considered to be consistent with terms that can be obtained in the credit market for loans with comparable risk and if they meet certain performance criteria.

(g) Premises and Equipment
Land is carried at cost. Premises, furniture, equipment, and leasehold improvements are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation of premises, furniture and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives from three to seven years. Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the improvements or the lease term, whichever is shorter. Purchased computer software which is capitalized is amortized over estimated useful lives of one to three years.
On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-02 “Leases (Topic 842)” and all subsequent ASUs that modified Topic 842. The Company elected the prospective application approach provided by ASU 2018-11 and did not adjust prior periods for ASC 842. There was a cumulative effect adjustment of approximately $86 thousand at adoption. The Company also elected certain practical expedients within the standard and did not reassess whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, did not reassess the lease classification for any expired or existing leases and did not reassess any initial direct costs for existing leases. Prior to adoption, all of the Company’s leases were classified as operating leases and remain operating leases at adoption. The implementation of the new standard resulted in recognition of a right-of-use asset of approximately $12.2 million and an offsetting lease liability of $12.7 million for leases existing at the date of adoption.
Contracts that commence subsequent to adoption are evaluated to determine whether they are or contain a lease in accordance with Topic 842. The Company has elected the practical expedient provided by Topic 842 not to allocate consideration in a contract between lease and non-lease components. The Company also elected, as provided by the standard, not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases, defined by the standard as leases with terms of 12 months or less.
Lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments and are presented at each reporting date as the net present value of the remaining contractual cash flows. Cash flows are discounted at the Company’s incremental borrowing rate in effect at the commencement date of the lease. Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use the underlying asset for the lease term and are calculated as the sum of the lease liability and if applicable, prepaid rent, initial direct costs and any incentives received from the lessor.
Lease payments for short-term leases are recognized as lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term, or for variable lease payments, in the period in which the obligation was incurred. Payments for leases with terms longer than twelve months are included in the determination of the lease liability. Payments may be fixed for the term of the lease or variable. If the lease agreement provides a known escalator, such as a specified percentage increase per year or a stated increase at a specified time, the variable payment is included in the cash flows used to determine the lease liability. If the variable payment is based upon an unknown escalator, such as the consumer price index at a future date, the increase is not included in the cash flows used to determine the lease liability. The Company’s leases provide known escalators that are included in the determination of the lease liability, with the exception of three lease agreements.
The Company’s leases offer the option to extend the lease term. For each of the leases, the Company is reasonably certain it will exercise the options and has included the additional time and lease payments in the calculation of the lease liability. None of the Company’s leases provide for residual value guarantees and none provide restrictions or covenants that would impact dividends or require incurring additional financial obligations.
During 2020, the Company closed two branch office locations, which resulted in an impairment loss on right-of -use assets of $508 thousand and derecognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities of $458 thousand.
(h) Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill, which represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired, is not amortized but is evaluated at least annually for impairment by comparing its fair value with its carrying amount. Impairment is indicated when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share data)
Goodwill arises from business combinations and is generally determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances exist; that indicate that a goodwill impairment test should be performed. The Company performs the impairment test annually during the fourth quarter. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values. Goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite life on our balance sheet.
No impairment was recorded for 2020 and 2019.
(i) Other Real Estate Owned
Assets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are held for sale. At the time of acquisition, these properties are recorded at fair value less estimated selling costs, with any write down charged to the allowance for loan losses and any gain on foreclosure recorded in net income, establishing a new cost basis. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations of the assets are periodically performed by management, and these assets are subsequently accounted for at lower of cost or fair value less estimated selling costs. Adjustments are made for subsequent decline in the fair value of the assets less selling costs. Revenue and expenses from operations and valuation changes are charged to operating income in the year of the transaction. The Company did not foreclose on any properties during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The Company, through its acquisition of Colombo, did acquire one residential real estate property, which was sold for its recorded value in 2019.
(j) Bank Owned Life Insurance
The Company has purchased life insurance policies on certain key employees. Bank owned life insurance is recorded at the amount that can be realized under the insurance contract at the balance date, which is the cash surrender value. The increase in the cash surrender value over time is recorded as other non-interest income. The Company monitors the financial strength and condition of the counterparty.
(k) Transfers of Financial Assets
Transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales, when control over the assets has been surrendered. Control over transferred assets is deemed surrendered when (1) the assets have been isolated from the Company - put presumptively beyond reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership, (2) the transferee obtains the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets, and (3) the Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity or the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets.
(l) Income Taxes
Deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for deductible temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share data)
Deferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the tax position will be realized or sustained upon examination. The term more likely than not means a likelihood of more than 50 percent; the terms examined and upon examination also include resolution of the related appeals or litigation processes, if any. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The determination of whether or not a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold considers the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date and is subject to management’s judgment. The Company had no such liability recorded as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of evidence available, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
(m) Comprehensive Income (Loss)
Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income (loss) includes unrealized gains (losses) on securities available-for-sale and interest rate swaps for 2020 and 2019, which are also recognized as separate components of equity. Items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to net income relate solely to realized gains (losses) on sales of securities available-for-sale and appear under the caption “Gain on sale of securities available-for-sale” in the Company’s consolidated statements of income.
(n) Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Fair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions, as more fully disclosed in Note 17. Fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment. Changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect the estimates.
(o) Equity-based Compensation
The Company recognizes in the income statement the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation. The Company classifies stock awards as either an equity award or a liability award. Equity classified awards are valued as of the grant date using either an observable market price or a valuation methodology. Liability classified awards are valued at fair value at each reporting date. For the periods presented, all of the Company’s stock options are classified as equity awards.
The fair value related to forfeitures of stock options and other equity-based compensation are recorded to the income statement as they occur, reducing equity-based compensation expense in that period. During 2017, the Company began granting restricted stock units which are granted at the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the grant date. Most restricted stock units vest in one-quarter increments on the anniversary date of the grant. The Company did not grant stock options in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
(p) 401(k) Plan
Employee 401(k) plan expense is the amount of matching contributions paid by the Company. 401(k) plan expense was $350 thousand and $367 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share data)
(q) Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share represent income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect additional common shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential common shares had been issued, as well as any adjustment to income that would result from the assumed issuance. Common stock equivalents that may be issued by the Company consist primarily of outstanding stock options and restricted stock units, and the dilutive potential common shares resulting from outstanding stock options and restricted stock units are determined using the treasury method. The effects of anti-dilutive common stock equivalents are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share.
(r) Reclassifications
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s method of presentation. None of these reclassifications were significant.
(s) Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” The amendments in this ASU, among other things, require the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Financial institutions and other organizations will now use forward-looking information to better inform their credit loss estimates. Many of the loss estimation techniques applied today will still be permitted, although the inputs to those techniques will change to reflect the full amount of expected credit losses. In addition, the ASU amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. The FASB has issued multiple updates to ASU 2016-13 as codified in Topic 326, including ASUs 2019-04, 2019-05, 2019-10, 2019-11, 2020-02, and 2020-03. These ASUs have provided for various minor technical corrections and improvements to the codification as well as other transition matters. Smaller reporting companies who file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), such as the Company, and all other entities who do not file with the SEC are required to apply the guidance for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company has identified a third party vendor to assist in the measurement of expected credit losses under this standard. The implementation committee has completed the data collection process, validated the data inputs, and is in the initial phases of evaluating various allowance methodologies for certain loan segments within the Company’s loan portfolio. The Company is currently evaluating the implementation of ASU 2016-13 due to the change in implementation dates for smaller reporting companies.
Effective November 25, 2019, the SEC adopted Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 119. SAB 119 updated portions of SEC interpretative guidance to align with FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 326, "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses." It covers topics including (1) measuring current expected credit losses; (2) development, governance, and documentation of a systematic methodology; (3) documenting the results of a systematic methodology; and (4) validating a systematic methodology.
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes.” The ASU is expected to reduce cost and complexity related to the accounting for income taxes by removing specific exceptions to general principles in Topic 740 (eliminating the need for an organization to analyze whether certain exceptions apply in a given period) and improving financial statement preparers’ application of certain income tax-related guidance. This ASU is part of the FASB’s simplification initiative to make narrow-scope simplifications and improvements to accounting standards through a series of short-term projects. For public business entities, such as the Company, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact that ASU 2019-12 will have on its consolidated financial statements.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share data)
In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01, “Investments - Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Clarifying the Interactions between Topic 321, Topic 323, and Topic 815.” The ASU is based on a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force and is expected to increase comparability in accounting for these transactions. ASU 2016-01 made targeted improvements to accounting for financial instruments, including providing an entity the ability to measure certain equity securities without a readily determinable fair value at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Among other topics, the amendments clarify that an entity should consider observable transactions that require it to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting. For public business entities, such as the Company, the amendments in the ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2020-01 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04 "Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting." These amendments provide temporary optional guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. The ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contract modifications and hedging relationships, subject to meeting certain criteria, that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. It is intended to help stakeholders during the global market-wide reference rate transition period. The guidance is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. Subsequently, in January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01 "Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope." This ASU clarifies that certain optional expedients and exceptions in Topic 848 for contract modifications and hedge accounting apply to derivatives that are affected by the discounting transition. The ASU also amends the expedients and exceptions in Topic 848 to capture the incremental consequences of the scope clarification and to tailor the existing guidance to derivative instruments affected by the discounting transition. An entity may elect to apply ASU 2021-01 on contract modifications that change the interest rate used for margining, discounting, or contract price alignment retrospectively as of any date from the beginning of the interim period that includes March 12, 2020, or prospectively to new modifications from any date within the interim period that includes or is subsequent to January 7, 2021, up to the date that financial statements are available to be issued. An entity may elect to apply ASU 2021-01 to eligible hedging relationships existing as of the beginning of the interim period that includes March 12, 2020, and to new eligible hedging relationships entered into after the beginning of the interim period that includes March 12, 2020. To facilitate an orderly transition from interbank offered rates (“IBORs”) and other benchmark rates to alternative reference rates (“ARRs”), the Company has established an enterprise-wide initiative led by senior management. The objective of this initiative is to identify, assess and monitor risks associated with the expected discontinuation or unavailability of benchmarks, including LIBOR, achieve operational readiness and engage impacted clients in connection with the transition to ARRs. The Company is assessing ASU 2020-04 and its impact on the Company's transition away from LIBOR for its loan and other financial instruments.
On March 12, 2020, the SEC finalized amendments to the definitions of its "accelerated filer" and "large accelerated filer" definitions. The amendments increase the threshold criteria for meeting these filer classifications and are effective on April 27, 2020. Any changes in filer status are to be applied beginning with the filer's first annual report filed with the SEC subsequent to the effective date. Prior to these changes, the Company was required to comply with section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act concerning auditor attestation over internal control over financial reporting as an "accelerated filer" as it had more than $75 million in public float but less than $700 million at the end of the Company's most recent second quarter. The rule change expands the definition of "smaller reporting companies" to include entities with public float of less than $700 million and less than $100 million in annual revenues. The Company meets this expanded category of small reporting company and is no longer considered an accelerated filer. If the Company's annual revenues exceed $100 million, its category will change back to "accelerated filer". The classifications of "accelerated filer" and "large accelerated filer" require a public company to obtain an auditor attestation concerning the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting (“ICFR”) and include the opinion on ICFR in its annual report on Form 10-K. Smaller reporting companies also have additional time to file quarterly and annual financial statements. All are required to obtain and file annual financial statement audits, as well as provide management's assertion on effectiveness of ICFR, but the external auditor attestation of ICFR is not required for smaller reporting companies. As the Company has total assets exceeding $1.0 billion, it remains subject to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Act, which requires an auditor attestation concerning ICFR. As such, other than the additional time provided to file quarterly and annual financial statements, this change does not significantly change the Company's annual reporting and audit requirements.

In March 2020 (Revised in April 2020), various regulatory agencies, including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve”) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the agencies), issued an interagency statement on loan modifications and reporting for financial institutions working with customers affected by COVID-19. The interagency statement was effective immediately and impacted accounting for loan modifications. Under ASC 310-40, "Receivables - Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors," a restructuring of debt constitutes a TDR if the creditor, for economic or legal reasons related to the debtor's financial difficulties, grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider. The agencies confirmed with the staff of the FASB that short-term modifications made on a good faith basis in response to COVID-19 to borrowers who were current prior to any relief, are not to be considered TDRs. This includes short-term (e.g., six months) modifications such as payment deferrals, fee waivers, extensions of repayment terms, or other delays in payment that are insignificant. Borrowers considered current are those that are less than 30 days past due on their contractual payments at the time a modification program is implemented. Depending on the demonstrated need of the client, the Company is deferring either the full loan payment or the principal component of the loan payment generally for 90 days. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has executed 277 of these deferrals on outstanding loan balances of $360.2 million. There were six loans that remained under deferral on outstanding loan balances of $12.5 million at December 31, 2020.
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06 "Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity." The ASU simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current GAAP. Consequently, more convertible debt instruments will be reported as a single liability instrument and more convertible preferred stock as a single equity instrument with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features. The ASU removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, which will permit more equity contracts to qualify for it. The ASU also simplifies the diluted earnings per share calculation in certain areas. In addition, the amendment updates the disclosure requirements for convertible instruments to increase the information transparency. For public business entities, excluding smaller reporting companies, the amendments in the ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, in cluding the Company, the standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2020-06 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In October 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-08, "Codification Improvements to Subtopic 310-20, Receivables - Nonrefundable fees and Other Costs." This ASU clarifies that an entity should reevaluate whether a callable debt security is within the scope of ASC paragraph 310-20-35-33 for each reporting period. For public business entities, the ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is not permitted. All entities should apply ASU No. 2020-08 on a prospective basis as of the beginning of the period of adoption for existing or newly purchased callable debt securities. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2020-08 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
Note 3. Business Combinations
On October 12, 2018, the Company acquired Colombo, a commercial bank with approximately $199 million in assets, after purchase accounting adjustments. Based on an average closing price of the Company’s common stock during the five trading day period ended on October 10, 2018 of $19.614 (the “Average Closing Price”), the shareholders of Colombo common stock received 0.002217 shares of the Company’s common stock and $0.053157 in cash for each share of Colombo common stock held, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares at a rate equal to the Average Closing Price, and subject to the right of holders of Colombo common stock who own fewer than 45,086 shares of Colombo common stock after aggregation of all shares held in the same name, and who made a timely election, to receive only cash in an amount equal to $0.096649 per share of Colombo common stock. As a result of the merger, 763,051 shares of the Company’s common stock and $18.3 million in cash were issued in exchange for outstanding shares of Colombo common stock. Total consideration for the acquisition was $32.9 million.
Merger and acquisition expense for 2018 was $3.3 million which was mainly related to legal and accounting cost, system conversion and integration expenses, employee retention and severance payments. In 2019, $133 thousand of primarily legal and contract termination expenses associated with the Colombo acquisition was recorded.

The following table sets forth the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition at their estimated fair values as of the closing date of the transactions:
The fair value estimates were subject to change for up to one year after the closing date of the transaction if additional information relative to closing dates fair values becomes available.
Subsequent to the purchase, management made a measurement period adjustment of $663 thousand for a purchase credit impaired loan inadvertently included in the purchase performing loan category and for deferred tax assets based on the additional credit mark and final tax return of Colombo.
Fair Value Measurement of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed
Below are the methods used to determine the fair values of the significant assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition.
Cash and cash equivalents. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents was used as a reasonable estimate of fair value.
Interest-bearing deposits. The carrying amount of interest-bearing deposits was used as a reasonable estimate of fair value.
Investment securities available-for-sale. The estimated fair value of investment securities available-for-sale was based on proceeds received from sale of securities immediately after consummation of acquisition.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share data)
Restricted stocks. The carrying amount of restricted stocks was used as a reasonable estimate of fair value. These investments are carried at cost as no active trading market exists.
Loans. The acquired loan portfolio was segregated into one of two categories for valuation purposes: PCI and performing loans. PCI loans were identified as those loans that were nonaccrual prior to the business combination and those loans that had been identified as potentially impaired. Potentially impaired loans were those loans that were identified during the credit review process where there was an indication that the borrower did not have sufficient cash flows to service the loan in accordance with its terms. Performing loans were those loans that were currently performing in accordance with the loan contract and do not appear to have any significant credit issues.
For loans that were identified as performing, the fair values were determined using a discounted cash flow analysis (the “income approach”). Performing loans were segmented into pools based on loan type (commercial real estate, commercial and industrial, commercial construction, consumer residential and consumer nonresidential), and further segmented based on payment structure (fully amortizing, non-fully amortizing balloon, or interest only), rate type (fixed versus variable), and remaining maturity. The estimated cash flows expected to be collected for each loan was determined using a valuation model that included the following key assumptions: prepayment speeds, expected credit loss rates and discount rates. Prepayment speeds were influenced by many factors including, but not limited to, current yields, historic rate trends, payment types, interest rate type, and the duration of the individual loan. Expected credit loss rates were based on recent and historical default and loss rates observed for loans with similar characteristics, and further influenced by a credit review by management and a third party consultant on a selection of loans within the acquired portfolio. The discount rates used were based on rates market participants might charge for cash flows with similar risk characteristics at the acquisition date. These assumptions were developed based on management discussions and third party professional experience.
For loans that were identified as PCI, either the above income approach was used or the asset approach was used. The income approach was used for PCI loans where there was an expectation that the borrower would more likely than not continue to pay based on the current terms of the loan contract. Management used the asset approach for all nonaccrual loans to reflect market participant assumptions. Under the asset approach, the fair value of each loan was determined based on the estimated values of the underlying collateral.
The methods used to estimate the Level 3 fair values of loans are extremely sensitive to the assumptions and estimates used. While management attempted to use assumptions and estimates that best reflected the acquired loan portfolios and current market conditions, a greater degree of subjectivity is inherent in these values than in those determined in active markets.
The difference between the fair value and the expected cash flows from acquired loans will be accreted to interest income over the remaining term of the loans in accordance with ASC Topic 310-30, “Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality.” See Note 5 for further details.
Premises and equipment. The land and building acquired were recorded at fair value as determined by the current tax assessment at acquisition date.
Other real estate owned ("OREO"). OREO was recorded at fair value based on an existing purchase contract.
Core deposit intangible. Core deposit intangibles (“CDI”) are measures of the value of noninterest checking, savings, interest-bearing checking, and money market deposits that are acquired in a business combination excluding certificates of deposit with balances over $250,000 and high yielding interest bearing deposit accounts, which the Company determines customer related intangible assets as non-existent. The fair value of the CDI stemming from any business combination is based on the present value of the expected cost savings attributable to the core deposit funding, relative to an alternative funding source. The CDI is being amortized over an estimated useful life of 9.8 years to approximate the existing deposit relationships acquired.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share data)
Deposits. The fair values of deposit liabilities with no stated maturity (non-interest checking, savings, interest-bearing checking, and money market deposits) are equal to the carrying amounts payable on demand. The fair values of the certificates of deposit represent contractual cash flows, discounted to present value using interest rates currently offered by market participants on deposits with similar characteristics and remaining maturities.
Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances. The fair value of FHLB advances was determined based on the repayment amount as all acquired advances were repaid immediately following the acquisition.
Note 4. Investment Securities and Other Investments
Amortized cost and fair values of securities held-to-maturity and securities available-for-sale as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, are as follows:
The Company had securities with a market value of $9.2 million and $11.3 million pledged with the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond (the “Federal Reserve Bank”) for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
There were no securities pledged with the Treasury Board of Virginia at the Community Bankers’ Bank at December 31, 2020 and 2019.

The following table shows fair value and gross unrealized losses, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The reference point for determining when securities are in an unrealized loss position is month-end. Therefore, it is possible that a security’s market value exceeded its amortized cost on other days during the prior twelve-month period. Securities that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position are as follows:
Corporate bonds: The unrealized losses on the investments in corporate bonds were caused by interest rate increases. The contractual terms of those investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the amortized cost basis of the investments. One of these investments carries an S&P investment grade rating of BBB+, while one has a rating of BB. The remaining ten investments do not carry a rating.
Mortgage-backed securities: The unrealized losses on the Company's investment in four mortgage-backed securities were caused by interest rate increases. The contractual cash flows of those investments are guaranteed by an agency of the U.S. Government. Accordingly, it is expected that the securities would not be settled at a price less than the amortized cost basis of the Company’s investments. Because the decline in market value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality, the Company does not consider those investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2020.
Collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs): The unrealized loss associated with two CMOs was caused by interest rate increases. The contractual cash flows of these investments are guaranteed by an agency of the U.S. Government. Accordingly, it is expected that the securities would not be settled at a price less than the amortized cost basis of the Company’s investments. Because the decline in market value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality, the Company does not consider those investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2020.

The amortized cost and fair value of securities available-for-sale as of December 31, 2020, by contractual maturity, are shown below. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations without penalties.
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, proceeds from maturities, calls, and principal repayments of securities were $38.5 million and $24.1 million, respectively. During 2020 and 2019, proceeds from sales of securities amounted to $13.2 million and $0 , respectively, and gross realized gains amounted to $141 thousand and $3 thousand, respectively. There were no realized losses in 2020 and 2019.
The Company has other investments in the form of restricted stock totaling $6.6 million and $6.0 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The following table discloses the types of investments included in other investments:
As members of the Federal Reserve Bank and the FHLB, the Company’s banking subsidiary is required to hold stock in these entities. Stock membership in Community Bankers’ Bank allows the Company to secure overnight funding. These investments are carried at cost since no active trading markets exist.
Note 5. Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses
A summary of loan balances by type follows:
During 2018, as a result of the Company’s acquisition of Colombo, the loan portfolio was segregated between loans initially accounted for under the amortized cost method (referred to as “originated” loans) and loans acquired (referred to as “acquired” loans).

The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as current financial information, historical payment experience, collateral adequacy, credit documentation, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This analysis typically includes larger, non-homogeneous loans such as commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans. This analysis is performed on an ongoing basis as new information is obtained. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings:
Pass - Loans listed as pass include larger non-homogeneous loans not meeting the risk rating definitions below and smaller, homogeneous loans not assessed on an individual basis.
Special Mention - Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management’s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution’s credit position at some future date.
Substandard - Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the enhanced possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.
Doubtful - Loans classified as doubtful include those loans which have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified Substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, based on currently known facts, conditions and values, improbable.
Loss - Loans classified as loss include those loans which are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as loans is not warranted. Even though partial recovery may be achieved in the future, it is neither practical nor desirable to defer writing off these loans.
Based on the most recent analysis performed, the risk category of loans by class of loans was as follows as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:
2020 - Originated Loan Portfolio
2020 - Acquired Loan Portfolio

The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as current financial information, historical payment experience, collateral adequacy, credit documentation, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This analysis includes, larger non-homogeneous loans such as commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans. This analysis is performed on an ongoing basis as new information is obtained. At December 31, 2020, the Company had $12.1 million in loans identified as special mention within the originated loan portfolio, a decrease of $4.9 million from December 31, 2019. Special mention rated loans are loans that have a potential weakness that deserve management’s close attention. These loans do not have a specific reserve and are considered well-secured. At December 31, 2020, the Company had $17.1 million in loans identified as substandard within the originated loan portfolio, an increase of $7.3 million from December 31, 2019. Substandard rated loans are loans that are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. For each of these substandard loans, a liquidation analysis is completed. As of December 31, 2020, specific reserves on originated and acquired loans totaling $2.1 million, has been allocated within the allowance for loan losses to supplement any shortfall of collateral.
Past due and nonaccrual loans presented by loan class were as follows as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:

As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company has a recorded investment in TDRs of $97 thousand and $3.9 million, respectively.
The concessions made in TDRs were extensions of the maturity dates or reductions in the stated interest rate for the remaining life of the debt. The payment deferrals that were made on a good faith basis in response to COVID-19 to borrowers who were current prior to any relief, are not to be considered TDRs.
Note 6. Other Real Estate Owned
OREO activity was $3.9 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019. There was no activity in 2020 and 2019.There were no foreclosed residential real estate properties recorded in OREO as a result of obtaining physical possession of the property at December 31, 2020 and 2019. There were no consumer mortgage loans secured by residential real estate properties for which formal foreclosure proceedings are in process as of December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2019, there was $177 thousand of consumer mortgage loans secured by residential real estate properties for which formal foreclosure proceedings are in process. The Company recorded no impairment charges during 2020 and 2019.
Note 7. Goodwill and Intangibles
As a result of the Company’s acquisition of Colombo in October 2018, the Company recognized goodwill and core deposit intangibles. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company engaged a third party specialist to perform an independent goodwill and other intangible assets valuation. During 2020, bank stocks in general as well as the Company's market capitalization declined as a result of the events surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the qualitative analysis completed, the Company does not believe this decline is indicative of permanent deterioration of the value of the Bank, and as such, no impairment was recorded as of December 31, 2020.

The Company has unsecured lines of credit with correspondent banks totaling $269.0 million at December 31, 2020 and $199.0 million at December 31, 2019, available for overnight borrowing. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, $0.0 and $10.0 million, respectively, of these lines of credit with correspondent banks were drawn upon.
On June 20, 2016, the Company issued $25.0 million in fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due June 30, 2026 in a private placement transaction. Interest is payable at 6.00% per annum, from and including June 20, 2016 to, but excluding June 30, 2021, payable semi-annually in arrears. From and including June 30, 2021 to the maturity date or early redemption date, the interest rate shall reset quarterly to an interest rate per annum equal to the then current three-month LIBOR rate plus 487 basis points, payable quarterly in arrears.
The Company may, at its option, beginning with the interest payment date of June 30, 2021 and on any scheduled interest payment date thereafter redeem the subordinated notes, in whole or in part, upon not fewer than 30 nor greater than 60 days’ notice to holders, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the subordinated notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption. Any partial redemption will be made pro rata among all of the holders.
On October 13, 2020, the Company completed its private placement of $20 million of its 4.875% Fixed to Floating Subordinated Notes due 2030 (the "Notes") to certain qualified institutional buyers and accredited investors. The Notes have a maturity date of October 15, 2030 and carry a fixed rate of interest of 4.875% for the first five years. Thereafter, the Notes will pay interest at 3-month SOFR plus 471 basis points, resetting quarterly. The Notes include a right of prepayment without penalty on or after October 15, 2025. The Notes have been structured to qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes. The Company plans to use the proceeds from the placement of the Notes for general corporate purposes, to include supporting capital ratios at the Company's subsidiary, FVCbank, and potential repayment of a portion of the $25.0 million outstanding subordinated debt callable June 30, 2021.
The subordinated notes qualify as Tier 2 capital for the Company to the fullest extent permitted under the Basel III capital rules. When contributed to the capital of the Bank, the proceeds of the subordinated notes may be included in Tier 1 capital for the Bank. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, $41 million and $21 million, respectively, of the proceeds of the Company’s subordinated notes have been included in the Bank’s Tier 1 capital.

Under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, the Company has $13.3 million of net operating loss carryforwards acquired from Colombo which can be offset against future taxable income. The carryforwards expire through December 31, 2037. The full realization of tax benefits associated with carryforwards depends predominately upon the recognition of ordinary income during the carryforward period. Beginning in 2019, the federal portion of net operating loss carryforwards available to offset taxable income is limited to $762 thousand annually under Internal Revenue Code section 382. The Company believes it will generate sufficient future taxable income to fully utilize the remaining deferred tax assets.
Note 12. Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company enters into interest rate swap agreements (“swap agreements”) to facilitate the risk management strategies needed in order to accommodate the needs of its banking customers. The Company mitigates the risk of entering into these loan agreements by entering into equal and offsetting swap agreements with highly-rated third party financial institutions. These back-to-back swap agreements are free-standing derivatives and are recorded at fair value in the Company’s consolidated statements of condition (asset positions are included in other assets and liability positions are included in other liabilities) as of December 31, 2020. The Company is party to master netting arrangements with its financial institution counterparty; however, the Company does not offset assets and liabilities under these arrangements for financial statement presentation purposes. The master netting arrangements provide for a single net settlement of all swap agreements, as well as collateral, in the event of default on, or termination of, any one contract. Parties to a centrally cleared over-the-counter derivative exchange daily payments that reflect the daily change in value of the derivative. These payments, commonly referred to as variation margin, are recorded as settlements of the derivatives’ mark-to-market exposure rather than collateral against the exposures, which effectively results in any centrally cleared derivative having a Level 2 fair value that approximates zero on a daily basis, and therefore, these swap agreements were not included in the offsetting table in the Fair Value Measurement section. As of December 31, 2020, the Company entered into 21 interest rate swap agreements which are collateralized by $14.0 million in cash. As of December 31, 2019, the Company entered into 17 interest rate swap agreements which are collateralized by $6.1 million in cash.
The notional amount and fair value of the Company’s derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:
Interest Rate Risk Management-Cash Flow Hedging Instruments
The Company uses FHLB advances and other wholesale funding from time to time as a source of funds for use in the Company's lending and investment activities and other general business purposes. This wholesale funding exposes the Company to increased interest rate risk as a result of the variability in cash flows (future interest payments). The Company believes it is prudent to reduce this interest rate risk. To meet this objective, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement whereby the Company reduces the interest rate risk associated with the Company’s variable rate advances (or other wholesale funding) from the designation date and going through the maturity date.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share data)
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the information pertaining to outstanding interest rate swap agreements used to hedge variability in cash flows (FHLB advance which is included in other borrowed funds on the consolidated balance sheet) is as follows:
These agreements provided for the Company to receive payments determined by a specific index (three month LIBOR) in exchange for making payments at a fixed rate. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the unrealized loss relating to interest rate swaps designated as hedging instruments of the variability of cash flows associated with FHLB advances are reported in other comprehensive income. These amounts are subsequently reclassified into interest expense as a yield adjustment in the same period in which the related interest on the advance affects earnings. The Company measures cash flow hedging relationships for effectiveness on a monthly basis, and at December 31, 2020 and 2019, the hedges were highly effective and the amount of ineffectiveness reflected in earnings was de minimus.
Note 13. Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk
The Company is party to credit-related financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Such commitments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet.
The Company’s exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of these commitments. The Company follows the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the following financial instruments were outstanding which contract amounts represent credit risk:
Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The commitments for equity lines of credit may expire without being drawn upon. Therefore, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The amount of collateral obtained, if it is deemed necessary by the Company, is based on management’s credit evaluation of the customer.
Unfunded commitments under commercial lines of credit, revolving credit lines and overdraft protection agreements are commitments for possible future extensions of credit to existing customers. These lines of credit usually do not contain a specified maturity date and may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which the Company is committed. The amount of collateral obtained, if it is deemed necessary by the Company, is based on management’s credit evaluation of the customer.
Commercial and standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those letters of credit are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements. Substantially all letters of credit issued have expiration dates within one year. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Company generally holds collateral supporting those commitments, if deemed necessary.

The Company maintains its cash accounts with the Federal Reserve Bank and correspondent banks. The total amount of cash on deposit in correspondent banks exceeding the federally insured limits was $25.3 million and $10.6 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Note 14. Minimum Regulatory Capital Requirements
In August, 2018, the Federal Reserve updated the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement (the “Statement”), in compliance with the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (“EGRRCPA”). The Statement, among other things, exempts bank holding companies that have assets below a specified asset threshold from the consolidated regulatory capital requirements. The interim final rule expands the exemption to bank holding companies with consolidated total assets of less than $3 billion. Prior to August 2018, the statement exempted bank holding companies with consolidated total assets of less than $1 billion. As a result of the interim final rule, the Company qualifies as a small bank holding company and is no longer subject to regulatory capital requirements on a consolidated basis.
Banks and bank holding companies are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Bank’s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, financial institutions must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. A financial institution’s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors.
The final rules implementing Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s capital guidelines for U.S. banks (the “Basel III Rules”) became effective for the Bank on January 1, 2015 with full compliance with all of the requirements being fully phased in January 1, 2019. As a part of the new requirements, the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio is calculated and utilized in the assessment of capital for all institutions. The Company has made an election to not have the net unrealized gain or loss on available-for-sale securities included in computing regulatory capital. Under the Basel III Rules, the Bank must hold a capital conservation buffer above the adequately capitalized risk-based capital ratios. Management believes as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Bank meets all capital adequacy requirement to which they are subject.
Prompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition. If adequately capitalized, regulatory approval is required to accept brokered deposits. If undercapitalized, capital distributions are limited, as is asset growth and expansion, and capital restoration plans are required. At year-end 2020 and 2019, the most recent regulatory notification categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the institution’s category.
Pursuant to the EGRRCPA, regulators have provided for an optional, simplified measure of capital adequacy, the community bank leverage ratio framework (“CBLR”), for qualifying community bank organizations. Banks that qualify could opt in to the CBLR framework beginning January 1, 2020 or any time thereafter. The CBLR framework eliminates the four required capital ratios disclosed below and requires the disclosure of a single leverage ratio, with a minimum requirement of 9%. On January 1, 2020, the Company opted in to the CBLR framework.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share data)
The CARES Act, passed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, directed federal banking agencies to adopt interim final rules to lower the threshold under the CBLR from 9% to 8% and to provide a reasonable grace period for a community bank that falls below the threshold to regain compliance, in each case until the earlier of the termination date of the national emergency or December 31, 2020. In April 2020, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued two interim final rules implementing this directive. One interim final rule provides that, as of the second quarter 2020, banking organizations with leverage ratios of 8% or greater (and that meet the other existing qualifying criteria) may elect to use the CBLR framework. It also establishes a two-quarter grace period for qualifying community banking organizations whose leverage ratios fall below the 8% CBLR requirement, so long as the banking organization maintains a leverage ratio of 7% or greater. The second interim final rule provides a transition from the temporary 8% CBLR requirement to a 9% CBLR requirement. It establishes a minimum CBLR of 8% for the second through fourth quarters of 2020, 8.5% for 2021, and 9% thereafter, and maintains a two-quarter grace period for qualifying community banking organizations whose leverage ratios fall no more than 100 basis points below the applicable CBLR requirement.
The Bank continues to be subject to various capital requirements administered by banking agencies. The capital ratios for the Bank as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 are shown in the following table.
(1) Except with regard to the Bank’s Tier 1 to average assets ratio, the minimum capital requirement includes the Basel III Capital Rules capital conservaion buffer.
Dividend Restrictions - The Company’s principal source of funds for dividend payments is dividends received from the Bank. Banking regulations limit the amounts of dividends that may be paid without approval of regulatory agencies. As of December 31, 2020, $55.2 million of retained earnings is available to pay dividends.
Note 15. Related Party Transactions
Officers, directors and their affiliates had borrowings of $14.3 million and $14.5 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019 with the Company. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, total principal additions were $476 thousand and $292 thousand , and total principal payments were $608 thousand and $611 thousand, respectively.
Related party deposits amounted to $43.7 million and $46.2 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Note 16. Stock-Based Compensation Plan
The Company’s Amended and Restated 2008 Option Plan (the “Plan”), which is shareholder-approved, was adopted to advance the interests of the Company by providing selected key employees of the Company, their affiliates, and directors with the opportunity to acquire shares of common stock. In June 2018, the shareholders approved an amendment to the Amended and Restated 2008 Plan to extend the term of the plan until 2028 and increase the number of shares authorized for issuance under the Plan by 200,000 shares.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share data)
The maximum number of shares with respect to which awards may be made is 2,529,296 shares of common stock, subject to adjustment for certain corporate events. Option awards are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of the Company’s stock at the date of grant, generally vest annually over four years of continuous service and have ten year contractual terms. At December 31, 2020, 148,602 shares were available to grant under the Plan.
No options were granted during 2020 and 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, 2,737 shares were withheld from issuance upon exercise of options in order to cover the cost of the exercise by the participant. For the year ended December 31, 2019, 17,491 shares were withheld from issuance upon exercise of options in order to cover the cost of the exercise by the participant.
A summary of option activity under the Plan as of December 31, 2020, and changes during the year then ended is presented below:
(1) The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the amount by which the current market value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the option) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on December 31, 2020. This amount changes based on changes in the market value of the Company’s stock.
The compensation cost that has been charged to income for the plan was $690 thousand and $679 thousand for 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, all outstanding shares of the Plan are fully vested and amortized. Tax benefits recognized for qualified and non-qualified stock options during 2020 and 2019 totaled $89 thousand and $179 thousand, respectively.
A summary of the Company’s restricted stock grant activity as of December 31, 2020 is shown below.
As of December 31, 2020, there was $1.2 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested restricted shares granted under the Plan. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 26 months.

Note 17. Fair Value Measurements
Determination of Fair Value
The Company uses fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures. In accordance with Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures topic of FASB ASC, the fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is best determined based upon quoted market prices. However, in many instances, there are no quoted market prices for the Company’s various financial instruments. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. Accordingly, the fair value estimates may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the instrument.
The fair value guidance provides a consistent definition of fair value, which focuses on exit price in an orderly transaction (that is, not a forced liquidation or distressed sale) between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. If there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability, a change in valuation technique or the use of multiple valuation techniques may be appropriate. In such instances, determining the price at which willing market participants would transact at the measurement date under current market conditions depends on the facts and circumstances and requires the use of significant judgment. The fair value is a reasonable point within the range that is most representative of fair value under current market conditions.
Fair Value Hierarchy
In accordance with this guidance, the Company groups its financial assets and financial liabilities generally measured at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value.
Level 1 - Valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
Level 2 - Valuation is based on observable inputs including quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in less active markets, and model -based valuation techniques for which significant assumptions can be derived primarily from or corroborated by observable data in the market.
Level 3 - Valuation is based on model-based techniques that use one or more significant inputs or assumptions that are unobservable in the market.
The following describes the valuation techniques used by the Company to measure certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis in the financial statements:
Securities available-for-sale: Securities available-for-sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value measurement is based upon quoted market prices, when available (Level 1). If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are measured utilizing independent valuation techniques of identical or similar securities for which significant assumptions are derived primarily from or corroborated by observable market data. Third party vendors compile prices from various sources and may determine the fair value of identical or similar securities by using pricing models that consider observable market data (Level 2).

The following table presents the balances of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Certain financial assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with GAAP. Adjustments to the fair value of these assets usually result from the application of lower of cost or market accounting or write-downs of individual assets.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share data)
The following describes the valuation techniques used by the Company to measure certain financial assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in the financial statements:
Impaired Loans: Loans are designated as impaired when, in the judgment of management based on current information and events, it is probable that all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected. The measurement of loss associated with impaired loans can be based on either the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the collateral. Fair value is measured based on the value of the collateral securing the loans. Collateral may be in the form of real estate or business assets including equipment, inventory, and accounts receivable. The vast majority of the collateral is real estate. The value of real estate collateral is determined utilizing a market valuation approach based on an appraisal conducted by an independent, licensed appraiser outside of the Company using observable market data (Level 2). However, if the collateral is a house or building in the process of construction, has the value derived by discounting comparable sales due to lack of similar properties, or is discounted by the Company due to marketability, then the fair value is considered Level 3. The value of business equipment is based upon an outside appraisal if deemed significant, or the net book value on the applicable business’s financial statements if not considered significant using observable market data. Likewise, values for inventory and accounts receivables collateral are based on financial statement balances or aging reports (Level 3). Impaired loans allocated to the Allowance for Loan Losses are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Any fair value adjustments are recorded in the period incurred as provision for loan losses on the Statements of Income.
Loans Held for Sale: During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company reclassified a portion of its consumer unsecured loan portfolio as held for sale and recorded a loss on the market value adjustment totaling $145 thousand. During the second quarter of 2020, the Company reclassified its consumer unsecured loans held for sale portfolio to held for investment at the lower of cost or market as the market for these types of loans receded due to current economic conditions. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a loss on the market value adjustment totaling $451 thousand. The portfolio totaled $6.5 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $11.2 million at December 31, 2019. The measurement of loss associated with the loans held for sale can be based on the observable market price of the loan portfolio. Any fair value adjustments are recorded in the period incurred as losses on loans held for sale on the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Other Real Estate Owned: Assets acquired through or instead of loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. These assets are subsequently accounted for at lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell. Fair value is commonly based on recent real estate appraisals which are updated no less frequently than annually. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach with data from comparable properties. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available, which results in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. OREO properties are evaluated regularly for impairment and adjusted accordingly.

Note 18. Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share ("EPS") excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock, or resulted in the issuance of stock which then shared in the earnings of the Company. Weighted average shares - diluted includes only the potential dilution of stock options as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The following shows the weighted average number of shares used in computing earnings per share and the effect of weighted average number of shares of dilutive potential common stock. Dilutive potential common stock has no effect on income available to common shareholders. There were no anti-dilutive shares for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.

Note 21. Revenue Recognition
The Company adopted ASU No. 2014-09 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (Topic 606) and all subsequent ASUs that modified Topic 606 in recognizing revenue.
Topic 606 does not apply to revenue associated with financial instruments, including revenue from loans and securities. In addition, certain noninterest income streams such as fees associated with mortgage servicing rights, gain on sale of securities, BOLI income, financial guarantees, derivatives, and certain credit card fees are also not in scope of the new guidance. Topic 606 is applicable to noninterest revenue streams such as trust and asset management income, deposit related fees, interchange fees, merchant income, and insurance commissions. However, the recognition of these revenue streams did not change significantly upon adoption of Topic 606. Substantially all of the Company’s revenue is generated from contracts with customers. Noninterest revenue streams in-scope of Topic 606 are discussed below.

Service Charges on Deposit Accounts
Service charges on deposit accounts consist of account analysis fees (i.e., net fees earned on analyzed business and personal checking accounts), monthly service fees, check orders, and other deposit account related fees. The Company’s performance obligation for account analysis fees and monthly service fees is generally satisfied, and the related revenue recognized, over the period in which the service is provided. Check orders and other deposit account related fees are largely transactional based, and therefore, the Company’s performance obligation is satisfied, and related revenue recognized, at a point in time. Payment for service charges on deposit accounts is primarily received immediately or in the following month through a direct charge to customers’ accounts.
Fees, Exchange and Other Service Charges
Fees, exchange, and other service charges are primarily comprised of debit and credit card income, ATM fees, merchant services income, and other service charges and are included in other income on our consolidated statements of income. Debit and credit card income is primarily comprised of interchange fees earned whenever the Company’s debit and credit cards are processed through card payment networks such as Visa. ATM fees are primarily generated when a Company cardholder uses a non-Company ATM or a non-Company cardholder uses a Company ATM. Merchant services income mainly represents fees charged to merchants to process their debit and credit card transactions, in addition to account management fees. Other service charges include revenue from processing wire transfers, bill pay service, cashier’s checks, and other services. The Company’s performance obligation for fees, exchange, and other service charges are largely satisfied, and related revenue recognized, when the services are rendered or upon completion. Payment is typically received immediately or in the following month. This income is reflected in other income on the Company’s consolidated statements of income.
Other Income
Other noninterest income consists of loan swap fees, insurance commissions, and other miscellaneous revenue streams not meeting the criteria above. When the Company enters into an interest rate swap agreement, the Company may receive an additional one-time payment fee which is recognized as income when received. The Company receives monthly recurring commissions based on a percentage of premiums issued and revenue is recognized when received. Any residual miscellaneous fees are recognized as they occur, and therefore, the Company determined this consistent practice satisfies the obligation for performance.
The following presents noninterest income, segregated by revenue streams in-scope and out-of-scope of Topic 606, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:

Contract Balances
A contract asset balance occurs when an entity performs a service for a customer before the customer pays consideration (resulting in a contract receivable) or before payment is due (resulting in a contract asset). A contract liability balance is an entity’s obligation to transfer a service to a customer for which the entity has already received payment (or payment is due) from the customer. The Company’s noninterest revenue streams are largely based on transactional activity. Consideration is often received immediately or shortly after the Company satisfies its performance obligation and revenue is recognized. The Company does not typically enter into long-term revenue contracts with customers, and therefore, does not experience significant contract balances. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company did not have any significant contract balances.
Contract Acquisition Costs
Under Topic 606, an entity is required to capitalize, and subsequently amortize into expense, certain incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if these costs are expected to be recovered. The incremental costs of obtaining a contract are those costs that an entity incurs to obtain a contract with a customer that it would not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained (for example, sales commission). The Company utilizes the practical expedient which allows entities to immediately expense contract acquisition costs when the asset that would have resulted from capitalizing these costs would have been amortized in one year or less. The Company did not capitalize any contract acquisition cost during the years ended December 31, 2020 or 2019.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods required by the Securities and Exchange Commission and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based on the evaluation, the aforementioned officers concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of such period.
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the preparation of published financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment, management used the 2013 criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on management’s assessment, management believes that as of December 31, 2020, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on criteria set forth by COSO in its 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework.
The Company’s annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Yount, Hyde & Barbour. P.C.
