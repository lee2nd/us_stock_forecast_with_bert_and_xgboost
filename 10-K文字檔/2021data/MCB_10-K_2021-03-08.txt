Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Executive Summary
The Company is a bank holding company headquartered in New York, New York and registered under the Bank Holding Company Act. Through its wholly owned bank subsidiary, Metropolitan Commercial Bank, a New York state chartered bank, the Company provides a broad range of business, commercial and retail banking products and services to small businesses, middle-market enterprises, public entities and affluent individuals in the New York metropolitan area.
The Bank’s primary lending products are commercial real estate loans, multi-family loans and commercial and industrial loans. Substantially all loans are secured by specific items of collateral including business assets, consumer assets, and commercial and residential real estate. Commercial loans are expected to be repaid from cash flows from operations of businesses. The Bank’s primary deposit products are checking, savings, and term deposit accounts, and its deposit accounts are insured by the FDIC under the maximum amounts allowed by law. In addition to traditional commercial banking products, the Bank offers corporate cash management and retail banking services and, through its global payments business, provides global payments infrastructure to its FinTech partners, which includes serving as an issuing bank for third-party debit card programs nationwide. The Bank has developed various deposit gathering strategies, which generate the funding necessary to operate without a large branch network. These activities, together with six strategically located banking centers, generate a stable source of deposits and a diverse loan portfolio with attractive risk-adjusted yields.
The Company is focused on organically growing and expanding its position in the New York metropolitan area. Through an experienced team of commercial relationship managers and its integrated, client-centric approach, the Bank has successfully demonstrated its ability to consistently grow market share by deepening existing client relationships and continually expanding its client base through referrals and seeking out alternatives to traditional retail banking products. The Bank has maintained a goal of converting many of its commercial lending clients into full retail relationship banking clients. Given the size of the market in which the Bank operates and its differentiated approach to client service, there is significant opportunity to continue its loan and deposit growth trajectory. By combining the high-tech service and relationship-based focus of a community bank with an extensive suite of financial products and services, Metropolitan is well-positioned to continue to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities available in the New York metropolitan area.
Recent Events
In April 2019, the Company executed a lease agreement to expand the space occupied at its headquarters at 99 Park Ave., New York, New York. The Company took possession of the new space during the third quarter of 2019 and commenced renovations, which were completed during the third quarter of 2020. When the Company took possession of
the new space, rent expense increased by $615,000 a quarter. The Company vacated its previous space in July 2020. As a result, beginning in August 2020, the Company has ceased rent payments on the former space resulting in a reduction of rent expense of approximately $195,000 per quarter.
The Novel Coronavirus: The Novel Coronavirus pandemic (“COVID-19”) has caused significant economic dislocation in the United States as many state and local governments have placed restrictions on businesses and residents. While many regions in the United States have started to reopen in phases, this process has been protracted, especially in New York City, the Company’s primary market area. This has resulted in a slow-down in economic activity and a related increase in unemployment. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Federal Reserve reduced the benchmark fed funds rate to a target range of 0% to 0.25%, and the yields on 10- and 30-year treasury notes have declined to historic lows. Various state governments and federal agencies are requiring lenders to provide forbearance and other relief to borrowers (e.g., waiving late payment and other fees). The federal banking agencies have encouraged financial institutions to prudently work with affected borrowers and passed legislation that provided relief from reporting loan classifications due to modifications related to the COVID-19 outbreak. Certain industries have been particularly hard-hit, including the travel and hospitality industry, the restaurant industry and the retail industry. Finally, the spread of COVID-19 has caused the Bank to modify its business practices, including employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences. See “Impact of COVID-19 on the Bank” in this Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations for more information on the impact of COVID-19 on the Bank. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this Report for further discussion on the risks to the Bank due to COVID-19.
Critical Accounting Policies
A summary of accounting policies is provided in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. Critical accounting estimates are necessary in the application of certain accounting policies and procedures and are particularly susceptible to significant change. Critical accounting policies are defined as those involving significant judgments and assumptions by management that could have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the Company’s most critical accounting policy, which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments, is as follows:
Allowance for Loan Losses
The ALLL has been determined in accordance with GAAP. The Bank is responsible for the timely and periodic determination of the amount of the allowance required. Management believes that the ALLL is adequate to cover specifically identifiable loan losses, as well as estimated losses inherent in the Bank’s portfolio for which certain losses are probable but not specifically identifiable.
Although management evaluates available information to determine the adequacy of the ALLL, the level of allowance is an estimate which is subject to significant judgment and short-term change. Because of uncertainties associated with local economic, operating, regulatory and other conditions, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, collateral values and future cash flows of the loan portfolio, it is possible that a material change could occur in the ALLL in the near term. The evaluation of the adequacy of loan collateral is often based upon estimates and appraisals. Because of changing economic conditions, the valuations determined from such estimates and appraisals may also change. Accordingly, the Company may ultimately incur losses that vary from management’s current estimates. Adjustments to the ALLL will be reported in the period such adjustments become known or can be reasonably estimated. All loan losses are charged to the ALLL when the loss actually occurs or when the collectability of the principal is unlikely. Recoveries are credited to the allowance at the time of recovery. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Bank’s allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require the Bank to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.
Emerging Growth Company
Pursuant to the JOBS Act, an EGC is provided the option to adopt new or revised accounting standards that may be issued by the FASB or the SEC either (i) within the same periods as those otherwise applicable to non-EGCs or (ii) within the same time periods as private companies. The Company elected the option to utilize the delayed effective dates of recently issued accounting standards. As permitted by the JOBS Act, so long as it qualifies as an EGC, the Company will take advantage of some of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that are available to it, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation, and exemptions from the requirements of holding non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute payments.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards

Discussion of Financial Condition
Summary
The Company had total assets of $4.33 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of 29.0% from December 31, 2019. Total loans before deferred fees increased to $3.14 billion at December 31, 2020, as compared to $2.67 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase from December 31, 2019 primarily included increases of $358.4 million in CRE loans (including multi-family and construction loans) and $142.9 million in C&I loans, partially offset by net paydowns and amortization of $11.3 million and $25.5 million in one- to four-family and consumer loans, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Bank’s loan production was $687.2 million, as compared to $1.1 billion for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019.
Total cash and cash equivalents were $864.3 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of 122.1% from December 31, 2019. The increases in cash and cash equivalents reflect the strong growth in deposits of $1.03 billion that exceeded growth in loans of $464.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Total securities, primarily those classified as AFS, were $271.2 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of 12.6% from December 31, 2019.
Total deposits increased by $1.03 billion, or 36.8%, to $3.82 billion at December 31, 2020 from $2.79 billion at December 31, 2019. The year-to-date increase in deposits was due to increases of $624.6 million in non-interest-bearing deposits to $1.72 billion at December 31, 2020, as compared to $1.09 billion at December 31, 2019 and $403.2 million in interest-bearing deposits to $2.10 billion at December 31, 2020, as compared to $1.70 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase in deposits was primarily due to growth in U.S. bankruptcy trustee and property management accounts, as well as deposit growth in the Bank’s retail network. Non-interest-bearing deposits were 44.9% of total deposits at December 31, 2020, as compared to 39.1% at December 31, 2019.
In September 2020, the Bank fully paid down its Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances, a decrease of $144.0 million from December 31, 2019.
Total stockholders’ equity was $340.8 million at December 31, 2020, as compared to $299.1 million at December 31, 2019. The increase of $41.7 million was primarily due to net income of $39.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Investments
The following table sets forth the stated maturities and weighted average yields of investment securities, excluding equity securities, at December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands). The table does not include the effect of prepayments or scheduled principal amortization. The weighted average yield for each group of securities was weighted by the par value of the securities in the group. The par values were as of December 31, 2020. Tax exempt-securities, if any, were presented on tax-equivalent basis.
There were no securities pledged as collateral at December 31, 2020. There were $126.2 million of AFS securities pledged as collateral for certain deposits at December 31, 2019.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company’s securities portfolio primarily consisted of investment grade mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations issued by government agencies.
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment
Each reporting period, the Bank evaluates its AFS and HTM securities with a decline in fair value below the amortized cost of the investment to determine whether or not the impairment is deemed to be other-than-temporary. Other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) is required to be recognized if:  (1) the Bank intends to sell the security; (2) the Bank is more likely than not that the Bank will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis; or (3) the present value of expected cash flows is not sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis. For impaired securities that the Bank intends to sell, or more likely than not will be required to sell, the full amount of the impairment is recognized as OTTI, resulting in a realized loss that is a charged to earnings through a reduction in noninterest income. For all other impaired debt securities, credit-related OTTI is recognized through earnings and non-credit related OTTI is recognized in other comprehensive income/loss, net of applicable taxes.
The unrealized losses of securities at December 31, 2020 and 2019 are primarily due to the changes in market interest rates subsequent to purchase. The Bank does not consider these securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired since the decline in market value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality. In addition, the Bank does not intend to sell and does not believe that it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell these investments until there is a full recovery of the unrealized loss, which may be at maturity. As a result, no impairment loss was recognized during the years ended December 31, 2020 or 2019.
Loans
Loans are the Bank’s primary interest-earning asset. The following tables set forth certain information about the loan portfolio and asset quality.
The following tables set forth certain information at December 31, 2020 regarding the dollar amount of loan contractual maturities during the periods indicated. The tables do not include any estimate of prepayments that significantly shorten the average loan life and may cause actual repayment experience to differ from that shown below (in thousands).
The following table sets forth the dollar amount of loans at December 31, 2020 that are due after one year and have either fixed interest rates or floating interest rates (dollars in thousands):
Asset Quality
Non-performing assets consist of non-accrual loans, non-accrual troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”), and other real estate that has been acquired in partial or full satisfaction of loan obligations or upon foreclosure. Past due status on all loans is based on the contractual terms of the loan. It is generally the Bank’s policy that a loan 90 days past due be placed on non-accrual status unless factors exist that would eliminate the need to place a loan in this status. A loan may also be designated as non-accrual at any time if payment of principal or interest in full is not expected due to deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower. At the time loans are placed on non-accrual status, the accrual of interest is discontinued and previously accrued interest is reversed. All payments received on non-accrual loans are applied to principal. Loans are considered for return to accrual status when they become current as to principal and interest and remain current for a period of six consecutive months or when, in the opinion of management, the Company expects to receive all of its original principal and interest. In the case of non-accrual loans where a portion of the loan has been charged off, the remaining balance is kept on non-accrual status until the entire principal balance has been recovered.
Non-accrual loans increased by $1.5 million to $5.6 million at December 31, 2020, as compared to $4.1 million at December 31, 2019, primarily due to the addition of one C&I loan, which was adversely affected by COVID-19, in the amount of $3.1 million, offset by a one-to-four family loan in the amount of $2.4 million, which was placed on non-accrual status in June 2019 and was taken off of non-accrual status following the borrower making current payments for six consecutive months since then. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had established a specific reserve of $2.8 million for the C&I loan.
Allowance for Loan Losses
The allowance is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb probable incurred losses on existing loans. The allowance is established based on management’s evaluation of the probable incurred losses inherent in the Company’s portfolio in accordance with GAAP, and is comprised of both specific valuation allowances and general valuation allowances.
The allowance for loan losses is increased through a provision for loan losses charged to operations. Loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the collectability of all or a portion of the principal is unlikely. Management’s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is performed on a quarterly basis and takes into consideration such factors as the credit risk grade assigned to the loan, historical loan loss experience and review of specific impaired loans.
The following tables set forth the allowance for loan losses allocated by loan category for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):
Deposits
The tables below summarize the Bank’s deposit composition by segment for the periods indicated, and the dollar and percent change from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019 (dollars in thousands):
The tables below summarize the Bank’s average balances and average interest rate paid, by segment, for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):
As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate amount of uninsured deposits (deposits in amounts greater than or equal to $250,000, which is the maximum amount for federal deposit insurance) was $3.33 billion. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, the aggregate amount of the Bank’s uninsured time deposits was $42.5 million. The following are scheduled maturities of time deposits greater than $250,000 as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands):
Borrowings
FHLB Advances
At December 31, 2020, the Bank did not have any FHLB borrowings as all of the previous $144.0 million of advances matured in 2020. At December 31, 2020, the Bank had the ability to borrow a total of $499.8 million from the FHLB. It also had an available line of credit with the FRBNY discount window of $123.8 million.
Trust Preferred Securities Payable
On December 7, 2005, the Company established MetBank Capital Trust I, a Delaware statutory trust (“Trust I”). The Company received all of the common stock of Trust I in exchange for contributed capital of $310,000. Trust I issued $10 million of preferred capital securities to investors in a private transaction and invested the proceeds, combined with the proceeds from the sale of Trust I’s common capital securities, in the Company through the purchase of $10.3 million aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures (the “Debentures”) issued by the Company. The Debentures, the sole assets of Trust I, mature on December 9, 2035 and bear interest at a floating rate of 3-month LIBOR plus 1.85%. The Debentures became callable after five years. At December 31, 2020, the Debentures bore an interest rate of 2.09%.
On July 14, 2006, the Company established MetBank Capital Trust II, a Delaware statutory trust (“Trust II”). The Company received all of the common stock of Trust II in exchange for contributed capital of $310,000. Trust II issued $10 million of preferred capital securities to investors in a private transaction and invested the proceeds, combined with the proceeds from the sale of Trust II’s common capital securities, in the Company through the purchase of $10.3 million aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures (the “Debentures II”) issued by the Company. The Debentures II, the sole assets of Trust II, mature on October 7, 2036, and bear interest at a floating rate of 3-month LIBOR plus 2.00%. The Debentures II became callable after five years of issuance. At December 31, 2020, the Debentures II bore an interest rate of 2.24%.
Subordinated Notes Payable
On March 8, 2017, the Company issued $25 million of subordinated notes at 100% issue price to accredited institutional investors. The notes mature on March 15, 2027 and bear an interest rate of 6.25% per annum. The interests are paid semi-annually on March 15th and September 15th of each year through March 15, 2022 and quarterly thereafter on March 15th, June 15th, September 15th and December 15th of each year.
In accordance with the terms of the subordinated notes, the interest rate from March 15, 2022 to the maturity date will reset quarterly to an interest rate per annum equal to the then current 3-month LIBOR (not less than zero) plus 426 basis points, payable quarterly in arrears.
The Company may redeem the subordinated notes beginning with the interest payment date of March 15, 2022 and on any scheduled interest payment date thereafter. The subordinated notes may be redeemed in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the subordinated notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest.
The terms of the trust preferred securities and subordinated notes payable will be impacted by the transition from LIBOR to an alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rate, potentially the SOFR, in 2022. On November 30, 2020, announcement by LIBOR’s administrator, the ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA), signaled to the market that USD LIBOR for the most liquid maturities is now likely to continue to be published until June 30, 2023; however, no definitive announcement has been made on this delay. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the transition on the trust preferred securities payable.
Secured Borrowings
The Bank has loan participation agreements with counterparties. The Bank is generally the servicer for these loans. If the transfer of the participation interest does not qualify for sale treatment under current accounting guidance, the amount of the loan transferred is recorded as a secured borrowing. There were $37.0 million in secured borrowings as of December 31, 2020 and $43.0 million as of December 31, 2019.
Discussion of the Results of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020
Net Income
Net income increased $9.4 million to $39.5 million for 2020, as compared to $30.1 million for 2019. This increase was primarily due to a $27.3 million increase in net interest income and a $6.4 million increase in non-interest income, offset by a $5.3 million increase in provision for loan losses, a $14.5 million increase in non-interest expense and a $4.5 million increase in income tax expense.
Net Interest Income Analysis
Net interest income is the difference between interest earned on assets and interest incurred on liabilities. The following presents an analysis of net interest income by each major category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in thousands). The table presents the average yield on interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Yields and costs were derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, respectively, for the periods shown. Average balances were derived from daily balances over the periods indicated. Interest income included fees that management considered to be adjustments to yields. Yields on tax-exempt obligations were not computed on a tax equivalent basis. Non-accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances
and therefore have a zero yield. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred loan origination fees and costs, and purchase discounts and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income.
(3) Amount includes deferred loan fees and non-performing loans.
(4) Determined by subtracting the weighted average cost of total interest-bearing liabilities from the weighted average yield on total interest-earning assets.
(5) Determined by dividing net interest income by total average interest-earning assets.
Rate/Volume Analysis
The following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on net interest income for the periods indicated. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The net column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately, based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume (in thousands).
Net interest margin decreased 20 basis points to 3.26% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 3.46% for 2019. Total average interest-earning assets increased $1.01 billion to $3.83 billion for 2020, as compared to $2.82 billion for 2019. The total yield on average interest-earning assets decreased 87 basis points to 3.73% for 2020, as compared to 4.60% for 2019. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $456.9 billion to $2.03 billion for 2020, as compared to $1.57 billion for 2019. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased 115 basis points to 0.90% for 2020, as compared to 2.05% for 2019. Non-interest-bearing deposits accounted for 42% of total funding for 2020, as compared to 38% for 2019.
The decreases in net interest margin for 2020, as compared to 2019 was due to significantly lower market interest rates as well as an increase in the level of liquid assets and securities on the balance sheet, which earn lower yields than the Bank’s loan portfolio. The Bank was successful in growing deposits by $1.03 billion in 2020, which exceeded net loan growth. As a result, the average balance of overnight deposits grew by $383.0 million to $732.1 million for 2020, as compared to $349.1 million for 2019. In addition, the average yield on overnight deposits was 0.35% for 2020, as compared to 2.22% for 2019, and the average balance of overnight deposits accounted for 19.1% and 12.4% of total average interest-earning assets for 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The decreases in yields on interest-earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities were primarily due to the several interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in 2019 and 2020. The Federal Reserve reduced interest rates three
times for a total of 75 basis points in the third and fourth quarters of 2019 and, in response to COVID-19, reduced interest rates by an additional 50 basis points on March 3, 2020 and 100 basis points on March 15, 2020.
Interest Income
Interest income increased $13.3 million to $143.1 million for 2020, as compared to $129.8 million for 2019. This increase was primarily due to increases of $19.4 million in interest income on loans, partially offset by a $5.2 million decrease in interest on overnight deposits. The increase in interest income on loans was due to a $584.0 million increase in the average balance of loans to $2.89 billion, partially offset by a 35 basis point decrease in the average yield to 4.73% for 2020, as compared to an average balance of $2.30 billion and an average yield of 5.08% on loans for 2019. The increase in the average balance of loans reflects the Bank’s continued growth. The decrease in interest on overnight deposits was due to a 187 basis point decrease in the average yield on overnight deposits to 0.35% for 2020, partially offset by an increase of $383.0 million in the average balance of overnight deposits to $732.1 million for 2020, as compared to an average balance of $349.1 million and average yield of 2.22% on overnight deposits for 2019.
Interest Expense
Interest expense decreased $14.0 million to $18.2 million for 2020, as compared to $32.2 million for 2019. This decrease was due primarily to a $11.3 million decrease in interest on deposits and a $2.4 million decrease in interest on borrowings. The decrease in interest expense on deposits was primarily due to a 113 basis point decrease in the average cost of deposits to 0.75%, partially offset by a $538.5 million increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits to $1.90 billion for 2020, as compared to an average balance of $1.36 billion and an average cost of 1.88% for 2019. The growth in the average balance of deposits was due primarily to the development of the Bank’s new corporate cash management product offered to bankruptcy trustees, property management companies and others who have control of or discretion over large cash positions.
Interest expense on borrowings decreased primarily due to a decrease in the average balance of borrowings of $81.7 million to $129.5 million for 2020, as compared to $211.1 million for 2019, as well as a decrease of 11 basis points in the average cost to 2.99%, as compared to 3.10% for 2019. The Bank had $144.0 million of FHLB advances mature during 2020.
Provision for Loan Losses
The provision for loan losses for 2020 was $9.5 million, as compared to $4.2 million for 2019. The increase in the provision reflected the economic conditions driven by COVID-19 as well as the loan growth during 2020. In the first quarter of 2020, the Bank recorded $3.1 million in additional provision due to the economic downturn resulting from COVID-19. The required provision for loan losses for 2019 was reduced due to $4.3 million of recoveries related primarily to the recovery of medallion loans previously charged-off in 2017 and 2016.
Non-Interest Income
Non-interest income increased by $6.4 million to $17.0 million for 2020, as compared to $10.6 million for 2019, primarily due to a $3.3 million gain on the sale of securities and an increase of $2.8 million in global payments revenue. The gain on securities sales was due to the sale of $108.1 million of available-for-sale securities, which were sold to realize gains as market rates decreased and prepayment speeds were anticipated to increase. The increase in global payments revenue reflects the growth in the global payments business.
Non-Interest Expense
Non-interest expense increased $14.5 million to $74.5 million for 2020 as compared to $60.0 million for 2019. The increase was primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits, licensing fees and technology costs, and Bank premises and equipment costs.
Compensation and benefits increased $8.6 million to $39.8 million for 2020 as compared to $31.2 million for 2019. This increase was due primarily to an increase in total compensation in line with year-on-year loan growth and revenue generation as well as the increase in the number of full-time employees to 189 for 2020, as compared to 167 for 2019.
Licensing fees and technology costs increased $2.0 million to $13.0 million for 2020 as compared to $11.0 million for 2019. This increase was primarily due to increases in licensing fees related to certain corporate cash management deposits and technology costs. Licensing fees amounted to $9.7 million for 2020, an increase of $1.2 million over 2019. Average corporate cash management deposits related to these licensing fees amounted to $773.4 million for 2020, as compared to $375.3 million for 2019, primarily due to an increase in U.S. Bankruptcy Trustee deposit accounts. Technology costs were $3.4 million for 2020, an increase of $861,000 over 2019. The increase in technology costs was due to the growth of the business and its technology needs.
Bank premises and equipment was $8.3 million for 2020, an increase of $1.8 million over 2019, primarily due to the Company taking possession of and renovating new headquarters space. In addition, the Bank accelerated the amortization of $575,000 of leasehold improvements related to the Bank’s prior space at its headquarters in the first quarter of 2020.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company is party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, which involve elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition. Exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of the instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.
The following is a table of off-balance sheet arrangements broken out by fixed and variable rate commitments for the periods indicated therein (in thousands):
The following is a maturity schedule for the Company’s off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2020 (in thousands):

Liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short-term nature. The Bank’s primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows, loan repayments and maturities and sales of securities. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows, mortgage prepayments and security sales are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition.
The Bank regularly reviews the need to adjust investments in liquid assets based upon an assessment of: (1) expected loan demand, (2) expected deposit flows, (3) yields available on interest-earning deposits and securities, and (4) the objectives of the ALCO program. Excess liquid assets are invested generally in interest earning deposits and short- and intermediate-term securities.
The Bank’s most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents. The levels of these assets are dependent on operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, cash and cash equivalents totaled $864.3 million and $389.2 million, respectively. Securities classified as AFS, which provide additional sources of liquidity, totaled $266.1 million at December 31, 2020 and $234.9 million at December 31, 2019. There were no securities pledged as collateral at December 31, 2020. There were $126.2 million of AFS securities pledged as collateral for certain deposits at December 31, 2019.
At December 31, 2020, the Bank did not have any borrowing from the FHLB and had the ability to borrow $499.8 million from the FHLB. The Bank also had an available line of credit with the FRBNY discount window of $123.8 million.
The Bank has no material commitments or demands that are likely to affect its liquidity other than set forth below. In the event loan demand were to increase faster than expected, or any unforeseen demand or commitment were to occur, the Company could access its borrowing capacity with the FHLB or obtain additional funds through brokered certificates of deposit.
Time deposits due within one year of December 31, 2020 totaled $51.3 million, or 1.3% of total deposits. Total time deposits were $92.1 million, or 2.4% of total deposits, at December 31, 2020.
The Bank’s primary investing activities are the origination and purchase of loans and the purchase of securities. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Bank originated and purchased $687.2 million of loans and $234.4 million of securities. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Bank originated and purchased $1.1 billion of loans and purchased $226.9 million of securities.
Financing activities consist primarily of activity in deposit accounts. Total deposits increased by $1.03 billion and $1.13 billion for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Bank generates deposits from businesses and individuals through client referrals and other relationships and through its retail presence. The Bank has established deposit concentration thresholds to avoid the possibility of dependence on any single depositor base for funds.
The Bank has loan participation agreements with counterparties. The Bank is generally the servicer for these loans. If the transfer of the participation interest does not qualify for sale treatment under current accounting guidance, the amount of the loan transferred is recorded as a secured borrowing. There were $37.0 million in secured borrowings as of December 31, 2020 and $43.0 million as of December 31, 2019.
Regulation
The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal banking agencies. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company and the Bank met all applicable regulatory capital requirements to be considered “well capitalized” under regulatory guidelines. The Company and the Bank manage their capital to comply with their internal planning targets and regulatory capital standards administered by
federal banking agencies. The Company and the Bank review capital levels on a monthly basis. Below is a table of the Company and Bank’s capital ratios for the periods indicated:
The banking regulatory agencies adopted a revised definition of “well capitalized” for financial institutions and holding companies with assets of less than $10 billion and that are not determined to be ineligible by their primary federal regulator due to their risk profile (a “Qualifying Community Bank”). The new definition expanded the ways that a Qualifying Community Bank may meet its capital requirements and be deemed “well capitalized.” The new rule establishes a community bank leverage ratio (“CBLR”) equal to the tangible equity capital divided by the average total consolidated assets. Regulators have established the CBLR to be set at 8.5% through calendar year 2021 and 9% thereafter. The CARES Act temporarily reduced the CBLR to 8%.
A Qualifying Community Bank that maintains a leverage ratio greater than 9% is considered to be well capitalized and to have met generally applicable leverage capital requirements, generally applicable risk-based capital requirements, and any other capital or leverage requirements to which such financial institution or holding company is subject.
The Bank did not elect into the CBLR framework and plans to continue to measure capital adequacy using the ratios in the table above. At December 31, 2020, the Bank’s capital exceeded all applicable requirements.
At both December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, total commercial real estate loans were 412.5% of risk-based capital.
Impact of COVID-19 on the Bank
Operational Readiness
The Company identified the potential threat of COVID-19 in February 2020, activated its Pandemic Plan in March 2020, and had a fully remote workforce for its corporate office by early April 2020 as COVID-19 began to affect New York City, the Bank’s primary market. The activation of the established Pandemic Plan allowed the Bank to react in a disciplined manner to a rapidly changing situation.
On September 7, 2020, the Bank implemented its Return-to-Work Plan, which allowed for up to 50% of employees to return to work. The Bank has made available, at no cost to employees, on-site COVID-19 testing on a two-week schedule. Based on the success of the on-site testing program, the Bank has revised its Return-to-Work Plan to allow up to 75% of employees to return to work as of January 11, 2021 and 100% of employees to return to work as of March 1, 2021. The Bank requires certain health protocols to be followed by all employees including, but not limited to, daily
temperature checks prior to entering the common workspace, daily health certifications by employees, office cleaning measures, social distancing practices and the use of face coverings in all common areas.
The Bank’s actions ensured, and continue to ensure, the Bank’s uninterrupted operational effectiveness, while safeguarding the health and safety of its customers and employees. The Pandemic Plan and Return-to-Work Plan incorporate guidance from the regulatory and health communities, as implemented and monitored by the Bank’s Business Continuity Response Team. The Bank’s branch network continues to serve the local community and its online platforms facilitate alternate methods for its customers to meet their financial needs. While COVID-19 has resulted in widespread disruption to the lives and businesses of the Bank’s customers and employees, the Bank’s Pandemic Plan has enabled the Bank to remain focused on assisting customers and ensuring that the Bank remains fully operational.
Financial Impact
Loan Portfolio and Deferrals
The Bank has taken several steps to assess the financial impact of COVID-19 on its business, including contacting customers to determine how their business was being affected and analyzing the impact of the virus on the different industries that the Bank serves.
Loan Portfolio: As of December 31, 2020, total loans consisted primarily of CRE, C&I and multi-family mortgage loans. At December 31, 2020, the Bank’s loan portfolio includes loans to the following industries (dollars in thousands):
(1)
Commercial real estate, not including one-to-four family loans and participations
(2)
Net of premiums and overdraft adjustments
The largest concentration in the loan portfolio is to the healthcare industry, which amounted to $814.8 million, or 26.0% of total loans at December 31, 2020, including $699.6 million in loans to skilled nursing facilities (“SNF”). The
Bank has not noted any significant impact on SNF loans because of COVID-19 as the demand for nursing home beds remains strong.
Loan Deferrals: The Bank has been working with customers to address their needs during this pandemic. These deferrals were not considered TDRs under Section 4013 of the CARES Act. The following is a summary of loan modifications requested and in process as of December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands):
Loan deferrals were $220.3 million, or 7.0% of total loans, at December 31, 2020.
The following is a summary of the weighted average loan-to-value ratio (“LTV”) for CRE and 1-4 Family loan modifications requested and in process as of December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands):
Allowance for Loan Losses: The Bank continues to assess the impact of the pandemic on its financial condition, including the determination of the allowance for loan losses. As part of that assessment, the Bank considers the effects of the impact of COVID-19 on macro-economic conditions such as unemployment rates and the gradual re-opening of all non-essential businesses. The Bank also analyzed the impact of COVID-19 on its primary market, which is the New York metropolitan area, as well as the impact on the Bank’s market sectors and its specific clients.
Based on current economic conditions, including the negative impact of COVID-19, and the Bank’s ALLL methodology, the total provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $9.5 million.
However, this is a period of great uncertainty. The impact of COVID-19 is likely to be felt over the next several quarters particularly as the term of loan modifications expire and borrowers return to a normal debt service schedule as well as the commencement of a repayment schedule for payments that were deferred. As such, significant adjustments to the ALLL may be required as the full impact of COVID-19 on the Bank’s borrowers becomes known.
Goodwill: The Company performed an impairment assessment and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed as of December 31, 2020.
Liquidity: During periods of economic stress, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bank closely monitors deposit trends and the Bank’s liquidity position. At December 31, 2020, deposits totaled $3.82 billion, an increase of $1.03 billion from total deposits of $2.79 billion at December 31, 2019. On December 31, 2020, total cash and cash equivalents amounted to $864.3 million, or 20.0% of total assets, and securities available for sale amounted to $266.1 million, or 6.1% of total assets. In addition, the Bank has available borrowing capacity of $499.8 million from the FHLB and an available line of credit of $123.8 million with the FRBNY. Management believes that the Bank has ample liquidity to address the COVID-19 uncertainties and remains vigilant in assessing its potential liquidity needs during this period.
Capital: At December 31, 2020, the Company and the Bank were considered well-capitalized. See regulatory ratios under the “Regulation” section herein.
