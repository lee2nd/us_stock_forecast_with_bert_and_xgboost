ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following is a narrative discussion and analysis of significant changes in our results of operations and financial condition. The purpose of this discussion is to focus on information about our financial condition and results of operations that is not otherwise apparent from the audited financial statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and selected financial data included elsewhere in this report.
Overview
We are a bank holding company within the meaning of the BHC Act headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama. Through our wholly-owned subsidiary bank, we operate 21 full service banking offices located in Jefferson, Shelby, Madison, Montgomery, Mobile, Baldwin and Houston Counties in Alabama, Escambia and Hillsborough Counties in Florida, Cobb and Douglas Counties in Georgia, Charleston County in South Carolina and Davidson County in Tennessee. These offices operate in the Birmingham-Hoover, Huntsville, Montgomery, Dothan, Daphne-Fairhope-Foley and Mobile, Alabama MSAs, the Pensacola-Ferry Pass-Brent and Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, Florida MSAs, the Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Roswell, Georgia MSA, the Charleston-North Charleston, South Carolina MSA and the Nashville-Davidson-Murfreesboro-Franklin, Tennessee MSA. We also operate loan production offices in Columbus, Georgia, Sarasota, Florida, and Summerville, South Carolina. Our principal business is to accept deposits from the public and to make loans and other investments. Our principal source of funds for loans and investments are demand, time, savings, and other deposits and the amortization and prepayment of loans and borrowings. Our principal sources of income are interest and fees collected on loans, interest and dividends collected on other investments and service charges. Our principal expenses are interest paid on savings and other deposits, interest paid on our other borrowings, employee compensation, office expenses and other overhead expenses.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of certain accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or subject to variation and may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the current period or in future periods. The use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments are necessary when financial assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at, or adjusted to reflect, fair value. Assets carried at fair value inherently result in more financial statement volatility. Fair values and information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on either quoted market prices or are provided by other independent third-party sources, when available. When such information is not available, management estimates valuation adjustments. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations.
Allowance for Credit Losses
The Company assesses the adequacy of its allowance for credit losses at the end of each calendar quarter. The level of allowance is based on the Company’s evaluation of historical default and loss experience, current and projected economic conditions, asset quality trends, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrowers’ ability to repay a loan, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio and other relevant factors. The allowance is increased by a provision for credit losses, which is charged to expense, and reduced by charge-offs, net of recoveries. The allowance for credit losses is believed adequate to absorb all expected future losses to be recognized over the contractual life of the loans in the portfolio.
Loans with similar risk characteristics are evaluated in pools and, depending on the nature of each identified pool, the Company utilizes a discounted cash flow (“DCF”), probability of default / loss given default (“PD/LGD”) or remaining life method. The historical loss experience estimate by pool is then adjusted by forecast factors that are quantitatively related to the Company’s historical credit loss experience, such as national unemployment rates and gross domestic product. Losses are predicted over a period of time determined to be reasonable and supportable, and at the end of the reasonable and supportable period losses are reverted to long term historical averages. The reasonable and supportable period and reversion period are re-evaluated each quarter by the Company and are dependent on the current economic environment among other factors. See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data elsewhere in this report.
The expected credit losses for each loan pool are then adjusted for changes in qualitative factors not inherently considered in the quantitative analyses. The qualitative adjustments either increase or decrease the quantitative model estimation. The Company considers factors that are relevant within the qualitative framework which include the following: lending policy, changes in nature and volume of loans, staff experience, changes in volume and trends of problem loans, concentration risk, trends in underlying collateral values, external factors, quality of loan review system and other economic conditions.
Expected credit losses for loans that no longer share similar risk characteristics with the collectively evaluated pools are excluded from the collective evaluation and estimated on an individual basis. Individual evaluations are performed for nonaccrual loans, loans rated substandard, and modified loans classified as troubled debt restructurings. Specific allocations of the allowance for credit losses are estimated on one of several methods, including the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, observable market value of similar debt or the present value of expected cash flows.
Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, the allowance for credit losses represented management’s best estimate of inherent losses that had been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans. The allowance for credit losses on loans included allowance allocations calculated in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 310, “Receivables” and allowance allocations calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 450, “Contingencies.”
Income Taxes
Income tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
The Company follows the provisions of ASC 740-10, Income Taxes. ASC 740-10 establishes a single model to address accounting for uncertain tax positions. ASC 740-10 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. ASC 740-10 also provides guidance on derecognition measurement classification interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. ASC 740-10 provides a two-step process in the evaluation of a tax position. The first step is recognition. A company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including a resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based upon the technical merits of the position. The second step is measurement. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis presents the more significant factors that affected our financial condition as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and results of operations for each of the years then ended. Refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K file with the SEC on February 25, 2020 (2019 FORM 10-K) for a discussion and analysis of the more significant factors that affected periods prior to 2019.
Net Income Available to Common Stockholders
Net income available to common stockholders was $169.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $149.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase in net income is primarily attributable to an increase in net interest income, which increased $50.4 million, or 17.5%, to $338.0 million in 2020 from $287.6 million in 2019. Noninterest income increased $6.1 million, or 25.6%, to $30.1 million in 2020 from $24.0 million in 2019. Noninterest expense increased by $9.4 million, or 9.2%, to $111.5 million in 2020 from $102.1 million in 2019. Basic and diluted net income per common share were $3.15 and $3.13, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $2.79 and $2.76, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019. Return on average assets was 1.59% in 2020, compared to 1.73% in 2019, and return on average stockholders’ equity was 18.55% in 2020, compared to 19.16% in 2019.
The following table presents some ratios of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
The following tables present a summary of our statements of income, including the percent change in each category, for the years ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019, and for the years ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018, respectively.
Net Interest Income
Net interest income is the difference between the income earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities used to support such assets. The major factors which affect net interest income are changes in volumes, the yield on interest-earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Our management’s ability to respond to changes in interest rates by effective asset-liability management techniques is critical to maintaining the stability of the net interest margin and the momentum of our primary source of earnings.
Net interest income increased $50.4 million, or 17.5%, to $338.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $287.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Total interest income decreased $1.8 million, or 0.5%, to $389.0 million from $390.8 million year-over-year, while total interest expense decreased $52.2 million, or 50.6%, to $51.0 million from $103.2 million year-over-year. Average earning assets increased $1.91 billion, or 22.9%, to $10.24 billion in 2020 from $8.33 billion in 2019. All of our regional markets grew loans during 2020 when including Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loans. Excluding PPP loans, all but three of our regional markets grew loans during 2020. All of our regional markets grew deposits during 2020. PPP loan origination fees recorded as an adjustment to loan yield for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $14.1 million.
Net Interest Margin Analysis
The net interest margin is impacted by the average volumes of interest-sensitive assets and interest-sensitive liabilities and by the difference between the yield on interest-sensitive assets and the cost of interest-sensitive liabilities (spread). Loan fees collected at origination represent an additional adjustment to the yield on loans. Our spread can be affected by economic conditions, the competitive environment, loan demand, and deposit flows. The net yield on earning assets is an indicator of effectiveness of our ability to manage the net interest margin by managing the overall yield on assets and cost of funding those assets.
The following table shows, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the average balances of each principal category of our assets, liabilities and stockholders’ equity, and an analysis of net interest revenue, and the change in interest income and interest expense segregated into amounts attributable to changes in volume and changes in rates. This table is presented on a taxable equivalent basis, if applicable.
(1)
Non-accrual loans are included in average loan balances in all periods. Loan fees of $19,409, $4,744 and $3,733 are included in interest income in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
(2)
Accretion on acquired loan discounts of $100, $90 and $163 are included in interest income in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
(3)
Interest income and yields are presented on a fully taxable equivalent basis using a tax rate of 21%.
(4)
Unrealized gains (losses) of $20,117, $1,607 and $(8,808) are excluded from the yield calculation in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The following table reflects changes in our net interest margin as a result of changes in the volume and rate of our interest-bearing assets and liabilities.
In the table above, changes in net interest income are attributable to (a) changes in average balances (volume variance), (b) changes in rates (rate variance), or (c) changes in rate and average balances (rate/volume variance). The volume variance is calculated as the change in average balances times the old rate. The rate variance is calculated as the change in rates times the old average balance. The rate/volume variance is calculated as the change in rates times the change in average balances. The rate/volume variance is allocated on a pro rata basis between the volume variance and the rate variance in the table above.
From 2019 to 2020, growth in loans was the primary driver of our volume component change. Growth in average balances of interest-bearing balances with banks was a significant contributor to our overall unfavorable volume change. The rate component was favorable as average rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities decreased 96 basis points while yields on average earning assets decreased 89 basis points. Our average rates paid on interest-bearing deposits have come back down since the Federal Reserve started lowering rates during the second half of 2019.
The two primary factors that make up the spread are the interest rates received on loans and the interest rates paid on deposits. We have been responsive to market declines in deposit rates as federal aid money has been inserted into the banking system in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. We dropped our deposit rates five times during 2020. Also, we have not competed for new loans on interest rate alone, but rather we have relied significantly on effective marketing to business customers.
Our net interest spread and net interest margin were 3.09% and 3.31%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 3.02% and 3.46%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in net interest spread was due to rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities decreasing by 96 basis points while average yields on interest-earning assets decreased 89 basis points. The decrease in net interest margin in 2020 was due to increases in average interest-bearing balances with banks driven higher by increasing average deposits due to the influx of federal COVID-19 relief money. Our average interest-earning assets for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $1.91 billion, or 22.9%, to $10.24 billion from $8.33 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase in our average interest-earning assets was due to PPP loan originations and higher interest-bearing balances with banks. Our average interest-bearing liabilities increased $995.1 million, or 16.1%, to $7.18 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $6.19 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. All but one of our markets had an increase in total deposits during 2020. The ratio of our average interest-earning assets to average interest-bearing liabilities increased from 134.6% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 142.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020, as average noninterest-bearing deposits and stockholders’ equity grew by a combined $995.0 million, or 41.3%, from 2019 to 2020.
Our average interest-earning assets produced a taxable equivalent yield of 3.80% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 4.69% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 0.71% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 1.67% for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Provision for Credit Losses
The provision for credit losses represents the amount determined by management to be necessary to maintain the allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) at a level capable of absorbing expected credit losses over the contractual life of loans in the loan portfolio. See the section captioned “Allowance for Credit Losses” located elsewhere in this item for additional discussion related to provision for credit losses.
The provision expense for credit losses was $42.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $19.8 million from $22.6 million in 2019. The increase in provision expense is primarily the result of COVID-19 and its effect on overall macroeconomic conditions during 2020 as well as the implementation of ASC 326 and its current expected loss methodology. The ACL for December 31, 2020 was calculated under the current expected credit losses (“CECL”) methodology and totaled $87.9 million, or 1.04% of loans, net of unearned income. The allowance totaled $76.6 million, or 1.05% of loans, net of unearned income, at December 31, 2019 and was calculated under the incurred loss methodology. Nonperforming loans decreased to $19.0 million, or 0.22% of total loans, at December 31, 2020 from $36.1 million, or 0.50% of total loans, at December 31, 2019. During 2020, we had net charged-off loans totaling $29.6 million, compared to net charged-off loans of $22.1 million for 2019. The ratio of net charged-off loans to average loans was 0.36% for 2020 compared to 0.32% for 2019.
Noninterest Income
Noninterest income increased $6.1 million, or 25.4%, to $30.1 million in 2020 from $24.0 million in 2019. Service charges on deposit accounts increased $0.5 million, or 7.1%, to $7.5 million in 2020 compared to 2019 due to increases in the number of accounts. Mortgage banking income increased $4.4 million, or 100.6%, to $8.7 million in 2020 compared to 2019, as decreases in interest rates drove higher loan volumes. Credit card income decreased $1.2 million, or 16.4%, to $5.9 million in 2020 compared to 2019. Spending on business credit cards decreased 6.3% from 2019 to 2020 while spending on purchase cards increased 44.3%. Purchase cards yield a lower profit margin due to their higher awards payouts. The cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance contracts increased $2.6 million, or 68.4%, to $6.3 million in 2020 compared to 2019. We purchased multiple life insurance contracts totaling $60.7 million in 2020. Other operating income decreased $0.1 million, or 7.3%, to $1.6 million in 2020 compared to 2019.
Noninterest Expense
Noninterest expenses increased $9.4 million, or 9.2%, to $111.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $102.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Salary and employee benefits expenses increased $3.6 million, or 6.3%, to $61.4 million in 2020 compared to 2019. We had 493 full-time equivalent employees as of December 31, 2020 compared to 500 as of December 31, 2019, a 1.5% decrease. Equipment and occupancy expense increased $798,000 or 8.6%, to $10.1 million in 2020 compared to 2019. Depreciation expense increased $460,000 year-over-year while building rental expense increased $163,000 year-over-year. Third party processing and other services increased $2.5 million or 22.6%, to $13.8 million in 2020 compared to 2019. Increased data processing expenses continue to be driven by growth in deposit accounts. Increased service charges from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta are the result of increased processing of transactions by us for our correspondent banking clients. Professional services expense increased $7,000 in 2020 compared to 2019. FDIC assessments increased $1.4 million, or 46.4% to $4.4 million from 2019 to 2020. This increase was largely the result of deposit growth due to PPP in 2020 and the Small Bank Assessment Credit in 2019. Expenses on other real estate owned increased $1.7 million to $2.2 million in 2020 compared to $415,000 in 2019, primarily the result of increased write-downs upon updated appraisals received during 2020. Other operating expenses decreased $724,000, or 4.5%, to $15.5 million in 2020 compared to 2019. Changes in other operating expenses from 2019 to 2020 are detailed in Note 15, “Other Operating Income and Expenses,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense was $44.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $37.6 million in 2019. Our effective tax rates for 2020 and 2019 were 20.84% and 20.13%, respectively. Maturities of some of our state tax credit investments at the end of 2019 contributed to the increase in our effective tax rates. Our primary permanent differences are related to tax exempt income on debt securities, state income tax benefit on real estate investment trust dividends, various qualifying tax credits and change in cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance.
We have invested $248.2 million in bank-owned life insurance for certain officers of the Bank. The periodic increases in cash surrender value of those policies are tax exempt and therefore contribute to a larger permanent difference between book income and taxable income.
We own real estate investment trusts for the purpose of holding and managing participations in residential mortgages and commercial real estate loans originated by the bank. The trusts are majority-owned subsidiaries of a trust holding company, which in turn is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the bank. The trusts earn interest income on the loans they hold and incur operating expenses related to their activities. They pay their net earnings, in the form of dividends, to the bank, which receives a deduction for state income taxes.
Financial Condition
Assets
Total assets as of December 31, 2020, were $11.93 billion, an increase of $2.99 billion, or 33.4%, over total assets of $8.95 billion as of December 31, 2019. Average assets for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $10.64 billion, an increase of $2.01 billion, or 23.2%, over average assets of $8.64 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. Loan growth was the primary reason for the increase in ending and average total assets. Year-end 2020 loans were $8.47 billion, up $1.20 billion, or 16.6%, over year-end 2019 total loans of $7.26 billion. Total Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loans at year-end 2020 were $900.5 million. During 2020, we originated over 4,900 PPP loans for our customers.
Earning assets include loans, securities, short-term investments and bank-owned life insurance contracts. We maintain a higher level of earning assets in our business model than do our peers because we allocate fewer of our resources to facilities, ATMs, and cash and due-from-bank accounts used for transaction processing. Earning assets as of December 31, 2020 were $11.76 billion, or 98.6% of total assets of $11.93 billion. Earning assets as of December 31, 2019 were $8.79 billion, or 98.2% of total assets of $8.95 billion. We believe this ratio is expected to generally continue at these levels, although it may be affected by economic factors beyond our control.
Investment Portfolio
We view the investment portfolio as a source of income and liquidity. Our investment strategy is to accept a lower immediate yield in the investment portfolio by targeting shorter term investments. Our investment policy provides that no more than 60% of our total investment portfolio should be composed of municipal securities. At December 31, 2020, mortgage-backed securities represented 55.9% of the investment portfolio, corporate debt represented 36.5% of the investment portfolio, state and municipal securities represented 4.3% of the investment portfolio, government agency securities represented 1.7%, and U.S. Treasury securities represented 1.6% of the investment portfolio.
All of our investments in mortgage-backed securities are pass-through mortgage-backed securities. We do not have currently, and did not have at December 31, 2020, any structured investment vehicles or any private-label mortgage-backed securities. The amortized cost of securities in our portfolio totaled $861.2 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $752.2 million at December 31, 2019.
The following table presents the amortized cost of securities available for sale and held to maturity by type at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
The following table presents the amortized cost of our securities as of December 31, 2020 by their stated maturities (this maturity schedule excludes security prepayment and call features), as well as the taxable equivalent yields for each maturity range.
As of December 31, 2020, we had $1.8 million in federal funds sold, compared with $100.5 million at December 31, 2019. At year-end 2020, there were no holdings of securities of any issuer, other than the U.S. government and its agencies, in an amount greater than 10% of stockholders’ equity.
The objective of our investment policy is to invest funds not otherwise needed to meet our loan demand to earn the maximum return, yet still maintain sufficient liquidity to meet fluctuations in our loan demand and deposit structure. In doing so, we balance the market and credit risks against the potential investment return, make investments compatible with the pledge requirements of any deposits of public funds, maintain compliance with regulatory investment requirements, and assist certain public entities with their financial needs. The investment committee has full authority over the investment portfolio and makes decisions on purchases and sales of securities. The entire portfolio, along with all investment transactions occurring since the previous board of directors meeting, is reviewed by the board at each monthly meeting. The investment policy allows portfolio holdings to include short-term securities purchased to provide us with needed liquidity and longer-term securities purchased to generate level income for us over periods of interest rate fluctuations.
Loan Portfolio
Section 1102 of the CARES Act created the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”), a program administered by the SBA to provide loans to small businesses for payroll and other basic expenses during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company has participated in the PPP as a lender. These loans are eligible to be forgiven if certain conditions are satisfied and are fully guaranteed by the SBA. Additionally, loan payments will also be deferred for the first six months of the loan term. The PPP commenced on April 3, 2020 and was available to qualified borrowers through August 8, 2020. No collateral or personal guarantees are required. Neither the government nor lenders are permitted to charge the recipients any fees.
On December 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act (“CAA”). The CAA, among other things, extends the life of the PPP, effectively creating a second round of PPP loans for eligible businesses. The Company is participating in the CAA’s second round of PPP lending. In mid-January we opened our lending portal and have begun processing PPP loan applications. Additionally, section 541 of the CAA extends the relief provided by the CARES Act for financial institutions to suspend the GAAP accounting treatment for troubled debt restructuring to January 1, 2022. As of January 31, 2021, we have funded 593 loans under the CAA round of PPP lending, representing $123.7 million in funding.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had originated over 4,900 loans with balances in excess of $1.05 billion to new and existing customers through the PPP. To the extent the PPP loans are forgiven, this represents outside funds to our borrowers; and, especially with respect to vulnerable industries, we believe these capital injections are going to be instrumental in assisting our borrowers in navigating through the pandemic. This capital injection, along with the level of capital each borrower had just prior to COVID-19 impacting them, are critical factors in determining the staying power of our borrowers. Upon receipt of interim financial results from our borrowers, we will use that information to update our understanding of the underlying strengths or weaknesses in each individual relationship and take actions, as appropriate. As of January 31, 2021, we have received payment from the SBA on just over 1,000 of our loans totaling $220.0 million.
We had total loans of approximately $8.5 billion at December 31, 2020. The following table shows the percentage of our total loan portfolio assigned to each of our markets. A large majority of our loan customers are located within our market MSAs, as is the collateral for their loans. With our loan portfolio concentrated in a limited number of markets, there is a risk that our borrowers’ ability to repay their loans from us could be affected by changes in local and regional economic conditions.

Asset Quality
The following table presents a summary of changes in the allowance for credit losses over the past five fiscal years.
Effective January 1, 2020, we adopted the provisions of ASC 326, which replaced the incurred loss methodology for determining our provision for credit losses and allowance for credit losses with the CECL model. Upon the adoption of ASC 326 the total amount of the allowance for credit losses on loans estimated using the CECL methodology decreased $2.0 million compared to the total amount of the allowance recorded as of December 31, 2019 using the prior incurred loss model. This decrease is the result of implementing a more quantitative methodology. The commercial, financial, and agricultural loan category decreased $8.2 million due to the portfolio primarily consisting of loans with generally short contractual maturities. This was partially offset by an increase of $6.2 million in the real estate - construction loan category due to the application of peer loss rates within the discounted cash flow pool reserve methodology. Peer historical loss rates were utilized to better align with loss expectations given the Company’s low historical loss experience in this category. The allowance for credit losses is established and maintained at levels needed to absorb anticipated credit losses to be recognized over the contractual life of the loans in the portfolio as of the balance sheet date. In assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, management considers its evaluation of the loan portfolio, past due loan experience, collateral values, current economic conditions and other factors considered necessary to maintain the allowance at an adequate level. Our management feels that the allowance was adequate at December 31, 2020.
We maintain an allowance for credit losses on unfunded commercial lending commitments and letters of credit to provide for the risk of loss inherent in these arrangements. The allowance is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine the allowance for credit losses for loans, modified to take into account the probability of a drawdown on the commitment. The allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments is classified as a liability account on the balance sheet within other liabilities, while the corresponding provision for these credit losses is recorded as a component of other expense. The allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments was $2.2 million at December 31, 2020. Prior to January 1, 2020, we calculated allowance for losses on unfunded loan commitments using an incurred losses methodology. At December 31, 2019, the allowance for unfunded commitments was $500,000.
The following table presents the allocation of the allowance for loan losses for each respective loan category with the corresponding percent of loans in each category to total loans.
The Company uses the discounted cash flow (“DCF”) method to estimate ACL for all loan pools except for commercial revolving lines of credit and credit cards. For all loan pools utilizing the DCF method, the Company utilizes and forecasts national unemployment rate as a loss driver. The Company also utilizes and forecasts GDP growth as a second loss driver for its agricultural and consumer loan pools. Consistent forecasts of the loss drivers are used across the loan segments. Upon implementation of CECL on January 1, 2020 and at December 31, 2020, a reasonable and supportable period of twelve months was utilized followed by a six-month straight-line reversion to long term averages. The Company leveraged economic projections from reputable and independent sources to inform its loss driver forecasts. At December 31, 2020 as compared to January 1, 2020, the Company forecasted a significantly higher national unemployment rate as well as a slightly higher national GDP growth rate. The Company expects national unemployment to remain above pre-pandemic levels over the forecast period with an improved national GDP growth rate as the economy comes back on line over the next year.
The Company uses loss rate methods to estimate expected credit losses for its commercial revolving lines of credit and credit card pools. The commercial revolving lines of credit pool incorporates a probability of default (“PD”) and loss given default (“LGD”) modeling approach. This approach involves estimating the pool average life and then using historical correlations of default and loss experience over time to calculate the lifetime PD and LGD. These two inputs are then applied to the outstanding pool balance as of December 31, 2020. The credit card pool incorporates a remaining life modeling approach, which utilizes an attrition-based method to estimate the remaining life of the pool. A quarterly average loss rate is then calculated using the Company’s historical loss data. The model reduces the pool balance quarterly on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the pool. The quarterly loss rate is multiplied by the outstanding balance at each period-end resulting in an estimated loss for each quarter. The sum of estimated loss for all quarters is the total calculated reserve for the pool at December 31, 2020.
Each loan pool is adjusted for qualitative factors not inherently considered in the quantitative analyses. The qualitative adjustments either increase or decrease the quantitative model estimation. The Company considers factors that are relevant within the qualitative framework which include the following: lending policy, changes in nature and volume of loans, staff experience, changes in volume and trends of problem loans, concentration risk, trends in underlying collateral values, external factors, quality of loan review system and other economic conditions.
PPP loans outstanding totaled $900.5 million at December 31, 2020 and are included within the Commercial, financial and agricultural loan category. No allowance for credit losses has been recorded for PPP loans as they are fully guaranteed by the SBA.
The bank has procedures and processes in place intended to ensure that losses do not exceed the potential amounts documented in the bank’s analysis of loans individually evaluated and reduce potential losses in the remaining performing loans within our real estate construction portfolio. These include the following:
●
We closely monitor the past due and overdraft reports on a weekly basis to identify deterioration as early as possible and the placement of identified loans on the watch list.
●
We perform extensive quarterly credit reviews for all watch list/classified loans, including formulation of aggressive workout or action plans. When a workout is not achievable, we move to collection/foreclosure proceedings to obtain control of the underlying collateral as rapidly as possible to minimize the deterioration of collateral and/or the loss of its value.
●
We require updated financial information, global inventory aging and interest carry analysis for existing customers to help identify potential future loan payment problems.
●
We generally limit loans for new construction to established builders and developers that have an established record of turning their inventories, and we restrict our funding of undeveloped lots and land.
Nonperforming Assets
The table below summarizes our nonperforming assets at December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016:
The balance of nonperforming assets can fluctuate due to changes in economic conditions. We have established a policy to discontinue accruing interest on a loan (i.e., place the loan on nonaccrual status) after it has become 90 days delinquent as to payment of principal or interest, unless the loan is considered to be well-collateralized and is actively in the process of collection. In addition, a loan will be placed on nonaccrual status before it becomes 90 days delinquent unless management believes that the collection of interest is expected. Interest previously accrued but uncollected on such loans is reversed and charged against current income when the receivable is determined to be uncollectible. Interest income on nonaccrual loans is recognized only as received. If we believe that a loan will not be collected in full, we will increase the allowance for loan losses to reflect management’s estimate of any potential exposure or loss. Generally, payments received on nonaccrual loans are applied directly to principal. There are not any loans, outside of those included in the table above, that cause management to have serious doubts as to the ability of borrowers to comply with present repayment terms.
In keeping with guidance from regulators, the Company continues to work with COVID-19 affected borrowers to defer their payments and interest. While interest continues to accrue to income, through normal GAAP accounting, should eventual credit losses on these deferred payments emerge, the related loans would be placed on nonaccrual status and interest income accrued would be reversed. In such a scenario, interest income in future periods could be negatively impacted. As of December 31, 2020, the Company carries $5.8 million of accrued interest income on deferrals made to COVID-19 affected borrowers. At this time, the Company is unable to project the materiality of such an impact on future deferrals to COVID-19 affected borrowers but recognizes the breadth of the economic impact may affect its borrowers’ ability to repay in future periods.
Deposits
We rely on increasing our deposit base to fund loan and other asset growth. Each of our markets is highly competitive. We compete for local deposits by offering attractive products with competitive rates. We expect to have a higher average cost of funds for local deposits than competitor banks due to our lack of an extensive branch network. Our management’s strategy is to offset the higher cost of funding with a lower level of operating expense and firm pricing discipline for loan products. We have promoted electronic banking services by providing them without charge and by offering in-bank customer training. The following table presents the average balance and average rate paid on each of the following deposit categories at the bank level for years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:
The following table presents the maturities of our certificates of deposit as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Total average deposits for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $8.9 billion, an increase of $1.6 billion, or 22.1%, over total average deposits of $7.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased by $860,000, or 52.7%, from $1.63 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $2.49 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Borrowed Funds
We had available $923.0 million in unused federal funds lines of credit with regional banks as of December 31, 2020, compared to $767.0 million as of December 31, 2019. The increase was attributable to additional lines of credit initiated with new banks during 2020. These lines are subject to certain restrictions.
Federal funds purchased from correspondent banks averaged $627.2 million, $398.2 million and $270.9 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We paid average interest rates on these funds of 0.43%, 2.28% and 1.96% for the same three years, respectively. The maximum amount outstanding at month-end during 2020 and 2019 was $851.5 million and $472.0 million, respectively.
Stockholders’ Equity
Stockholders’ equity increased $150.2 million during 2020, to $992.8 million at December 31, 2020 from $842.7 million at December 31, 2019. The increase in stockholders’ equity resulted primarily from net income of $169.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, less dividends paid or declared on our common stock of $39.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In the normal course of business, we are a party to financial credit arrangements with off-balance sheet risk to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial credit arrangements include commitments to extend credit beyond current fundings, credit card arrangements, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees. Those credit arrangements involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. The contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement we have in those particular financial credit arrangements. All such credit arrangements bear interest at variable rates and we have no such credit arrangements which bear interest at fixed rates.
Our exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit, credit card arrangements and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual or notional amount of those instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance sheet instruments.
The following table sets forth our credit arrangements and financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:
Commitments to extend credit beyond current fundings are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Such commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We evaluate each customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained if deemed necessary by us upon extension of credit is based on our management’s credit evaluation. Collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, and income-producing commercial properties.
Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing, and similar transactions. All letters of credit are due within one year or less of the original commitment date. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers.
Derivatives
The Company periodically enters into derivative contracts to manage exposures to movements in interest rates. The Company purchased an interest rate cap in May of 2020 to limit exposures to increases in interest rates. The interest rate cap is not designated as a hedging instrument but rather as a stand-alone derivative. The interest rate cap has an original term of 3 years, a notional amount of $300 million and is tied to the one-month LIBOR rate with a strike rate of 0.50%. The fair value of the interest rate cap is carried on the balance sheet in other assets and the change in fair value is recognized in noninterest income each quarter. At December 31, 2020 the interest rate cap had a fair value of $139,000 and remaining term of 2.3 years.
The bank has entered into agreements with secondary market investors to deliver loans on a “best efforts delivery” basis. When a rate is committed to a borrower, it is based on the best price that day and locked with our investor for our customer for a 30-day period. In the event the loan is not delivered to the investor, the bank has no risk or exposure with the investor. The interest rate lock commitments related to loans that are originated for later sale are classified as derivatives. The fair values of our agreements with investors and rate lock commitments to customers as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were not material.
Asset and Liability Management
The matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are “interest rate sensitive” and by monitoring an institution’s interest rate sensitivity “gap.” An asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period. The interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the dollar amount of rate-sensitive assets repricing during a period and the volume of rate-sensitive liabilities repricing during the same period. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate-sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate-sensitive liabilities. A gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate-sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate-sensitive assets. During a period of rising interest rates, a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income.
Our asset liability and investment committee is charged with monitoring our liquidity and funds position. The committee regularly reviews the rate sensitivity position on a three-month, six-month and one-year time horizon; loans-to-deposits ratios; and average maturities for certain categories of liabilities. The asset liability committee uses a model to analyze the maturities of rate-sensitive assets and liabilities. The model measures the “gap” which is defined as the difference between the dollar amount of rate-sensitive assets repricing during a period and the volume of rate-sensitive liabilities repricing during the same period. Gap is also expressed as the ratio of rate-sensitive assets divided by rate-sensitive liabilities. If the ratio is greater than “one,” then the dollar value of assets exceeds the dollar value of liabilities and the balance sheet is “asset sensitive.” Conversely, if the value of liabilities exceeds the dollar value of assets, then the ratio is less than one and the balance sheet is “liability sensitive.” Our internal policy requires our management to maintain the gap such that net interest margins will not change more than 10% if interest rates change by 100 basis points or more than 15% if interest rates change by 200 basis points. As of December 31, 2020, our gap was within such ranges. See “-Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis of Market Risk” below in
