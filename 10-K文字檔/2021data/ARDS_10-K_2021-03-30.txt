Overview
We are a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of novel anti-infectives. A significant focus of ours is on targeted immunotherapy using fully human monoclonal antibodies, or mAbs, to treat life-threatening infections. mAbs represent an innovative treatment approach that harnesses the human immune system to fight infections and are designed to overcome the deficiencies associated with current therapies, such as rise in drug resistance, short duration of response, limited tolerability, negative impact on the human microbiome, and lack of differentiation among the treatment alternatives. The majority of our product candidates are derived by employing our differentiated antibody discovery platforms. Our proprietary product pipeline comprises fully human mAbs targeting specific pathogens associated with life-threatening bacterial infections, primarily nosocomial pneumonia, and viral infections such as COVID-19.
Recently we announced the development of a novel antibody discovery and production platform technology called λPEX™. This technology complements and further extends the capabilities of MabIgX® to quickly screen large number of antibody-producing B-cells from patients and generation of high mAb-producing mammalian production cell line at a speed not previously attainable. As a result, we can significantly reduce time for antibody discovery and manufacturing compared to conventional approaches. This technology is being applied to the development of COVID-19 mAbs. We also announced initiation of research and development activities of our monoclonal antibody programs for COVID-19 called AR-712 and AR-701.
In October 2020 and February 2021, we announced the development of a highly neutralizing monoclonal antibody cocktail (AR-712), discovered from convalescent COVID-19 patients, that successfully eliminated all detectable SARS-CoV-2 virus in infected animals at substantially lower doses than parenterally administered (injected) COVID-19 mAbs. The cocktail broadly bind and neutralize SAR-COV-2 virus and the mutant ‘E484K’ variant that is associated with the UK, South Africa, Brazil, and Japan strains. The potency of AR-712 and its direct delivery to the lungs by inhaled administration may facilitate broader treatment coverage and dose sparing not achievable by parenteral administration. A clinical Phase 1/2 study is expected to be launched in the second half of 2021.
Our lead product candidate, AR-301 has exhibited promising preclinical data and clinical data from a Phase 1/2a clinical study in patients. AR-301 targets the alpha toxin produced by gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, or S. aureus, a common pathogen associated with HAP and VAP. In contrast to other programs targeting S. aureus toxins, we are developing AR-301 as a treatment of pneumonia, rather than prevention of S. aureus colonized patients from progression to pneumonia. In January 2019, we initiated a Phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating AR-301 for the treatment of HAP and VAP. The on-going COVID-19 pandemic has caused an impact on patient enrollment globally and the rate of clinical site activation. Pending on the rate of resolution of the on-going COVID-19 pandemic, we provisionally expect to report an interim futility analysis in the second half of 2021. Currently enrollment completion and top-line data are projected to occur in the first half of 2022.
To complement and diversify our portfolio of targeted mAbs, we are developing a broad spectrum small molecule non-antibiotic anti-infective agent gallium citrate (AR-501). AR-501 is being developed in collaboration with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (“CFF”) as a chronic inhaled therapy to treat lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients. In 2018, AR-501 was granted Orphan Drug, Fast Track and Qualified Infectious Disease Product (“QIDP”) designations by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). During the third quarter of 2019, the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) granted the program Orphan Drug Designation. We initiated a Phase 1/2a clinical trial in December 2018 of the inhalable formulation of gallium citrate, which is being evaluated for the treatment of chronic lung infections associated with cystic fibrosis. In June 2020, we announced positive results from the Phase 1 portion of our Phase 1/2a clinical trial of AR-501 in which healthy subjects were enrolled. The Safety Monitoring Committee (“SMC’) and Data Safety Monitoring Board (“DSMB”) from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation supported that the study proceed at all dose levels to the Phase 2a portion of the Phase 1/2a trial in adult subjects with cystic fibrosis (“CF”). The on-going COVID-19 pandemic has caused an impact on the rate of clinical site activation. We provisionally expect to complete enrollment of the Phase 2a portion with cystic fibrosis subjects in the second half of 2021 with top-line data available shortly afterward.
In September 2020, we announced that we reached an agreement with the FDA to simplify our AR-501 Phase 2 trial design for the treatment of chronic lung infections associated with CF. We proposed, and the FDA agreed, to streamline AR-501’s forthcoming Phase 2a clinical trial in CF patients, by removing the single ascending dose (“SAD”) portion of the study and only conducting a multiple ascending dose (“MAD”) regimen. Furthermore, the FDA also concurred with our proposal to expand the originally planned Phase 2a protocol design into a Phase 2a/2b study. This Phase 2a/2b design will enable seamless and efficient advancement of the study from Phase 2a into Phase 2b using the same clinical study protocol. The data from the Phase 2a will inform the dose selection and sample size expansion to achieve statistical significance in efficacy in Phase 2b.
To date, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development efforts relating to our therapeutic candidates, including conducting clinical trials and developing manufacturing capabilities, in-licensing related intellectual property, protecting our intellectual property and providing general and administrative support for these operations. We have generated revenue from our payments under our collaboration strategic research and development contracts and federal awards and grants, as well as awards and grants from not-for-profit entities and fee for service to third-party entities. Since our inception, we have funded our operations primarily through these sources and the issuance of common stock, convertible preferred stock, and debt securities. Current clinical development activities are focused on AR-301, AR712 and AR-501. Our expenses and resulting cash burn during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, were largely due to costs associated with the Phase 3 study of AR-301 for the treatment of VAP caused by the S. aureus bacteria, preclinical development of AR-712 COVID-19 mAb, and the Phase 1/2 study of AR-501 for the treatment of chronic lung infections associated with cystic fibrosis.
Financial Overview
We have incurred losses since our inception. Our net losses were approximately $22.3 million and $29.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 we had approximately $8.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and had an accumulated deficit of approximately $123.1 million. Substantially, all of our net losses have resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs, clinical trials, intellectual property matters, strengthening our manufacturing capabilities, and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations.
We have not yet achieved commercialization of our products and have a cumulative net loss from our operations. We will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. We will require additional capital to meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through the sale of equity and/or debt securities. Historically, our principal sources of cash have included proceeds from grant funding, fees for services performed, issuances of convertible debt and the sale of our preferred stock. Our principal uses of cash have included cash used in operations. We expect that the principal uses of cash in the future will be for continuing operations, funding of research and development including our clinical trials and general working capital requirements.
We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we:
•
continue enrollment in our ongoing clinical trials;
•
initiate new clinical trials;
•
seek to identify, assess, acquire and develop other products, therapeutic candidates and technologies;
•
seek regulatory and marketing approvals in multiple jurisdictions for our therapeutic candidates that successfully complete clinical studies;
•
establish collaborations with third parties for the development and commercialization of our products and therapeutic candidates;
•
make milestone or other payments under our agreements, pursuant to which we have licensed or acquired rights to intellectual property and technology;
•
seek to maintain, protect, and expand our intellectual property portfolio;
•
seek to attract and retain skilled personnel;
•
incur the administrative costs associated with being a public company and related costs of compliance;
•
create additional infrastructure to support our operations as a commercial stage public company and our planned future commercialization efforts;
•
experience any delays or encounter issues with any of the above; and
•
experience protracted COVID-19 related delays.
We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing losses for at least the next several years. Accordingly, we anticipate that we will need to raise additional capital in order to obtain regulatory approval for, and the commercialization of, our therapeutic candidates. Until such time that we can generate meaningful revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operating activities through public or private equity or debt financings, government or other third-party funding and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements or a combination of these approaches. If we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, we may be required to significantly curtail, delay or discontinue one or more of our research or development programs or the commercialization of any approved therapies or products or be unable to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, as desired, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
SIBV License Agreement
In July 2019, we entered into an option agreement with Serum International B.V. (“SIBV”), an affiliate of Serum Institute of India Private Limited, which granted SIBV the option to license multiple programs from us and access our MabIgX® platform technology for asset identification and selection. We received an upfront cash payment of $5 million upon execution of this option agreement. In connection with the option agreement, SIBV made an equity investment whereby we issued 801,820 shares of our restricted common stock in a private placement to SIBV for total gross proceeds of $10 million.
In September 2019, we entered into a License, Development and Commercialization Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with Serum AMR Products (“SAMR”). Pursuant to the License Agreement, we received upfront payments totaling $15 million, of which $5 million was received in July 2019 through the option agreement referred to above, and may receive milestone payments and royalty-based payments from SAMR if certain milestones and sales levels as defined in the License Agreement are met.
Given the equity investment by SIBV was negotiated in conjunction with the option agreement, which resulted in the execution of the License Agreement, all arrangements were evaluated as a single agreement and amounts were allocated to the elements of the arrangement based on their fair value. We allocated the proceeds received from the sale of the restricted common stock and upfront payment from the License Agreement, net of issuance and contract costs, of approximately $22.5 million accordingly:
•
we recorded approximately $5.0 million, which represented the fair value of the restricted common stock issued of $5.4 million, net of $441,000 of issuance costs, to stockholders’ equity within our consolidated balance sheet;
•
we recorded approximately $19.6 million to deferred revenue based on the $15 million from upfront payments under the License Agreement and approximately $4.6 million from the equity allocation; and
•
we capitalized approximately $2.1 million to contract costs, which consists of approximately $376,000 issuance costs from the equity allocation and approximately $1.7 million in other direct costs to obtain the License Agreement.
In accordance with ASC 606, we determined that no performance obligations were satisfied through December 31, 2020, and therefore, no revenue related to the License Agreement was recognized for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP.
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported expenses during the reported periods. We evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. Such estimates include those related to the evaluation of our ability to continue as a going concern, our best estimate of standalone selling price of revenue deliverables, useful live of long lived assets, classification of deferred revenue, income taxes, assumptions used in the Black Scholes Merton (“BSM”) model to calculate the fair value of stock based compensation, deferred tax asset valuation allowances, and preclinical study and clinical trial accruals. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
We define our critical accounting policies as those accounting principles generally accepted in the United States that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles. Our critical accounting policies are primarily revenue recognition and research and development expenses and related accruals. We believe the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are as follows:
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue based on Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), which applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards, such as leases, insurance, collaboration arrangements and financial instruments.
To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that we determine are within the scope of ASC 606, we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue at a point in time, or over time, as the entity satisfies performance obligations. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that we will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services we transfer to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract, determine those that are performance obligations, and assess whether each promised good or service is distinct. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.
As part of the accounting for customer arrangements, we must use judgment to determine: a) the number of performance obligations based on the determination under step (ii) above; b) the transaction
price under step (iii) above; and c) the standalone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract for the allocation of the transaction price in step (iv) above. We use judgment to determine whether milestones or other variable consideration should be included in the transaction price.
The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. In developing the standalone price for a performance obligation, we consider applicable market conditions and relevant entity-specific factors, including factors that were contemplated in negotiating the agreement with the customer and estimated costs. We recognize revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied. We receive payments from our customers based on payment schedules established in each contract. We record any amounts received prior to satisfying the revenue recognition criteria as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet. Amounts recognized as revenue, but not yet received or invoiced are recorded within other receivables on the consolidated balance sheet. Amounts are recorded as other receivables on the consolidated balance sheet when our right to consideration is unconditional. We do not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component if the expectation at contract inception is such that the period between payment by the customer and the transfer of a majority of the promised goods or services to the customer will be one year or less.
Under the Development Program Letter Agreement with CFF (the “CFF Agreement”), entered into in December 2016 and amended in November 2018 to support funding for the development of our Inhaled Gallium Citrate Anti-Infective program, we recognized revenue of approximately $1.0 million for both years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. We expect that any revenue we generate for the foreseeable future will fluctuate from period to period as a result of the timing of when performance obligations and variable consideration criteria under the contract are satisfied.
Research and Development Expenses
We recognize research and development expenses to operations as they are incurred. Our research and development expenses consist primarily of:
•
salaries and related overhead expenses, which include stock-based compensation and benefits for personnel in research and development functions;
•
fees paid to consultants and contract research organizations, or CROs, including in connection with our preclinical studies and clinical trials and other related clinical trial fees, such as for investigator grants, patient screening, laboratory work, clinical trial material management and statistical compilation and analyses;
•
costs related to acquiring and manufacturing clinical trial materials;
•
costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements; and
•
payments related to licensed products and technologies.
Costs for certain development activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information and data provided to us by our vendors and clinical sites. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in future periods for use in research and development activities are deferred and capitalized. The capitalized amounts are then expensed as the related goods are delivered or when the services are performed.
We plan to increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue to develop our therapeutic programs, and subject to the availability of additional funding, further advance the development of our therapeutic candidates for additional indications and begin to conduct clinical trials.
The process of conducting the necessary clinical research to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming, and the successful development of our therapeutic candidates is highly uncertain. As a result, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when and to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any of our therapeutic candidates.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs related to executive, finance, corporate development and administrative support functions, including stock-based compensation expenses and benefits for personnel in general and administrative functions. Other significant, general and administrative expenses include rent, accounting and legal services, obtaining and maintaining patents or other intellectual property rights, the cost of various consultants, occupancy costs, insurance premiums and information systems costs.
We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase as we continue to operate as a public company, continue to conduct our clinical trials and prepare for commercialization. We believe that these increases will likely include increased costs for director and officer liability insurance, costs related to the hiring of additional personnel to support product commercialization efforts and increased fees for outside consultants, attorneys and accountants. We also expect to incur increased costs to comply with corporate governance, internal controls, investor relations and disclosures, and similar requirements applicable to public companies.
Interest Income, Net
Interest income, net consists primarily of interest earned on our cash balances, partially offset by interest expense resulting from our PPP Loan.
Stock-Based Compensation
We recognize compensation expense for all stock-based awards based on the grant-date estimated fair values, which we determine using the BSM option pricing model, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the award. We account for forfeitures as they occur.
The BSM option pricing model incorporates various highly sensitive assumptions, including the fair value of our common stock, expected volatility, expected term and risk-free interest rates. The weighted average expected life of options was calculated using the simplified method as prescribed by the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin, Topic 14 (“SAB Topic 14”). This decision was based on the lack of relevant historical data due to our limited historical experience. In addition, due to our limited historical data, the estimated volatility also reflects the application of SAB Topic 14, incorporating the historical volatility of comparable companies whose stock prices are publicly available. The risk-free interest rate for the periods within the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant. The dividend yield was zero, as we have never declared or paid dividends and have no plans to do so in the foreseeable future.
Income Taxes
We account for income taxes under the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, no income tax expense or benefit was recognized, primarily due to a full valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax asset
We assess all material positions taken in any income tax return, including all significant uncertain positions, in all tax years that are still subject to assessment or challenge by the relevant taxing authorities. Assessing an uncertain tax position begins with the initial determination of the position’s sustainability and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. At each balance sheet date, unresolved uncertain tax positions must be reassessed, and we determine whether (i) the factors underlying the sustainability assertion have changed and (ii) the amount of the recognized benefit is still appropriate. The recognition and measurement of tax benefits requires significant judgment. Judgments concerning the recognition and measurement of a tax benefit might change as new information becomes available.
Going Concern
We assess and determine our ability to continue as a going concern under the provisions of ASC 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern, which requires us to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that our annual and interim consolidated financial statements are issued. Certain additional financial statement disclosures are required if such conditions or events are identified. If and when an entity’s liquidation becomes imminent, financial statements should be prepared under the liquidation basis of accounting.
Determining the extent, if any, to which conditions or events raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, or the extent to which mitigating plans sufficiently alleviate any such substantial doubt, as well as whether or not liquidation is imminent, requires significant judgment by us. We have determined that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for at least the one-year period following our consolidated financial statements issuance date, which have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. We have not made any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of us to continue as a going concern.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):
Grant Revenue. Grant revenue remained fairly constant at approximately $1.0 million for both years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 related to the recognition of revenue for milestones achieved under the award from the CFF during 2020 and 2019.
Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses decreased by approximately $7.1 million from $24.1 million for year ended December 31, 2019 to $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 due primarily to:
•
a decrease of approximately $5.4 million in spending on clinical trial activities and drug manufacturing expenses for the Phase 2 study of our AR-105 program that was terminated during 2019;
•
a decrease of approximately $1.2 million in drug manufacturing expenses for the Phase 3 study of our AR-301 program;
•
a decrease of approximately $400,000 in spending on other research and development activities;
•
a decrease of approximately $200,000 in personnel, consulting and other related costs; and
•
a decrease of approximately $200,000 in spending on clinical trial activities for the Phase 1/2a study of our AR-501 program because the Phase 1 portion of the study ended in the second quarter of 2020.
These decreases were partially offset by:
•
an increase of approximately $300,000 in spending on research and development activities for our COVID-19 programs.
General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by approximately $419,000 from $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 due primarily to increases in directors’ and officers’ related liabilities insurance expense, professional service fees, and rent expense due to the Company entering into a new facility lease during the fourth quarter of 2020. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in patent related fees and Delaware franchise taxes.
Interest Income, Net. Interest income, net decreased by approximately $280,000 from $357,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $77,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease is primarily due to lower interest rates and a lower average cash balance during 2020 as compared to 2019.
Share of Loss in Equity Method Investment. Loss from equity method investment decreased by approximately $942,000 from $951,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $9,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as our share of loss from our minority interest calculated under the equity method was limited to the reduction of the net book value of the investment to zero as of March 31,2020.
Liquidity, Capital Resources and Going Concern
As of December 31, 2020 we had approximately $8.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and had an accumulated deficit of approximately $123.1 million.
In July 2019, we issued and sold 801,820 shares of restricted common stock in a private placement to SIBV, and received total gross proceeds of $10 million, and after deducting commissions and offering costs of approximately $816,000, the net proceeds were approximately $9.2 million. In addition, we received an upfront cash payment of $5 million upon the execution of an option agreement with SIBV and received an upfront payment of $10 million in October 2019 in connection with a License Agreement we executed in September 2019 with SAMR, and after deducting commissions of approximately $1.2 million, the net proceeds were approximately $13.8 million.
In September 2019, we entered into a Common Stock Sales Agreement (the “ATM Agreement”) with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. (“Cantor”) under which we may offer and sell, from time to time, at our sole discretion, shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $25.0 million through Cantor as our sales agent. We will pay Cantor a commission of up to three percent (3.0%) of the gross sales proceeds of any common stock sold through Cantor under the ATM Agreement, and also provided Cantor with customary indemnification rights. Our registration statement on Form S-3 contemplated under the ATM Agreement was declared effective by the SEC on September 5, 2019. As a result of the limitations of General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3, and in accordance with the terms of the ATM Agreement, we filed a prospectus supplement on May 14, 2020 that registered the offer and sale of shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $22.0 million from time to time through Cantor. As of December 31, 2020, we have sold 7,883 shares of common stock under the ATM Agreement for gross proceeds of approximately $64,000, and after deducting commissions, net proceeds were approximately $62,000.
In May 2020, we received a loan in the form of a note, from Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”) in the aggregate amount of approximately $715,000 (the “Loan”), pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”). The PPP, established as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”), provides for loans to qualifying businesses for amounts up to 2.5 times of the average monthly payroll expenses of the qualifying business. The loans and accrued interest may be forgiven as long as the borrower uses the loan proceeds for eligible purposes, including payroll, benefits, rent and utilities,
and maintains its payroll levels. The amount of loan forgiveness will be reduced if the borrower terminates employees or reduces salaries during the covered period. The Loan is payable over two years at an interest rate of 1% per annum, with an estimated deferral of payments until mid-2021. We are required to pay principal and interest on the Loan in equal monthly installments estimated to begin mid-2021 and the outstanding interest balance accrued during the deferral period is to be paid on the maturity date, which is May 1, 2022. We believe in good faith that we met the loan forgiveness eligibility requirements of the PPP Loan. Our Loan forgiveness application was submitted to the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) in October 2020 and we expect to meet the forgiveness criteria. Since the forgiveness of the Loan is outside of our control, we have accounted for our PPP Loan as debt. If the PPP Loan is ultimately forgiven and we are legally released from being the Loan’s primary obligor, the extinguishment of the liability will be recognized in our consolidated statement of operations as an extinguishment of debt gain.
In October 2020, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “October 2020 Purchase Agreement”) with certain institutional investors (the “Purchasers”), pursuant to which we agreed to offer, issue and sell to the Purchasers, (i) in a registered direct offering, an aggregate of 1,134,470 shares (the “Shares”) of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Common Stock”) and (ii) in a concurrent private placement, Series A warrants (the “Series A Warrants”) and Series B warrants (the “Series B Warrants” and collectively, with the Series A Warrants, the “Warrants”) to purchase up to an aggregate 567,234 shares (the “Warrant Shares”) of Common Stock, for aggregate gross proceeds to us of approximately $8.5 million, before deducting estimated offering expenses payable by us. We agreed to pay Arcadia Securities, LLC a fee equal to 3.5% of the aggregate purchase price of the shares of its common stock sold in the offering to certain of the investors. In addition, we agreed to pay Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. a fee equal to 3.5% of the aggregate purchase price of the shares of its common stock sold in the offering.
The combined purchase price for each Share, together with one Series A Warrant and one Series B Warrant, was $7.4925. The Series A Warrants have an exercise price of $7.43 per share, are exercisable six months from the date of issuance, and expire three and a half years from the date they become exercisable. The Series B Warrants have an exercise price of $9.00 per share, are exercisable six months from the date of issuance, and expire three and a half years from the date they become exercisable. In addition, the Series B Warrants are redeemable by us at $0.01 per share upon the price of our common stock closing at $9.00 or more over five (5) consecutive trading days. The exercise price of the Warrants and Warrant Shares are subject to adjustment in the event of any stock dividends and splits, reverse stock split, recapitalization, reorganization or similar transaction, as described in the Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants, respectively.
In March 2021, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with certain institutional and individual investors, pursuant to which we agreed to offer, issue and sell to these investors, in a registered direct offering, an aggregate of 1,037,405 shares of our Common Stock for aggregate gross proceeds to us of approximately $7.0 million, before deducting estimated offering expenses payable by us.
In addition, in March 2021 we issued 124,789 shares of unregistered Common Stock to the Purchasers in our October 2020 offering pursuant to the anti-dilutive provisions of the October 2020 Purchase Agreement.
We have had recurring losses from operations since inception and negative cash flows from operating activities during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. We anticipate that we will continue to generate operating losses and use cash in operations through the foreseeable future. Management plans to finance operations through equity or debt financings or other capital sources, including potential collaborations or other strategic transactions. There can be no assurances that, in the event that we require additional financing, such financing will be available on terms which are favorable to us, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional funding to meet our working capital needs in the future, we will be forced to delay or reduce the scope of our research programs and/or limit or cease our operations. We believe that our current available cash and cash equivalents, along with the additional cash received in March 2021 from an equity offering and a license agreement, will not be sufficient to fund our planned expenditures and meet our obligations for at least the one-year period following our consolidated financial statements issuance date. There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern unless we are able to successfully raise additional capital.
Cash Flows
Our net cash flow from operating, investing and financing activities for the periods below were as follows (in thousands):
Cash Flows from Operating Activities.
Net cash used in operating activities was approximately $20.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was primarily due to our net loss of approximately $22.3 million, an increase of approximately $488,000 related to capitalized contract costs, resulting from the SAMR License Agreement entered into in 2019, a decrease of approximately $756,000 in accrued liabilities and other, a decrease of approximately $83,000 in accounts payables, and an increase of approximately $144,000 in other receivables.

Net cash used in investing activities of approximately $174,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 was due to the purchase of equipment, primarily for diagnostic use in clinical trials.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities.
Net cash provided by financing activities of approximately $8.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 was due to net proceeds received from a registered direct offering of our common stock and a concurrent private placement of common stock warrants of approximately $7.9 million, proceeds received from the PPP Loan of approximately $715,000, net proceeds received from our ATM Agreement of approximately $62,000, and net proceeds received from stock option exercises of approximately $14,000.

Future Funding Requirements
To date, we have generated revenue from grants and contract services performed and funding from the issuance of convertible preferred stock and common stock sales. We do not know when, or if, we will generate any revenue from our development stage therapeutic programs. We do not expect to generate any revenue from sales of our therapeutic candidates unless and until we obtain regulatory approval. At the same time, we expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing development activities, particularly as we continue the research, development and clinical trials of, and seek regulatory approval for, our therapeutic candidates. We expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. In addition, subject to obtaining regulatory approval of any of our therapeutic candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses for product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. We anticipate that we will need additional funding in connection with our continuing operations.
Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:
•
the progress, costs, results and timing of our clinical trials;
•
FDA acceptance, if any, of our therapies for infectious diseases and for other potential indications;
•
the outcome, costs and timing of seeking and obtaining FDA and any other regulatory approvals;
•
the number and characteristics of product candidates that we pursue, including our product candidates in preclinical development;
•
the ability of our product candidates to progress through clinical development successfully;
•
our need to expand our research and development activities;
•
the costs of acquiring, licensing or investing in businesses, products, product candidates and technologies;
•
our ability to maintain, expand and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio, including the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make, or that we may receive, in connection with the licensing, filing, prosecution, defense and enforcement of any patents or other intellectual property rights;
•
the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operations;
•
our need and ability to hire additional management and scientific, medical and administrative personnel;
•
the effect of competing technological and market developments; and
•
our need to implement additional internal systems and infrastructure, including financial and reporting systems.
Until such time that we can generate meaningful revenue from the sales of approved therapies and products, if ever, we expect to finance our operating activities through public or private equity or debt financings, government or other third-party funding, and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements or a combination of these approaches. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of our common stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include conversion discounts or covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through government or other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, or strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
During the periods presented we did not have, nor do we currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined under the rules of the SEC.
JOBS Act Accounting Election
The JOBS Act permits an “emerging growth company” such as us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. We are choosing to take advantage of this provision and, as a result, we will adopt the extended transition period available under the JOBS Act until the earlier of the date we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided under the JOBS Act.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Information regarding recent accounting pronouncements applicable to us is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
