Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing transformative cell therapies for patients with cancer, infectious diseases and other serious conditions. We use our proprietary technology, Cell Squeeze, to physically squeeze cells through a microfluidic chip, temporarily opening the cell membrane and enabling biologic material of interest, or cargo, to diffuse into the cell. This technology allows us to create a broad pipeline of product candidates for different diseases. We believe our Cell Squeeze technology has the potential to create well-tolerated cell therapies that can provide therapeutic benefit for patients. Our potential benefits include accelerated timelines with production time under 24 hours, compared to four to six weeks for other existing cell therapies, improved patient experience by eliminating the need for pre-conditioning or lengthy hospital stays, and broadened therapeutic impact. Our goal is to use the Cell Squeeze approach to establish a new paradigm for cell therapies. We are using Cell Squeeze to create multiple cell therapy platforms focused on directing specific immune responses. Our most advanced platform in development, SQZ Antigen Presenting Cells or SQZ APCs, is currently in a Phase 1 trial in HPV+ tumors. Our additional platforms currently in development are SQZ Activating Antigen Carriers or SQZ AACs and SQZ Tolerizing Antigen Carriers or SQZ TACs. We are leveraging each of these platforms to create differentiated product candidates that have applicability across multiple disease areas.
Since our inception, we have focused substantially all of our resources on building our Cell Squeeze technology, establishing and protecting our intellectual property portfolio, conducting research and development activities, developing our manufacturing process and manufacturing product candidate materials, preparing for and initiating clinical trials of our product candidates, organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital and providing general and administrative support for these operations. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. To date, we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from sales of common and preferred stock, payments received under our collaboration agreements with Hoffman-La Roche Inc. and F. Hoffman La Roche Ltd., or together, Roche, and proceeds from borrowings under a convertible promissory note, which converted into shares of preferred stock. Through December 31, 2020, we have funded our operations from sales of common and preferred stock, upfront and milestone payments under our collaboration agreements with Roche and with proceeds from our initial public offering, or IPO of common stock. In November 2020, we completed our IPO pursuant to which we issued and sold 5,073,529 shares of common stock, inclusive of 661,764 shares sold by us pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares. We received aggregate net proceeds of approximately $75.5 million from the IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, but before deducting offering costs payable by us, which were $2.6 million. In February 2021, we completed a public offering pursuant to which we issued and sold 3,000,000 shares of common stock. We received aggregate net proceeds of approximately $56.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, but before deducting offering costs payable by us, which are estimated to be $0.8 million.
Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our ability to generate any product revenue or product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. We reported net losses of $50.5 million and $32.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $126.8 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years. We expect that our expenses and capital requirements will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly if and as we:
•
conduct clinical trials for our product candidates, including our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of SQZ-PBMC-HPV and SQZ-AAC-HPV;
•
further develop our Cell Squeeze technology;
•
continue to develop additional product candidates;
•
maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;
•
hire additional clinical, scientific manufacturing and commercial personnel;
•
expand external and/or establish internal commercial manufacturing sources and secure supply chain capacity sufficient to provide commercial quantities of any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval;
•
acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies;
•
seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;
•
establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval; and
•
add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel to support our product development, clinical execution and planned future commercialization efforts, as well as to support our operation as a public company.
We will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant expenses related to developing our commercialization capability to support product sales, marketing and distribution.
As a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when, needed, we would have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with cell therapy product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate product sales, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.
We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through the first half of 2023. See “-Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
Impact of the COVID-19 Coronavirus
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, which causes the disease known as COVID-19, was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. Since then, COVID-19 coronavirus has spread globally. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic and the U.S. government-imposed travel restrictions on travel between the United States, Europe and certain other countries. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact personnel at third-party manufacturing facilities or the availability or cost of materials, which would disrupt our supply chain, and it has affected and may continue to affect our ability to enroll patients in and timely complete our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trials of SQZ-PBMC-HPV and SQZ-AAC-HPV and delay the initiation of any future clinical trials, disrupt regulatory activities, or have other adverse effects on our business and operations. For example, we have experienced delays in receiving supplies of raw materials for our preclinical activities due to the impact of COVID-19 on our suppliers’ ability to timely manufacture these materials, and we have experienced an increase in the transportation cost of our product candidates due to the decreased availability of commercial flights. In addition, we have experienced delays in opening clinical trial sites and sites that are open may also have challenges enrolling patients due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, some staff that are required to conduct certain testing, such as biopsies, at our clinical sites or at third-party vendors have been required to stay at home or have been reallocated to other activities, resulting in such tests not being properly or timely performed or being delayed. In response to the public health directives and to help reduce the risk to our employees, we took precautionary measures, including implementing work-from-home policies for our administrative employees and staggered work times for our lab employees. We plan to continue these measures and are assessing when and how to resume normal operations. The effects of the public health directives and our work-from-home policies may negatively impact productivity, disrupt our business and delay our clinical programs and timelines and future clinical trials, the magnitude of which will depend, in part, on the length and severity of the restrictions and other limitations on our ability to conduct our business in the ordinary course. These and similar, and perhaps more severe, disruptions in our operations could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition, including our ability to obtain financing.
The pandemic has already caused significant disruptions in the financial markets, and may continue to cause such disruptions, which could impact our ability to raise additional funds to support our operations. Moreover, the pandemic has significantly impacted economies worldwide and could result in adverse effects on our business and operations.
We are monitoring the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial statements. To date, we have not incurred impairment losses in the carrying values of our assets as a result of the pandemic and we are not aware of any specific related event or circumstance that would require us to revise our estimates reflected in our consolidated financial statements. We cannot be certain what the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will be on our business and people. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity, including planned and future clinical trials and research and development costs, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain, including as a result of new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19, the actions taken to contain or treat it, and the duration and intensity of the related effects.
Components of Our Results of Operations
Revenue
To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to do so for the next several years. All of our revenue to date has been derived from three collaboration agreements with Roche, which we entered into in 2015, 2017 and 2018, and, to a lesser extent, from government grants.
If our development efforts for our product candidates are successful and result in regulatory approval or license or additional collaboration agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from product sales, payments from additional collaboration or license agreements that we may enter into with third parties, or any combination thereof. We expect that our revenue for the next several years will be derived primarily from our collaboration agreements with Roche as well as any additional collaborations that we may enter into in the future. We cannot provide assurance as to the timing of future milestone or royalty payments or that we will receive any of these payments at all.
Collaboration Revenue
2017 License and Collaboration Agreement with Roche
In April 2017, we entered into a second license and collaboration agreement with Roche, or the 2017 Roche Agreement, to allow Roche to use our Cell Squeeze technology to enable gene editing of immune cells to discover new targets in cancer immunotherapy. The 2017 Roche Agreement includes several licenses granted by Roche to us and by us to Roche in order to conduct a specified research program in accordance with a specified research plan.
Under the agreement, we received an upfront payment of $5.0 million as a technology access fee and are entitled to (i) payments of up to $1.0 million as reimbursement for our research costs; (ii) milestone payments of up to $7.0 million upon the achievement of specified development milestones; and (iii) annual maintenance fees ranging from $0.5 million to $0.9 million for each year following the fifth anniversary of the effective date, subject to specified prepayment discounts.
We assessed our accounting for the 2017 Roche Agreement under ASC 606 and identified the following promises under the agreement: (i) a non-exclusive license granted to Roche to perform research related to and use our Cell Squeeze technology for gene editing of immune cells; (ii) specified research and development services related to gene editing of immune cells through the research term; (iii) manufacturing activities to support the specified research plan; and (iv) participation on a joint research committee, or JRC. We concluded at the outset of the 2017 Roche Agreement that the first three promises should be combined into a single performance obligation and that the JRC participation had an immaterial impact on the accounting model.
We received the upfront payment of $5.0 million in April 2017 upon execution of the 2017 Roche Agreement. We also received the payments of $0.5 million in each of 2017 and 2018 related to our reimbursable research costs. In addition, during the third quarter of 2018, we received a payment of $2.0 million following the achievement of the first development milestone under the agreement related to Roche’s validation of preclinical proof of concept.
We recognize revenue associated with the performance obligation as the research and development services are provided using an input method, based on the cumulative costs incurred compared to the total estimated costs expected to be incurred to satisfy the performance obligation. The amounts received from Roche that have not yet been recognized as revenue are deferred as a contract liability in our consolidated balance sheet and will be recognized over the remaining research and development period until the performance obligation is satisfied.
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no significant changes in the total estimated costs expected to be incurred to satisfy the performance obligation under the 2017 Roche Agreement and we recognized revenue of $0.5 million and $0.7 million, respectively, under the 2017 Roche Agreement. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded as a contract liability, deferred revenue related to the 2017 Roche Agreement of $1.2 million and $1.7 million, respectively, of which $0.8 million and $0.7 million, respectively, were current liabilities. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the research and development services related to the performance obligation were expected to be performed over a remaining period of approximately 1.5 and 2.5 years, respectively.
2018 License and Collaboration Agreement with Roche
In October 2018, we entered into a third license and collaboration agreement with Roche, or the 2018 Roche Agreement, to jointly develop certain products based on mononuclear antigen presenting cells, or APCs, including human papilloma virus, or HPV, using our SQZ APC platform for the treatment of oncology indications. We granted Roche a non-exclusive license to our intellectual property, and Roche granted us a non-exclusive license to its and its affiliates’ intellectual property for the purpose of performing research activities. In connection with this agreement, the parties terminated the original Roche Agreement entered into in 2015.
Under the 2018 Roche Agreement, Roche was granted option rights to obtain an exclusive license to develop APC products or products derived from the collaboration programs on a product-by-product basis in oncology and to develop a Tumor Cell Lysate, or TCL, product. For each of the APC products and TCL product, once Roche exercises its option and pays a specified incremental amount, Roche will receive worldwide, exclusive commercialization rights for the licensed products, subject to our alternating option to retain U.S. APC commercialization rights. Through December 31, 2020, Roche had not exercised any of its options under the 2018 Roche Agreement.
Under the 2018 Roche Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $45.0 million and are eligible to receive (i) reimbursement of a mid double-digit percentage of our development costs; (ii) aggregate milestone payments on a product-by-product basis of up to $1.6 billion upon the achievement of specified milestones, consisting of up to $217.0 million of development milestone payments, up to $240.0 million of regulatory milestone payments and up to $1.2 billion of sales milestone payments; and (iii) tiered royalties on annual net sales of APC and TCL products licensed under the agreement at specified rates ranging from a mid single-digit percentage to a percentage in the mid twenties. We received the upfront payment of $45.0 million in October 2018 upon execution of the agreement. In addition, during the second quarter of 2019, we received a payment of $10.0 million following the achievement of the first development milestone under the 2018 Roche Agreement related to submission by us of preclinical data to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and during the first quarter of
2020, we received a payment of $20.0 million following the achievement of the second development milestone under the 2018 Roche Agreement related to first-patient dosing in a Phase 1 clinical trial. For additional information on the 2018 Roche Agreement, see “Business-Collaboration, Research and License Agreements-Roche Collaboration.”
We assessed our accounting for the 2018 Roche Agreement in accordance with ASC 606 and identified the following promises under the agreement: (i) a non-exclusive license granted to Roche to use our intellectual property and collaboration compounds to conduct research activities related to the research plans under the 2018 Roche Agreement; (ii) specified research and development services related to HPV through Phase 1 clinical trials under a specified research plan; (iii) manufacturing of our SQZ APC platform and equipment in order to support the HPV research plan; (iv) specified research and development services on next-generation APCs under a research plan; (v) specified research and development services on TCL under a research plan; and (vi) participation on a joint steering committee, or JSC. We concluded at the outset of the 2018 Roche Agreement that there were three performance obligations under the agreement: (1) the license to our intellectual property, the research and development activities related to HPV through Phase 1 clinical trials under a specified research plan, and the manufacturing of our SQZ APC platform and equipment in order to support the HPV research plan, or the first performance obligation; (2) the license to our intellectual property and the research and development activities on next-generation APCs, or the second performance obligation; and (3) the license to our intellectual property and the research and development activities on TCL, or the third performance obligation. We also concluded that the JSC participation had an immaterial impact on the accounting model.
In addition, we determined that the upfront payment of $45.0 million as well as the reimbursable costs of $10.8 million estimated by us constituted the entirety of the consideration to be included in the transaction price. This transaction price of $55.8 million was initially allocated to the three performance obligations based on the relative standalone selling price of each obligation. The potential milestone payments that we may be eligible to receive were excluded from the transaction price at the outset of the arrangement. We reevaluate the transaction price at the end of each reporting period and as uncertain events are resolved or other changes in circumstances occur, and, if necessary, we will adjust our estimate of the transaction price.
During the first quarter of 2019, we became entitled to receive a payment of $10.0 million upon the achievement of the first development milestone under the 2018 Roche Agreement, which was related to submission by us of preclinical data to the FDA. The $10.0 million amount was added to our estimate of the transaction price as of the first quarter of 2019, when we determined that achievement of the milestone was “most likely” and that it was probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized would not occur, and, as a result, we recorded a cumulative catch-up adjustment to collaboration revenue of $1.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2019 and the year ended December 31, 2019.
In October 2019, we received clearance from the FDA for our investigational new drug application, or IND, for our lead clinical program under the 2018 Roche Agreement. As a result of this IND clearance and progress made toward beginning clinical trials, we concluded as of December 31, 2019 that the achievement in the first quarter of 2020 of a milestone resulting in receipt of a payment of $20.0 million due upon first-patient dosing in a Phase 1 clinical trial under the terms of the 2018 Roche Agreement was “most likely” and that it was probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized would not occur. We therefore included the $20.0 million payment in our estimate of the transaction price for the 2018 Roche Agreement in the fourth quarter of 2019 and recorded a cumulative catch-up adjustment to collaboration revenue of $5.0 million during the three months and year ended December 31, 2019.
During the fourth quarter of 2019, we evaluated our overall program priorities and determined that in 2020 we would continue to focus our resources on progressing the specified APC programs related to the 2018 Roche Agreement as well as our AAC and TAC platforms. As a result of our continuing focus on these specific programs, we reduced the level of priority of the TCL research activities under the 2018 Roche Agreement and expect to perform such TCL research activities over a longer time period than as originally expected under the research plan of the agreement.
We separately recognize revenue associated with each of the three performance obligations as the research, development and manufacturing services are provided using an input method, based on the cumulative costs incurred compared to the total estimated costs expected to be incurred to satisfy each performance obligation. The amounts received from Roche that have not yet been recognized as revenue are deferred as a contract liability in our consolidated balance sheet and will be recognized over the remaining research and development period until each performance obligation is satisfied.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the total estimated costs expected to be incurred to satisfy the performance obligations under the 2018 Roche Agreement increased by $7.3 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the total estimated costs expected to be incurred to satisfy the performance obligations increased by $21.0 million. We recognized revenue of $20.5 million and $18.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, under the 2018 Roche Agreement. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded as a contract liability deferred revenue related to the 2018 Roche Agreement of $44.0 million and $43.2 million, respectively, of which $24.7 million and $15.7 million, respectively, were current liabilities. As of December 31, 2020, the research and development services related to the first and second performance obligations were expected to be performed over remaining periods ranging from 1.0 years to 1.5 years. The expected remaining period of performance of our research and development services related to the third performance obligation is not currently determinable until TCL research activities resume, or the 2018 Roche Agreement is modified by us and Roche.
For additional information regarding our accounting for the three collaboration agreements with Roche, see “-Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates-Revenue Recognition for License and Collaboration Arrangements” and “Business-Collaboration, Research and License Agreements-Roche Collaboration.”
Grant Revenue
We generate revenue from government contracts with the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation, which reimburse us for certain allowable costs for funded projects. Revenue from government grants is recognized as the qualifying expenses related to the contracts are incurred, provided that there is reasonable assurance of recoverability. Revenue recognized upon incurring qualifying expenses in advance of receipt of funding is recorded as unbilled receivables, a component of prepaid expenses and other current assets, in our consolidated balance sheets.
Operating Expenses
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including development of our product candidates and costs incurred under our collaboration arrangements with Roche, which include:
•
employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits and stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development functions;
•
expenses incurred in connection with the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates and research programs, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants, contractors and contract research organizations, or CROs;
•
the costs of developing and scaling our manufacturing process and of manufacturing our product candidates for use in our preclinical studies and clinical trials, including the costs under agreements with third parties, such as consultants, contractors and contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs;
•
laboratory and consumable materials and research materials;
•
facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and utilities; and
•
payments made under third-party licensing agreements.
We expense research and development costs as incurred. Nonrefundable advance payments that we make for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. The prepaid amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed, or when it is no longer expected that the goods will be delivered or the services rendered. Upfront payments under license agreements are expensed upon receipt of the license, and annual maintenance fees under license agreements are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Milestone payments under license agreements are accrued, with a corresponding expense being recognized, in the period in which the milestone is determined to be probable of achievement and the related amount is reasonably estimable.
Our direct research and development expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis and consist of external costs and fees paid to consultants, contractors, CMOs and CROs in connection with our preclinical and clinical development and manufacturing activities. Such program costs also include the external costs of laboratory and consumable materials and costs of raw materials that are directly attributable to and incurred for any single program. We do not allocate employee costs, costs associated with our platform development and discovery efforts, payments made under third-party licensing agreements, costs of laboratory supplies and consumable materials that are not directly attributable to any single program, and facilities expenses, including rent, depreciation and other indirect costs, to specific product development programs because these costs are deployed across multiple programs and our platform technology and, as such, are not separately classified.
Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially in connection with our planned preclinical and clinical development activities in the near term and in the future, particularly should Roche determine not to exercise its options and we decide to continue clinical development of a product candidate. At this time, we cannot accurately estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the preclinical and clinical development of any of our product candidates. The successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, including the following:
•
the timing and progress of preclinical and clinical development activities;
•
the number and scope of preclinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue;
•
raising additional funds necessary to complete preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates;
•
the progress of the development efforts of parties with whom we have entered, or may enter, into collaboration arrangements;
•
our ability to maintain our current research and development programs and to establish new ones;
•
our ability to establish new licensing or collaboration arrangements;
•
the successful initiation and completion of clinical trials with safety, tolerability and efficacy profiles that are satisfactory to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or any comparable foreign regulatory authority;
•
the receipt and related terms of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;
•
the availability of specialty raw materials for use in production of our product candidates;
•
our ability to consistently manufacture our product candidates for use in clinical trials;
•
our ability to establish and operate a manufacturing facility, or secure manufacturing supply through relationships with third parties;
•
our ability to obtain and maintain patents, trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity, both in the United States and internationally; and
•
our ability to protect our rights in our intellectual property portfolio.
A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. In addition, we may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for any of our product candidates.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include direct and allocated facility-related costs as well as professional fees for legal, patent, consulting, investor and public relations, accounting and audit services. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our continued research activities and development of our product candidates. We also anticipate that we will incur increased accounting, audit, legal, regulatory, compliance and director and officer insurance costs as well as investor and public relations expenses associated with operating as a public company.
Other Income (Expense)
Interest Income
Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash equivalents and marketable securities balances. We expect that our interest income will increase as we invest the cash received from the net proceeds from our IPO in November 2020 and our public offering in February 2021.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net consists of miscellaneous income and expense unrelated to our core operations.
Income Taxes
Since our inception, we have not recorded any income tax benefits for the net losses we have incurred in each year or for our earned research and development tax credits, as we believe, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all of our net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards will not be realized. As of December 31, 2020, we had U.S. federal NOL carryforwards of $73.7 million, which may be available to offset future taxable income, of which $11.3 million begin to expire in 2034 and of which $62.4 million do not expire but are (for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020) generally limited in their usage to an annual deduction equal to 80% of annual taxable income. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, we had state NOL carryforwards of $71.9 million, which may be available to offset future taxable income and begin to expire in 2035. As of December 31, 2020, we also had U.S. federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $6.3 million and $3.8 million which will begin to expire in 2034 and 2029, respectively. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets at each balance sheet date.
On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, was passed by the U.S. Congress and signed into United States law. The CARES Act, among other things, includes certain provisions for individuals and corporations (including a suspension on the application of the 80% limitation described above for taxable years beginning prior to January 1, 2021), and technical amendments for qualified improvement property, or QIP. While we accelerated tax depreciation expenses due to the technical amendments made by the CARES Act to QIP, this and other CARES Act benefits did not materially impact our income tax provisions in the periods presented.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Revenue
Total revenue was $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $20.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in total revenue of $0.9 million was due to the increase in collaboration revenue of $1.7 million, which was offset by a decrease in grant revenue. Collaboration revenue increased by $1.7 million due to an increase in research and development services performed by us under those agreements. We recognize revenue for those arrangements using an input measure, comparing our cumulative costs incurred to our total estimated costs of the research, development and manufacturing activities, as applicable, on each program. In the first quarter of 2019, we became entitled to receive a payment of $10.0 million upon the achievement of the first development milestone under the 2018 Roche Agreement, of which $2.5 million was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we included the $20.0 million payment due upon the then-expected achievement of the second development milestone under the 2018 Roche Agreement in our estimate of the transaction price for the 2018 Roche Agreement. As a result, we recorded a cumulative catch-up adjustment to collaboration revenue of $5.0 million during the three months and year ended December 31, 2019. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized total revenue of $20.5 million and $18.6 million, respectively, under the 2018 Roche Agreement (inclusive of the $2.5 million and $5.0 million amounts described above). During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized total revenue of $0.5 million and $0.7 million, respectively, under the 2017 Roche Agreement.
Grant revenue decreased by $0.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2020. Grant revenue decreased in 2020 because we did not yet complete all the steps that would allow us to submit a request for reimbursements of qualifying expenses under our existing government grants during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses were $51.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $36.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The direct costs related to our SQZ-PBMC-HPV program increased by $4.2 million primarily due to our Phase 1 clinical trial of SQZ-PBMC-HPV in patients with HPV, which was initiated in January 2020. These direct costs in the year ended December 31, 2020 included a full year of the costs of a dedicated suite at a contract manufacturing as compared to three months of similar costs in 2019. Direct costs incurred for our SQZ-AAC-HPV program increased by $5.4 million due to higher laboratory, consumable, raw materials, as well as costs incurred to transfer technical know-how to our contract manufacturing site. Our APC-other programs and our other programs increased by $0.8 million and $0.5 million, respectively, both due to higher laboratory and consumable materials expenses and raw materials expenses.
The increase in personnel-related costs of $3.4 million was primarily due to increased headcount in our research and development function. Personnel-related costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 included stock-based compensation expense of $1.2 million and $0.7 million, respectively. Facility-related costs increased by $2.5 million primarily due to an increase in rent, utilities, maintenance, insurance, and information technology expenses due to the growth of our company. Laboratory and consumable materials expenses for general usage fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of our purchases made. We expense the costs of materials when purchased because they have no alternative future use. The laboratory and consumables materials expenses decreased by $1.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 due to more purchases being made by us in 2019 than in 2020. Third-party licensing fees decreased by $0.7 million primarily due to a greater amount of sublicense income being earned from Roche in 2019 than in 2020, resulting in higher expenses recognized in 2019 than in 2020 in relation to the sublicense terms of our license agreement with MIT. The increase in platform-related external services and other costs of $0.4 million was primarily due to our expansion of testing to support product candidate selection and an increase in platform development activities.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $20.5 million, compared to $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Personnel-related costs increased by $2.1 million primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense. Personnel-related costs for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 included stock-based compensation expense of $2.4 million and $1.4 million, respectively. Professional and consultant fees decreased by $0.8 million due to the timing of the capitalization of legal costs incurred as a result of our preparation for becoming a public company. Patent-related costs increased by $0.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 as a result of increased legal costs related to intellectual property protections, primarily consisting of patent application and maintenance costs in the United States and internationally in the year ended December 31, 2019.
Interest Income
Interest income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $0.6 million and $2.1 million, respectively. The decrease in interest income was due to a decrease in interest rates as well as lower average cash balances invested in marketable securities during 2020 as compared to 2019.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense) was not significant for both the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. We have not yet commercialized any of our product candidates and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of any product candidates for the next several years, if at all. Through December 31, 2020, we have funded our operations from the sales of our common and preferred stock, upfront and milestone payments under our collaboration agreements with Roche, and with proceeds from our IPO. In November 2020, we completed our IPO pursuant to which we issued and sold 5,073,529 shares of common stock, inclusive of 661,764 shares sold by us pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares. We received aggregate net proceeds of approximately $75.5 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, but before deducting offering costs payable by us, which were $2.6 million. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $170.4 million. In February 2021, we completed a public offering pursuant to which we issued and sold 3,000,000 shares of common stock. We received aggregate net proceeds of approximately $56.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, but before deducting offering costs payable by us, which are estimated to be $0.8 million.
Cash Flows
The following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented:
Operating Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2020, operating activities used $43.2 million of cash, primarily resulting from our net loss of $50.5 million and changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $7.3 million partially offset by net non-cash charges of $14.6 million. Net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted of a $2.9 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and a $9.0 million decrease in operating lease liabilities, partially offset by a $0.4 million increase in accrued expenses and a $4.7 million increase in deferred revenue.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, operating activities used $33.5 million of cash, primarily resulting from our net loss of $32.2 million and changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $6.8 million, partially offset by net non-cash charges of $5.5 million. Net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted primarily of a $5.3 million decrease in operating lease liabilities, a $4.9 million decrease in deferred revenue primarily due to the amounts of revenue we recognized in the year under the 2017 and 2018 Roche Agreements, a $1.0 million increase in accounts receivable and a $0.6 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, partially offset by a $3.4 million increase in accrued expenses and a $1.7 million increase in accounts payable.
In all periods presented, other changes in prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities not described above were generally due to growth in our business, the advancement of our research programs and the timing of vendor invoicing and payments. In all periods presented, decreases in operating lease liabilities were primarily due to our recurring payments made under recorded operating lease liabilities, including those arising from embedded leases.
Investing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by investing activities was $57.8 million, consisting of maturities of marketable securities of $59.0 million, partially offset by purchases of property and equipment of $1.2 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash used in investing activities was $12.8 million, consisting of purchases of marketable securities of $115.9 million and purchases of property and equipment of $2.2 million, partially offset by maturities of marketable securities of $105.2 million.
The purchases of property and equipment in each period were primarily for equipment purchases and leasehold improvements related to the expansion of our research and development activities and the growth of our business.
Financing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $116.4 million, consisting primarily of net proceeds from our IPO of $72.9 million, net proceeds from the issuance of Series D preferred stock of $42.0 million, and stock option exercises of $0.4 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was $26.0 million, consisting primarily of net proceeds from our issuance of Series D preferred stock in December 2019.
Funding Requirements
We expect that our expenses will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance the preclinical activities and clinical trials for our product candidates in development. In addition, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. The timing and amount of our operating and capital expenditures will depend largely on:
•
the timing and progress of preclinical and clinical development activities;
•
the commencement, enrollment or results of the planned clinical trials of our product candidates or any future clinical trials we may conduct, or changes in the development status of our product candidates;
•
the timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;
•
our decision to initiate a clinical trial, not to initiate a clinical trial or to terminate an existing clinical trial as well as Roche’s decision whether to exercise its options;
•
changes in laws or regulations applicable to our product candidates, including but not limited to clinical trial requirements for approvals;
•
adverse developments concerning our manufacturers;
•
our ability to obtain materials to produce adequate product supply for any approved product or inability to do so at acceptable prices;
•
our ability to establish collaborations if needed;
•
the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval;
•
the legal patent costs involved in prosecuting patent applications and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property claims;
•
additions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;
•
unanticipated serious safety concerns related to the use of our product candidates;
•
the terms and timing of any collaboration, license or other arrangement, including the terms and timing of any milestone payments thereunder; and
•
the severity, duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may adversely impact our business.
We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, including the net proceeds from our IPO in November 2020 and our public offering in February 2021 will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through the first half of 2023. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect.
Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making acquisitions or capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed, we would be required to delay, scale back or discontinue our research, product development or future commercialization efforts, or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
Under license agreements with MIT and Erytech, we are obligated to pay annual license fees and to make contingent milestone and royalty payments. Under our license agreement with MIT, we are obligated to make aggregate milestone payments of up to $1.8 million upon the achievement of specified milestones, consisting of up to $0.8 million of development milestone payments and up to $1.0 million of regulatory milestone payments, as well as to pay royalties of low single-digit percentages of (i) our, and any of our affiliates’ and sublicensees’, net sales of licensed products in the research field and (ii) our, and any of our affiliates’, net sales of licensed products in the therapeutic field. In addition, we are obligated to pay annual license maintenance fees of less than $0.1 million per year. For additional information on our license with MIT, see “Business-Collaboration, Research and License Agreements-MIT License Agreement.”
Under our license agreement with Erytech, we are obligated to make aggregate milestone payments of up to $6.0 million upon the achievement of specified milestones, consisting of up to $1.0 million of development milestone payments and up to $5.0 million of regulatory milestone payments, for the first licensed product to achieve the specified milestones and payments of up to $50.0 million upon the achievement of specified sales milestones for all licensed products successfully developed under the agreement for each indication. In addition, we are obligated to pay tiered royalties ranging in the low single-digit percentages of annual net sales for each licensed product or licensed indication sold by us or our affiliates.
Under the 2018 Roche Agreement, if Roche exercises one of its options, then for each antigen product candidate for which Roche commercializes outside of the United States and we commercialize in the United States, we are obligated to pay Roche tiered royalties on net sales of such product candidate in the United States. The amount, timing and likelihood of such payments are not known. See “Business-Collaboration, Research and License Agreements-Roche Collaboration.”
We enter into contracts in the normal course of business with CMOs, CROs and other third parties for preclinical research studies, manufacturing, clinical trials and testing. These contracts do not contain minimum purchase commitments and are cancelable by us upon
prior written notice. Payments due upon cancellation consist only of payments for services provided or expenses incurred, including non-cancelable obligations of our service providers, up to the date of cancellation.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.
Revenue Recognition for License and Collaboration Arrangements
Under ASC 606, we recognize revenue when our customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that we determine are within the scope of ASC 606, we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that we will collect the consideration we are entitled to in exchange for the goods or services we transfer to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract, determine which goods or services are performance obligations and assess whether each promised good or service is distinct. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when, or as, that performance obligation is satisfied.
We enter into licensing arrangements that are within the scope of ASC 606, under which we may exclusively license to third parties rights to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize our product candidates. The terms of these arrangements typically include payment to us of one or more of the following: nonrefundable, upfront license fees; reimbursement of certain costs; customer option exercise fees; development, regulatory and sales milestone payments; and royalties on net sales of licensed products. The payment terms under our existing licensing arrangements are 60 days.
In determining the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as we fulfill our obligations under our arrangements, we perform the following steps: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the assessment of the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy each performance obligation. As part of the accounting for these arrangements, we must use significant judgment to determine: (a) the performance obligations based on the determination under step (ii) above; (b) the transaction price under step (iii) above; and (c) the standalone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract for the allocation of transaction price in step (iv) above. We also use judgment to determine whether milestone payments or other variable consideration, except for royalties and sales-based milestones, should be included in the transaction price, as described below. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling prices of each performance obligation in the contract, and we recognize revenue based on those amounts when, or as, the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied.
The standalone selling price is the price at which an entity would sell a promised good or service separately to a customer. We estimate the standalone selling price of each of the identified performance obligations in our customer contracts, maximizing the use of observable inputs. Because we have not sold the same goods or services in our contracts separately to any customers on a standalone basis and there are no similar observable transactions in the marketplace, we estimate the standalone selling price of each performance obligation in our customer arrangements based on our estimate of costs to be incurred to fulfil our obligations associated with the performance, plus a reasonable margin.
We have determined that our only contract liability under ASC 606 is deferred revenue. Amounts received prior to revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as current portion of deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets. Amounts not expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as deferred revenue, net of current portion, in the consolidated balance sheets.
Exclusive Licenses
If the license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other promises or performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenue from nonrefundable, upfront fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the license. In assessing whether a promise or performance obligation is distinct from the other promises, we consider factors such as the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization capabilities of the collaboration
partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. In addition, we consider whether the collaboration partner can benefit from a promise for its intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining promises, whether the value of the promise is dependent on the unsatisfied promises, whether there are other vendors that could provide the remaining promises, and whether it is separately identifiable from the remaining promises. For licenses that are combined with other promises, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjust the measure of progress and related revenue recognition. The measure of progress, and the resulting periods over which revenue should be recognized, are subject to estimates by management and may change over the course of the research, development and licensing arrangement. Such a change could have a material impact on the amount of revenue we record in future periods. Under our existing license and collaboration agreements, we have concluded that the transfer of control to the customer occurs over the time period that the research and development services are to be provided by us, and this cost-to-cost method is, in management’s judgment, the best measure of progress towards satisfying the performance obligation.
Research and Development Services
The promises under our license and collaboration arrangements often include research and development services to be performed by us on behalf of the partner. Payments or reimbursements resulting from our research and development efforts are estimated at the outset of the arrangement and considered part of the transaction price that is subsequently recognized as revenue because we are the principal in the arrangement for such efforts.
Customer Options
If an arrangement is determined to contain customer options that allow the customer to acquire additional goods or services, we evaluate the customer options to determine if they are material rights at the outset of each arrangement. Options to acquire additional goods or services for free or at a discount are deemed to be material rights. If the goods and services underlying the customer options are not determined to be material rights, these customer options are not considered to be performance obligations in the arrangement because they are contingent upon exercise of the option. If the customer options are determined to be a material right, the material right is recognized as a separate performance obligation at the outset of the arrangement. We allocate the transaction price to material rights based on the relative standalone selling price, which is determined based on the identified discount and the probability that the customer will exercise the option. Amounts allocated to a material right are not recognized as revenue until, at the earliest, the option is exercised.
Milestone Payments
At the inception of each arrangement that includes potential research, development or regulatory milestone payments, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered likely to be met and estimate the amount to be considered for inclusion in the transaction price using the most-likely-amount method. If it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized would not occur, the associated milestone payment value is included in the transaction price. For milestone payments due upon events that are not within the control of us or the licensee, such as regulatory approvals, we are not able to assert that it is likely that the regulatory approval will be granted and that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur until those approvals are received. In making this assessment, we evaluate factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the particular milestone. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized would not occur. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we reevaluate the probability of achievement of all milestones subject to constraint and, if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price of the arrangement. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect the amounts of revenue and earnings in the period of adjustment.
Royalties
For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments due upon first commercial sales or based on a level of sales, that are the result of a customer-vendor relationship and for which the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the later of (i) the occurrence of the related sales or (ii) the date upon which the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied or partially satisfied. To date, we have not recognized any royalty revenue from any of our licensing arrangements.
Information regarding management’s judgments and estimates applied in our accounting for our collaboration agreements with Roche in accordance with ASC 606 is summarized below. For additional information, see “-Components of Our Results of Operations-Revenue” and Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
2017 License and Collaboration Agreement with Roche
In April 2017, we entered into the 2017 Roche Agreement. Under the agreement, we received an upfront payment of $5.0 million as a technology access fee and are entitled to (i) payments of up to $1.0 million, in two tranches of $0.5 million, as reimbursement for our research costs; (ii) milestone payments of up to $7.0 million upon the achievement of specified development milestones; and (iii) annual maintenance fees ranging from $0.5 million to $0.9 million for each year following the fifth anniversary of the effective date, subject to specified prepayment discounts. Both we and Roche have specified obligations for performance during the term of the agreement.
We assessed our accounting for the 2017 Roche Agreement under ASC 606 as the transactions underlying the agreement were deemed to be transactions with a customer. We identified the following promises under the 2017 Roche Agreement: (i) a non-exclusive license granted to Roche to perform research related to and use our Cell Squeeze technology for gene editing of immune cells; (ii) specified research and development services related to gene editing of immune cells through the research term; (iii) manufacturing activities to support the specified research plan; and (iv) participation on a JRC. The annual maintenance fees described above were determined by us to be optional renewal payments. We concluded that each of the promises under the agreement was not distinct from the other promises in the arrangement. The research license was determined to not be distinct from the research and manufacturing activities primarily as a result of Roche being unable
to benefit on its own or with other resources reasonably available in the marketplace because the license to our intellectual property requires significant specialized capabilities in order to be further developed, the research services necessary to develop the product are highly specialized, and our proprietary Cell Squeeze technology is a key capability of that development. The research and manufacturing services were determined not to be distinct because the promise under the agreement is to complete research and development, inclusive of the manufacturing. In addition, we determined that the impact of participation on the JRC was insignificant and had an immaterial impact on the accounting model. As such, we concluded that the first three promises should be combined into a single performance obligation. Based on these assessments, we identified one distinct performance obligation at the outset of the 2017 Roche Agreement.
As of entering into the 2017 Roche Agreement, we assessed whether the 2017 Roche Agreement was, for accounting purposes, a modification of the 2015 Roche Agreement or a separate contract and concluded that it was a separate contract because (i) the programs under the 2017 Roche Agreement were entirely new and distinct and are separate from programs under the 2015 Roche Agreement, (ii) the 2017 Roche Agreement and 2015 Roche Agreement were not negotiated together as a package with a single commercial objective and (iii) the amount of consideration paid under the 2017 Roche Agreement and 2015 Roche Agreement are not dependent on the price or performance under the other agreement. In addition, we determined that the upfront payment of $5.0 million as well as the expected reimbursable costs of $1.0 million constituted the entirety of the consideration to be included in the transaction price. The potential milestone payments that we may be eligible to receive were initially excluded from the transaction price of the arrangement as all development milestone payments did not meet the criteria for inclusion using the most-likely-amount method. We reevaluate the transaction price at the end of each reporting period and as uncertain events are resolved or other changes in circumstances occur, and, if necessary, we will adjust our estimate of the transaction price. We received the upfront payment of $5.0 million in April 2017 upon execution of the agreement. We also received the payments of $0.5 million in each of 2017 and 2018 related to our reimbursable research costs. In addition, during the third quarter of 2018, we received a payment of $2.0 million following the achievement of the first development milestone under the agreement related to Roche’s validation of preclinical proof of concept. This amount was added to our estimate of the transaction price as of the second quarter of 2018, when we determined that achievement of the milestone was “most likely” and that it was probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized would not occur, and as a result, we recorded a cumulative catch-up adjustment to collaboration revenue of $1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.
We recognize revenue associated with the performance obligation as the research, development and manufacturing services are provided using an input method, based on the cumulative costs incurred compared to the total estimated costs expected to be incurred to satisfy the performance obligation. The transfer of control to the customer occurs over the time period that the research and development services are to be provided by us, and this cost-to-cost method is, in management’s judgment, the best measure of progress towards satisfying the performance obligation. The amounts received from Roche that have not yet been recognized as revenue are deferred as a contract liability in our consolidated balance sheet and will be recognized over the remaining research and development period until the performance obligation is satisfied.
2018 License and Collaboration Agreement with Roche
In October 2018, we entered into the 2018 Roche Agreement. Under the agreement, Roche was granted option rights to obtain an exclusive license to develop APC products or products derived from the collaboration programs on a product-by-product basis for oncologic indications. These option rights are exercisable upon the achievement of clinical Phase 1 proof of concept and expire, if unexercised, as of a date specified in the agreement. In addition, Roche was granted an option right to obtain an exclusive license to develop a TCL product. This option right is exercisable upon the achievement of clinical proof of concept and expires, if unexercised, as of a date specified in the agreement. For each of the APC products and TCL product, once Roche exercises its option and pays a specified incremental amount ranging from $15.0 million to $50.0 million for APC products and of $100.0 million for the TCL product, Roche will receive worldwide, exclusive commercialization rights for the licensed products, subject to our alternating option to retain U.S. APC commercialization rights. Through December 31, 2020, Roche had not exercised any of its options under the 2018 Roche Agreement.
Under the 2018 Roche Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $45.0 million and are eligible to receive (i) reimbursement of a mid double-digit percentage of our development costs; (ii) aggregate milestone payments on a product-by-product basis of up to $1.6 billion upon the achievement of specified milestones, consisting of up to $217.0 million of development milestone payments, up to $240.0 million of regulatory milestone payments and up to $1.2 billion of sales milestone payments; and (iii) tiered royalties on annual net sales of APC and TCL products licensed under the agreement at specified rates ranging from a mid single-digit percentage to percentage in the low twenties. We received the upfront payment of $45.0 million in October 2018 upon execution of the agreement. In addition, during the second quarter of 2019, we received a payment of $10.0 million following the achievement of the first development milestone under the 2018 Roche Agreement related to submission by us of preclinical data to the FDA, and during the first quarter of 2020, we received a payment of $20.0 million following the achievement of the second development milestone under the 2018 Roche Agreement related to first-patient dosing in a Phase 1 clinical trial.
We assessed our accounting for the 2018 Roche Agreement in accordance with ASC 606 and concluded that Roche is a customer prior to the exercise of any of its options under the agreement. We also identified the following promises under the 2018 Roche Agreement: (i) a non-exclusive license granted to Roche to use our intellectual property and collaboration compounds to conduct research activities related to the research plans under the 2018 Roche Agreement; (ii) specified research and development services related to HPV through Phase 1 clinical trials under a specified research plan; (iii) manufacturing of our SQZ APC platform and equipment in order to support the HPV research plan; (iv) specified research and development services on next-generation APCs under a research plan; (v) specified research and development services on TCL under a research plan; and (vi) participation on a JSC.
We concluded that, in the case of each performance obligation, the license to our intellectual property was not distinct as a result of Roche being unable to benefit from the license on its own or with other resources reasonably available in the marketplace because the license to our intellectual property requires significant specialized capabilities in order to be further developed. We concluded that the license to our intellectual property, research and development activities related to HPV, and manufacturing of our SQZ APC platform and equipment related to HPV were not distinct from each other because the research and manufacturing activities together customize and significantly modify the underlying technology. As such, we determined that each of these related promises under the agreement was not distinct from the others in this group and should be combined into a single performance obligation. We also concluded that the license to our intellectual property and the research and development activities on next-generation APCs were not distinct from each other because the research and development activities customize and significantly modify the underlying technology. As such, we determined that these related promises should be combined into a single performance obligation. Further, we concluded that the license to our intellectual property and the research and development activities on TCL were not distinct from each other because the research and development activities customize and significantly modify the underlying technology. As such, we determined that these related promises should be combined into a single performance obligation. We concluded that the three performance obligations were distinct from each other as they are separate programs and are unrelated. In addition, we determined that the impact of participation on the JSC was insignificant and had an immaterial impact on the accounting model.
Finally, we evaluated the option rights for licenses to develop, manufacture and commercialize the collaboration targets to determine whether these options provide Roche with any material rights for accounting purposes. We concluded that the option exercise prices were not below respective standalone selling prices, and, therefore, the options were marketing offers that do not provide material rights under ASC 606. Accordingly, the options were excluded as performance obligations at the outset of the 2018 Roche Agreement and will be accounted for as separate accounting contracts if and when each option exercise occurs.
Based on these assessments, we identified three performance obligations at the outset of the 2018 Roche Agreement: (1) the license to our intellectual property, the research and development activities related to HPV through Phase 1 clinical trials under a specified research plan, and the manufacturing of our SQZ APC platform and equipment in order to support the HPV research plan, or the first performance obligation; (2) the license to our intellectual property and the research and development activities on next-generation APCs, or the second performance obligation; and (3) the license to our intellectual property and the research and development activities on TCL, or the third performance obligation.
As of entering into the 2018 Roche Agreement, we assessed whether the 2018 Roche Agreement was, for accounting purposes, a modification of the two prior Roche agreements or a separate contract and concluded that it was a modification of the 2015 Roche Agreement. At the termination of the 2015 Roche Agreement, all deliverables were submitted to Roche for review, and as such, we completed all of our obligations under the 2015 Roche Agreement. Because the obligations under the 2015 Roche Agreement were completed at its termination and all arrangement consideration had been recognized as revenue, the accounting treatment as a modification determined by us would result in the same measurement and recognition patterns as would a separate contract. Further, we concluded that the 2018 Roche Agreement was a separate contract from the 2017 Roche Agreement because (i) we contracted to provide distinct goods and services associated with our gene editing platform to discover new targets in cancer immunotherapy, (ii) the 2018 Roche Agreement and 2017 Roche Agreement were not negotiated together as a package with a single commercial objective and (iii) the amount of consideration paid under the 2018 Roche Agreement and 2017 Roche Agreement are not dependent on the price or performance under the other agreement. In addition, we determined that the upfront payment of $45.0 million as well as the reimbursable costs of $10.8 million estimated by us constituted the entirety of the consideration to be included in the transaction price. This transaction price of $55.8 million was initially allocated to the three performance obligations based on the relative standalone selling price of each obligation. The potential milestone payments that we may be eligible to receive were excluded from the transaction price at the outset of the arrangement because (i) all development and regulatory milestone payments did not meet the criteria for inclusion using the most-likely-amount method and (ii) we recognize as revenue sales-based royalties and milestone payments at the later of the occurrence of the related sales or the date upon which the performance obligation has been satisfied because we believe that the license is the predominant item to which the royalties relate and have applied the sales-based royalty exception. We reevaluate the transaction price at the end of each reporting period and as uncertain events are resolved or other changes in circumstances occur, and, if necessary, we will adjust our estimate of the transaction price.
We determined the standalone selling price of each performance obligation under the 2018 Roche Agreement based on our estimate of our costs to be incurred to fulfil the research, development and manufacturing obligations associated with each of the three performance obligations, plus a reasonable margin.
During the first quarter of 2019, we became entitled to receive a payment of $10.0 million upon the achievement of the first development milestone under the 2018 Roche Agreement, which was related to submission by us of preclinical data to the FDA. The $10.0 million amount was added to our estimate of the transaction price as of the first quarter of 2019, when we determined that achievement of the milestone was “most likely” and that it was probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized would not occur, and, as a result, we recorded a cumulative catch-up adjustment to collaboration revenue of $1.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2019 and the year ended December 31, 2019.
In October 2019, we received clearance from the FDA for our IND for our lead clinical program under the 2018 Roche Agreement. As a result of this IND clearance and progress made toward beginning clinical trials, we concluded as of December 31, 2019 that the achievement in the first quarter of 2020 of a milestone resulting in receipt of a payment of $20.0 million due upon first-patient dosing in a Phase 1 clinical trial under the 2018 Roche Agreement was “most likely” and that it was probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative
revenue recognized would not occur. We therefore included the $20.0 million payment in our estimate of the transaction price for the 2018 Roche Agreement in the fourth quarter of 2019 and recorded a cumulative catch-up adjustment to collaboration revenue of $5.0 million during the three months and year ended December 31, 2019. In first quarter of 2020, we received the $20.0 million milestone payment from Roche.
During the fourth quarter of 2019, we evaluated our overall program priorities and determined that in 2020 we would continue to focus our resources on progressing the specified APC programs related to the 2018 Roche Agreement as well as our AAC and TAC platforms. As a result of our continuing focus on these specific programs, we reduced the level of priority of the TCL research activities under the 2018 Roche Agreement and expect to perform such TCL research activities over a longer time period than as originally expected under the research plan of the agreement. Consequently, in the fourth quarter of 2019, we reclassified $5.3 million of our current deferred revenue to non-current deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheet, and such non-current deferred revenue will remain unrecognized as revenue until TCL research activities resume or the 2018 Roche Agreement is modified by us and Roche.
We separately recognize revenue associated with each of the three performance obligations as the research, development and manufacturing services are provided using an input method, based on the cumulative costs incurred compared to the total estimated costs expected to be incurred to satisfy each performance obligation. The transfer of control to the customer occurs over the time period that the research and development services are to be provided by us, and this cost-to-cost method is, in management’s judgment, the best measure of progress towards satisfying each performance obligation. The amounts received that have not yet been recognized as revenue are deferred as a contract liability in our consolidated balance sheet and will be recognized over the remaining research and development period until each performance obligation is satisfied.
Accrued Research and Development Expenses
As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advance payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in the consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. At each period end, we corroborate the accuracy of these estimates with the service providers and make adjustments, if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include those related to fees paid to:
•
vendors in connection with preclinical development activities;
•
CMOs in connection with the process development and scale-up activities and the production of preclinical and clinical trial materials; and
•
CROs in connection with clinical trials.
We record the expense and accrual related to contract research and manufacturing based on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended considering a number of factors, including our knowledge of the progress towards completion of the research, development and manufacturing activities; invoicing to date under the contracts; communication from the CMOs, CROs and other companies of any actual costs incurred during the period that have not yet been invoiced; and the costs included in the contracts and purchase orders. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid expense accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have not been any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses.
Stock-Based Compensation
We measure stock-based awards granted to employees, non-employees and directors based on their fair value on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for options or the difference between the purchase price per share of the award, if any, and the fair value of our common stock for restricted common stock awards. Compensation expense for those awards is recognized over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the award for employees and directors and the period during which services are performed for non-employees. We use the straight-line method to record the expense of awards with service-based vesting conditions.
The Black-Scholes option-pricing model uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock and assumptions we make for the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options, and our expected dividend yield.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
A description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows is disclosed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Emerging Growth Company Status
The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 permits an “emerging growth company” such as us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected not to “opt out” of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we will adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard and will do so until such time that we either (i) irrevocably elect to “opt out” of such extended transition period or (ii) no longer qualify as an emerging growth company. We may choose to early adopt any new or revised accounting standards whenever such early adoption is permitted for private companies.
