ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following is management’s assessment of NW Holdings' and NW Natural's financial condition, including the principal factors that affect results of operations. The discussion covers the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 and refers to the consolidated results of NW Holdings, the substantial majority of which consist of the operating results of NW Natural. When significant activity exists at NW Holdings that does not exist at NW Natural, additional disclosure has been provided. References in this discussion to "Notes" are to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.
NW Natural's natural gas distribution activities are reported in the natural gas distribution (NGD) segment. The NGD segment also includes NWN Gas Reserves, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Energy Corp, the NGD-portion of NW Natural's Mist storage facility in Oregon, and NW Natural RNG Holding Company, LLC. Other activities aggregated and reported as other at NW Natural include the non-NGD storage activity at Mist as well as asset management services and the appliance retail center operations. Other activities aggregated and reported as other at NW Holdings include NWN Energy's equity investment in Trail West Holdings, LLC (TWH) through August 6, 2020; NNG Financial's investment in Kelso-Beaver Pipeline (KB Pipeline); and NWN Water, which through itself or its subsidiaries, owns and continues to pursue investments in the water sector. See Note 4 for further discussion of our business segment and other, as well as our direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries. See Note 14 for information on our TWH investment.
In addition, NW Holdings has reported discontinued operations results related to the sale of Gill Ranch Storage, LLC (Gill Ranch). NW Natural Gas Storage, LLC (NWN Gas Storage), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of NW Holdings, entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement during the second quarter of 2018 that provided for the sale of all membership interests in Gill Ranch. Gill Ranch owns a 75% interest in the natural gas storage facility located near Fresno, California known as the Gill Ranch Gas Storage Facility. For more information, see "Results of Operations - Discontinued Operations" below.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. In addition to presenting the results of operations and earnings amounts in total, certain financial measures are expressed in cents per share, which are non-GAAP financial measures. All references in this section to earnings per share (EPS) are on the basis of diluted shares. We use such non-GAAP financial measures to analyze our financial performance because we believe they provide useful information to our investors and creditors in evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Key financial highlights for NW Holdings include:
Key financial highlights for NW Natural include:
2020 COMPARED TO 2019. Consolidated net income increased $1.6 million at NW Natural primarily due to the following factors:
•a $15.4 million increase in NGD segment margin driven by the 2020 Oregon and 2019 Washington rate cases and residential customer growth; and
•a $7.9 million decrease in other expense, net primarily related to higher 2019 pension expenses (non-service cost component) recognized as part of the settlement and recovery of NW Natural's pension balancing account, which was primarily offset within NGD margin and income tax benefits (as discussed below) and which did not recur in 2020; partially offset by
•a $13.6 million increase in depreciation expense and general taxes due to property, plant, and equipment additions, as we continued to invest in our gas utility system; and
•a $7.0 million increase in income tax expense primarily due to 2019 including an income tax benefit related to the return of deferred TCJA benefits to customers and the regulatory pension disallowance, and higher pre-tax income.
Net income from continuing operations increased $5.0 million at NW Holdings primarily due to the following factors:
•a $1.6 million increase in consolidated net income at NW Natural as discussed above; and
•a $3.4 million increase in other net income primarily reflecting higher earnings at our water and wastewater utilities that have been acquired since 2019.
2019 COMPARED TO 2018. NW Holdings' net income from continuing operations decreased $2.0 million and NW Natural's net income from continuing operations increased $1.0 million.
In March 2019, the OPUC issued an order resolving the remaining open items from NW Natural's 2018 Oregon general rate case regarding recovery of the pension balancing account and treatment of the benefits associated with the TCJA. As a result of the order, in the first quarter of 2019, NW Natural recorded a disallowance and several benefits and expenses through the consolidated statements of comprehensive income as follows:
Pension balancing account. Approximately $12.5 million in previously deferred pension expenses were recognized of which approximately $4.6 million was recorded in operations and maintenance expense and $7.9 million was recorded in other income (expense), net. These charges were offset with a corresponding increase in revenue of $7.1 million and in income tax benefits of $2.7 million as the order required the offset of certain deferred TCJA benefits against the pension balancing account. Additional TCJA income tax benefits were realized throughout 2019 to offset the remainder of the $12.5 million charge.
NW Natural also recognized a regulatory pension disallowance of $10.5 million with approximately $3.9 million recognized in operations and maintenance expense and $6.6 million recognized in other income (expense), net, partially offset by related discrete income tax benefits of $1.1 million. Lastly, NW Natural realized $3.8 million of deferred regulatory interest accrued on the pension balancing account.
Deferred TCJA benefits and timing variance. In addition, the OPUC ordered the return of approximately $6.3 million of excess deferred income taxes associated with plant and gas reserves annually beginning April 1, 2019. As a result, NW Natural recognized approximately $2.0 million in income tax benefits in the first quarter of 2019. Reductions to customer billings commenced April 1, 2019 and offset these income tax benefits in total by the end of 2019. NW Natural will continue reductions to customer billings and recognition of deferred income tax benefits in subsequent years until all benefits have been returned.
The increase of $1.0 million at NW Natural was primarily due to the following factors:
•a $39.0 million increase in NGD segment margin driven by new customer rates from the 2018 Oregon rate case and 2019 Washington rate case, customer growth, and lease revenue from the North Mist storage facility; the remaining increase primarily relates to $7.1 million in revenues which were offset by pension expenses due to the OPUC order as discussed above;
•a $9.4 million decrease in NGD segment income tax expense primarily due to the income tax implications of the March 2019 OPUC order, of which $5.4 million was offset by pension expenses as discussed above, with the remainder driven by the return of deferred TCJA benefit credits to customers and lower pretax income in 2019 compared to 2018; and
•a $5.8 million increase in deferred regulatory interest income in other income (expense), net, of which $5.1 million relates to interest recognized in association with the OPUC order discussed above; offset by
•a $34.4 million increase in pension costs within operations and maintenance expense and other income (expense), net, of which $12.5 million relates to costs which were entirely offset by revenues and income tax benefits as discussed above, and $10.5 million relates to the regulatory pension disallowance discussed above. In addition, there was an $11.4 million increase in pension expenses as NW Natural began collecting ongoing pension costs through customer rates on November 1, 2018 and began collecting deferred pension costs through customer rates on April 1, 2019 rather than deferring a portion to the balancing account;
•a $5.4 million increase in depreciation and amortization primarily due to additional capital expenditures;
•a $5.4 million decrease in non-NGD segment operating revenues due to lower asset management revenues and increased asset management revenue sharing with Oregon customers as a result of the 2018 Oregon rate case;
•a $4.6 million increase in NGD segment interest expense due to higher interest on long- and short-term debt balances; and
•a $2.9 million increase in NGD segment operations and maintenance expenses primarily attributable to annual employee cost increases.
The decrease of $2.0 million at NW Holdings was primarily driven by increases in professional service costs and expenses associated with developing the water business, partially offset by the increase of $1.0 million at NW Natural.
COVID-19 AND CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. The novel coronavirus (COVID-19), which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, has resulted in severe and widespread global, national, and local economic and societal disruptions. In Oregon and Washington, where we serve natural gas and water customers, stay-at-home orders were issued in March 2020. Orders were also issued in March in Idaho and Texas where we also serve water customers. These and subsequent executive orders required the closure of “non-essential” businesses and permitted the continuation of “essential services.” All of the services provided by NW Natural and NW Natural Water were considered “essential services” under the executive orders applicable to the jurisdictions in which they operate, and we continue to serve our gas and water customers and proceed with capital investments without interruption.
As a critical infrastructure energy company that provides an essential service to our customers, NW Natural has well-defined emergency response command structures and protocols. In response to the pandemic, NW Natural mobilized its incident command team and business continuity plans in early March 2020, and continues to operate under these structures and protocols, with a focus on the safety of our 1,200 employees and the 2.5 million people, business partners and communities we serve. NW Natural has generally suspended business travel out of our service territory and implemented work-from-home plans for employees wherever possible. For employees whose role requires them to work in the field or onsite, we are following CDC, OSHA, and state specific requirements. Measures include: following social distancing guidelines; use of personal protective equipment (PPE) including masks, face coverings and gloves; enhanced sanitizing protocols; requiring employee health screenings prior to entering a NW Natural facility; and other measures intended to mitigate the spread of this disease and keep our employees and customers safe and informed. Our water companies are following similar protocols. In addition, we are working with state officials to provide our essential field and onsite workers access to the vaccine during the coming months. We remain vigilant regarding the safety of our customers and employees.
Currently, our service territories are in various phases of reopening, which has permitted the reopening of many businesses that were considered non-essential. Certain of the reopened businesses are operating under continued restrictions related to patron capacity for retail stores and outdoor-only seating for restaurants in Oregon, among other restrictions to prevent further spread of COVID-19.
To support our customers in this unusual time, in March 2020, NW Natural temporarily stopped charging late fees and disconnecting customers for nonpayment. NW Natural also provided Oregon natural gas customers with annual bill credits primarily in June totaling approximately $17.0 million related to NW Natural's revenue sharing mechanism. Through term sheets with the Oregon and Washington Commissions, we have agreed to timelines for resuming our normal business practices such as beginning collection processes while also providing financial assistance and payment plans to our most vulnerable customers.
From a financial perspective, the initial timing of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 and resulting economic disruption in the United States coincided with the end of the Pacific Northwest 2019-20 winter heating season and although it has continued into the 2020-21 winter heating season, the financial effects were moderated by our regulated utility business model, our natural gas customer base being predominately residential, and temporary cost savings initiatives that were implemented by management. For 2020, we estimate the total financial effects of COVID-19 to be approximately $10 million pre-tax with the impact partially mitigated by regulatory deferrals and temporary cost savings measures. We incurred $4.8 million of COVID-related costs that were deferred to a regulatory asset for recovery in a future period. These costs included PPE supplies, estimates for bad debts, and interest expense associated with financing related activities undertaken to support liquidity during the pandemic, net of direct cost savings such as lower travel and meals and entertainment expenses. In addition, we expect to recognize revenue in a future period for an additional $1.3 million related to forgone late fee revenue. We also experienced additional financial implications of approximately $3.8 million pre-tax that will not be recovered through rates primarily due to lower natural gas distribution margin from customers that stopped natural gas service and lower usage from customers that are not covered under decoupled rate schedules. The financial impacts were mitigated in part by approximately $3.5 million in temporary cost savings initiatives.
During 2020, NW Natural increased the allowance for uncollectible accounts by $2.4 million to $3.1 million. Our allowance for residential and commercial uncollectible accounts estimate increased from 0.1% of gas sales to approximately 0.4% of gas sales for the year ended December 31, 2020.
At the onset of the pandemic, in March 2020 as a precaution to strengthen our liquidity and guard against volatile markets as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded, we took the following steps:
•NW Natural drew $227 million on its credit facility and subsequently repaid the full amount during the second quarter;
•NW Holdings drew $35 million on its credit facility and repaid $27 million as of December 31, 2020;
•NW Natural borrowed $150 million pursuant to a 364-day term loan and subsequently repaid the full amount in October 2020; and
•NW Natural issued $150 million 30-year first mortgage bonds with an interest rate of 3.6%, which was primarily to support its capital expenditure program.
The federal CARES Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020 to provide direct and indirect financial support to individuals, businesses, state and local governments, and the healthcare system in response to COVID-19. As provided for in the CARES Act, we deferred remittance of the employer portion of the Social Security payroll tax from March through December 31, 2020, when the provision ended. This resulted in $4.7 million of deferred payroll taxes that we expect to remit under the CARES Act guidelines, which require half of the tax liability to be paid by December 31, 2021 and the remaining half to be paid by December 31, 2022.
We have taken additional actions in response to known issues arising from the trends related to the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, we have enhanced cybersecurity monitoring in response to reports that cybersecurity attackers are more active with much of the economy utilizing work from home protocols. Like others, we experienced some constraints on our ability to obtain PPE and disinfecting supplies, but currently believe that we have sufficient supplies to continue our work and continue to procure additional supplies and most efficiently utilize those supplies we have on hand. We have not experienced material disruptions in our supply chain for goods and services to date, but are continuing to actively monitor, and have formulated and continue to evaluate contingency plans as necessary.
We remain vigilant in monitoring how the phased re-openings of the territories in which we operate progress and any reinstitution or possible reinstitution of restrictions, and we are actively monitoring several key metrics. While we are unable to predict the length, severity or impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and economic disruptions on our business, the potential for a resurgence or mutation of the virus, or timing, widespread availability and efficacy of vaccine implementation, we have the following expectations and beliefs currently:
•Both NW Natural and NW Natural Water expect their capital projects in 2021 to move forward as planned.
•NW Natural's customer growth rate is affected by both new meter connections and when existing customers close their accounts and disconnect their meters. Customer growth from construction and conversions remained strong during 2020. A slow economic recovery could result in a decline in new meter connections, which could adversely affect margin in 2021 and the following periods. In addition, we are closely monitoring our approximately 70,000 commercial and industrial natural gas meters, as a substantial decline in these meters could materially affect margin in 2021 and the following periods. A
disconnection may occur if circumstances require businesses, such as restaurants, retailers, and those in the hospitality sector, to temporarily or permanently close. When we cease suspending disconnections, we may experience a higher level of disconnections. We don't anticipate significant residential meter disconnections.
•NW Natural has seen lower utility margin from a reduction in overall sales volumes during the year ended December 31, 2020 attributed to COVID-19, primarily related to the loss of commercial customers as described above. Due to the seasonality of our gas utility business, we may see more substantial declines in volumes as our peak heating season progresses, depending on the level of reopenings and resiliency of businesses in the communities in which we serve. However, volumes do not translate directly to earnings as the majority of our NGD margin is not dependent on volumes.
•While we have begun returning to normal business practices for many commercial and industrial customers in certain jurisdictions, our residential customers' return to normal practices may be extended based on the timing, availability and efficacy of vaccine rollout and timing of economic recovery. Therefore, the recognition of late and disconnection fee revenue may be delayed beyond our current expectations.
•As the pandemic has continued into the 2020-2021 winter heating season, certain customers are faced with seasonally higher natural gas usage and bills. This could have a financial strain on our customers and impact their ability to pay their bills in a timely manner thus potentially increasing our working capital needs.
•While we deferred to a regulatory asset certain COVID-related financial impacts as agreed upon with regulators, ultimate recovery of these costs and prudence review will be determined through a separate proceeding and may be subject to modification as a result of those proceedings.
Given the evolving nature of the pandemic and resulting economic conditions, we are continually monitoring our business operations and the larger trends and developments to take additional measures we believe are warranted to continue providing safe and reliable service to our customers and communities while protecting our employees.
2021 OUTLOOK
We expect to make significant progress on our long-term objectives in the coming year. Our natural gas distribution business is focused on providing safe, reliable, and affordable energy in an environmentally responsible way to better the lives of the public we serve. Our water and wastewater utility business is committed to providing its customers with safe, clean, reliable and affordable water and wastewater services, while also continuing to grow organically and through acquisitions. In 2021, we remain focused on the strategic pillars of our business: ensuring safe & reliable service; providing superior customer service; advancing constructive legislative policies and regulation; enabling customer growth; and leading on environmental stewardship and decarbonization.
ENSURING SAFE AND RELIABLE SERVICE. Delivering our products safely and reliably to customers, while keeping our employees safe, is our first priority. At NW Natural, we remain focused on safety and emergency response through hands-on, scenario-based training for employees, third-party contractors, and first responders. The reliability, resiliency and safety of our gas system is critical and to this end, we remain focused on investing in necessary upgrades and replacing key system components, preventing third-party damages, and performing regular inspections and assessments. Safety for our gas infrastructure also includes maintaining and strengthening our cybersecurity defenses, upgrading key technology systems, such as our enterprise risk planning system and customer information system over the next several years, and preparing for large-scale emergency events, such as seismic hazards. Our water and wastewater utilities are focused on executing on their capital expenditure plans to ensure continued safe and reliable service to customers and enhancing plans to be able to readily prioritize capital investments.
PROVIDING SUPERIOR CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. We have a legacy of providing excellent customer service and a long-standing dedication to continuous improvement, which has resulted in NW Natural consistently receiving high rankings in the J.D. Power and Associates customer satisfaction studies and more recently in Escalent's Congent trusted brand and customer engagement residential customer study, earning NW Natural the designation of Customer Champion for the last several years. During 2020, we also implemented several new customer facing technologies including a new website, a streamlined customer onboarding process, and new Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system. In 2021, we intend to fully optimize this new technology to enhance our natural gas customers’ experience and meet their evolving expectations. We'll also plan for the next upgrades, which will be centered on our customers’ most frequent interactions and highest value touchpoints.
ADVANCING CONSTRUCTIVE LEGISLATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATION. NW Natural has a history of working productively with lawmakers and regulators. Most recently in 2020, rulemaking was completed on the groundbreaking Oregon Senate Bill 98 that allows gas utilities to procure and invest in renewable natural gas for their customers. In 2021, we'll continue to proactively communicate with policymakers and other stakeholders about what we believe is the important role of the gas system in achieving climate goals for our communities, and work with the American Gas Association to provide education on the role of natural gas in energy infrastructure at the national level. With regulators, we'll strive to work productively on open proceedings, taking care of customers during the pandemic, and pursuing recovery of deferred costs related to COVID-19. NW Natural will also continue working with the EPA and other stakeholders on an environmentally protective and cost-effective clean-up for the Portland Harbor Superfund Site. For our water utilities, we are focused on working collaboratively with regulators, pursuing efficient approval processes for acquisitions, filing general rate cases where needed to support investments, and engaging in constructive regulatory proceedings.
ENABLING CUSTOMER GROWTH. Natural gas is a preferred energy choice in our service territory given its affordable, efficient, and reliable qualities and often preferred by homeowners for heating and cooking. We are focused on leveraging these key attributes to capitalize on our region's continued strong housing growth. We'll strive to continue growing our market share in the residential sector and multifamily developments, but believe commercial customer growth may be modest in 2021 as the pandemic has placed additional restrictions on small businesses, such as retail stores and restaurants, in our region. At NW Natural Water, we continue to be focused on supporting the fast-growing communities we currently serve and continuing our disciplined acquisition strategy.
LEADING ON DECARBONIZATION. We are deeply committed to a clean energy future and environmental stewardship. It's why NW Natural launched a low-carbon initiative in 2017 to reduce emissions in the communities we serve by leveraging our modern natural gas pipeline system in new ways, working closely with customers, policymakers and regulators, and embracing cutting-edge technology. In 2020, under Oregon SB 98, NW Natural began a partnership with BioCarbN, a developer and operator of sustainable infrastructure projects, to convert methane into RNG. Under this partnership, NW Natural has the ability to invest up to an estimated $38 million in four separate RNG development projects that will access biogas derived from water treatment at Tyson Foods' processing plants. In 2021, NW Natural intends to continue striving to execute on our renewable strategy by helping our customers reduce and offset their consumption, to procure and invest in RNG for our customers under Oregon Senate Bill 98, execute on our RNG interconnection projects, continue developing voluntary renewable product offerings for our customers, and explore renewable hydrogen. We also intend to leverage technology and relationships to examine ways to reduce emissions across the entire value chain from suppliers to end-use heating appliances.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Regulatory Matters
Regulation and Rates
NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION. NW Natural's natural gas distribution business is subject to regulation by the OPUC and WUTC with respect to, among other matters, rates and terms of service, systems of accounts, and issuances of securities by NW Natural. In 2020, approximately 88% of NGD customers were located in Oregon, with the remaining 12% in Washington. Earnings and cash flows from natural gas distribution operations are largely determined by rates set in general rate cases and other proceedings in Oregon and Washington. They are also affected by weather, the local economies in Oregon and Washington, the pace of customer growth in the residential, commercial, and industrial markets, and NW Natural's ability to remain price competitive, control expenses, and obtain reasonable and timely regulatory recovery of its natural gas distribution-related costs, including operating expenses and investment costs in plant and other regulatory assets. See "Most Recent Completed Rate Cases" below.
MIST INTERSTATE GAS STORAGE. NW Natural's interstate storage activity at Mist is subject to regulation by the OPUC, WUTC, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) with respect to, among other matters, rates and terms of service. The OPUC also regulates the intrastate storage services at Mist, while FERC regulates the interstate storage services at Mist. The FERC uses a maximum cost of service model which allows for gas storage prices to be set at or below the cost of service as approved by each agency in their last regulatory filing. The OPUC Schedule 80 rates are tied to the FERC rates, and are updated whenever NW Natural modifies FERC maximum rates.
OTHER. In June 2018, NWN Gas Storage, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NW Holdings, entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement for the sale of all of its ownership interests in Gill Ranch, a natural gas storage facility located near Fresno, California. The sale closed on December 4, 2020. See Note 19 for more information. The wholly-owned regulated water businesses of NWN Water, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NW Holdings, are subject to regulation by the utility commissions in the states in which they are located, which currently includes Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Texas.
Most Recent Completed Rate Cases
OREGON. On October 16, 2020, the OPUC issued an order concluding NW Natural's general rate case filed in December 2019 (Order). The Order provides for a total revenue requirement increase of approximately $45 million over revenues from existing rates. The revenue requirement is based on the following assumptions:
•Capital structure of 50% common equity and 50% long-term debt;
•Return on equity of 9.4%;
•Cost of capital of 6.965%; and
•Average rate base of $1.44 billion or an increase of $242.1 million since the last rate case.
Under the terms of the Order, NW Natural was authorized to begin to recover the expense associated with the Oregon Corporate Activity Tax (CAT) as a component of base rates. See "Corporate Activity Tax" below.
In NW Natural's previous Oregon rate case in March 2019, the OPUC ordered specific terms by which excess deferred income taxes (EDIT) associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) would be provided to customers directly or applied for the benefit of customers. The Order in the most recent Oregon rate case directs NW Natural to include a true-up credit to customers of approximately $1.0 million as a temporary rate adjustment to be amortized over the 2020-21 PGA year.
In addition, the Order approves the application of NW Natural’s decoupling calculation for the months of November and May to the month of April. The decoupling mechanism is intended to encourage customers to conserve energy without adversely affecting earnings due to reductions in sales volumes.
From November 1, 2018 through October 31, 2020, the OPUC authorized rates to customers based on an ROE of 9.4%, an overall rate of return of 7.317%, and a capital structure of 50% common equity and 50% long-term debt. In March 2019, the OPUC issued an order resolving the remaining matters of the rate case regarding recovery of NW Natural's pension balancing account and the return of tax reform benefits to customers. For additional information, see "Rate Mechanisms - Pension Cost Deferral and Pension Balancing Account" and "Rate Mechanisms - Tax Reform Deferral" below.
WASHINGTON. Effective November 1, 2019, the WUTC authorized rates to customers based on an ROE of 9.4% and an overall rate of return of 7.161% with a capital structure of 50.0% long-term debt, 1.0% short-term debt, and 49.0% common equity. The WUTC also authorized the recovery of environmental remediation expenses allocable to Washington customers through an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) and directed NW Natural to provide federal tax reform benefits to customers. See "Rate Mechanisms - Environmental Cost Deferral and Recovery - Washington ECRM" and "Rate Mechanisms -Tax Reform Deferral" below.
From January 1, 2009, through October 31, 2019, the WUTC authorized rates to customers based on an ROE of 10.1% and an overall rate of return of 8.4% with a capital structure of 51% common equity, 5% short-term debt, and 44% long-term debt.
FERC. NW Natural is required under its Mist interstate storage certificate authority and rate approval orders to file every five years either a petition for rate approval or a cost and revenue study to change or justify maintaining the existing rates for its interstate storage services. On October 12, 2018, NW Natural filed a rate petition with FERC for revised cost-based maximum rates, which incorporated the new federal corporate income tax rate. The revised rates were effective beginning November 1, 2018.
NW Natural continuously evaluates the need for rate cases in its jurisdictions.
Regulatory Proceeding Updates
2021 WASHINGTON RATE CASE. On December 18, 2020, NW Natural filed a request for a general rate increase with the WUTC. The filing includes a requested increase in annual revenue requirements over two years, consisting of an 8.0% or $6.3 million increase in the first year beginning November 1, 2021 (Year One), and a 3.7% or $3.2 million increase in the second year beginning November 1, 2022 (Year Two). NW Natural is also requesting a $2.2 million, or 3%, offset to rates in the first year via suspension of amortization of a regulatory asset associated with NW Natural’s energy efficiency programs and via application of proceeds from the sale of real property in Portland, Oregon, which would reduce the Year One rate increase to approximately 5%.
The requested increase is intended to recover operating costs and investments made in the distribution system, underground storage facility, operations facilities, including improvements to the resource facility in Vancouver, Washington, and upgrades of critical information technology, including NW Natural’s enterprise resource planning system, and is based upon the following assumptions or requests:
•Capital structure of 50% long-term debt, 1% short-term debt, and 49% common equity;
•Return on equity of 9.4%
•Cost of capital of 6.913%; and
•Average rate base of $194.7 million, an increase of $20.9 million since the last rate case for capital expenditures already expended at the time of filing, with an additional expected $31.2 million increase in Year One, and an additional expected $21.4 million increase in Year Two, with the increases in Year One and Year Two relating to expected capital expenditures in those years.
NW Natural’s filing will be reviewed by the WUTC and other stakeholders. The process is anticipated to take up to 11 months. NW Natural has requested that the new rates take effect November 1, 2021.
2020 OREGON & WASHINGTON DEFERRAL. In December 2020, a vehicle crashed into a Williams NW Pipeline district regulator, causing more than 5,500 NW Natural customers in the Hood River, Oregon area and White Salmon, Washington area to lose natural gas service. NW Natural recorded a regulatory asset of approximately $0.8 million for costs incurred to restore service. NW Natural filed requests for deferrals with the OPUC and WUTC and plans to seek recovery of these costs in future ratemaking proceedings.
Rate Mechanisms
During 2020 and 2019, NW Natural's key approved rates and recovery mechanisms for each service area included:
Annually, or more often if circumstances warrant, NW Natural reviews all regulatory assets for recoverability. If NW Natural should determine all or a portion of these regulatory assets no longer meet the criteria for continued application of regulatory accounting, then NW Natural would be required to write-off the net unrecoverable balances against earnings in the period such a determination was made.
PURCHASED GAS ADJUSTMENT. Rate changes are established for NW Natural each year under PGA mechanisms in Oregon and Washington to reflect changes in the expected cost of natural gas commodity purchases. The PGA filings include gas costs under spot purchases as well as contract supplies, gas cost hedges, gas costs from the withdrawal of storage inventories, the production of gas reserves, interstate pipeline demand costs, temporary rate adjustments, which amortize balances of deferred regulatory accounts, and the removal of temporary rate adjustments effective for the previous year.
Each year, NW Natural hedges gas prices on a portion of NW Natural's annual sales requirement based on normal weather, including both physical and financial hedges. NW Natural entered the 2020-21 gas year with its forecasted sales volumes hedged at 53% in financial swap and option contracts, including hedging of 56% in Oregon and 28% in Washington, and 17% in physical gas supplies, including hedging of 18% in Oregon and 13% in Washington. The percentage of total hedged for Oregon was approximately 74% and approximately 41% for Washington.
NW Natural is also hedged between 1% and 43% for annual requirements over the subsequent five gas years, which consists of between 1% and 41% in Oregon and between 0% and 58% in Washington. Hedge levels are subject to change based on actual load volumes, which depend to a certain extent on weather, economic conditions, and estimated gas reserve production. Also, gas storage inventory levels may increase or decrease with storage expansion, changes in storage contracts with third parties, variations in the heat content of the gas, and/or storage recall by NW Natural.
In September 2020, NW Natural filed its annual PGA and received OPUC and WUTC approval in October 2020. PGA rate changes were effective November 1, 2020. Rates and hedging approaches may vary between states due to different rate structures and mechanisms.
Under the current PGA mechanism in Oregon, there is an incentive sharing provision whereby NW Natural is required to select each year an 80% deferral or a 90% deferral of higher or lower actual gas costs compared to estimated PGA prices, such that the impact on NW Natural's current earnings from the incentive sharing is either 20% or 10% of the difference between actual and estimated gas costs, respectively. For the 2019-20 and 2020-21 gas years, NW Natural selected the 90% deferral option. Under the Washington PGA mechanism, NW Natural defers 100% of the higher or lower actual gas costs, and those gas cost differences are passed on to customers through the annual PGA rate adjustment.
EARNINGS TEST REVIEW. NW Natural is subject to an annual earnings review in Oregon to determine if the NGD business is earning above its authorized ROE threshold. If NGD business earnings exceed a specific ROE level, then 33% of the amount above that level is required to be deferred or refunded to customers. Under this provision, if NW Natural selects the 80% deferral gas cost option, then NW Natural retains all earnings up to 150 basis points above the currently authorized ROE. If NW Natural selects the 90% deferral option, then it retains all earnings up to 100 basis points above the currently authorized ROE. For the 2019-20 and 2020-21 gas years, NW Natural selected the 90% deferral option. The ROE threshold is subject to adjustment annually based on movements in long-term interest rates. For calendar years 2018, 2019, and 2020, the ROE threshold was 10.48%, 10.24%, and 10.40%, respectively. There were no refunds required for 2018 and 2019. NW Natural does not expect a refund for 2020 based on results, and anticipates filing its 2020 earnings test in May 2021.
GAS RESERVES. In 2011, the OPUC approved the Encana gas reserves transaction to provide long-term gas price protection for NGD business customers and determined costs under the agreement would be recovered on an ongoing basis through the annual PGA mechanism. Gas produced from NW Natural's interests is sold at then prevailing market prices, and revenues from such sales, net of associated operating and production costs and amortization, are included in cost of gas. The cost of gas, including a carrying cost for the rate base investment made under the original agreement, is included in NW Natural's annual Oregon PGA filing, which allows NW Natural to recover these costs through customer rates. The net investment under the original agreement earns a rate of return.
In 2014, NW Natural amended the original gas reserves agreement in response to Encana's sale of its interest in the Jonah field located in Wyoming to Jonah Energy. Under the amended agreement with Jonah Energy, NW Natural has the option to invest in additional wells on a well-by-well basis with drilling costs and resulting gas volumes shared at the amended proportionate working interest for each well in which NW Natural invests. Volumes produced from the additional wells drilled after the amended agreement are included in NW Natural's Oregon PGA at a fixed rate of $0.4725 per therm. NW Natural has not participated in additional wells since 2014.
DECOUPLING. In Oregon, NW Natural has a decoupling mechanism. Decoupling is intended to break the link between earnings and the quantity of gas consumed by customers, removing any financial incentive to discourage customers’ efforts to conserve energy. The Oregon decoupling baseline usage per customer was reset in the 2020 Oregon general rate case. The Order in the 2020 Oregon general rate case also approved of extending NW Natural’s decoupling calculation for the months of November and May to the month of April. This mechanism employs a use-per-customer decoupling calculation, which adjusts margin revenues to account for the difference between actual and expected customer volumes. The margin adjustment resulting from differences between actual and expected volumes under the decoupling component is recorded to a deferral account, which is included in the annual PGA filing.
WARM. In Oregon, NW Natural has an approved weather normalization mechanism, which is applied to residential and small commercial customer bills. This mechanism is designed to help stabilize the collection of fixed costs by adjusting residential and small commercial customer billings based on temperature variances from average weather, with rate decreases when the weather is colder than average and rate increases when the weather is warmer than average. The mechanism is applied to bills from December through mid-May of each heating season. The mechanism adjusts the margin component of customers’ rates to reflect average weather, which uses the 25-year average temperature for each day of the billing period. Daily average temperatures and 25-year average temperatures are based on a set point temperature of 59 degrees Fahrenheit for residential customers and 58 degrees Fahrenheit for commercial customers. The collections of any unbilled WARM amounts due to tariff caps and floors are deferred and earn a carrying charge until collected, or returned, in the PGA the following year. Residential and small commercial customers in Oregon are allowed to opt out of the weather normalization mechanism, and as of December 31, 2020, 8% of total eligible customers had opted out. NW Natural does not have a weather normalization mechanism approved for Washington customers, which account for about 12% of total customers. See "Business Segment-Natural Gas Distribution" below.
INDUSTRIAL TARIFFS. The OPUC and WUTC have approved tariffs covering NGD service to major industrial customers, which are intended to give NW Natural certainty in the level of gas supplies needed to serve this customer group. The approved terms include, among other things, an annual election period, special pricing provisions for out-of-cycle changes, and a requirement that industrial customers complete the term of their service election under NW Natural's annual PGA tariff.
ENVIRONMENTAL COST DEFERRAL AND RECOVERY. NW Natural has authorizations in Oregon and Washington to defer costs related to remediation of properties that are owned or were previously owned by NW Natural. In Oregon, a Site Remediation and Recovery Mechanism (SRRM) is currently in place to recover prudently incurred costs allocable to Oregon customers, subject to an earnings test. Effective beginning November 1, 2019, the WUTC authorized an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) for recovery of prudently incurred costs allocable to Washington customers.
Oregon SRRM
Under the Oregon SRRM collection process, there are three types of deferred environmental remediation expense:
•Pre-review - This class of costs represents remediation spend that has not yet been deemed prudent by the OPUC. Carrying costs on these remediation expenses are recorded at NW Natural's authorized cost of capital. NW Natural anticipates the prudence review for annual costs and approval of the earnings test prescribed by the OPUC to occur by the third quarter of the following year.
•Post-review - This class of costs represents remediation spend that has been deemed prudent and allowed after applying the earnings test, but is not yet included in amortization. NW Natural earns a carrying cost on these amounts at a rate equal to the five-year treasury rate plus 100 basis points.
•Amortization - This class of costs represents amounts included in current customer rates for collection and is calculated as one-fifth of the post-review deferred balance. NW Natural earns a carrying cost equal to the amortization rate determined annually by the OPUC, which approximates a short-term borrowing rate. NW Natural included $4.2 million and $5.1 million of deferred remediation expense approved by the OPUC for collection during the 2020-21 and 2019-20 PGA years, respectively.
In addition, the SRRM also provides for the annual collection of $5.0 million from Oregon customers through a tariff rider. As it collects amounts from customers, NW Natural recognizes these collections as revenue net of any earnings test adjustments and separately amortizes an equal and offsetting amount of the deferred regulatory asset balance through the environmental remediation operating expense line shown separately in the operating expenses section of the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). See Note 18 for more information on our environmental matters.
The SRRM earnings test is an annual review of adjusted NGD ROE compared to authorized NGD ROE. To apply the earnings test NW Natural must first determine what if any costs are subject to the test through the following calculation:
(1) Prior year carry-over results when the prior year amount transferred to post-review is negative. The negative amount is carried over to offset annual spend in the following year.
(2) Deferred interest is added to annual spend to the extent the spend is recoverable.
To the extent the NGD business earns at or below its authorized ROE as defined in the SRRM, the total amount transferred to post-review is recoverable through the SRRM. To the extent more than authorized ROE is earned in a year, the amount transferred to post-review would be reduced by those earnings that exceed its authorized ROE.
For 2020, NW Natural has performed this test, which is anticipated to be submitted to the OPUC in May 2021. No earnings test adjustment is expected for 2020.
Washington ECRM
The ECRM established by the WUTC order effective November 1, 2019 permits NW Natural’s recovery of environmental remediation expenses allocable to Washington customers. These expenses represent 3.32% of costs associated with remediation of sites that historically served both Oregon and Washington customers. The order allows for recovery of past deferred and future prudently incurred remediation costs allocable to Washington through application of insurance proceeds and collections from customers. Prudently incurred costs that were deferred from the initial deferral authorization in February 2011 through June 2019 are to be fully offset with insurance proceeds, with any remaining insurance proceeds to be amortized over a 10.5 year period. On an annual basis, NW Natural will file for a prudence determination and a request to recover remediation expenditures in excess of insurance amortizations in the following year's customer rates. After insurance proceeds are fully amortized, if in a particular year the request to collect deferred amounts exceeds one percent of Washington normalized revenues, then the excess will be collected over three years with interest. On October 29, 2020, NW Natural's first environmental cost recovery filing was approved by the WUTC covering the period from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019.
PENSION COST DEFERRAL AND PENSION BALANCING ACCOUNT. From 2011 through October 2018, the OPUC authorized a regulatory mechanism in which NW Natural deferred annual pension expenses above the amount set in rates, with recovery of these deferred amounts through the implementation of a balancing account, which included the expectation of higher and lower pension expenses in future years. During this period the mechanism permitted NW Natural to accrue interest on the account balance at the NGD business' authorized rate of return. The OPUC ordered the freezing of the account in October 2018 with pension expenses to be recovered through rates beginning November 1, 2018.
In March 2019, the OPUC issued an order outlining how the account would be recovered. As a result, the following items were recorded in the first quarter of 2019:
•Applied $7.1 million of TCJA benefits deferred from January 1, 2018 to October 31, 2018, as a reduction against the pension balancing account;
•Credited to customers' benefit $5.4 million of deferred income taxes as a reduction against the pension balancing account;
•Reduced the amount of the frozen balancing account by an additional $10.5 million; and
•Reduced the interest rate on the pension balancing account from NW Natural's authorized rate of return of 7.317% to 4.3%.
The items above resulted in the recovery of $12.5 million of deferred pension expenses by applying deferred tax benefits against the pension balancing account. Recognition of these items resulted in higher operations and maintenance expense and other income (expense), net with offsetting benefits recognized in operating revenues and income tax expense. Additional pension expenses of $10.5 million from the regulatory disallowance were also recognized in operations and maintenance expense and other income (expense), net. Deferred regulatory interest income of $3.8 million was also realized in other income (expense), net in 2019.
Commencing April 1, 2019, the OPUC also authorized the collection of the remainder of the pension balancing account over ten years in a customer tariff of $7.3 million per year. Deferred pension expense recoveries, inclusive of the application of the TCJA benefits described above, were $7.1 million and $16.8 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Pension expense deferrals, excluding interest, were $10.3 million in 2018.
TAX REFORM DEFERRAL. In December 2017, NW Natural filed applications with the OPUC and WUTC to defer the overall net benefit associated with the TCJA that was enacted on December 22, 2017. In February 2019, NW Natural and the other parties to the 2018 Oregon rate case agreed upon terms by which the deferred benefits would be returned to customers via a joint stipulation filed with the OPUC. In March 2019, the OPUC approved the terms in their entirety as follows:
•Applied $7.1 million of TCJA benefits deferred from January 1, 2018 to October 31, 2018, as a reduction against the pension balancing account; and
•Credited to customers' benefit $5.4 million of deferred income taxes as a reduction against the pension balancing account;
Commencing April 1, 2019, the OPUC also ordered the following:
•Provide an annual credit to base rates of $3.4 million for excess deferred income taxes to all customers, subject to the average rate assumption method;
•Provide an additional annual credit of $3.0 million to sales service customers for five years; and
•An increase in rate base of $15.4 million, and corresponding increase to revenue requirement of $1.4 million.
If NW Natural files a general rate case within five years of the date of the March 2019 order, this revenue requirement may be adjusted as part of that general rate case. On December 30, 2019, NW Natural filed a general rate case with the OPUC, which is within five years from the date of the March 2019 order and the order in that rate case adjusted this revenue requirement. For more information, see "Most Recent Completed General Rate Cases" above.
On October 21, 2019 the WUTC issued an order dictating the means by which deferred tax reform benefits would be returned to customers beginning November 1, 2019. The order directs NW Natural to provide customers with a rate reduction of $2.1 million over one year to reflect the benefit of the lower federal corporate income tax rate accumulating from January 1, 2018 through October 31, 2019, and provides an additional annual rate reduction initially set at approximately $0.5 million to reflect a benefit from the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities of approximately $15.0 million.
INTERSTATE STORAGE AND ASSET MANAGEMENT SHARING. On an annual basis, NW Natural credits amounts to Oregon and Washington customers as part of a regulatory incentive sharing mechanism related to net revenues earned from Mist gas storage and asset management activities. Previously, amounts were credited to Oregon customers in June. Starting in 2021, Oregon customers will receive this credit in February per the 2020 Oregon rate case order. Credits are given to customers in Washington as reductions in rates through the annual PGA filing in November.
The following table presents the credits to NGD customers:
HOLDING COMPANY REORGANIZATION. On October 1, 2018, we completed the reorganization to a holding company structure. There were a number of conditions under the agreement with the OPUC and the WUTC related to the formation of a holding company structure. One of the conditions is that, for three years following formation of the holding company, NW Natural was required to provide an annual $500,000 credit to Oregon customers and a $55,000 credit to Washington customers. The credits to both Oregon and Washington customers were given in conjunction with the respective PGA filings with the rate adjustments commencing on November 1 of the applicable PGA year.
COVID-19 PROCESS AND DEFERRAL DOCKETS. During 2020, our regulated utilities, other utilities, stakeholders, and public utility commissions worked together to determine the best way to continue protecting utility customers during and after the pandemic. In September 2020, the OPUC issued an order authorizing OPUC staff to execute a term sheet with NW Natural and other parties to the proceeding, which includes provisions for lifting moratoriums on disconnections for nonpayment and late fees; extending timeframes for repayments and deferred payment plans; establishing timelines for reinstitution of service disconnection and reconnection fees; and allowing for deferred accounting of COVID-19 related costs. The term sheet also directs NW Natural to work with the parties to provide bill payment assistance, petition the Oregon legislature for bill payment assistance funding, explore the applicability of decoupling charges for a period of time, and participate in an investigation and discussion surrounding low income customers and social and environmental justice. The stipulation incorporating the term sheet was approved by the OPUC in November 2020. A term sheet was approved by the WUTC in October 2020 that provides similar guidance on key items such as the timing of lifting moratoriums on disconnections, resuming the collection process, and bill assistance and payment plans.
Additionally, both Oregon and Washington approved our applications to defer certain COVID-19 related costs in 2020.
Costs that may be recoverable include, but are not limited to, the following: personal protective equipment, cleaning supplies and services, bad debt expense, financing costs to secure liquidity, and certain lost revenue, net of offsetting direct expense reductions associated with COVID-19. As of December 31, 2020, we estimated that approximately $6.1 million of the financial effects related to COVID-19 in 2020 could be recoverable. As a result, we recorded a regulatory asset of approximately $4.8 million for incurred costs as of December 31, 2020. In addition, we expect to recognize revenue in a future period for an additional $1.3 million related to forgone late fee revenue.
The following table outlines some of the key items approved by the respective Commissions:
* Jurisdiction retains discretion to re-evaluate date based on ongoing pandemic and economic conditions.
RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS. On June 19, 2019, the Oregon legislature passed Senate Bill 98 (SB98), which enables natural gas utilities to procure or develop RNG on behalf of their Oregon customers. RNG is produced from organic materials like food, agricultural and forestry waste, wastewater, or landfills. Methane is captured from these organic materials as they decompose and is conditioned to pipeline quality, so it can be added into the existing natural gas system, reducing net GHG emissions. The bill was signed into law by the governor in July 2019, and subsequently, the OPUC opened a docket in August 2019 regarding the rules for the bill. After working with parties, the OPUC adopted final rules in July 2020.
SB98 and the rules outline the following parameters for the RNG program including: setting voluntary goals for adding as much as 30% renewable natural gas into the state’s pipeline system by 2050; enabling gas utilities to invest in and own the cleaning and conditioning equipment required to bring raw biogas and landfill gas up to pipeline quality, as well as the facilities to connect to the local gas distribution system; and allowing up to 5% of a utility’s revenue requirement to be used to cover the incremental cost or investment in renewable natural gas infrastructure.
Further, the new law supports all forms of renewable natural gas including renewable hydrogen, which is made from excess wind, solar and hydro power. Renewable hydrogen can be used for the transportation system, industrial use, or blended into the natural gas pipeline system.
In its initial RNG contract under SB98, NW Natural began a partnership with BioCarbN, a developer and operator of sustainable infrastructure projects, to convert methane into RNG. Under this partnership, NW Natural has the ability to invest up to an estimated $38 million in four separate RNG development projects that will access biogas derived from water treatment at Tyson Foods' processing plants, subject to approval by all parties. In December 2020, NW Natural exercised its option for the first development project in Nebraska, initiating investment in an estimated $8 million project, which is expected to begin producing RNG in late 2021.
CORPORATE ACTIVITY TAX. In 2019, the State of Oregon enacted a Corporate Activity Tax (CAT) that is applicable to all businesses with annual Oregon gross revenue in excess of $1 million. The CAT is in addition to the state's corporate income tax and imposes a 0.57% tax on certain Oregon gross receipts less a reduction for a portion of cost of goods sold or labor. The CAT legislation became effective September 29, 2019 and applies to calendar years beginning January 1, 2020. Under the terms of the Order in NW Natural's 2020 Oregon general rate case, NW Natural is authorized to begin to recover the expense associated with the CAT as a component of base rates. NW Natural is also directed to adjust the amount recovered for the CAT in each annual PGA to reflect changes in gross revenue and cost of goods sold that occur as a result of the PGA.
Beginning on the November 1, 2020 rate effective date, NW Natural expects to recover an additional $3.15 million in revenue requirement for the CAT. The Order also provides for certain adjustments if there are legislative, rulemaking, judicial, or policy decisions that would cause the calculation methodology used by NW Natural for the CAT to vary in a fundamental way. Additionally, the CAT deferred from January 2020 through June 2020 will be added to and amortized over the 2020-21 PGA gas year, and the CAT amounts deferred from July 2020 through the effective date of the rate case will be amortized over the 2021-22 PGA year.
WATER UTILITIES. In 2020, NW Holdings, through its water subsidiaries, continued acquiring water utilities. The following notable transactions received regulatory approval and were closed during 2020:
•Suncadia Water Company, LLC and Suncadia Environmental, LLC - NWN Water of Washington received regulatory approval for the purchase of Suncadia Water in January 2020. Suncadia Environmental is not currently subject to the WUTC's jurisdiction. The transaction closed in January 2020.
•T&W Water Service Company - NWN Water of Texas received regulatory approval from the Public Utility Commission of Texas for the T&W Water Service Company acquisition in February 2020 and subsequently the transaction closed in March 2020.
In addition to the acquisitions above, we closed three acquisitions near existing water utilities during 2020. While COVID-19 has restricted certain activities, we continue to pursue water acquisitions and expect to return to normal business development activities as the pandemic eases and travel and commerce return to previous levels. For our acquired water utilities, we've begun to assess the need for general rate cases, and in 2020, we filed general rate cases for three water utilities to support infrastructure investments for safety and reliability.
OREGON EXECUTIVE ORDER. On March 10, 2020, the governor of Oregon issued an executive order (EO) establishing GHG emissions reduction goals of at least 45% below 1990 emission levels by 2035 and at least 80% below 1990 emission levels by 2050 and directed state agencies and commissions to facilitate such GHG emission goals targeting a variety of sources and industries. Although the EO does not specifically direct actions of natural gas distribution businesses, the OPUC is directed to prioritize proceedings and activities that advance decarbonization in the utility sector, mitigate energy burden experienced by utility customers and ensure system reliability and resource adequacy. The EO also directs other agencies to cap and reduce GHG emissions from transportation fuels and all other liquid and gaseous fuels, including natural gas, adopt building energy efficiency goals for new building construction, reduce methane gas emissions from landfills and food waste, and submit a proposal for adoption of state goals for carbon sequestration and storage by Oregon’s forest, wetlands and agricultural lands. These agencies and commissions are currently engaged in various stages of their rulemaking processes and are currently expected to complete those processes in the next 12 to 24 months. NW Natural is actively engaged with Oregon state regulatory entities and holds a seat on the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality rules advisory committee, which is considering the cap and reduce rules.
INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLAN (IRP). NW Natural generally files a full IRP biennially for Oregon and Washington with the OPUC and WUTC, respectively. NW Natural jointly filed its 2018 IRP for both Oregon and Washington in August 2018, and received both a letter of compliance from the WUTC and acknowledgment by the OPUC in February 2019. The 2018 IRP included analysis of different scenarios, examining several potential future states and the corresponding least cost, least risk resource acquisition strategies. In addition to these strategies, the 2018 IRP published an emissions forecast for each of these potential futures. NW Natural expects to file an update to the 2018 IRP in March 2021.
The development of an IRP filing is an extensive and complex process that engages multiple stakeholders in an effort to build a robust and commonly understood analysis. The final product is intended to provide a long-term outlook of the supply-side and demand-side resource requirements for reliable and low cost natural gas service. The IRP examines and analyses uncertainties in the planning process, including potential changes in governmental and regulatory policies. As a result of the EO issued by the governor of Oregon, new regulations and requirements are currently being developed in the state of Oregon, which have the potential to impact long-term resource decisions. In order to reflect the outcomes of the EO proceedings, the time to file NW Natural's next full IRP was extended to July 2022.
Business Segment - Natural Gas Distribution (NGD)
NGD margin results are primarily affected by customer growth, revenues from rate-base additions, and, to a certain extent, by changes in delivered volumes due to weather and customers’ gas usage patterns. In Oregon, NW Natural has a conservation tariff (also called the decoupling mechanism), which adjusts margin up or down each month through a deferred regulatory accounting adjustment designed to offset changes resulting from increases or decreases in average use by residential and commercial customers. NW Natural also has a weather normalization tariff in Oregon, WARM, which adjusts customer bills up or down to offset changes in margin resulting from above- or below-average temperatures during the winter heating season. Residential and commercial customers in Oregon are allowed to opt out of the weather normalization mechanism, and as of December 31, 2020, approximately 8% of total eligible customers had opted out. NW Natural does not have a weather normalization mechanism approved for Washington customers, which account for about 12% of total customers. The decoupling and WARM mechanisms are designed to reduce, but not eliminate, the volatility of customer bills and natural gas distribution earnings. See "Regulatory Matters-Rate Mechanisms" above.
The NGD business is primarily seasonal in nature due to higher gas usage by residential and commercial customers during the cold winter heating months. Other categories of customers experience seasonality in their usage but to a lesser extent. Seasonality affects the comparability of the results of operations of the NGD business across quarters but not across years.
NGD segment highlights include:
(1) See Natural Gas Distribution Margin Table below for additional detail.
2020 COMPARED TO 2019. NGD net income was $63.6 million in 2020 compared to $60.8 million in 2019. The primary factors contributing to the increase in NGD net income were as follows:
•a $15.4 million increase in NGD margin primarily due to:
▪a $17.7 million increase due to new customer rates from the 2020 Oregon and 2019 Washington rate cases;
▪a $7.6 million increase from revenue generated from NW Natural's North Mist storage contract which commenced service in May 2019 and is included within other regulated services within NGD margin; and
▪a $3.9 million increase from customer growth; partially offset by
▪a $7.1 million decrease due to revenue recognized in 2019 as part of the settlement and recovery of NW Natural's pension balancing account, which was entirely offset by pension expenses within operations and maintenance expense and other income (expense), net, and which did not recur in 2020;
▪a $4.0 million decrease primarily due to lower overrun and entitlement fees;
▪a $2.7 million decrease driven by warmer than average weather in 2020 compared average weather in 2019; and
▪a $1.3 million decrease related to the temporary suspension of late fees during the COVID-19 pandemic.
In addition to the increase in margin, NGD net income for 2020 reflects:
•a benefit of $12.5 million from pension expenses recognized in 2019 associated with recoveries of NW Natural's pension balancing account which did not recur in 2020. Approximately $4.6 million was recorded in operations and maintenance expense and $7.9 million was recorded in other income (expense), net; and
•a benefit of $10.5 million from a 2019 regulatory pension disallowance which did not recur in 2020. Approximately $3.9 million was recorded in operations and maintenance expense and $6.6 million was recorded in other income (expense), net.
The increases in net income above are partially offset by the following:
•an $8.2 million increase in operations and maintenance expense related to higher compensation costs, contractor expenses, and moving and lease costs for a new headquarters and operations center;
•a $13.8 million increase in depreciation and general tax expenses due to NGD plant additions, including the North Mist gas storage facility;
•a $7.3 million decrease in other income (expense), net primarily related to interest income recognized in 2019 associated with the 2019 recoveries of the pension balancing account and ongoing regulatory amortization of the remaining pension balancing account deferral, which began in April 2019; and
•a $6.9 million higher income tax reflecting a non-recurring tax benefit associated with the March 2019 Oregon order, partially offset by the ongoing amortization of TCJA benefits.
Total natural gas sold and delivered in 2020 decreased 6% over 2019 primarily due to the impact of weather that was 12% warmer than average in 2020 compared to weather that was average in 2019.
2019 COMPARED TO 2018. NGD net income was $60.8 million in 2019 compared to $57.5 million in 2018. The primary factors contributing to the increase in NGD net income were as follows:
•a $39.0 million increase in NGD margin primarily due to:
▪a $16.2 million increase due to new customer rates from the 2018 Oregon rate case and 2019 Washington rate case;
▪a $6.1 million increase from customer growth;
▪an $11.8 million increase from revenue generated from NW Natural's North Mist storage contract which commenced service in May 2019 and is included within other regulated services within NGD margin;
▪a $7.1 million increase due to revenues recognized in association with recoveries of NW Natural's pension balancing account, which are entirely offset by pension expenses within operations and maintenance and other income (expense), net; and
▪a $3.7 million increase driven by colder than average weather in the first quarter of 2019 coupled with higher fee revenues from interruptible customers as a result of system restrictions; partially offset by
▪a $3.2 million decrease due to an adjustment to the tax reform deferral estimate in 2018; and
▪a $1.5 million decrease due to a regulatory disallowance of deferred environmental expenditures as a result of the 2019 Washington rate case.
•a $9.4 million decrease in income tax expense primarily due to the income tax implications of the March 2019 OPUC order, of which $5.4 million was offset by pension expenses as discussed above, with the remainder driven by the return of deferred TCJA benefit credits to customers and lower pretax income in 2019 compared to 2018; and
•a $5.8 million increase in deferred regulatory interest income in other income (expense), net, of which $5.1 million relates to interest recognized in association with the OPUC order discussed above.
The increases were partially offset by:
•a $34.4 million increase in pension costs within operations and maintenance expense and other income (expense), net, of which $12.5 million relates to costs which were entirely offset by revenues and income tax benefits in the March 2019 OPUC order, and $10.5 million relates to the regulatory pension disallowance included in the March 2019 OPUC order. In addition, there was a $11.4 million increase in pension expenses as NW Natural began collecting ongoing pension costs through customer rates on November 1, 2018 and began collecting deferred pension costs through customer rates on April 1, 2019 rather than deferring a portion to the balancing account;
•a $5.7 million increase in depreciation expense due to NGD plant additions;
•a $4.6 million increase in interest expense driven by $2.3 million higher interest on long term debt, $1.2 million lower AFUDC debt interest income, and $0.9 million higher commercial paper and line of credit interest;
•a $3.3 million decrease in AFUDC equity interest; and
•a $2.9 million increase in NGD segment operations and maintenance expenses primarily attributable to annual employee cost increases.
Total natural gas sold and delivered in 2019 increased 8% over 2018 primarily due to the impact of weather that was average in 2019 compared to weather that was 15% warmer than average in 2018.
NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION MARGIN TABLE. The following table summarizes the composition of NGD gas volumes, revenues, and cost of sales:
(1) Amounts reported as margin for each category of meters are operating revenues, which are net of revenue taxes, less cost of gas and environmental remediation expense.
(2) Other margin adjustments include net revenue recoveries of $6.2 million and revenue deferrals of $7.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, associated with the decline of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate.
(3) Heating degree days are units of measure reflecting temperature-sensitive consumption of natural gas, calculated by subtracting the average of a day's high and low temperatures from 59 degrees Fahrenheit.
(4) Average weather represents the 25-year average of heating degree days. Beginning November 1, 2020, average weather is calculated over the period June 1, 1994 through May 31, 2019, as determined in NW Natural’s 2020 Oregon general rate case. From November 1, 2018 through October 31, 2020, average weather was calculated over the period May 31, 1992 through May 30, 2017, as determined in NW Natural's 2018 Oregon general rate case. Prior to November 1, 2018, average weather was calculated over the period 1986 - 2010, as determined in NW Natural's 2012 Oregon general rate case.
Residential and Commercial Sales
The primary factors that impact results of operations in the residential and commercial markets are customer growth, seasonal weather patterns, energy prices, competition from other energy sources, and economic conditions in our service areas. The impact of weather on margin is significantly reduced through NW Natural's weather normalization mechanism in Oregon; approximately 82% of NW Natural's total customers are covered under this mechanism. The remaining customers either opt out of the mechanism or are located in Washington, which does not have a similar mechanism in place. For more information on the weather mechanism, see "Regulatory Matters-Rate Mechanisms-Weather Normalization Mechanism" above.
NGD residential and commercial sales highlights include:
2020 COMPARED TO 2019. The increases of $22.4 million in operating revenue and $19.0 million in total residential and commercial NGD margin were primarily the result of new customer rates resulting from the Oregon and Washington rate cases and customer growth. Sales volume decreased 57.0 million therms, or 8%, primarily due to warmer than average weather in 2020 compared to average weather in 2019 and lower usage from commercial customers related to the pandemic, partially offset by residential customer growth.
2019 COMPARED TO 2018. The increases of $17.2 million in operating revenue and $14.3 million in total residential and commercial NGD margin were primarily driven by new customer rates from the 2018 Oregon rate case and 2019 Washington rate case as well as sales volume increases of 73.1 million therms, or 11%, due to customer growth and average weather in 2019 compared to warmer than average weather in 2018.
Industrial Sales and Transportation
Industrial customers have the option of purchasing sales or transportation services. Under the sales service, the customer buys the gas commodity from NW Natural. Under the transportation service, the customer buys the gas commodity directly from a third-party gas marketer or supplier. The NGD gas commodity cost is primarily a pass-through cost to customers; therefore, NGD profit margins are not materially affected by an industrial customer's decision to purchase gas from third parties. Industrial and large commercial customers may also select between firm and interruptible service options, with firm services generally providing higher profit margins compared to interruptible services. To help manage gas supplies, industrial tariffs are designed to provide some certainty regarding industrial customers' volumes by requiring an annual service election which becomes effective November 1, special charges for changes between elections, and in some cases, a minimum or maximum volume requirement before changing options.
NGD industrial sales and transportation highlights include:
2020 COMPARED TO 2019. NGD volumes decreased by 15.2 million therms, or 3%, and margin decreased by $1.2 million primarily due to lower usage from a small number of industrial customers.
2019 COMPARED TO 2018. Industrial sales and transportation volumes increased by 13.8 million therms and NGD margin increased $1.2 million due to an increase in manufacturing activity in NW Natural's service territory. The increase was partially offset by a reduction in customer count, which was driven by customer elections to switch from industrial to commercial rate schedules.
Miscellaneous Revenues
Margin from miscellaneous revenues includes fee income as well as regulatory revenue adjustments, which reflect current period deferrals to and prior year amortizations from regulatory asset and liability accounts, except for gas cost deferrals which flow through cost of gas. Decoupling and other regulatory amortizations from prior year deferrals are included in revenues from residential, commercial, and industrial firm customers.
Margin from NGD miscellaneous revenues highlights include:
2020 COMPARED TO 2019. Margin from miscellaneous revenues decreased due to lower entitlement and curtailment revenues in 2020 as 2019 included higher fee revenue related to a rupture in a critical natural gas pipeline in western Canada in 2018 that disrupted gas supply to the Pacific Northwest. In addition, margin from miscellaneous revenues was negatively impacted by the moratorium on charging late or reconnection fees during the pandemic in 2020.
2019 COMPARED TO 2018. Margin from miscellaneous revenues remained flat due to continued entitlement and curtailment revenue in first quarter of 2019 related to the October 2018 Canadian pipeline event.
Other Regulated Services
Other Regulated Services primarily consist of lease revenues from NW Natural's North Mist storage facility as well as other lease revenues for compressed natural gas assets.
Other regulated services revenue highlights include:
2020 COMPARED TO 2019. Other regulated services margin increased $7.0 million due to the commencement of storage services at the North Mist expansion facility in May 2019. See Note 7 for more information regarding North Mist expansion lease accounting.
2019 COMPARED TO 2018. Other regulated services margin increased $11.8 million due to the commencement of storage services at the North Mist expansion facility in May 2019.
Cost of Gas
Cost of gas as reported by the NGD segment includes gas purchases, gas withdrawn from storage inventory, gains and losses from commodity hedges, pipeline demand costs, seasonal demand cost balancing adjustments, regulatory gas cost deferrals, gas reserves costs, and company gas use. The OPUC and WUTC generally require natural gas commodity costs to be billed to customers at the actual cost incurred, or expected to be incurred. Customer rates are set each year so that if cost estimates were met the NGD business would not earn a profit or incur a loss on gas commodity purchases; however, in Oregon we have the incentive sharing mechanism described under "Regulatory Matters-Rate Mechanisms-Purchased Gas Adjustment" above. In addition to the PGA incentive sharing mechanism, gains and losses from hedge contracts entered into after annual PGA rates are effective for Oregon customers are also required to be shared and therefore may impact net income. Further, NW Natural also has a regulatory agreement whereby it earns a rate of return on its investment in the gas reserves acquired under the original agreement with Encana and includes gas from the amended gas reserves agreement at a fixed rate of $0.4725 per therm, which are also reflected in NGD margin. See "Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" below.
Cost of gas highlights include:
2020 COMPARED TO 2019. Cost of gas increased by $7.9 million, or 3%, primarily due to a 13% increase in average cost of gas consistent with higher gas costs in the PGA; partially offset by a 7% decrease in volumes sold driven primarily by 12% warmer than average weather during 2020 as compared to average weather in 2019.
2019 COMPARED TO 2018. Cost of gas was flat compared to 2018, primarily due to the 10% increase in volumes sold driven by average weather in 2019 compared to warmer than average weather in 2018 and customer growth, primarily offset by a three cent decrease in the average cost of gas.
The effect on net income from NW Natural's Oregon gas cost incentive sharing mechanism resulted in a margin gain of $0.3 million in 2020 compared to margin loss of $1.3 million in 2019 and a slight margin loss in 2018. In 2020, actual prices were lower than the estimated prices included in customer rates during the period. In 2019, actual gas prices were higher than those included in rates during the period. In 2018, actual prices closely aligned with estimated prices included in customer rates. For a discussion of the gas cost incentive sharing mechanism, see "Regulatory Matters-Rate Mechanisms-Purchased Gas Adjustment" above.
Other
Other activities aggregated and reported as other at NW Holdings include NWN Energy's equity investment in Trail West Holdings, LLC (TWH); NNG Financial's investment in Kelso-Beaver Pipeline (KB Pipeline); and NWN Water, which owns and continues to pursue investments in the water sector. Other activities aggregated and reported as other at NW Natural include the non-NGD storage activity at Mist as well as asset management services and the appliance retail center operations. See Note 4 for further discussion of our business segment and other, as well as our direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries.
On August 6, 2020, NWN Energy completed the sale to an unrelated third party of its interest in TWH. See Note 14 for further details.
At Mist, NW Natural provides gas storage services to customers in the interstate and intrastate markets using storage capacity that has been developed in advance of NGD customers’ requirements. Pre-tax income from gas storage at Mist and asset management services is subject to revenue sharing with NGD customers.
Under this regulatory incentive sharing mechanism, NW Natural retains 80% of pre-tax income from Mist gas storage services and asset management services when the underlying costs of the capacity being used are not included in NGD business rates. The remaining 20% is credited to a deferred regulatory account for credit to NGD customers.
Through October 2018, when the capacity used was included in NGD rates, NW Natural retained 33% of pre-tax income with the remaining 67% credited to a deferred regulatory account for credit to NGD customers. In conjunction with the Oregon rate case, effective November 2018, NW Natural retains 10% of pre-tax income from such storage and asset management services and 90% is credited to NGD business customers.
The following table presents the results of activities aggregated and reported as other for both NW Holdings and NW Natural:
The significant drivers of changes in other net income discussed below apply to both NW Holdings and NW Natural.
2020 COMPARED TO 2019. Other net income increased $2.2 million and decreased $1.1 million at NW Holdings and NW Natural, respectively. The decrease at NW Natural was primarily due to lower earnings from non-NGD gas storage operations at Mist as a result of less favorable market conditions. The increase at NW Holdings was driven by higher earnings from water and wastewater utilities and lower expenses at the holding company, partially offset by the decline in other for NW Natural.
2019 COMPARED TO 2018. Other net income decreased $5.3 million and $2.5 million at NW Holdings and NW Natural, respectively. The decrease at NW Natural was primarily driven by lower asset management revenues and increased asset management revenue sharing with Oregon customers as a result of the 2018 Oregon rate case. The decrease from other NW Holdings activity was driven by increases in professional service costs and expenses associated with developing the water business.
Consolidated Operations
Operations and Maintenance
Operations and maintenance highlights include:
2020 COMPARED TO 2019. Operations and maintenance expense decreased $0.2 million for NW Natural primarily due to the following:
•a $7.4 million decrease reflecting pension expense (service cost component) recognized as part of the recovery of NW Natural's pension balancing account settlement in the Oregon rate case, which did not recur in 2020 as discussed below; and
•a $0.6 million decrease in workers compensation expense as a result of fewer claims in 2020; partially offset by
•a $4.5 million increase in contractor and professional service expenses, and moving costs, as we moved to a new headquarters and operations center;
•a $1.6 million increase related to higher compensation costs attributable to annual employee cost increases; and
•a $1.4 million increase due to higher lease expense for the new headquarters and operations center.
Operations and maintenance expense in 2020 excludes approximately $2.9 million of COVID-19 related expenses that were deferred to a regulatory asset. In addition, to mitigate the effects of the financial implications of COVID-19, management implemented temporary cost savings initiatives, which resulted in approximately $3.5 million of operations and maintenance expense savings.
Operations and maintenance expense increased $1.9 million for NW Holdings primarily due to the following:
•a $2.2 million increase in other NW Holdings operations and maintenance expense primarily due to operating expenses at our water and wastewater utilities that have been acquired since 2019; partially offset by
•a $0.2 million decrease in operations and maintenance expense at NW Natural as discussed above.
2019 COMPARED TO 2018. Operations and maintenance expense increased $21.5 million and $13.9 million for NW Holdings and NW Natural, respectively, primarily due to the following factors:
•a $12.5 million increase in pension expenses, consisting of:
•a $4.6 million increase from recovery of amounts in NW Natural's pension balancing account upon receipt of an OPUC accounting order in March 2019, which was offset within NGD margin and income tax benefits;
•a $4.0 million increase from higher pension costs as NW Natural began collecting ongoing pension costs through customer rates on November 1, 2018 and began collecting deferred pension costs through customer rates on April 1, 2019 rather than deferring a portion to the balancing account; and
•a $3.9 million increase from a regulatory pension disallowance as a result of the March 2019 OPUC order in the Oregon general rate case.
The remaining change was primarily attributable to annual employee cost increases.
The $7.6 million increase in other NW Holdings operations and maintenance expense was primarily due to expenses associated with developing the water business in 2019.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization highlights include:
2020 COMPARED TO 2019. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $11.2 million for NW Natural, primarily due to NGD plant additions and the North Mist gas storage facility that began operations and depreciating in May 2019.
Depreciation and amortization expense increased $12.2 million for NW Holdings, primarily due to a $1.0 million increase in other NW Holdings depreciation and amortization related to water and wastewater acquisitions and an $11.2 million increase at NW Natural as discussed above.
2019 COMPARED TO 2018. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $6.3 million and $5.4 million for NW Holdings and NW Natural, respectively, primarily due to NGD plant additions that included investments in natural gas transmission and distribution systems supporting customer growth, safety, reliability, facility upgrades, and enhanced technology. In addition, the North Mist gas storage facility began operations and began depreciating in May 2019. The increase in other NW Holdings depreciation and amortization was primarily due to depreciation expense at acquired water and wastewater entities.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net highlights include:
2020 COMPARED TO 2019. Other income (expense), net, increased $7.9 million at NW Natural primarily due to higher 2019 pension expenses (non-service cost component) recognized as part of the settlement and recovery of NW Natural's pension balancing account, which did not recur in 2020. Other income (expense), net, increased $8.9 million at NW Holdings due to an increase of $1.0 million in other NW Holdings activity and a $7.9 million increase at NW Natural as discussed above.
2019 COMPARED TO 2018. Other income (expense), net, decreased $19.2 million and $19.4 million at NW Holdings and NW Natural, respectively. The decrease was primarily driven by activity in NW Natural's pension balancing account as described below. In addition, net interest income on deferred regulatory accounts increased $5.5 million primarily due to $5.1 million of deferred equity interest income recognized in 2019 in conjunction with amortization of the pension balancing account. Interest income from the equity portion of AFUDC decreased $3.3 million, primarily driven by the placement of the North Mist facility into service in May 2019.
Pension Balancing Account
From 2011 through October 31, 2018, NW Natural had OPUC approval to defer certain pension costs in excess of what was recovered in customer rates. This pension cost deferral was recorded to a regulatory balancing account, which stabilized the amount of pension expense recognized each year in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Total pension cost deferrals, excluding interest, were $10.3 million and $6.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, of which $7.9 million and $4.1 million was recognized in other income (expense), net, respectively. In October 2018, the OPUC issued an order freezing the pension balancing account and directing that future pension expense would be recovered through rates with an increase of $8.1 million to revenue requirement.
In March 2019, the OPUC issued another order allowing for the application of certain deferred revenues and tax benefits from the TCJA to reduce NW Natural's pension regulatory balancing account. A corresponding total of $12.5 million in pension expenses were recognized, of which $7.9 million was recognized in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income in the first quarter of 2019, with offsetting benefits recorded within operating revenues and income taxes. The order also directed NW Natural to reduce the balancing account by an additional, disallowed, $10.5 million, of which $6.6 million was charged to other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Amortization of the remaining amount of the balancing account began in the second quarter of 2019 in accordance with the order. Total amortization of the balancing account for the year ended December 31, 2019, inclusive of the $12.5 million recovery mentioned
above, was $16.8 million, of which $10.7 million was recorded to other income (expense), net. See Note 10 and "Regulatory Matters- Pension Cost Deferral and Pension Balancing Account" for more information regarding the pension balancing account.
Interest Expense, Net
Interest expense, net highlights include:
2020 COMPARED TO 2019. Interest expense, net, decreased $0.4 million at NW Natural primarily due to $1.7 million of lower interest on commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by $0.6 million of higher interest on long-term debt balances. NW Natural deferred to a regulatory asset approximately $1.9 million of interest on financings undertaken in March 2020 as a precautionary measure to strengthen our liquidity position as the pandemic unfolded.
Interest expense, net, increased $0.4 million at NW Holdings primarily due to $0.8 million higher interest on outstanding credit agreement balances, partially offset by a $0.4 million decrease at NW Natural as discussed above.
2019 COMPARED TO 2018. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $5.6 million and $4.3 million at NW Holdings and NW Natural, respectively. The increase at NW Natural was primarily driven by $2.3 million higher interest on long term debt balances, $1.2 million lower AFUDC debt interest income, and $0.9 million higher commercial paper and line of credit interest. The additional increase at NW Holdings was driven by interest on long-term debt at NWN Water and interest on NW Holdings' line of credit.
Income Tax Expense
NW Holdings income tax expense highlights include:
NW Natural income tax expense highlights include:
2020 COMPARED TO 2019. The effective tax rate increased by 6.9% and 6.1% at NW Holdings and NW Natural, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the 2019 tax implications of the March 2019 OPUC order, including the return of deferred TCJA benefits to customers and the regulatory pension disallowance.
2019 COMPARED TO 2018. The effective tax rate decreased by 10.2% and 9.5% at NW Holdings and NW Natural, respectively. The reduction was driven by the return of tax reform benefits to customers, including $5.4 million in tax benefits recognized in association with the OPUC 2018 Oregon rate case order which was offset by pension expenses. See "Executive Summary - Deferred TCJA benefits and timing variance" above.
Discontinued Operations
On June 20, 2018, NWN Gas Storage, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NW Holdings, entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Agreement) that provided for the sale by NWN Gas Storage of all of its membership interests in Gill Ranch. Gill Ranch owns a 75% interest in the natural gas storage facility located near Fresno, California known as the Gill Ranch Gas Storage Facility.
On December 4, 2020, NWN Gas Storage closed the sale of all the memberships interests in Gill Ranch and received payment of the initial cash purchase price of $13.5 million less the $1.0 million deposit previously paid. Furthermore, additional payments to NWN Gas Storage may be made subject to a maximum amount of $15.0 million in the aggregate (subject to a working capital adjustment) based on the economic performance of Gill Ranch each full gas storage year (April 1 of one year through March 31 of the following year) occurring after the closing and the remaining portion of the 2020-2021 gas storage year and will continue until such time as the maximum amount has been paid. The fair value of this arrangement at the closing date was zero based on a discounted cash flow forecast. Subsequent changes in the fair value will be recorded in earnings. The completion of the sale resulted in an after-tax gain of $5.9 million.
The results of Gill Ranch Storage have been determined to be discontinued operations until the date of sale and are presented separately, net of tax, from the results of continuing operations of NW Holdings for all periods presented. See Note 19 for more information on the Agreement and the results of our discontinued operations.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Capital Structure
NW Holdings' long-term goal is to maintain a strong and balanced consolidated capital structure. NW Natural targets a regulatory capital structure of 50% common equity and 50% long-term debt, which is consistent with approved regulatory allocations in Oregon, which has an allocation of 50% common equity and 50% long-term debt without recognition of short-term debt, and Washington, which has an allocation of 50% long-term debt, 1% short-term debt, and 49% common equity.
When additional capital is required, debt or equity securities are issued depending on both the target capital structure and market conditions. These sources of capital are also used to fund long-term debt retirements and short-term commercial paper maturities. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below and Note 9. Achieving our target capital structure and maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet operating requirements is necessary to maintain attractive credit ratings and provide access to the capital markets at reasonable costs.
NW Holdings' consolidated capital structure, excluding short-term debt, was as follows:
NW Natural's consolidated long-term capital structure, excluding short-term debt, was as follows:
Including short-term debt balances, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, NW Holdings' consolidated capital structure included common equity of 41.4% and 45.7%, long-term debt of 40.0% and 42.5%, and short-term debt including current maturities of long-term debt of 18.6% and 11.8%, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, NW Natural's consolidated capital structure included common equity of 42.1% and 45.9%, long-term debt of 43.2% and 42.9%, and short-term debt including current maturities of long-term debt of 14.7% and 11.2%, respectively.
During 2020, changes to NW Natural's capital structures were primarily due to increases in short-term debt and the issuance of long-term debt. Changes to NW Holdings' capital structure were primarily due to increases in short-term debt at NW Natural. See further discussion below in "Cash Flows - Financing Activities".
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, NW Holdings had approximately $30.2 million and $9.6 million, and NW Natural had approximately $10.5 million and $5.9 million, of cash and cash equivalents, respectively. In order to maintain sufficient liquidity during periods when capital markets are volatile, NW Holdings and NW Natural may elect to maintain higher cash balances and add short-term borrowing capacity. NW Holdings and NW Natural may also pre-fund their respective capital expenditures when long-term fixed rate environments are attractive.
For example, as the COVID-19 pandemic developed, in early to mid-March, markets displayed significant volatility. In response to that volatility and possible implications for the availability of access to the capital markets, NW Natural and NW Holdings undertook a number of measures to increase cash on hand to ensure ample liquidity. On March 20, 2020, NW Natural borrowed $122.0 million under its multi-year credit facility, which was not backing commercial paper. As of December 31, 2020, the credit facility was paid back in full. Similarly, on March 20, 2020, NW Holdings borrowed $35.0 million under its multi-year credit facility, of which $27.0 million had been paid back as of December 31, 2020. On March 23, 2020, NW Natural entered into a $150.0 million, 364-day term loan credit agreement, and borrowed the full amount on closing. The term loan was paid back in full and terminated in 2020. On March 31, 2020, NW Natural issued and sold $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.60% first mortgage bonds (FMBs). These actions were taken as a precaution to support sufficient cash on hand under a variety of financial
sector circumstances that could develop. Currently, NW Holdings and NW Natural expect to have ample liquidity in the form of cash on hand and from operations and available credit capacity under credit facilities to support funding needs.
NW Holdings
For NW Holdings, short-term liquidity is primarily provided by cash balances, dividends from its operating subsidiaries, in particular NW Natural, available cash from a multi-year credit facility, and short-term credit facilities. NW Holdings also has a universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC for the issuance of debt and equity securities. NW Holdings long-term debt, if any, and equity issuances are primarily used to provide equity contributions to NW Holdings’ operating subsidiaries for operating and capital expenditures and other corporate purposes. NW Holdings' issuance of securities is not subject to regulation by state public utility commissions, but the dividends from NW Natural to NW Holdings are subject to regulatory ring-fencing provisions. NW Holdings guarantees the debt of its wholly-owned subsidiary, NWN Water. See "Long-Term Debt" below for more information regarding NWN Water debt.
As part of the ring-fencing conditions agreed upon with the OPUC and WUTC in connection with the holding company reorganization, NW Natural may not pay dividends or make distributions to NW Holdings if NW Natural’s credit ratings and common equity ratio, defined as the ratio of equity to long-term debt, fall below specified levels. If NW Natural’s long-term secured credit ratings are below A- for S&P and A3 for Moody’s, dividends may be issued so long as NW Natural’s common equity ratio is 45% or more. If NW Natural’s long term secured credit ratings are below BBB for S&P and Baa2 for Moody’s, dividends may be issued so long as NW Natural’s common equity ratio is 46% or more. Dividends may not be issued if NW Natural’s long-term secured credit ratings are BB+ or below for S&P or Ba1 or below for Moody’s, or if NW Natural’s common equity ratio is below 44%, where the ratio is measured using common equity and long-term debt excluding imputed debt or debt-like lease obligations. In each case, common equity ratios are determined based on a preceding or projected 13-month average. In addition, there are certain OPUC notice requirements for dividends in excess of 5% of NW Natural’s retained earnings.
Additionally, if NW Natural’s common equity (excluding goodwill and equity associated with non-regulated assets), on a preceding or projected 13-month average basis, is less than 46% of NW Natural’s capital structure, NW Natural is required to notify the OPUC, and if the common equity ratio falls below 44%, file a plan with the OPUC to restore its equity ratio to 44%. This condition is designed to ensure NW Natural continues to be adequately capitalized under the holding company structure. Under the WUTC order, the average common equity ratio must not exceed 56%.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, NW Natural satisfied the ring-fencing provisions described above.
Based on several factors, including current cash reserves, committed credit facilities, its ability to receive dividends from its operating subsidiaries, in particular NW Natural, and an expected ability to issue long-term debt and equity securities in the capital markets, NW Holdings believes its liquidity is sufficient to meet anticipated near-term cash requirements, including all contractual obligations, investing, and financing activities as discussed in "Contractual Obligations" and "Cash Flows" below.
NW HOLDINGS DIVIDENDS. Quarterly dividends have been paid on common stock each year since NW Holdings’ predecessor’s stock was first issued to the public in 1951. Annual common stock dividend payments per share, adjusted for stock splits, have increased each year since 1956. The declarations and amount of future dividends to shareholders will depend upon earnings, cash flows, financial condition, NW Natural’s ability to pay dividends to NW Holdings and other factors. The amount and timing of dividends payable on common stock is at the sole discretion of the NW Holdings Board of Directors.
Natural Gas Distribution Segment
For the NGD business segment, short-term borrowing requirements typically peak during colder winter months when the NGD business borrows money to cover the lag between natural gas purchases and bill collections from customers. Short-term liquidity for the NGD business is primarily provided by cash balances, internal cash flow from operations, proceeds from the sale of commercial paper notes, as well as available cash from multi-year credit facilities, short-term credit facilities, company-owned life insurance policies, the sale of long-term debt, and equity contributions from NW Holdings. NW Natural's long-term debt and contributions from NW Holdings are primarily used to finance NGD capital expenditures, refinance maturing debt, and provide temporary funding for other general corporate purposes of the NGD business.
Based on its current debt ratings (see "Credit Ratings" below), NW Natural has been able to issue commercial paper and long-term debt at attractive rates and has not needed to borrow or issue letters of credit from its back-up credit facility. In the event NW Natural is not able to issue new debt due to adverse market conditions or other reasons, NW Natural expects that near-term liquidity needs can be met using internal cash flows, issuing commercial paper, receiving equity contributions from NW Holdings, or, for the NGD segment, drawing upon a committed credit facility. NW Natural also has a universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC for the issuance of secured and unsecured debt securities. As previously described, NW Natural drew on its credit facility, secured a term loan, and issued FMBs to ensure ample liquidity during market volatility resulting from the commencement of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the event senior unsecured long-term debt ratings are downgraded, or outstanding derivative positions exceed a certain credit threshold, counterparties under derivative contracts could require NW Natural to post cash, a letter of credit, or other forms of collateral, which could expose NW Natural to additional cash requirements and may trigger increases in short-term borrowings while in a net loss position. NW Natural was not required to post collateral at December 31, 2020. However, if the credit risk-
related contingent features underlying these contracts were triggered on December 31, 2020, assuming long-term debt ratings dropped to non-investment grade levels, NW Natural could have been required to post $0.1 million in collateral with our counterparties. See "Credit Ratings" below and Note 16.
Other items that may have a significant impact on NW Natural's liquidity and capital resources include NW Natural's pension contribution requirements and environmental expenditures.
PENSION CONTRIBUTION. NW Natural expects to make contributions to its company-sponsored defined benefit plan, which is closed to new employees, over the next several years until the plan is fully funded under the Pension Protection Act rules, including the rules issued under the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21), as amended. See "Application of Critical Accounting Policies-Accounting for Pensions and Postretirement Benefits" below and Note 10 for more information.
ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES. NW Natural expects to continue using cash resources to fund environmental liabilities. NW Natural has authorizations in Oregon and Washington to defer costs related to remediation of properties that are owned or were previously owned by NW Natural. In Oregon, a Site Remediation and Recovery Mechanism (SRRM) is currently in place to recovery prudently incurred costs allocable to Oregon customers, subject to an earnings test. On October 21, 2019 the WUTC authorized an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) for recovery of prudently incurred costs allocable to Washington customers beginning November 1, 2019. See Note 18, and "Results of Operations-Regulatory Matters-Environmental Cost Deferral and Recovery" above.
Based on several factors, including current credit ratings, NW Natural's commercial paper program, current cash reserves, committed credit facilities, and an expected ability to issue long-term debt and receive equity contributions from NW Holdings, NW Natural believes its liquidity is sufficient to meet anticipated near-term cash requirements, including all contractual obligations, investing, and financing activities as discussed in "Contractual Obligations" and "Cash Flows" below.
NW NATURAL DIVIDENDS. The declarations and amount of future dividends to NW Holdings will depend upon earnings, cash flows, financial condition, the satisfaction of OPUC and WUTC regulatory ring-fencing restrictions, and other factors. The amount and timing of dividends payable on common stock is subject to approval of the NW Natural Board of Directors.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS. Except for certain lease and purchase commitments, NW Holdings and NW Natural have no material off-balance sheet financing arrangements. See "Contractual Obligations" below.
Contractual Obligations
The following table shows contractual obligations from continuing operations at December 31, 2020 by maturity and type of obligation:
(1)Postretirement benefit payments primarily consists of two NW Natural items: (1) estimated pension and other postretirement plan payments, which are funded by plan assets and future cash contributions, and (2) required payments to the Western States multiemployer pension plan due to NW Natural's withdrawal from the plan in December 2013. See Note 10.
(2)Gas purchases include contracts which use price formulas tied to monthly index prices. The commitment amounts presented incorporate the December 2020 first of month index price for each supply basin from which gas is purchased. For a summary of gas purchase and gas pipeline capacity commitments, see Note 17.
(3)Other purchase commitments primarily consist of remaining balances under existing purchase orders and gas storage agreements.
(4)Other long-term liabilities includes accrued deferred compensation plan liabilities for executives and directors. The timing of these payments are uncertain; however, these payments are unlikely to all occur in the next 12 months.
(5)Short- and long-term obligations include short- and long-term debt obligations and other immaterial liabilities.
In addition to known contractual obligations listed in the above table, NW Natural has also recognized liabilities for future environmental remediation or action. The exact timing of payments beyond 12 months with respect to those liabilities cannot be reasonably estimated due to numerous uncertainties surrounding the course of environmental remediation and the preliminary nature of site investigations. See Note 18 for a further discussion of environmental remediation cost liabilities.
At December 31, 2020, 606 of NW Natural's natural gas distribution employees were members of the Office and Professional Employees International Union (OPEIU) Local No. 11. In November 2019, union employees ratified a new collective bargaining agreement that took effect on December 1, 2019, expires on May 31, 2024, and is effective thereafter from year to year unless either party serves notice of its intent to negotiate modifications to the collective bargaining agreement.
Short-Term Debt
The primary source of short-term liquidity for NW Holdings is cash balances, dividends from its operating subsidiaries, in particular NW Natural, available cash from a multi-year credit facility, and short-term credit facilities it may enter into from time to time.
The primary source of short-term liquidity for NW Natural is from the sale of commercial paper, available cash from a multi-year credit facility, and short-term credit facilities. NW Natural has a separate commercial paper program and separate bank facilities. In addition to issuing commercial paper or bank loans to meet working capital requirements, including seasonal requirements to finance gas purchases and accounts receivable, short-term debt may also be used to temporarily fund capital requirements. For NW Natural, commercial paper and bank loans are periodically refinanced through the sale of long-term debt or equity contributions from NW Holdings. Commercial paper, when outstanding, is sold through two commercial banks under an issuing and paying agency agreement and is supported by one or more unsecured revolving credit facilities. See “Credit Agreements” below.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, NW Holdings had short-term debt outstanding of $304.5 million and $149.1 million, respectively. The weighted average interest rate of NW Holdings' short-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 0.5% and 2.0%, respectively. NW Natural had short-term debt outstanding of $231.5 million and $125.1 million, respectively. The weighted average interest rate of NW Natural's short-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 0.4% and 2.0%, respectively.
Credit Agreements
NW Holdings
NW Holdings has a $100 million credit agreement, with a feature that allows it to request increases in the total commitment amount, up to a maximum of $150 million. The maturity date of the agreement is October 2, 2023, with available extensions of commitments for two additional one-year periods, subject to lender approval.
All lenders under the NW Holdings credit agreement are major financial institutions with committed balances and investment grade credit ratings as of December 31, 2020 as follows:
Based on credit market conditions, it is possible one or more lending commitments could be unavailable to NW Holdings if the lender defaulted due to lack of funds or insolvency; however, NW Holdings does not believe this risk to be imminent due to the lenders' strong investment-grade credit ratings.
The NW Holdings credit agreement permits the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to $40 million. The principal amount of borrowings under the credit agreement is due and payable on the maturity date. The credit agreement requires NW Holdings to maintain a consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization ratio of 70% or less. Failure to comply with this covenant would entitle the lenders to terminate their lending commitments and accelerate the maturity of all amounts outstanding. NW Holdings was in compliance with this covenant at December 31, 2020 and 2019, with consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization ratios of 58.6% and 54.3%, respectively.
The agreement also requires NW Holdings to maintain debt ratings (which are defined by a formula using NW Natural's credit ratings in the event NW Holdings does not have a credit rating) with Standard & Poor's (S&P) and Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (Moody’s) and notify the lenders of any change in its senior unsecured debt ratings or senior secured debt ratings, as applicable, by such rating agencies. A change in NW Holdings' debt ratings by S&P or Moody’s is not an event of default, nor is
the maintenance of a specific minimum level of debt rating a condition of drawing upon the credit agreement. Rather, interest rates on any loans outstanding under the credit agreements are tied to debt ratings and therefore, a change in the debt rating would increase or decrease the cost of any loans under the credit agreements when ratings are changed. NW Holdings does not currently maintain ratings with S&P or Moody's.
Interest charges on the credit agreement are indexed to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The agreement contains a provision to transition to an equivalent replacement rate upon the phase-out of LIBOR in 2022.
NW Holdings had no letters of credit issued and outstanding at December 31, 2020 and 2019. NW Holdings had a $1.0 million letter of credit issued and outstanding, separate from the aforementioned credit agreement, at December 31, 2019 for purposes of facilitating the Suncadia acquisition, which was extinguished after the close of the transaction in February 2020.
NW Natural
NW Natural has a multi-year credit agreement for unsecured revolving loans totaling $300 million, with a feature that allows NW Natural to request increases in the total commitment amount, up to a maximum of $450 million. The maturity date of the agreement is October 2, 2023 with an available extension of commitments for two additional one-year periods, subject to lender approval.
All lenders under the NW Natural credit agreement are major financial institutions with committed balances and investment grade credit ratings as of December 31, 2020 as follows:
Based on credit market conditions, it is possible one or more lending commitments could be unavailable to NW Natural if the lender defaulted due to lack of funds or insolvency; however, NW Natural does not believe this risk to be imminent due to the lenders' strong investment-grade credit ratings.
The NW Natural credit agreement permits the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to $60 million. The principal amount of borrowings under the credit agreement is due and payable on the maturity date. There were no outstanding balances under this credit agreement at December 31, 2020 or 2019. The credit agreement requires NW Natural to maintain a consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization ratio of 70% or less. Failure to comply with this covenant would entitle the lenders to terminate their lending commitments and accelerate the maturity of all amounts outstanding. NW Natural was in compliance with this covenant at December 31, 2020 and 2019, with consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization ratios of 57.9% and 54.1%, respectively.
The agreement also requires NW Natural to maintain credit ratings with S&P and Moody’s and notify the lenders of any change in NW Natural's senior unsecured debt ratings or senior secured debt ratings, as applicable, by such rating agencies. A change in NW Natural's debt ratings by S&P or Moody’s is not an event of default, nor is the maintenance of a specific minimum level of debt rating a condition of drawing upon the credit agreement. Rather, interest rates on any loans outstanding under the agreement are tied to debt ratings and therefore, a change in the debt rating would increase or decrease the cost of any loans under the credit agreement when ratings are changed. See "Credit Ratings" below.
Interest charges on the credit agreement are indexed to LIBOR. The agreement contains a provision to transition to an equivalent replacement rate upon the phase-out of LIBOR.
Credit Ratings
NW Holdings does not currently maintain ratings with S&P or Moody's. NW Natural's credit ratings are a factor of liquidity, potentially affecting access to the capital markets including the commercial paper market. NW Natural's credit ratings also have an impact on the cost of funds and the need to post collateral under derivative contracts.
The following table summarizes NW Natural's current credit ratings:
The above credit ratings and ratings outlook are dependent upon a number of factors, both qualitative and quantitative, and are subject to change at any time. The disclosure of or reference to these credit ratings is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold NW Holdings or NW Natural securities. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
As part of the ring-fencing conditions agreed upon with the OPUC and WUTC in connection with the holding company reorganization, NW Holdings and NW Natural are required to maintain separate credit ratings, long-term debt ratings, and preferred stock ratings, if any.
Long-Term Debt
The following NW Natural debentures were retired in the periods indicated:
In June 2019, NWN Water, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NW Holdings, entered into a two-year term loan agreement for $35.0 million. The loan carried an interest rate of 0.70% at December 31, 2020, which is based upon the one-month LIBOR rate. The loan is guaranteed by NW Holdings and requires NW Holdings to maintain a consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization ratio of 70% or less. Failure to comply with this covenant would entitle the lenders to terminate their lending commitments and accelerate the maturity of all amounts outstanding. NW Holdings was in compliance with this covenant at December 31, 2020, with a consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization ratio of 58.6%.
In March 2020, NW Natural issued $150.0 million of FMBs with an interest rate of 3.60%, due in 2050. In February 2020, NW Natural retired $75.0 million of FMBs with an interest rate of 5.37%.
$10.0 million of FMBs with an interest rate of 9.05% and $50.0 million of FMBs with an interest rate of 3.18% will mature in August and September 2021, respectively.
See "Financial Condition-Contractual Obligations" above for long-term debt maturing over the next five years.
Bankruptcy Ring-fencing Restrictions
As part of the ring-fencing conditions agreed upon with the OPUC and WUTC in connection with the holding company reorganization, NW Natural is required to have one director who is independent from NW Natural management and from NW Holdings and to issue one share of NW Natural preferred stock to an independent third party. NW Natural was in compliance with both of these ring-fencing provisions as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. NW Natural may file a voluntary petition for bankruptcy only if approved unanimously by the Board of Directors of NW Natural, including the independent director, and by the holder of the preferred share.
Cash Flows
Operating Activities
Changes in our operating cash flows are primarily affected by net income or loss, changes in working capital requirements, and other cash and non-cash adjustments to operating results.
Operating activity highlights include:
The significant drivers of changes in cash provided by operating activities discussed below apply to both NW Holdings and NW Natural.
2020 COMPARED TO 2019. The significant factors contributing to the $42.3 million and $40.0 million decreases in NW Holdings and NW Natural cash flow provided by operating activities, respectively, were as follows:
•a decrease of $25.8 million at NW Natural from increased receivables;
•a decrease of $18.0 million due to higher contributions paid to qualified defined benefit pension plans;
•a decrease of $15.8 million from decreased cash collections from our decoupling mechanism; and
•a decrease of $11.6 million due to higher environmental expenditures; partially offset by
•a decrease of $41.1 million in net deferred gas costs as the actual costs during the 2019-20 winter season were in line with estimates embedded in the PGA as opposed to gas costs in the 2018-2019 winter season that were 14% above PGA estimates.
2019 COMPARED TO 2018. The significant factors contributing to the $16.5 million and $12.7 million increases in NW Holdings and NW Natural cash flow provided by operating activities, respectively, were as follows:
•an increase of $27.5 million at NW Holdings and $24.9 million at NW Natural due to net income tax refunds in 2019 compared to payments in 2018. The refunds were primarily due to bonus depreciation taken on NW Natural's North Mist gas storage expansion which was placed into service in May 2019, as well as $6.0 million in income taxes paid in 2018 and refunded to NW Natural in 2019;
•an increase of $10.6 million from collections of both current and deferred pension expenses as a result of NW Natural's Oregon rate case; and
•an increase of $4.6 million due to lower contributions paid to qualified defined benefit pension plans; partially offset by
•a net decrease of $28.5 million at NW Natural from changes in receivables, inventories, and accounts payable, primarily reflecting increased gas purchase expenditures from average weather in 2019 compared to warmer-than average weather in 2018 as well as higher gas costs than those included in customer rates.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, NW Natural contributed $29.0 million to its qualified defined benefit pension plan, compared to $11.0 million for 2019 and $15.5 million in 2018. The amount and timing of future contributions will depend on market interest rates and investment returns on the plans’ assets. See Note 10.
NW Holdings and NW Natural have lease and purchase commitments relating to our operating activities that are financed with cash flows from operations. For information on cash flow requirements related to leases and other purchase commitments, see “Financial Condition-Contractual Obligations” above and Note 17.
Investing Activities
Investing activity highlights include:
2020 COMPARED TO 2019. Cash used in investing activities decreased $9.5 million at NW Holdings and increased $21.0 million and NW Natural, respectively.
The decrease in cash used at NW Holdings was driven by $12.5 million of proceeds from the sale of Gill Ranch and $7.0 million from the sale of Trail West. The increase in cash used at NW Natural was due to continued capital expenditures for customer growth, system reinforcement, and technology, partially offset by lower leasehold improvement expenditures at the new corporate operations center and $8.1 million of proceeds from the sale of assets.
2019 COMPARED TO 2018. Cash used in investing activities increased $86.3 million and $4.6 million at NW Holdings and NW Natural, respectively. The increase at NW Natural was driven by continued capital expenditures for customer growth, system reinforcement, and technology, as well as leasehold improvement additions at NW Natural's new corporate operations center. The increase was partially offset by lower capital expenditures due to the completion of the North Mist gas storage expansion in May 2019. The increase at NW Holdings was driven by $55.9 million higher expenditures for acquisitions, net of cash acquired.
NW Natural capital expenditures for 2021 are expected to be in the range of $280 million to $320 million and for the five-year period from 2021 to 2025 are expected to range from $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion. NW Natural Water is expected to invest approximately $15 million in 2021 related to maintenance capital expenditures for water and wastewater utilities currently owned or under a purchase and sale agreement, and for the five-year period from 2021 to 2025 capital expenditures are expected to invest approximately $40 million to $50 million.
The timing and amount of the core capital expenditures and projects for 2021 and the next five years could change based on regulation, growth, and cost estimates. Additional investments in our infrastructure during and after 2021 that are not incorporated in the estimates provided above will depend largely on additional regulations, growth, and expansion opportunities. Required funds for the investments are expected to be internally generated or financed with long-term debt or equity, as appropriate.
Financing Activities
Financing activity highlights include:
2020 COMPARED TO 2019. Cash provided by financing activities increased $56.3 million and $67.5 million at NW Holdings and NW Natural, respectively.
The increase in cash provided by financing activities at NW Natural was primarily driven by $198.8 million of higher borrowings of short-term debt, net, and $2.0 million of higher cash dividends paid. The increases were partially offset by decreases of $35.0 million in long-term borrowing and the $93.2 million in capital contribution from NW Holdings to NW Natural in 2019.
The increase at NW Holdings was primarily due to $223.9 million higher in short-term borrowing, partially offset by decreases of $93.0 million in common stock issuance proceeds and $70.0 million lower repayments of long-term debt.
2019 COMPARED TO 2018. Cash provided by financing activities increased $57.7 million and decreased $14.9 million at NW Holdings and NW Natural, respectively.
The decrease in cash provided by financing activities at NW Natural was primarily driven by $255.7 million in higher repayments of short-term debt compared to 2018 and $15.0 million higher cash dividends paid. The decrease was partially offset by net issuances of $110.0 million in long-term debt in 2019 compared to net repayments of $47.0 million in 2018, as well as a capital contribution from NW Holdings to NW Natural of $93.0 million.
The increase at NW Holdings was primarily due to proceeds of $93.0 million from the June 2019 issuance of NW Holdings common stock, the issuance of $35.0 million of long-term debt at NW Natural Water, and short-term debt issuances of $24 million at NW Holdings. These increases were partially offset by the debt activity at NW Natural described above.
Pension Cost and Funding Status of Qualified Retirement Plans
NW Natural's pension costs are determined in accordance with accounting standards for compensation and retirement benefits. See “Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Pensions and Postretirement Benefits” below. Pension expense for NW Natural's qualified defined benefit plan, which is allocated between operations and maintenance expenses, capital expenditures, and through October 31, 2018, the deferred regulatory balancing account, totaled $18.4 million in 2020, an increase of $1.9 million from 2019. The fair market value of pension assets in this plan increased to $373.9 million at December 31, 2020 from $313.1 million at December 31, 2019. The increase was due to a gain on plan assets of $54.6 million and $29.0 million in employer contributions, partially offset by benefit payments of $22.7 million.
Contributions made to NW Natural's company-sponsored qualified defined benefit pension plan are based on actuarial assumptions and estimates, tax regulations, and funding requirements under federal law. The qualified defined benefit pension plan was underfunded by $151.2 million at December 31, 2020. NW Natural plans to make contributions during 2021 of $20.1 million. See Note 10 for further pension disclosures.
Contingent Liabilities
Loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable in accordance with accounting standards for contingencies. See “Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” below. At December 31, 2020, NW Natural's total estimated liability related to environmental sites was $120.5 million. See Note 18 and "Results of Operations-Regulatory Matters-Rate Mechanisms-Environmental Cost Deferral and Recovery" above.
NW Holdings is not currently party to any direct claims or litigation, though in the future it may be subject to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.
New Accounting Pronouncements
For a description of recent accounting pronouncements that may have an impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, see Note 2.
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
In preparing financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management exercises judgment to assess the potential outcomes and related accounting impacts in the selection and application of accounting principles, including making estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures in the financial statements. Management considers critical accounting policies to be those which are most important to the representation of financial condition and results of operations and which require management’s most difficult and subjective or complex judgments, including accounting estimates that could result in materially different amounts if reported under different conditions or used different assumptions. Our most critical estimates and judgments for both NW Holdings and NW Natural include accounting for:
•regulatory accounting;
•revenue recognition;
•derivative instruments and hedging activities;
•pensions and postretirement benefits;
•income taxes;
•environmental contingencies; and
•impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill.
Management has discussed its current estimates and judgments used in the application of critical accounting policies with the Audit Committees of the Boards of NW Holdings and NW Natural. Within the context of critical accounting policies and estimates, management is not aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported.
Regulatory Accounting
The NGD segment is regulated by the OPUC and WUTC, which establish the rates designed to recover specific costs of providing regulatory services, and, to a certain extent, set forth special accounting treatment for certain regulatory transactions for which NW Natural records regulatory assets and liabilities. In general, the same accounting principles as non-regulated
companies reporting under U.S. GAAP are used. However, authoritative guidance for regulated operations (regulatory accounting) requires different accounting treatment for regulated companies to show the effects of such regulation. For example, NW Natural accounts for the cost of gas using a PGA deferral and cost recovery mechanism, which is submitted for approval annually to the OPUC and WUTC. See "Results of Operations-Regulatory Matters-Rate Mechanisms-Purchased Gas Adjustment" above. There are other expenses and revenues that the OPUC or WUTC may require NW Natural to defer for recovery or refund in future periods. Regulatory accounting requires NW Natural to account for these types of deferred expenses (or deferred revenues) as regulatory assets (or regulatory liabilities) on the balance sheet. When the recovery of these regulatory assets from, or refund of regulatory liabilities to, customers is approved, NW Natural recognizes the expense or revenue on the income statement at the same time the adjustment to amounts included in rates charged to customers.
The conditions that must be satisfied to adopt the accounting policies and practices of regulatory accounting include:
•an independent regulator sets rates;
•the regulator sets the rates to cover specific costs of delivering service; and
•the service territory lacks competitive pressures to reduce rates below the rates set by the regulator.
Because NW Natural's NGD operations satisfy all three conditions, NW Natural continues to apply regulatory accounting to NGD operations. Future accounting changes, regulatory changes, or changes in the competitive environment could require NW Natural to discontinue the application of regulatory accounting for some or all of our regulated businesses. This would require the write-off of those regulatory assets and liabilities that would no longer be probable of recovery from or refund to customers.
Based on current accounting and regulatory competitive conditions, NW Natural believes it is reasonable to expect continued application of regulatory accounting for NGD activities. Further, it is reasonable to expect the recovery or refund of NW Natural's regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31, 2020 through future customer rates. If it is determined that all or a portion of these regulatory assets or liabilities no longer meet the criteria for continued application of regulatory accounting, then NW Natural would be required to write-off the net unrecoverable balances against earnings in the period such determination is made. The net balance in regulatory asset and liability accounts was a net liability of $308.5 million and $285.3 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. See Note 2 for more detail on regulatory balances.
Revenue Recognition
Revenues, which are derived primarily from the sale, transportation, and storage of natural gas, are recognized upon the delivery of gas commodity or services rendered to customers.
Accrued Unbilled Revenue
For a description of the policy regarding accrued unbilled revenue, most of which relates to the NGD business at NW Natural, see Note 2. The following table presents changes in key metrics if the estimated percentage of unbilled volume at December 31 was adjusted up or down by 1%:
(1) Includes impact of regulatory mechanisms including decoupling mechanism and excludes the impact of unbilled revenue from water services.
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
NW Natural's gas acquisition and hedging policies set forth guidelines for using financial derivative instruments to support prudent risk management strategies. These policies specifically prohibit the use of derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. Financial derivative contracts are utilized to hedge a portion of natural gas sale requirements. These contracts include swaps, options, and combinations of option contracts. NW Natural primarily uses these derivative financial instruments to manage commodity price variability. A small portion of NW Natural's derivative hedging strategy involves foreign currency exchange contracts.
Derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. If certain regulatory conditions are met, then the derivative instrument fair value is recorded together with an offsetting entry to a regulatory asset or liability account pursuant to regulatory accounting, and no unrealized gain or loss is recognized in current income or loss. See "Regulatory Accounting" above for additional information. The gain or loss from the fair value of a derivative instrument subject to regulatory deferral is included in the recovery from, or refund to, NGD business customers in future periods. If a derivative contract is not subject to regulatory deferral, then the accounting treatment for unrealized gains and losses is recorded in accordance with accounting standards for derivatives and hedging which is either in current income or loss or in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss (AOCI or AOCL). Derivative contracts outstanding at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were measured at fair value using models or other market accepted valuation methodologies derived from observable market data. Estimates of fair value may change significantly from period-to-period depending on market conditions, notional amounts, and prices. These changes may have an impact on results of operations, but the impact would largely be mitigated due to the majority of derivative activities
being subject to regulatory deferral treatment. For more information on derivative activity and associated regulatory treatment, see Note 2 and Note 16.
The following table summarizes the amount of gains realized from commodity price transactions for the last three years:
Realized gains and losses from commodity hedges shown above were recorded in cost of gas and were, or will be, included in annual PGA rates.
Pensions and Postretirement Benefits
NW Natural maintains a qualified non-contributory defined benefit pension plan, non-qualified supplemental pension plans for eligible executive officers and certain key employees, and other postretirement employee benefit plans covering certain non-union employees. NW Natural also has a qualified defined contribution plan (Retirement K Savings Plan) for all eligible employees. Only the qualified defined benefit pension plan and Retirement K Savings Plan have plan assets, which are held in qualified trusts to fund the respective retirement benefits. The qualified defined benefit retirement plan for union and non-union employees was closed to new participants several years ago. Non-union and union employees hired or re-hired after December 31, 2006 and 2009, respectively, and employees of certain NW Holdings subsidiaries are provided an enhanced Retirement K Savings Plan benefit. The postretirement Welfare Benefit Plan for non-union employees was also closed to new participants several years ago.
Net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs (retirement benefit costs) and projected benefit obligations (benefit obligations) are determined using a number of key assumptions including discount rates, rate of compensation increases, retirement ages, mortality rates and an expected long-term return on plan assets. See Note 10.
Accounting standards also require balance sheet recognition of unamortized actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs in AOCI or AOCL, net of tax. However, the retirement benefit costs related to qualified defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans are generally recovered in rates charged to NGD customers, which are set based on accounting standards for pensions and postretirement benefit expenses. As such, NW Natural received approval from the OPUC to recognize the unamortized actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability based on expected rate recovery, rather than including it as AOCI or AOCL under common equity. See "Regulatory Accounting" above and Note 2, "Industry Regulation".
In 2011, NW Natural received regulatory approval from the OPUC and began deferring a portion of pension expense above or below the amount set in rates to a regulatory balancing account on the balance sheet. As part of general rate case proceedings, on October 26, 2018, the OPUC issued an order to freeze NW Natural's pension balancing account as of October 31, 2018. In March 2019, the OPUC issued an order resolving the remaining open items for NW Natural's 2018 Oregon general rate case regarding recovery of the pension balancing account. At December 31, 2020, the cumulative amount deferred for future pension cost recovery was $50.5 million, including accrued interest. The regulatory balancing account includes the recognition of accrued interest on the account balance at NW Natural's authorized rate of return from 2011 through October 31, 2018, and at 4.3% thereafter. See "Regulatory Matters - Rate Mechanisms - Pension Cost Deferral and Pension Balancing Account" above for more information.
A number of factors, as discussed above, are considered in developing pension and postretirement benefit assumptions. For the December 31, 2020 measurement date, NW Natural reviewed and updated:
•the weighted-average discount rate assumptions for pensions decreased from 3.16% for 2019 to 2.36% for 2020, and our weighted-average discount rate assumptions for other postretirement benefits decreased from 3.11% for 2019 to 2.34% for 2020. The new rate assumptions were determined for each plan based on a matching of benchmark interest rates to the estimated cash flows, which reflect the timing and amount of future benefit payments. Benchmark interest rates are drawn from the FTSE Above Median Curve, which consists of high quality bonds rated AA- or higher by S&P or Aa3 or higher by Moody’s;
•the expected annual rate of future compensation increases for bargaining unit employees, which remained consistent with 2019, of 6.50% in 2020 and 3.50% thereafter. The rate for 2020 reflects a new collective bargaining agreement that took effect December 1, 2019. The expected annual rate of future compensation was 3.50% for non-bargaining employees;
•the expected long-term return on qualified defined benefit plan assets remains unchanged at 7.25%;
•the mortality rate assumptions were updated from Pri-2012 mortality tables using scale MP-2019 to Pri-2012 mortality tables using scale MP-2020, which partially offset increases of the projected benefit obligation; and
•other key assumptions, which were based on actual plan experience and actuarial recommendations.
At December 31, 2020, the net pension liability (benefit obligations less market value of plan assets) for NW Natural's qualified defined benefit plan decreased $13.1 million compared to 2019. The decrease in the net pension liability is primarily due to the
$60.9 million increase in plan assets, partially offset by the $47.8 million increase to the pension benefit obligation. The liability for non-qualified plans increased $2.7 million, and the liability for other postretirement benefits decreased $0.5 million in 2020.
The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined by averaging the expected earnings for the target asset portfolio. In developing expected return, historical actual performance and long-term return projections are analyzed, which gives consideration to the current asset mix and target asset allocation.
NW Natural believes its pension assumptions are appropriate based on plan design and an assessment of market conditions. The following shows the sensitivity of retirement benefit costs and benefit obligations to changes in certain actuarial assumptions:
In July 2012, President Obama signed MAP-21 into law. This legislation changed several provisions affecting pension plans, including temporary funding relief and Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) premium increases, which shifts the level of minimum required contributions from the short-term to the long-term as well as increasing the operational costs of running a pension plan. MAP-21 established a new minimum and maximum corridor for segment rates based on a 25-year average of bond yields, which resulted in lower minimum contributions requirements than those under previous regulations. MAP-21, as amended, provides for the current corridor to be in effect through 2020 and subsequently broaden on an annual basis from 2021 through 2024.
Income Taxes
Valuation Allowances
Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that these assets are believed to be more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, available positive and negative evidence is considered, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. NW Holdings and NW Natural have determined that all recorded deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized as of December 31, 2020. See Note 11.
Uncertain Tax Benefits
The calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. A tax benefit from a material uncertain tax position will only be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position, or some portion thereof, will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, on the basis of the technical merits. NW Holdings and NW Natural participate in the Compliance Assurance Process (CAP) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Under the CAP program companies work with the IRS to identify and resolve material tax matters before the federal income tax return is filed each year. No reserves for uncertain tax benefits were recorded during 2020, 2019, or 2018. See Note 11.
Tax Legislation
When significant proposed or enacted changes in income tax rules occur we consider whether there may be a material impact to our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or whether the changes could materially affect existing assumptions used in making estimates of tax related balances.
On December 22, 2017, H.R.1 - An Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018, also known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), was enacted. The TCJA lowered the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate to 21% from the existing maximum rate of 35%, effective for our tax year beginning January 1, 2018. The TCJA includes specific provisions related to regulated public utilities that generally provide for the continued deductibility of interest expense and the elimination of bonus depreciation. Certain rate normalization requirements for accelerated cost recovery benefits related to regulated plant balances also continue. See Note 11 for more information on how we are impacted by the TCJA.
With respect to other tax legislation, the final tangible property regulations applicable to all taxpayers were issued on September 13, 2013 and were generally effective for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2014. In addition, procedural guidance related to the regulations was issued under which taxpayers may make accounting method changes to comply with the
regulations. We have evaluated the regulations and do not anticipate any material impact. However, unit-of-property guidance applicable to natural gas distribution networks has not yet been issued and is expected in the near future. We will further evaluate the effect of these regulations after this guidance is issued, but believe the current method is materially consistent with the new regulations and do not expect this additional guidance to have a material effect on our financial statements.
Regulatory Matters
Regulatory tax assets and liabilities are recorded to the extent it is probable they will be recoverable from, or refunded to, customers in the future. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, NW Natural had net regulatory income tax assets of $14.6 million and $16.9 million, respectively, representing future rate recovery of deferred tax liabilities resulting from differences in NGD plant financial statement and tax bases and NGD plant removal costs. These regulatory assets are currently being recovered through customer rates. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, regulatory income tax assets of $2.5 million and $2.5 million, respectively, were recorded by NW Natural, representing probable future rate recovery of deferred tax liabilities resulting from the equity portion of AFUDC. At December 31, 2020, a regulatory income tax asset of $1.7 million was recorded by NW Natural, representing future recovery of Oregon Corporate Activity Tax that was deferred between January 1, 2020 and October 31, 2020.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, regulatory liability balances, representing the estimated net benefit to NGD customers resulting from the change in deferred taxes as a result of the TCJA, of $197.8 million and $205.0 million, respectively, were recorded by NW Natural. These balances include a gross up for income taxes of $52.4 million and $54.3 million, respectively.
The TCJA includes specific guidance for determining the shortest time period over which the portion of this regulatory liability resulting from accelerated cost recovery of NGD plant may accrue to the benefit of customers to avoid incurring federal normalization penalties. However, it is anticipated that until such time that customers receive the direct benefit of this regulatory liability, the balance, net of the additional gross up for income taxes, will continue to provide an indirect benefit to customers by reducing the NGD rate base which determines customer rates for service. Regulatory orders were issued by Oregon in March 2019 and by Washington in October 2019 addressing the provision of these TCJA tax benefits to customers. See "Regulatory Matters-Regulatory Proceeding Updates-Tax Reform Deferral" for more information.
NGD rates in effect for Oregon through October 31, 2018 and for Washington through October 31, 2019 included an allowance to provide for the recovery of the anticipated provision for income taxes incurred as a result of providing regulated services. The provision for income taxes during these periods included an allowance for federal income taxes determined by utilizing the pre-TCJA federal corporate income tax rate of 35 percent. NW Natural recorded an additional regulatory liability in 2018 and 2019 reflecting the deferral of estimated rate benefit for customers due to the newly enacted 21 percent federal corporate income tax rate. At December 31, 2019, a regulatory liability of $1.7 million was recorded to reflect this estimated revenue deferral. The liability has been completely amortized to customers’ benefit as of December 31, 2020.
Environmental Contingencies
Environmental liabilities are accounted for in accordance with accounting standards under the loss contingency guidance when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Amounts recorded for environmental contingencies take numerous factors into consideration, including, among other variables, changes in enacted laws, regulatory orders, estimated remediation costs, interest rates, insurance proceeds, participation by other parties, timing of payments, and the input of legal counsel and third-party experts. Accordingly, changes in any of these variables or other factual circumstances could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for our environmental liabilities. For a complete discussion of environmental accounting policies refer to Note 2. For a discussion of current environmental sites and liabilities refer to Note 18. In addition, for information regarding the regulatory treatment of these costs and NW Natural's regulatory recovery mechanism, see "Results of Operations-Regulatory Matters-Rate Mechanisms-Environmental Cost Deferral and Recovery" above.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill
Long-Lived Assets
We review the carrying value of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment of long-lived assets include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which the asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value or expected future cash flows of the asset, among others.
When such factors are present, we assess the recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of the asset will be recovered through expected future cash flows. An asset is determined to be impaired when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the expected undiscounted future cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If an impairment is indicated, we record an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the long-lived assets. Fair value is estimated using appropriate valuation methodologies, which may include an estimate of discounted cash flows.
Goodwill and Business Combinations
In a business combination, goodwill is initially measured as any excess of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred over the acquisition-date fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired.
The carrying value of goodwill is reviewed annually during the fourth quarter using balances as of October 1, or whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable.
NW Holdings' policy for goodwill assessments begins with a qualitative analysis in which events and circumstances are evaluated, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, regulatory environments, and the overall financial performance of the reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates that the carrying value may be at risk of recoverability, a quantitative evaluation is performed to measure the carrying value against the fair value of the reporting unit. This evaluation may involve the assessment of future cash flows and other subjective factors for which uncertainty exists and could impact the estimation of future cash flows. These factors include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of future cash flows, future growth rates, and the discount rate. Unforeseen events and changes in circumstances or market conditions could adversely affect these estimates, which could result in an impairment charge. A qualitative assessment was performed during the fourth quarter of 2020 which indicated a quantitative assessment was not required; thus, no goodwill impairment was recorded. See Note 2 and Note 15 for additional information.
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at fair value at the acquisition date, and the fair value of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. When NW Natural acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets acquired and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as of the acquisition date. When there is substantial judgment or uncertainty around the fair value of acquired assets, we may engage a third party expert to assist in determining the fair values of certain assets or liabilities.
