Plan of Operations
Following the acquisition of Rotor Riot and Fat Shark, we remain focused on providing products and solutions to the drone industry. We believe that Rotor Riot’s visibility and presence in the drone marketplace will foster growth in sales through its e*commerce platform and provide an initial target base of customers for the launch of “Dronebox”. Dronebox is being designed to provide distributed data storage, analytics and related services to the drone industry. The Company plans to utilize blockchain based technologies and offer its solutions as a Software-as-a-Service platform. Potential customers include regulators to track and review flight data, insurance companies for coverage and claims administration, and pilots to maintain compliance with regulations. The operations of Fat Shark are expected to constitute a significant majority of our revenue and results of operations and will position us to become a fully-integrated drone business with a strong supply chain while we continue to develop and promote industry standards through our blockchain-based distributed network that provides secure data storage, operational analytics, reporting, and SaaS solutions for the drone industry. We are also developing the means to accurately track, report and review flight data, which we believe will be the mainstay of future regulatory specifications and insurability.

We may, upon 10 business days prior notice, pre-pay the 2019 Notes, including all accrued interest, in whole or in part, provided that any such prepayment prior to the one-year anniversary of the 2019 Note issuance will be at a price equal to 112% of the then outstanding original principal amount. Upon an event of default, as described in the Notes, the outstanding principal and interest will become immediately due and payable. Additionally, under the 2019 Note, unless waived by the holder, the holder is not be entitled to convert the 2019 Note if such conversion would result in beneficial ownership by the holder and its affiliates of more than 9.99% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company on such date.

The Company may prepay all or any portion of the 2020 Note, without penalty or premium, upon at least ten business days’ prior notice to the noteholder. Upon issuance by the Company of a security, or amendment to a security, that the noteholder reasonably believes is more favorable, such term, at noteholder’s option, will become a part of the 2020 Note, except for certain exempt issuances. No conversions under the 2020 Note will be effected that will result in the noteholder, together with any affiliate, beneficially owning in excess of 9.99% of the Company’s outstanding common stock immediately after giving effect to such conversion.
The 2020 Warrants are exercisable at a price equal to the lower of (i) $1.50 per share or (ii) if a Qualified Offering occurs, at a 25% discount to the price per share of the common stock offered in such Qualified Offering.

2021 Underwritten Public Offerings
S-1 Offering
On May 4, 2021, the Company closed its firm commitment underwritten public offering (the “S-1 Offering”) in which it sold 4,000,000 shares of its common stock, at a public offering price of $4.00 per share, to ThinkEquity, a division of Fordham Financial Management, Inc., as representative of the underwriters (“ThinkEquity”), pursuant into an underwriting agreement with Think Equity dated April 29, 2021. The Company also granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 600,000 shares of its common stock to cover over-allotments in the initial public offering price, less the underwriting discount. These shares of common stock in the S-1 Offering were offered and sold by the Company pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1, as amended (File No. 333-253491), filed with the SEC, which was declared effective by the Commission on April 29, 2021 (the “S-1 Registration Statement”).
The net proceeds to the Company from the Offering, after deducting the underwriting discount, the underwriters’ fees and expenses and the Company’s estimated Offering expenses, were approximately $14.6 million . The Company anticipates using the net proceeds from the Offering to provide funding for service, sales, and marketing efforts for its Red Cat Drone Services, strategic acquisitions and related expenses, and general working capital.
S-3 Offering
On July 21, 2021 the Company closed on a firm commitment underwritten public offering (the “S-3 Offering”) in which it sold an aggregate of 13,333,334 shares of its Common Stock at a purchase price of $4.50 per share to ThinkEquity, pursuant to an underwriting agreement dated July 18, 2021.

The Company anticipates using the net proceeds from the S-3 Offering to provide funding for services, sales, and marketing efforts for its Red Cat Drone services, strategic acquisitions and related expenses, and general working capital.
Going Concern
We only began generating revenues in January 2020 and have reported net losses since our inception. We expect to report net losses for at least the next twelve months. The success of our business plan during the next 12 months and beyond will be contingent upon generating sufficient revenue to cover our operating costs and/or upon obtaining additional financing. The report from our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2021 includes an explanatory paragraph stating the Company has recurring net losses from operations, negative operating cash flows, and will need additional working capital for ongoing operations. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funding, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected and we may be unable to continue as a going concern.
As reflected in our accompanying financial statements, we had negative working capital of $3,034,060 at April 30, 2021 and have accumulated losses totaling approximately $15.8 million through April 30, 2021. Management recognizes that these operating results and our financial position raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
We are presently seeking to address these going concern doubts through a number of actions including efforts to (a) raise capital through the public markets, (b) release additional commercial products and (c) pursue acquisitions of complementary, revenue generating companies which are accretive to our operating results. In May 2021, we completed an offering of common stock which raised gross proceeds of $16 million. We can provide no assurance that any of these efforts will be successful or, that even if successful, that they will alleviate doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern form more than the next twelve months.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates use theirs
Our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in the notes to our financial statements. In general, management’s estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.
Goodwill - Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquisition over the estimated fair value of identifiable net assets acquired. The measurement periods for the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed ends as soon as information on the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date becomes known, not to exceed 12 months. Adjustments in a purchase price allocation may require a change in the amounts allocated to goodwill during the periods in which the adjustments are determined.
Fair Values, Inputs and Valuation Techniques for Financial Assets and Liabilities and Related Disclosures
The fair value measurements and disclosure guidance defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In accordance with this guidance, the Company has categorized its recurring basis financial assets and liabilities into a three-level fair value hierarchy based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique.
The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.
The levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:
● Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access.
● Level 2 inputs utilize other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable in the marketplace for the asset. The observable inputs are used in valuation models to calculate the fair value for the asset.
● Level 3 inputs are unobservable but are significant to the fair value measurement for the asset, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset. These inputs reflect management’s own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset.
A review of fair value hierarchy classifications is conducted on a quarterly basis. Changes in the observability of valuation inputs may result in a reclassification of levels for certain securities within the fair value hierarchy.
Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis
The Company’s financial instruments mainly consist of cash, receivables, current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses and debt. The carrying amounts of its cash, receivables, current asserts, accounts payable, accrued expenses and current debt approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
Convertible Securities and Derivatives - When the Company issues convertible debt or equity instruments that contain embedded derivative instruments that are to be bifurcated and accounted for as liabilities, the total proceeds from the convertible host instruments are first allocated to the bifurcated derivative instruments. The remaining proceeds, if any, are then allocated to the convertible instruments themselves, resulting in those instruments being recorded at a discount from their face value but no lower than zero. Any excess amount is recognized as a derivative expense.
Derivative Liabilities - The Company has financial instruments that are considered derivatives or contain embedded features subject to derivative accounting. Embedded derivatives are valued separately from the host instrument and are recognized as derivative liabilities in the Company’s balance sheet. The Company measures these instruments at their estimated fair value and recognizes changes in their estimated fair value in results of operations during the period of change.
In October 2020 and January 2021, the Company entered into convertible note agreements which included provisions under which the conversion price was equal to the lesser of an initial stated amount or the conversion price of a future offering. This variable conversion feature was recognized as a derivative. Both financings included the issuance of warrants which contained similar variable conversion features. The Company values these convertible notes and warrants using the multinomial lattice method that values the derivative liability within the notes based on a probability weighted discounted cash flow model. The resulting liability is valued at each reporting date and the change in the liability is reflected as change in derivative liability in the statement of operations.
Stock-Based Compensation - We use the estimated grant-date fair value method of accounting in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. Fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes Model using inputs reflecting our estimates of expected volatility, term and future dividends. We plan to estimate the forfeiture rate based on our historical experience but have made no such allowance to date as our first issuances of stock based awards occurred in October 2019 and we have not experienced any forfeitures to date. We recognize compensation costs on a straight line basis over the service period which is generally the vesting term.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.
