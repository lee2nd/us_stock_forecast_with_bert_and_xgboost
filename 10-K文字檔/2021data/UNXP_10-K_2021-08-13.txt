Additional financing is required for us to implement these planned activities. We anticipate obtaining such financing by way of public offerings of equity securities. No assurance can be given that any financing, borrowing or sale of equity or debt will be possible when needed or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms in a timely fashion or even available at all. In addition, our access to capital is affected by prevailing conditions in the financial and equity capital markets, as well as our own financial condition.
Our CEO will provide the services above. Our Chief Executive Officer and director, Andrei Stoukan is responsible for the development of our incentive programs, creation of all advertisements and marketing materials, attending tradeshows and identifying and conducting due diligence on additional customers.
As of June 30, 2021, we had cash of $34,550 and as of June 30,2020, we had cash of $2,726 respectively. There is no assurance our estimates of our current and future costs are accurate or that our revenues will be sufficient to fund the cost of our existing operations or 12-month plan of operations. If our revenues are not sufficient to fund operations we will require additional debt or equity funding to continue our operations. Should this occur, we hope to be able to raise additional funds from an offering of our stock in the future. However, this offering may not occur, or if it occurs, may not raise the required funding. We do not have any plans or specific agreements for new sources of funding. If we are unable to obtain required capital to fund our operations we will have to reduce 12-month plan of operations or discontinue our operations.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance arrangements that would have any current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital recourses.
