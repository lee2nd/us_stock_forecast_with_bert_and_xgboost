ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
Executive Summary
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. To date, COVID-19 has surfaced in nearly all regions around the world and resulted in restrictions and shutdowns implemented by national, state, and local authorities. As a result of the pandemic, we are complying with executive orders issued in Ohio and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines regarding safety procedures. These procedures include, but are not limited to: wearing masks, social distancing, staggering start times, remote working, and teleconferencing versus in person meetings. We are maintaining regular contact, via phone and other electronic means, with our customers and suppliers.
Based on recent conversations with customers, we do not expect to experience any material impairments and do not anticipate any changes in accounting judgements. We are not aware of any material adverse impact on our supply chain and remain in contact with our suppliers. Although we continue to face a period of uncertainty regarding the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and potential emergence of new strains on our projected customer demand, market conditions are gradually improving. In the midst of this challenging economic environment, we are focused on continuing to take the necessary steps to respond quickly to changes in our business and maintaining our financial flexibility in the face of the unprecedented and continuing impact of COVID-19, through specific contingency plans including (but not limited to): reviewing and monitoring planned capital expenditures, reviewing all operating expenses for opportunities to reduce spending, and aligning inventory to estimated revenue.
We continue to monitor the rapidly evolving situation related to COVID-19 including guidance from federal, state, and local public health authorities and may take additional actions based on these recommendations. In these circumstances, there may be developments outside our control requiring us to adjust our operating plan. As such, given the dynamic nature of this situation, we cannot reasonably estimate the impacts of COVID-19 or the emergence of new strains on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity in the future.
On April 17, 2020 we entered into an unsecured promissory note under the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”), with a principal amount of $325,300. The PPP was established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) and is administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the “SBA”). The SBA approved our Forgiveness Application in full on January 6, 2021.
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we had total revenue of $10,896,099. This was a decrease of $2,054,288, or 15.9%, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. Total revenue was adversely impacted by lower volume and COVID-19 related issues compared to 2019.
Gross profit was $2,198,290 and $2,208,563 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Operating expenses were $1,681,943 and $1,877,705 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to additional expenses incurred during our management transition in the first half of 2019 as well as lower travel expenses in 2020.
The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1,017,503. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $3,039. In 2020, we reversed in full our valuation allowance that had been recorded against the unrealizability of the deferred tax asset which resulted in the recording of the asset in the accompanying financial statements of $1,019,317 and a corresponding income tax benefit of the same amount.
Consistent with our growth strategy, we have identified niche markets that can benefit from our expertise in custom powder solutions, such as near infrared doped phosphors and short-wave infrared applications. These applications enable extended life of phosphors for specific nighttime identification needs of defense personnel and first responders.
New initiatives are also being pursued that utilize our vacuum hot press, cold isostatic press, and kilns for development projects, including diffusion bonding. We recently manufactured and sold conductive metal oxides for direct current sputtering of Tungsten Oxide and Molybdenum Oxide materials. We continue to invest in developing new products for all our markets including transparent conductive oxide systems for the solar and display markets as well as with our transparent electronic products. Those products involve research and development expense to accelerate time to market.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Year 2020 compared to Year 2019
Revenue
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had total revenue of $10,896,099. This was a decrease of $2,054,288, or 15.9%, compared to 2019. Total revenue was adversely impacted by lower volume and COVID-19 related issues compared to 2019.
Gross Profit
Gross profit was $2,198,290 for 2020 compared to $2,208,563 for 2019. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue (gross margin) was 20.2% and 17.1% for 2020 and 2019, respectively. The improved 2020 gross margin was due to pricing, product mix and improved manufacturing efficiency. As we continue to implement our growth strategy in complementary niche markets, it is anticipated the Company’s gross margin will continue to improve, although it will be influenced by product mix and price fluctuation of a high priced, low margin raw material for the foreseeable future.
General and Administrative Expense
General and administrative expense for 2020 and 2019, was $1,148,615 and $1,261,958, respectively, a decrease of 9.0%. This decrease was primarily due to lower compensation of approximately $84,000 in 2020 attributable to expenses incurred during our management transition in the first half of 2019. In addition, travel expenses were lower by approximately $18,000 in 2020.
Included in general and administrative expense was $222,024, and $218,098 for professional fees during 2020 and 2019, respectively. These expenses were primarily related to SEC compliance costs for legal, accounting and stockholder relations fees as well as costs associated with the Company’s President and CEO transition during 2019.
Research and Development Expense
Research and development expense for 2020 was $337,823, compared to $366,492 for 2019, a decrease of 7.8%. The decrease was primarily related to slightly lower staffing levels and less outside consulting expense in 2020. Specialty materials are being researched for use in niche markets which include custom applications and additive manufacturing. Our development efforts utilize a disciplined innovation approach focused on accelerating time to market for these applications and involve ongoing research and development expense.
Marketing and Sales Expense
Marketing and sales expense was $195,505, and $249,255 during 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease of $53,750, or 21.6%, was primarily related to lower travel expenses of approximately $60,000. Travel was limited during 2020 due to the cancellation of tradeshows and limited direct contact with customers in response to COVID-19 orders issued by national health organizations and state officials.
Stock Compensation Expense
Included in total expenses were non-cash stock-based compensation costs of $124,720 and $130,009 for 2020 and 2019, respectively. Compensation expense for all stock-based awards is based on the grant date fair value and recognized over the required service (vesting) period. Unrecognized non-cash stock-based compensation expense was $11,033 as of December 31, 2020 and will be recognized through 2023.
Interest
Interest expense was $32,087 and $22,468 for 2020 and 2019, respectively. Interest expense during 2020 was higher due to a new finance lease obligation related to the rebuild of production equipment.
Income Taxes
Income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1,017,503. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $3,039. In 2020, we reversed in full our valuation allowance that had been recorded against the unrealizability of the deferred tax asset, which resulted in the recording of the asset in the accompanying financial statements of $1,019,317 and a corresponding income tax benefit of the same amount. We assessed the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income generated is more likely than not to permit the realization of the existing deferred tax asset. The Company has continued to develop more efficient production methods which helped the Company remain profitable in 2020 despite the slowdown on the economy by COVID-19. Additionally, we have achieved four years of pretax income and expect profits to continue for the foreseeable future. While we have considered future taxable income and used ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances, if we were to determine we would not be able to realize all or part of the deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would decrease income in the period such determination was made. We regularly evaluate the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset.
Income Applicable to Common Stock
Income applicable to common stock for 2020 and 2019 was $1,477,611 and $281,199, respectively. The income tax benefit of $1,017,503 noted above increased the 2020 income applicable to common stock.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash
As of December 31, 2020, cash on hand was $2,917,551. Cash on hand was $1,828,397 at December 31, 2019. This increase was attributable to funds received in the second quarter of 2020 from the Paycheck Protection Program as well as increased gross profit during the fourth quarter of 2020.
Working Capital
At December 31, 2020 working capital was $2,810,629 compared to $1,992,328 at December 31, 2019, an increase of $818,301 or 41.1%. The increase was primarily due to the increase in cash noted above.
Cash from Operations
Net cash provided by operating activities during 2020 was $991,032 and $532,207 during 2019. These figures represent net income net of non cash items, such as, depreciation and amortization of $532,842 and $502,673, and non-cash stock-based compensation costs of $124,720 and $130,009 for 2020 and 2019, respectively. In addition, accrued expenses and customer deposits decreased $1,378,531 and $935,447 during 2020 and 2019. In addition, inventory decreased $1,568,678 during 2020 compared to $3,807 during 2019. Deferred tax assets increased $1,019,317 in 2020 as previously mentioned.
Cash from Investing Activities
During 2020, $75,852 was used in investing activities principally for upgrades of testing equipment. Cash of $379,603 was used in investing activities during 2019, which included an in-plant office structured mezzanine in addition to acquisition of production equipment.
Cash from Financing Activities
Cash of $127,174 and $117,846 was used in financing activities for principal payments to third parties for finance lease obligations and notes payable during 2020 and 2019, respectively. As previously mentioned, during the second quarter of 2020 we entered into an unsecured promissory note under the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”), with a principal amount of $325,300. Also, a dividend payment of $24,152 was made to owners of our Series B preferred stock during 2020 and 2019.
Debt Outstanding
Total debt outstanding was $728,934 at December 31, 2020, compared to $223,835 at December 31, 2019. The increase was due to the proceeds received from the unsecured promissory note under the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”) and a finance lease agreement for the rebuild of production equipment. The SBA approved our PPP Forgiveness Application in full on January 6, 2021.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 2 to the Financial Statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Financial Statements. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory allowances, property and equipment depreciable lives, patents and license useful lives, revenue recognition, income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, realization of deferred tax asset, stock-based compensation and assessing changes in which impairment of certain long-lived assets may occur. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the Financial Statements. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable. If there is a deterioration of a major customer’s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be adversely affected. Inventory purchases and commitments are based upon future demand forecasts. If there is a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products or there is a higher risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements, we may be required to increase our inventory allowances and our gross profit could be adversely affected. The tax valuation allowance is based on our consideration of new evidence, both positive and negative, that could affect our view of the future realization of deferred tax assets. If we were to determine we would not be able to realize all or part of the deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be necessary which would reduce our net income for that period. Depreciable and useful lives estimated for property and equipment, licenses and patents are based on initial expectations of the period of time these assets and intangibles will provide benefit. Changes in circumstances related to a change in our business, change in technology or other factors could result in these assets becoming impaired, which could adversely affect the value of these assets.
Inflation
We believe there has not been a significant impact from inflation on our operations during the past three fiscal years.
