Item 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this Report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under Item 1A “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Report. Please see the “Forward Looking Information” immediately preceding Part I of this Report.
Overview
We offer a full range of commercial and retail banking loan and deposit products through Bank of Hope. We have 58 banking offices in California, New York/New Jersey, Illinois, Washington, Texas, Virginia, and Alabama. We have 11 loan production offices located in Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, Portland, Seattle, Fremont, and in Southern California. We offer our banking services through our network of banking offices and loan production offices to our customers who typically are small to medium-sized businesses in our market areas. We accept deposits and originate a variety of loans including commercial business loans, real estate loans, trade finance loans, SBA loans, and consumer loans.
Our principal business involves earning interest on loans and investment securities that are funded primarily by customer deposits, wholesale deposits, and other borrowings. Our operating income and net income are derived primarily from the difference between interest income received from interest earning assets and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities and, to a lesser extent, from fees received in connection with servicing loan and deposit accounts and income from the sale of loans. Historically, we sold most of the guaranteed portion of SBA loans we originated on the secondary market, but due to the reduced premiums received from the secondary market for SBA guaranteed sales, we made the decision to retain the loans on our balance sheet. Our major expenses are the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, provisions for credit losses and general operating expenses, which primarily consist of salaries and employee benefits, occupancy costs, and other operating expenses. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, such as changes in the national economy and in the related monetary policies of the FRB, inflation, unemployment, consumer spending and political changes and events. We cannot predict the impact that these factors and future changes in domestic and foreign economic and political conditions might have on our performance.
Our results are affected by economic conditions in our markets and to a lesser degree in South Korea. A decline in economic and business conditions in our market areas or in South Korea may have a material adverse impact on the quality of our loan portfolio or the demand for our products and services, which in turn may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
COVID-19 Pandemic
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and any further impact will depend on future developments that cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, the economic implications of the same, effectiveness of vaccines being distributed, and the continued actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic.
The COVID-19 pandemic has substantially and negatively impacted the United States economy, disrupted global supply chains, considerably lowered equity market valuations, created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets, and materially increased unemployment levels. In addition, the pandemic has resulted in permanent and temporary closures of countless businesses and the institution of social distancing and sheltering in place requirements in most states and communities. Although some states and business have reopened, the last wave of COVID-19 cases resulted in further shutdowns and closures. Although COVID-19 vaccines are currently being distributed, it is unknown how long it will take for the vaccines to have a significant positive impact in reducing COVID-19 cases and how effective the vaccine will be for new emerging strains of the COVID-19 virus. The demand for our products and services has been and likely will continue to be significantly adversely impacted, which would continue to materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the pandemic could result in the recognition of amplified credit losses in our loan portfolios and increases in our allowance for credit losses, particularly as more and more businesses are closed. Similarly, because of changing economic and market conditions, we may be required to recognize impairments on goodwill or impairment on other financial instruments we hold.
The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as our regulatory capital and liquidity ratios, will depend on future developments, that cannot be predicted, including the effectiveness of vaccines, the scope and duration of the pandemic, the economic implications of the same, and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic.
On March 27, 2020, President Donald Trump signed into law the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act in response to the global pandemic. The CARES Act provided approximately $2.2 trillion in emergency economic relief funds, expanded SBA lending and provides temporary relief of certain modifications from TDR classification. In December 2020, the President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 which included another $900 billion in stimulus relief for the COVID-19 pandemic to provide emergency economic relief funds, further expanded SBA lending with additional funds for SBA PPP, and provides an extension for the relief of certain modifications from TDR classification. In 2020, we assisted many of our customers in availing themselves of certain provisions of the CARES Act by providing loan modifications to borrowers consisting of mostly payment deferrals. We also funded $480.1 million in SBA PPP loans in 2020 (see “COVID-19 Related Loan Modifications” in the Financial Conditions section of the MD&A for more information) and with the approval of a second round of PPP funds, we started originating additional PPP loans in the first quarter of 2021.
At December 31, 2020, all of our regulatory capital ratios for Hope Bancorp and the Bank were in excess of the minimum requirements set by our regulators. While we currently believe that we have sufficient excess capital and liquidity to withstand the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, further economic deterioration or an extended recession could adversely impact our capital and liquidity positions.
Pandemic Response Plan
With the onset of the COVID-19 virus, we activated a Pandemic Response Plan in January 2020, in advance of the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of the Pandemic Response Plan, a Pandemic Response Team and a Business Continuity Program Team were formed which closely monitor the COVID-19 situation, identifying issues and developing responses to reduce risks related to COVID-19 to our customers, employees, and communities. As part of our overall efforts to help contain the spread of the virus, we made a number of adjustments in our branch operations:
•Nationwide, we reduced the operating hours;
•For some of our branches with drive-thru service facilities, we limited in-branch services by appointment only;
•We have also temporarily closed a number of branches that are in close proximity to another branch location;
•We implemented social distancing procedures limiting the number of customers in a branch at a given time; requiring the use of face masks and hand sanitizers by all customers entering a branch, and added aisle lines to help guide customers in maintaining a minimum of 6 feet of separation;
•We limited operations to every other teller station as warranted to maintain the minimum 6-feet distance;
•We installed sneeze guards at all teller stations and customer service areas;
•We have provided our branch staff with facial masks, as well as face shields; and
•We implemented enhanced cleaning and disinfecting protocols at all of our branches.
We have also implemented a number of changes to our back-office operations including:
•Enabling the majority of our employees with remote work capabilities and implementing a remote rotation strategy with the general goal of having approximately 50% of the department staff working onsite and the remainder working remotely;
•In-person meetings have been prohibited to the extent possible;
•In line with social distancing guidelines, certain employee workstations have been temporarily modified to allow for a minimum separation of approximately six feet between each employee;
•Common break areas have been closed; and
•We have implemented enhanced cleaning and disinfecting protocols for our non-branch locations.
The goal of the Pandemic Response Plan is to protect the health of our customers, employees, and communities while continuing to meet the needs of our customers. The Pandemic Response Team and Business Continuity Program Team will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation and take additional actions in an effort to ensure the safe continued operations of the Bank.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and generally accepted practices within the banking industry. The financial information contained within these statements is, to a significant extent, financial information that is based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. All of our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements presented elsewhere in this Report and are essential to understanding Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may materially and adversely differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
The following is a summary of the more subjective and complex accounting estimates and judgements affecting the financial condition and results reported in our financial statements. In each area, we have identified the variables we believe to be the most important in the estimation process. We use the best information available to us to make the estimations necessary to value the related assets and liabilities in each of these areas. Management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with our Audit Committee.
Business Combinations
Description - Mergers and acquisitions are accounted for in accordance with ASC 805 “Business Combinations” using the acquisition method of accounting. Assets and liabilities acquired and assumed are generally recorded at their fair values as of the date of the transaction. The excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Critical accounting policies related to acquired loans is discussed in more detail below under “Purchase Credit Deteriorated Loans” (“PCD”).
Subjective Estimates and Judgments - Determining the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired often involves estimates based on internal estimate or third-party valuations using a discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation technique that may include the use of estimates. In addition, the determination of the useful lives over which intangible assets will be amortized is subjective in nature.
Impact if Actual Results Differ From Estimates and Judgments - Changes to estimates and judgments used in business combinations could result in a significant difference in the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired which would impact total goodwill recorded. A change in the useful life of intangible assets could impact amortization amounts which could have an impact on our earnings.
Investment Securities
Description - We evaluate securities in unrealized loss position for impairment related to credit losses on at least a quarterly basis. Based on our evaluation, we do not believe that we had any investment securities available for sale with unrealized losses with credit loss impairment as of December 31, 2020. Investment securities are discussed in more detail under “Financial Condition - Investment Security Portfolio”.
Subjective Estimates and Judgments - Significant judgment is involved in determining when a decline in fair value is credit impaired. Securities in unrealized loss positions are first assessed as to whether we intend to sell, or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If one of the criteria is met, the security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through current earnings. For securities that do not meet these criteria, we evaluate whether the decline in fair value resulted from credit losses or other factors. In evaluating whether a credit loss exists, we set up an initial filter for impairment triggers. Once the quantitative filters have been triggered, the securities are placed on a watch list and an additional assessment is performed to identify whether a credit impairment exists. In making this assessment, management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security and the issuer, among other factors.
Impact if Actual Results Differ From Estimates and Judgments - Changes in management’s assessment of the factors used to determine that an investment security was not credit impaired could lead to additional impairment charges. Additionally, a security that had no apparent risk could be affected by a sudden or acute market condition and necessitate an impairment charge.
Allowance for Credit Losses
Description - The allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb expected lifetime losses in the consolidated loan portfolio. The adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is determined by management based upon an evaluation and review of the credit quality of the loan portfolio, consideration of current and projected economic conditions and variables, and historical loss experience, relevant internal and external factors that affect the collection of a loan, and other pertinent factors. The allowance for credit losses is discussed in more detail under “Financial Condition - Allowance for Credit Losses”.
Subjective Estimates and Judgments - We determine the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses by analyzing and estimating lifetime expected losses in the loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses requires estimates that are not limited to current and projected economic conditions, the adequacy of and value of underlying collateral on real estate loans, the financial strength of the borrower, qualitative assessments, and other relevant factors. Specifically, the provision for credit losses represents the amount charged against current period earnings to achieve an allowance for credit losses that, in our judgment, is adequate to absorb lifetime expected losses in the loan portfolio.
Impact if Actual Results Differ From Estimates and Judgments - Adverse changes in management’s assessment of the assumptions and factors used to determine the allowance for credit losses could lead to additional provision for credit losses. Actual credit losses could differ materially from management’s estimates if actual losses and conditions differ significantly from the assumptions used. These factors and conditions include general economic conditions within our market, industry trends and concentrations, real estate and other collateral values, interest rates, and the financial conditions of our borrowers. While management believes that it has established adequate allowances for lifetime losses on loans, actual results may prove different and the differences could be significant.
Goodwill
Description - Goodwill is generally determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized but tested for impairment at least annually. Goodwill may also be tested for impairment on an interim basis if circumstances change or an event occurs between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. An impairment loss must be recognized for any excess of carrying value over fair value of the goodwill.
Subjective Estimates and Judgments - Before applying the goodwill impairment test, in accordance with ASC 350 “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other”, we perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. If we conclude that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we do not perform Step 1 of the impairment analysis. We assess certain qualitative factors to determine whether impairment is likely including: our market capitalization, capital adequacy, continued performance compared to peers, and continued improvement in asset quality trends, among others. This qualitative assessment can be subjective in nature and includes a certain amount of management judgment in determining whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount.
In the event we perform an impairment test, the determination of fair value is based on valuations using management assumptions and estimates including developing cash flow projections, selecting appropriate discount rates, calculation of a terminal growth rate, minimum target capitalization levels, identifying relevant market comparables, incorporating current and projected economic conditions, and selecting an appropriate control premium.
Impact if Actual Results Differ From Estimates and Judgments - Changes in qualitative factors assessed, changes to assumptions used in the impairment test, selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques, and downturns in economic or business conditions, could have a significant adverse impact on the carrying value of goodwill and could result in impairment losses which could have a material impact our financial condition and earnings.
Income Taxes
Description - We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our asset and liabilities. The realization of the net deferred tax asset generally depends upon future levels of taxable income and the existence of prior years’ taxable income, to which “carry back” refund claims could be made. A valuation allowance is maintained, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets that management estimates are more likely than not to be unrealizable based on available evidence at the time the estimate is made. Furthermore, tax positions that could be deemed uncertain are required to be disclosed and reserved for if it is more likely than not that the position would not be sustained upon audit examination. Taxes are discussed in more detail in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements presented elsewhere in this Report.
Subjective Estimates and Judgments - Significant management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities. Some judgments are subjective and involve estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. In determining the valuation allowance, we use historical and forecasted future operating results. In determining the level of reserve needed for uncertain tax positions, we consider relevant current legislation and court rulings, among other authoritative items, to determine the level of exposure inherent in our tax positions. Management believes that the accounting estimate related to the valuation allowance and uncertain tax positions are a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions can change from period to period.
Impact if Actual Results Differ From Estimates and Judgments - Although management believes that the judgments and estimates used are reasonable, should actual factors and conditions differ materially from those considered by management, the actual realization of the net deferred tax asset and tax positions taken could differ materially from the amounts recorded in the financial statements. If we are not able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future or if a tax position is overturned by a taxing authority, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination was made which could have a material impact on our earnings.
Results of Operations
Operations Summary
Our most significant source of income is net interest income, which is the difference between our interest income and our interest expense. Generally, interest income is generated from the loans we extend to our customers and from investments, and interest expense is generated from interest bearing deposits our customers have with us and from borrowings or debt that we may have, such as FHLB advances, federal funds purchased, convertible notes, and subordinated debentures. Our ability to generate profitable levels of net interest income is largely dependent on our ability to manage the levels of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, and the rates received or paid on them, as well as our ability to maintain sound asset quality and appropriate levels of capital and liquidity. As mentioned above, interest income and interest expense may fluctuate based on factors beyond our control, such as economic or political conditions and policies.
We attempt to minimize the effect of interest rate fluctuations on net interest margin by monitoring our interest sensitive assets and our interest sensitive liabilities. Net interest income can be affected by a change in the composition of assets and liabilities, such as replacing higher yielding loans with a like amount of lower yielding investment securities. Changes in the level of nonaccrual loans and changes in volume and interest rates can also affect net interest income. Volume changes are caused by differences in the level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. Interest rate changes result from differences in yields earned on assets and rates paid on liabilities.
The other source of our income is noninterest income, including service charges and fees on deposit accounts, loan servicing fees, fees from trade finance activities, net gains on sale of loans that were held for sale and investment securities available for sale, and other income and fees. Our noninterest income can be reduced by charges from the credit impairment of our investment securities.
In addition to interest expense, our income is also impacted by provisions for loan losses and noninterest expense, primarily salaries and benefits and occupancy expense. The following table presents our condensed consolidated statements of income and the changes year over year.
Net Income
Our net income was $111.5 million for 2020 compared to $171.0 million for 2019 and $189.6 million for 2018. Our diluted earnings per common share totaled $0.90, $1.35, and $1.44 for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The return on average assets was 0.68%, 1.12%, and 1.29% and the return on average stockholders’ equity was 5.49%, 8.63%, and 9.92% for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The decrease in net income for 2020 compared to 2019 was due to an increase in provision for credit losses and a decrease in interest income offset partially by a decline in interest expense. 2020 marked an unprecedented year with the COVID-19 pandemic which had a significantly adverse effect on the economy. The potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our loan portfolio combined with the adoption of CECL resulted in a large increase in allowance for credit losses for 2020 compared to 2019.
Impact of Acquisitions
Income before income tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were impacted by the accretion of discounts and the amortization of premiums relating to past acquisitions. The following table summarizes the accretion and amortization adjustments that were included in net income for the years indicated below:
Net Interest Margin and Net Interest Rate Spread
We analyze our earnings performance using, among other measures, net interest spread and net interest margin. The net interest spread represents the difference between the weighted average yield earned on interest earning assets and the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities. Net interest income, when expressed as a percentage of average total interest earning assets, is referred to as the net interest margin. Our net interest margin is affected by changes in the yields earned on assets and rates paid on liabilities, as well as the ratio of the amounts of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities.
Interest rates charged on our loans are affected principally by the demand for such loans, the supply of money available for lending purposes, the interest rate environment, and other competitive factors. These factors are in turn affected by general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control, such as federal economic policies, the general supply of money in the economy, legislative tax policies, governmental budgetary matters, and the actions of the FRB.
The following table presents our net interest margin, net interest rate spread, and our condensed consolidated average balance sheet information, together with interest rates earned and paid on the various sources and uses of funds, for the years indicated:
(1) Interest income on loans includes accretion of net deferred loan origination fees and costs, prepayment fees received on loan pay-offs and accretion of discounts on acquired loans. See the table below for detail.
(2) Average balances of loans are net of deferred loan origination fees and costs and include nonaccrual loans and loans held for sale.
(3) Interest income and yields are not presented on a tax-equivalent basis.
(4) Yield on interest earning assets minus cost of interest bearing liabilities.
(5) Cost on interest bearing liabilities and noninterest bearing deposits.
The following table presents net loan origination fees, loan prepayments fee income, interest reversed for nonaccrual loans, and discount accretion income included as part of loan interest income for the years indicated:
Net Interest Income
Net interest income was $467.5 million for 2020, compared to $466.6 million for 2019 and $487.9 million for 2018. Changes in net interest income are a function of changes in interest rates and volumes of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. The table below sets forth information regarding the changes in interest income and interest expense for the periods indicated. The total change for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities is segmented into the change attributable to variations in volume (changes in volume multiplied by the old rate) and the change attributable to variations in interest rates (changes in rates multiplied by the old volume). Nonaccrual loans are included in average loans used to compute this table.
Net interest income before provision for credit losses increased by $903 thousand, or less than 1%, for 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to a decrease in cost of interest bearing deposits which decreased by 95 basis points for 2020 compared to 2019. This decrease in cost of interest bearing deposits resulted in a decrease to interest expense of $86.8 million. The decrease in interest expense was partially offset by a decrease in interest income of $85.9 million due to decrease in interest rates in 2020 compared to the previous year.
Net interest income before provision for credit losses decreased by $21.3 million, or 4%, for 2019 compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in cost of interest bearing deposits which increased by 52 basis points for 2019 compared to 2018. This increase resulted in an increase to interest expense of $46.4 million due to the change in rates. The decrease in net interest income was partially offset by an increase in interest income of $34.6 million due to increase in average interest earning assets of 4% during 2019 compared to the previous year which resulted in an increase in interest income of $23.3 million due to the change in volume.
Interest Income
Interest income was $598.9 million for 2020, compared to $684.8 million for 2019 and $650.2 million for 2018. The yield on average interest earning assets was 3.84% for 2020, compared to 4.81% for 2019 and 4.71% for 2018.
Comparison of 2020 with 2019
The decrease in interest income of $85.9 million, or 13%, for 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily a result of the decline in interest rate in 2020. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact to the U.S. economy, the FOMC lowered the target federal funds rate by a total of 1.50% in March 2020 to 0.00%-0.25%. The reduction in interest rates in March 2020, had a large impact on our loan yields and interest income as our variable rate loans repriced to lower interest rates and new loans were originated at lower rates. Average total loans increased by $699.8 million for 2020 compared to 2019. Discount accretion income on acquired loans decreased to $23.1 million for 2020 compared to $31.8 million for 2019
Comparison of 2019 with 2018
The increase in interest income of $34.6 million, or 5%, for 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily a result of the growth in total loans. In addition, the interest rates for 2019 were slightly higher on average compared to 2018 which resulted in an increase in yield on earnings assets. Average total loans increased by $451.7 million in 2019 compared to 2018. Discount accretion income on acquired loans decreased to $31.8 million for 2019 compared to $33.6 million for 2018.
Interest Expense
Deposits
Interest expense on deposits was $110.4 million for 2020 compared to $190.2 million for 2019 and $135.0 million for 2018. The average cost of deposits was 0.81% for 2020, compared to 1.58% for 2019 and 1.16% for 2018. The average cost of interest bearing deposits was 1.14% for 2020, compared to 2.09% for 2019 and 1.57% for 2018.
Comparison of 2020 with 2019
The decrease in interest expense on total deposits of $79.8 million, or 42%, for 2020 compared to 2019 was due to a reduction in rates paid on interest bearing deposits in 2020 compared to 2019. We reduced the rates paid on our various deposits multiple times in 2020. The reduction in deposit rates was both a result of the interest rate cuts in March 2020 and due to a significant increase in liquidity throughout 2020. The increase in liquidity in 2020 resulted in a reduction in loan funding needs which had an impact on the overall rates paid on deposits as we were less eager to compete for additional sources of funds. The average balance of noninterest bearing deposits accounted for 32% of total average deposits at December 31, 2020 compared to 24% at December 31, 2019.
Comparison of 2019 with 2018
The increase in interest expense on total deposits of $55.2 million, or 41%, for 2019 compared to 2018 was due to an increase in interest bearing deposit accounts, particularly an increase in average time deposits accounts, in addition to an overall increase in deposit rates offered in 2019. Although our cost of deposits started experiencing a decline in the second half of 2019, the overall average rate on deposits for 2019 was higher compared to 2018. The average balance of noninterest bearing deposits accounted for 24% of total average deposits at December 31, 2019 compared to 26% at December 31, 2018.
FHLB Advances and Federal Funds Purchased
FHLB advances and federal funds purchased include borrowings from the FHLB and federal funds purchased. As part of our asset-liability management, we utilize FHLB advances to supplement our deposit source of funds. Therefore, there may be fluctuations in these balances depending on the short-term liquidity and longer-term financing needs of the Bank.
Average FHLB advances were $435.8 million for 2020, compared to $688.7 million in 2019 and $870.1 million in 2018. Interest expense on FHLB advances was $6.9 million for 2020 compared to $12.0 million for 2019 and $15.1 million for 2018. The average cost of FHLB advances was 1.58% for 2020, compared to 1.75% for 2019 and 1.74% for 2018. The average cost of FHLB advances included the amortization of premiums recorded on advances acquired from prior acquisitions. Total amortization of FHLB premiums for 2020 was $0, compared to $1.3 million in 2019 and $1.4 million in 2018. During 2020, we repaid $1.74 billion in FHLB advances with an average rate of 0.69% and borrowed $1.36 billion in advances with an average rate of 0.22%. $300.0 million in FHLB advances prepaid in 2020 were prepaid early before maturity and we paid a prepayment penalty of $3.6 million.
Convertible Notes
In 2018, we issued $217.5 million in senior convertible notes. The carrying balance of our convertible notes are net of discount to be amortized and issuance costs to be capitalized. The cost of our convertible notes for 2020 was 4.61% compared to 4.64% for 2019. The cost of our convertible notes consists of the 2.00% coupon rate, the non-cash conversion option rate, and the issuance cost capitalization rate. We adopted ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2021, and as a result our convertible notes are accounted for a single debt instrument. As a result, the cost of convertible notes beginning in 2021 will be closer to the coupon rate.
Other Borrowings
Other borrowings consist of subordinated debentures which bear interest at the 3-month LIBOR rate plus a designated spread. There were no changes in our balance of subordinated debentures during 2019 or 2020 aside from the increases related to the discount accretion on subordinated debentures acquired from previous acquisitions. The average rate on other borrowing decreased to 4.63% for 2020 compared to 6.74% for 2019 and 6.44% for 2018. The change in cost of other borrowings for 2020 and 2019 compared to prior years was due to changes in the 3-month LIBOR rate.
Provision for Credit Losses
The provision for credit losses reflects our judgment of the current period cost associated with credit risk inherent in our loan portfolio. The provision for credit losses for each period is dependent upon many factors, including loan growth, net charge offs, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio, delinquencies, assessments by management, third parties’ and regulators’ examination of the loan portfolio, the value of the underlying collateral on problem loans, the general economic conditions in our market areas, and future projections of the economy. Specifically, the provision for credit losses represents the amount charged against current period earnings to achieve an allowance for credit losses that, in our judgment, is adequate to absorb probable lifetime losses inherent in our loan portfolio. Periodic fluctuations in the provision for credit losses result from management’s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses; however, actual credit losses could potentially vary materially from current estimates. If the allowance for credit losses is inadequate, we may be required to record additional provision for credit losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
With the adoption of ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments” (“CECL”) in 2020, our provision for credit losses is more volatile due to changes in the calculation of the allowance for credit losses and especially due to the volatility that arose from the COVID-19 pandemic. CECL requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets carried at amortized cost based on historical experience, current macroeconomic conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. For additional information regarding the adoption of CECL, refer to “Accounting Pronouncements Adopted” section in Footnote 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Comparison of 2020 with 2019
The provision for credit losses was $95.0 million for 2020, an increase of $87.7 million, or 1,201%, from $7.3 million for 2019. The increase in provision for credit losses for 2020 compared to 2019 was due to both the adoption of CECL and due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected many industries with the hospitality sector being one of the hardest hit. Hotel/motel loans make up a large percentage of our loan portfolio at approximately 12% at December 31, 2020. As a result, our estimated allowance for credit losses experienced large increases in 2020 to reflect the current and projected impact of COVID-19 pandemic on our loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses coverage ratio was 1.52% of total loans at December 31, 2020 compared to 0.77% at December 31, 2019.
Comparison of 2019 with 2018
The provision for loan losses was $7.3 million for 2019, a decrease of $7.6 million, or 51%, from $14.9 million for 2018. The decrease in provision for loan losses for 2019 compared to 2018 was due the reduction in net charge-offs for 2019 compared to 2018 and an improvement in credit quality. The allowance for loan losses requirement remained unchanged at 0.77% of total loans at December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018. The reduction in net charge-offs for 2019 resulted in a reduction in provision for loans losses required to replenish the allowance for loan losses for the year. Net charge offs totaled $4.4 million for 2019 compared to $6.9 million for 2018.
See Note 1 “Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our allowance for credit losses methodology for 2020 and for a discussion of our former incurred loss allowance for loan losses methodology, please refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Noninterest Income
Noninterest income is primarily comprised of service charges on deposit accounts, net gains on sales of other loans and sale of available for sale securities, and other fees and income. Noninterest income was $53.4 million for 2020 compared to $49.7 million for 2019, and $60.2 million for 2018.
A breakdown of noninterest income by category is shown below:
Comparison of 2020 with 2019
The decrease in service fees on deposit accounts for 2020 compared to 2019 was due to a decrease in non-sufficient funds fees collected on deposit accounts and a decline in analysis fees income. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the stay at home orders issued by many states for many months in 2020, deposit activity for 2020 was greatly reduced compared to 2019. As a result, demand deposit account transactions and non-sufficient funds had significant declines in 2020. Analysis fee income declined for 2020 compared to 2019 due to the closing of higher risk deposit accounts during the year. The analysis fees collected on these accounts were on the higher end and the closing of these accounts contributed to the decline in service fee on deposits accounts for 2020 compared to 2019.
International service fees declined for 2020 compared to 2019 due to a decline in fees generated from trade finance loans. International service fees are earned from trade finance loans and as the balance of these loans have declined, the associated fee income earned has also declined. The balance of trade finance loans declined to $102.8 million at December 31, 2020 from $160.9 million at December 31, 2019.
Loan servicing fees, net represents income earned from servicing SBA and residential mortgage loans that were previously sold. We retain servicing on most of the loans that we choose to sell. The increase in loan servicing fees, net for 2020 compared to 2019 was due to a reduction in payoffs of serviced loans. Payoffs of serviced loans were higher during 2019, which resulted in the full amortization of the remaining servicing asset, which is recorded as a reduction to loan servicing fee income.
Wire transfer fees declined for 2020 compared to 2019 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a significant decline in deposit related transactions, including wire transfers.
Swap fee income represents fees earned from back to back swap transactions for our loan customers. Due to the volatility in interest rates we have experienced in the past twelve months, the number of swap transactions increased in 2020 which resulted in an increase in swap fee income for 2020 compared to 2019.
Net gain on sale of other loans increased in 2020 compared to 2019 due to an increase in loans sold and an increase in premiums received. Net gains on sales of other loans represents net gains primarily from the sale of residential mortgage loans. We sold $298.4 million in residential mortgage loans compared to $209.4 million residential mortgage loans sold in 2019. The average weighted premium on residential mortgage loans sold was 2.68% for 2020 compared to 2.06% for 2019.
During 2020, we sold investment securities with a total book value of $160.5 million for a net gain of $7.5 million. This compares to investment securities with a total book value of $115.3 million sold during 2019.
Comparison of 2019 with 2018
The decrease in noninterest income for 2019 over 2018 primarily reflected decreases in loan servicing fees and net gain on sales of SBA loans, partially offset by an increase to net gain on sales of other loans.
Loan servicing fees decreased by $2.4 million, or 51%, to $2.3 million in 2019 compared to $4.7 million in 2018. The decrease in loan servicing fees in 2019 was primarily a result of an increase in payoffs of loans we service. When loans that we service are paid off, the remaining unamortized servicing asset originally recorded is charged against servicing fees reducing our overall fee income.
Net gains on sales of SBA loans decreased by $9.7 million, or 100%, in 2019 compared to 2018. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we made the decision discontinue the practice of regularly selling the guaranteed portion of SBA loans on the secondary market and to retain these loans on our balance sheet due to the decline in premiums offered in the secondary market for the guaranteed portions SBA loans. As a result, there were no SBA loans sold in 2019 compared to $159.8 million of SBA loans sold in 2018.
Net gain on sale of other loans increased by $2.0 million, or 81%, to $4.5 million in 2019 from $2.5 million in 2018. Net gains on sales of other loans represents net gains primarily from the sale of residential mortgage loans. The increase in net gains on sales of other loans was due to the increase in residential mortgage loans sold in 2019 compared to 2018. In 2019, we sold $209.4 million in residential mortgage loans compared to $115.9 million residential mortgage loans sold in 2018.
Noninterest Expense
Noninterest expense is primarily comprised of salaries and employee benefit expense, occupancy expense, furniture and equipment expense, advertising and marketing expenses, data processing and communications expenses, professional fees, investment in affordable housing partnership expenses, and other expenses. Noninterest expense was $283.6 million for 2020, compared to $282.6 million for 2019 and $277.7 million for 2018. The increases in noninterest expenses were $1.0 million, or less than 1%, for 2020 compared to 2019, and $4.9 million, or 2%, for 2019 compared to 2018. Noninterest expense as a percentage of average assets for 2020 was 1.72% compared to 1.86% for 2019 and 1.88% for 2018.
A breakdown of noninterest expense by category is provided below:
Comparison of 2020 with 2019
The increase in noninterest expense for 2020 over 2019 was due mostly to increases in OREO expenses, investment in affordable housing partnership expenses, FHLB prepayment fee, and branch restructuring expenses, partially offset by significant declines in professional fees, advertising and marketing, occupancy, and data processing expenses.
Salaries and employee benefits expense increased $1.7 million for 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in salaries and employee benefits was due to an increase in salaries paid in 2020 and an increase in stock compensation expenses compared to 2019. These increases were partially offset by declines in payroll related loan origination costs, temporary personnel, bonus provision, and group insurance expenses. Salaries and employee benefits for 2020 included deferred originations costs which were recorded from the origination of $480.1 million in SBA PPP loans during the 2020. SBA PPP loan origination costs of $5.3 million was recorded during the second quarter of 2020 which initially reduced salaries and benefits and going forward is amortized through the life of the loans as a reduction to interest income. The number of full-time equivalent employees decreased from 1,441 at December 31, 2019 to 1,408 at December 31, 2020. During the third quarter of 2020, we implemented a 4% reduction in staff in light of the impact that COVID-19 is having on our operations. The staff reduction is expected to result in approximately $6.4 million in annual savings to salaries and employee benefits.
Occupancy expense declined for 2020 compared to 2019 due to the decline in rent expenses and other occupancy related expenditures. In December 2020, we implemented our previously planned branch consolidation plan in which we closed five branch offices. As a result, we recorded $2.4 million in restructuring costs related to the write-down of related ROU assets, severance payments, and other costs. The branch consolidation is estimated to result in approximately $2.6 million in annual cost savings starting in 2021.
Furniture and equipment expense increased for 2020 compared to 2019 due to additional expenditures made for software subscriptions, licenses, and IT related equipment and services.
Advertising and marketing expense decreased for 2020 compared to 2019 due to the decline in public sponsorship fees. In 2020, we did not sponsor the Ladies Professional Golf Association (“LPGA”) Founders Cup for which sponsorship fees were $1.5 million in 2019. However, we are currently in talks with the LPGA to once again become a sponsor for one of their events starting in 2021.
Data process and communications expense decreased for 2020 compared to 2019 due to an overall decline in core data processing fees as the number of loan and deposit transactions have declined.
Professional fees experienced a large decrease of $14.4 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease in professional fees for 2020 was due to decreases in fees related to the implementation of CECL, IT related professional fees, and internal audit service fees. With the expansion of our internal audit department, we were able to significantly reduce internal audit service fees in 2020 as much more of the work is now performed internally.
Investment in affordable housing partnership expenses increased in 2020 compared to 2019. We make investments in affordable housing partnerships and receive Community Reinvestment Act credits and tax credits, which reduces our overall tax provision rate. Investments in affordable housing partnership expenses are recorded based on benefit schedules of individual investment projects under the equity method of accounting. The benefit schedules show tax loss/deductions investors can take each year. We amortize the initial cost of investments in affordable housing partnership by tax loss/deductions. This amortization expense is more than offset by both tax credits received, which reduces our tax provision expense dollar for dollar and the tax benefits related to any tax losses generated through the affordable housing project’s expenditures. Total tax credits related to our investment in affordable housing partnership investment was approximately $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The balance of investments in affordable housing partnerships decreased from $82.6 million at December 31, 2019 to $69.5 million at December 31, 2020.
The FDIC assessment premium utilizes an initial base assessment rate, which is calculated as a percentage of our average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity. In addition to the initial assessment base, adjustments are added based upon our regulatory rating and selected financial measures. The increase in FDIC assessment fees for 2020 compared to the 2019 was largely due to a $1.5 million small bank assessment credit that was received during the third quarter of 2019 which reduced FDIC assessment fees for 2019. There were no recorded credits for 2020 which resulted in an increase in these fees.
Credit related expenses increased in 2020 compared to 2019 due to an increase in credit related provision expenses. In 2020 we set aside $1.0 million in provisions for accrued interest for loans currently on payment deferrals related to COVID-19. We had no such provision in 2019. In addition, provision for unfunded loan commitments which is included in credit related expenses increased by $760 thousand in 2020 compared to 2019.
The increase in OREO expense for 2020 compared to 2019 was due to an increase in valuation expenses for OREO in 2020. The overall value OREO experienced significant declines in 2020 compared to 2019 which resulted in much higher OREO related expense in 2020.
During third quarter of 2020, we utilized a portion of our excess liquidity to payoff $300.0 million in FHLB advances. These advances were paid off before maturity and resulted in a prepayment fee of $3.6 million. There was no FHLB advance prepayment penalty incurred in 2019. The FHLB advances repaid had an average weighted rate of 1.68% and had remaining maturities ranging from 4 months to 2.4 years. The prepayment of these advance resulted in over $1.0 million in interest expense savings for the fourth quarter of 2020.
In December 2020, we recorded branch restructuring costs of $2.4 million related to our branch consolidation plan. The $2.4 million in restructuring costs consisted of $349 thousand in severance payments, $2.0 million in occupancy expense most of which was related to the write-down of ROU assets, and $55 thousand in other various expenditures. There was no branch restructuring cost incurred in 2019.
Comparison of 2019 with 2018
The increase in noninterest expense for 2019 over 2018 was due mostly to increases in salaries and employee benefits, professional fees, and credit related expenses, partially offset by a decline in data processing expenses, investment in affordable housing partnership expenses, FDIC assessment expenses, OREO expenses, and branch restructuring expenses.
Salaries and employee benefits totaled $161.2 million for 2019, an increase of $7.7 million, or 5%, compared to $153.5 million for 2018. The increase in salaries and benefits was mostly due to an increase in salaries, bonus provisions, stock compensation expenses, and insurance related expenses partially offset by a decline in loan commission paid during the year. During the third quarter of 2018, we restructured our incentive compensation plans, which resulted in a reversal of previously accrued bonus provisions. As a result, total bonus provision expense was higher in 2019 compared to the same period of 2018. The restructured incentive plan also resulted in an increase in stock compensation costs in 2019 compared to 2018 as a larger portion of the incentive plan is now paid in stock awards. In 2019, we had a large increase in insurance related costs due to an increase in self-insured insurance claims. This resulted in an increase in insurance related costs in 2019 compared to 2018. We experienced a decline in commissions paid on loans to employees in 2019 compared to 2018 due to the reduction in residential mortgage originations and associated commissions. The number of full-time equivalent employees decreased from 1,494 at December 31, 2018 to 1,441 at December 31, 2019.
Data processing and communications expenses decreased $3.5 million, or 24%, to $10.8 million for 2019 compared to $14.2 million for 2018. Data processing and communication fees for 2019 included credits received for current year data processing fees from our core processing vendor as part of our negotiated contract renewal which begins in 2020. These credits resulted in an overall decline in data processing and communications fees for 2019 compared to 2018.
Professional fees increased $6.2 million, or 38%, to $22.5 million for 2019 compared to $16.3 million for 2018. The increase in professional fees was due to increases in internal audit service fees, third parties consulting fees for assistance with the implementation of the new accounting standard for current expected credit losses (“CECL”), and various other consulting fees. Professional fees related to the implementation of CECL is expected to decline in 2020 following the adoption of the new standard.
Investments in affordable housing partnership expenses decreased $2.8 million, or 23%, to $9.3 million for 2019 compared to $12.1 million for 2018. We make investments in affordable housing partnerships and receive CRA credit and tax credits which reduces our overall tax provision expense. Investments in affordable housing partnership expenses that are not impairment related are based on the performance of the underlying investment. We receive updated financial information for our affordable housing partnerships investments and record losses based on the performance of the investment. These losses will eventually be offset by tax credits which reduce our tax provision expense. Investments in affordable housing partnerships decreased from $92.0 million at December 31, 2018 to $82.6 million at December 31, 2019.
FDIC assessment expenses decreased $2.7 million, or 41%, to $3.9 million for 2019 compared to $6.6 million for 2018. The FDIC assessment premium utilizes an initial base assessment rate which is calculated as a percentage of our average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity. In addition to the initial assessment base, adjustments are added based on our regulatory rating and certain financial measures. The decrease in FDIC assessments for 2019 compared to 2018 was due to a $1.5 million small bank assessment credit received from the FDIC during the third quarter of 2019.
Credit related expenses increased $2.1 million, or 74%, to $5.0 million for 2019 compared to $2.9 million for 2018. Credit related expenses increased in 2019 compared to 2018 largely due to increases to expenses related to loan collections, forced insurance expenses, and other miscellaneous credit related expenses.
OREO (income) expense, net experienced a decline in 2019 compared to 2018 due to a fair value adjustment recorded for a loan that was transferred to OREO during the third quarter of 2019. The fair value of the underlying collateral of the loan (less cost to sell) being transferred to OREO exceeded the carrying balance of the loan and a fair value adjustment was recorded to reflect the difference in value. The fair value adjustment of $1.7 million was partially offset by an increase in OREO related expenses.
In December 2018, we incurred a restructuring charge of $1.7 million, related to our branch rationalization plan which was announced in December 2018 and completed in the second quarter of 2019. The $1.7 million in restructuring costs consisted of $229 thousand in salaries and benefit expenses, $957 thousand in occupancy expense, and $488 thousand in other various expenditures. There were no branch restructuring costs for 2019.
Income Tax Provision
The provision for income taxes for 2020 was $30.8 million, compared to $55.3 million in 2019 and $65.9 million in 2018. The effective income tax rate was 21.63% for 2020 compared to 24.44% for 2019 and 25.79% for 2018. The reduction in effective tax rate for 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to CRA investment tax credits which had a larger impact on tax rate for 2020 compared to 2019 due to a decline in pretax income.
Financial Condition
Our total assets were $17.11 billion at December 31, 2020 compared to $15.67 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $1.44 billion, or 9.2% year over year. The increase in assets for 2020 compared to 2019 was principally due to the increase in securities available-for-sale and loans receivable. These increases for 2020 were partially offset by a decline in cash and cash equivalents.
Investment Security Portfolio
The main objectives of our investment strategy are to provide sources of liquidity while managing our interest rate risk and to generate an adequate level of interest income without taking undue risks. Our investment policy permits investments in various types of securities, certificates of deposits, and federal funds sold in compliance with various restrictions in the policy. All of our investment securities are classified as available for sale. The securities for which we have the ability and intent to hold to maturity may be classified as held to maturity securities. However, we do not currently maintain a held-for-maturity or trading portfolio.
Our available for sale securities totaled $2.29 billion at December 31, 2020, compared to $1.72 billion at December 31, 2019. We had no securities that were categorized as held to maturity at December 31, 2020 or 2019. We had securities that were called, matured, or paid down totaling $565.4 million, purchased $1.27 billion, and sold $168.1 million in securities during the year. At December 31, 2020, $376.1 million in securities were pledged to secure public deposits, or for other purposes required or permitted by law, $368.2 million in securities were pledged in the State of California time deposit program, $1.9 million was pledged at the United States Department of Justice, and $1.4 million were pledged for other public deposits.
Our investment portfolio consists of government sponsored enterprise (“GSE”) bonds, mortgage backed securities (“MBS”), collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”), corporate securities, and municipal securities.
Our available for sale securities portfolio is primarily invested in residential CMOs and residential and commercial MBS, which combined to represent 96% of our total available for sale portfolio as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, all of our CMOs and MBS were issued by the Government National Mortgage Association (“GNMA”), Fannie Mae (“FNMA”), or Freddie Mac (“FHLMC”), which guarantee the contractual cash flows of these investments. All of our corporate and municipal securities at December 31, 2020 were rated as investment grade.
The following table presents the amortized cost, estimated fair value, and net unrealized gain and losses on our investment securities as of the dates indicated:
The following table summarizes the maturity of securities based on carrying value and their related weighted average yield (non-tax equivalent) at December 31, 2020:
* Investments in U.S. Government agency and U.S. Government sponsored enterprises
The following table shows our investments with gross unrealized losses and their estimated fair values, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, at December 31, 2020:
* Investments in U.S. Government agency and U.S. Government sponsored enterprises
We adopted ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020 and implemented the CECL methodology for our investment securities available for sale. At the time of adoption, we did not record a day 1 CECL adjustment on our investment securities available for sale as we determined that a credit impairment did not exist. Subsequently, we performed an analysis on our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2020 and concluded that an allowance for credit losses was not required. The majority of our investment portfolio consists of securities issued by U.S. Government agencies or U.S. Government sponsored enterprises which we determined have zero loss expectation. At December 31, 2020, we also had corporate security not issued by U.S. Government agencies or U.S. Government sponsored enterprises that was in an unrealized loss position. Based on our analysis of this investment, we concluded a credit loss did not exist due to the issuer’s financial strength, high bond ratings, and because we still expect full payment of principal and interest.
Equity Investments
As of December 31, 2020, equity investments totaled $59.7 million compared to $49.1 million at December 31, 2019. In 2020, we purchased $10.0 million in equity investments which were comprised of $5.0 in of mutual funds and $5.0 million in CRA investments. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded an increase in equity investments due to change fair value of $488 thousand. Equity investments as of December 31, 2020 included $27.6 million in equity investments with readily determinable fair values and $32.1 million in equity investments without readily determinable fair values.
Equity investments with readily determinable fair values at December 31, 2020 consisted of mutual funds totaling $27.6 million. Changes to the fair value of equity investments with readily determinable fair values is recorded in other noninterest income. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values at December 31, 2020 included $30.7 million in Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) investments, $1.0 million in Community Development Financial Institutions investments, and $370 thousand in correspondent bank stock. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are carried at cost, less impairment, and adjustments are made to the carrying balance based on observable price changes. There were no impairments or observable price changes for these investments during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Loan Portfolio
We offer a variety of products designed to meet the credit needs of our borrowers. Our lending activities primarily consist of real estate loans, commercial business loans, residential mortgage, and consumer loans. Gross loans receivable rose by $1.29 billion to $13.56 billion at December 31, 2020 from $12.28 billion at December 31, 2019.
We experienced an increase in real estate residential, real estate commercial and commercial business loans in 2020 compared to the previous year. All other loan types experienced declines in 2020. The rates of interest charged on variable rate loans are set at specified spreads based on the prime lending rate and LIBOR rates and vary as the prime lending rate and LIBOR rates varies. Approximately 42% of our total loans were variable rate loans at December 31, 2020 compared to 39% at December 31, 2019. Commercial real estate loans as a percentage to total loans was 65% at December 31, 2020 compared to 71% at December 31, 2019.
With certain exceptions, we are permitted under applicable law to make unsecured loans to single borrowers (including certain related persons and entities) in aggregate amounts of up to 15% of the sum of our total capital and our allowance for credit losses (as defined for regulatory purposes) at the Bank level and certain capital notes and debentures issued by us, if any. As of December 31, 2020, our lending limit was approximately $381.3 million per borrower for unsecured loans. For lending limit purposes, a secured loan is defined as a loan secured by collateral having a current fair value of at least 100% of the amount of the loan or extension of credit at all times and satisfying certain other requirements. In addition to unsecured loans, we are permitted to make such collateral-secured loans in an additional amount up to 10% (for a total of 25%) of our total capital and the allowance for credit losses for a total limit of approximately $635.5 million to one borrower as of December 31, 2020. The largest aggregate amount of loans that the Bank had outstanding to any one borrower and related entities was $198.6 million, of which the entire amount was performing and in good standing at December 31, 2020.
The following table shows the composition of our loan portfolio by type of loan on the dates indicated:
Real Estate Loans
Our real estate loans consist primarily of loans secured by deeds of trust on commercial real estate, including SBA loans secured by commercial real estate. It is our general policy to restrict commercial real estate loan amounts to 75% of the appraised value of the property at the time of loan funding. We offer both fixed and floating interest rate loans. The maturities on such loans are generally up to seven years (with payments determined on the basis of principal amortization schedules of up to 25 years and a balloon payment due at maturity). Real estate loans secured by non-consumer residential real estate comprise less than 1% of the total loan portfolio (consumer residential mortgage loans are classified separately and included in consumer loans). Construction loans are also a small portion of the total real estate portfolio, comprising approximately 2% of total loans outstanding. Total real estate loans, consisting primarily of commercial real estate loans, decreased $107.6 million or, 1%, to $8.77 billion at December 31, 2020 from $8.66 billion at December 31, 2019. Real estate loans declined slightly in 2020 from 2019 due to a decline in originations and an increase in real estate loan payoffs during the year.
Other Loans
Commercial business loans include term loans to businesses, lines of credit, trade finance facilities, commercial SBA loans, equipment leasing loans, warehouse lines of credit and SBA Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loans. Business term loans are generally provided to finance business acquisitions, working capital, and/or equipment purchases. Lines of credit are generally provided to finance short-term working capital needs. Trade finance facilities are generally provided to finance import and export activities. SBA loans are provided to small businesses under the U.S. SBA guarantee program. Short-term credit facilities (payable within one year) typically provide for periodic interest payments, with principal payable at maturity. Term loans (usually 5 to 7 years) normally provide for monthly payments of both principal and interest. SBA commercial loans usually have a longer maturity (7 to 10 years). These credits are reviewed on a periodic basis, and most loans are secured by business assets and/or real estate. Warehouse lines of credit are utilized by mortgage originators to fund mortgages which are then pledged to the Bank as collateral until the mortgage loans are sold and the lines of credit are paid down. The typical duration of these lines of credit from the time of funding to pay-down ranges from 10-30 days. Although collateralized by mortgage loans, the structure of warehouse lending agreements results in the commercial business classification for warehouse lines of credit. During 2020, commercial business loans increased $1.44 billion, or 53%, to $4.16 billion at December 31, 2020 from $2.72 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase in commercial business loans was due to an increase in commercial term loans, warehouse lines of credit, and PPP loans funded in 2020.
Residential mortgage loan represented approximately 4% of total loan portfolio. Residential mortgage portfolio declined from $835.2 million in 2019, or 30% to $582.2 million in 2020. Consumer loans comprise approximately less than 1% of the total loan portfolio. Most of our consumer loan portfolio include automobile loans, home equity lines and loans, signature term loans and lines of credit, and credit card loans. Consumer loans decreased $4.0 million, or 7%, to $51.1 million at December 31, 2020 from $55.1 million at December 31, 2019. The decreases in residential mortgage and consumer loans were due primarily to the decrease in loan originations in 2020 as well as an increase in residential mortgage loans sold during the year.
Loan Commitments
We provide lines of credit to business customers usually on an annual renewal basis. We normally do not make loan commitments in material amounts for periods in excess of one year.
The following table shows our loan commitments and letters of credit outstanding at the dates indicated:
Nonperforming Assets
Nonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans, accruing loans that are 90 days or more past due, accruing restructured loans, and OREO.
Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days or more past due, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. Loans may be placed on nonaccrual status earlier if the full and timely collection of principal or interest becomes uncertain. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid accrued interest is charged against interest income. Loans are charged off when collection of the loan is determined to be unlikely. Loans are restructured when, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower’s financial difficulties, the Bank grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. OREO consists of real estate acquired by the Bank through foreclosure or similar means, including by deed from the owner in lieu of foreclosure, and is held for future sale.
Nonperforming assets were $143.3 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $122.1 million at December 31, 2019. Nonperforming assets at December 31, 2020 increased from December 31, 2019 due to the increases in nonaccrual loans and accruing restructured loans, partially offset by decreases in loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing and OREO. The following table illustrates the composition of nonperforming assets and nonperforming loans as of the dates indicated:
_________________________
(1) Nonaccrual loans exclude the guaranteed portion of delinquent SBA loans that are in liquidation and excludes PCI loans for periods prior to 2020
(2) Excludes PCI loans at reporting years 2016 to 2019
COVID-19 Related Loan Modifications
In 2020, we received a large number of modification requests from borrowers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Subsequently many of those requests for modifications were granted during the second quarter of 2020. Many of these modifications had deferral periods that expired during the third quarter of 2020 and some of these loans were granted a second modification. As of June 30, 2020, loans that were modified due to hardship caused by the COVID-19 pandemic totaled $3.12 billion, which represented approximately 24.2% of our total loan portfolio. As of September 30, 2020, COVID-19 related modifications totaled $1.15 billion or approximately 8.8% of our total loan portfolio and COVID-19 related modifications at December 31, 2020 totaled $1.38 billion or approximately 10.2% of our total loan portfolio. The number of modification we are providing has declined significantly as of December 31, 2020 compared to modification at June 30, 2020.
COVID-19 modifications at January 31, 2021 declined to $1.26 billion or 9.3% of the loan portfolio. Based on the expiration schedule of modifications as of December 31, 2020, we expect total modifications to decline to 2-3% of total loans by June 30, 2021, assuming we do not provide any new modifications.
Loans that have been modified under the CARES Act were not categorized as past due, TDR, or nonaccrual as of December 31, 2020 unless the loans were categorized as past due, TDR, or nonaccrual prior to the modification. All COVID-19 modifications are being monitored by management for potential downgrades to classified and nonaccrual status as the CARES Act provides temporary relief of certain modifications from TDR classification, but not from classified or nonaccrual status.
To assist our customers during this difficult time, we provided various types of modifications to fit the needs of each borrower. Of the COVID-19 related modifications as of December 31, 2020, $414.8 million or 30% consisted of full payment deferrals, $430.3 million or 31% consisted of a hybrid of full payment deferral for a period followed by interest only payments, $407.6 million or 30% consisted of interest only payments, and the remaining modifications consisted of maturity extensions. The length of time for the modified loans ranged from 2 to 18 months, but most of the modifications had terms of either 6 or 9 months (modification terms are not stated on a cumulative basis).
The following table presents total COVID-19 related modifications by loan type as of December 31, 2020:
At December 31, 2020 approximately 73% of all of the COVID-19 related modifications were loans secured by hotel/motel and retail properties (includes some construction loans secured by hotel/motel and retail properties) as these industries were hard hit by the pandemic. Our hotel/motel loan portfolio consists mostly of limited services facilities, which were less impacted by the pandemic compared to destination hotel properties. Although occupancy trends have stabilized for many of our hotel/motel operators, approximately half of the hotel/motel borrowers that had a modification at June 30, 2020 required a second round of modifications. The majority of our hotel/motel loans are secured with personal guarantees.
Modified loans secured by retail properties consist mostly of strip mall type properties anchored by grocery markets with tenants of these properties made up of largely service oriented businesses. Commercial real estate loans secured by retail properties represented approximately 21% of all COVID-19 modifications as of December 31, 2020. Many of these businesses are now operating again, although at a limited level due to a social distancing requirement as a result of the pandemic. As a result, only 36% of retail commercial real estate loans modified as of June 30, 2020 were modified at December 31, 2020.
In accordance with the CARES Act and interagency guidance, qualifying modifications provide banks the option to temporarily suspend certain requirements under U.S. GAAP related to TDRs for a limited period of time to account for the effects of COVID-19. This timeframe was extended in December 2020 to the earlier of January 1, 2022 or 60 days after the end of the coronavirus emergency declaration. As of December 31, 2020, loans modified under Section 4013 of the CARES Act and interagency guidance were not included as TDRs.
Maturity of Loans
The following table illustrates the maturity distribution intervals of loans outstanding as of December 31, 2020.
_________________________
(1) Includes hybrid loans (loans with fixed interest rates for a specified period and then convert to variable interest rates) in fixed interest rate periods as of December 31, 2020.
Concentrations
Our lending activities are predominately in California, New Jersey and the New York City, Houston, Dallas, Chicago, and Seattle metropolitan areas. At December 31, 2020, loans from California represented 60% of the total loans outstanding and loans from New York and New Jersey represented 16%. The remaining 24% of total loans outstanding represented loans from other states. Although we have a diversified loan portfolio, a substantial portion of the loan portfolio and credit performance depends on the economic stability of Southern California. Within the California market, most of our business activity is with customers located within Southern California (54%). Therefore, our exposure to credit risk is significantly affected by changes in the economy in the Southern California area. Within our commercial real estate loan portfolio, the largest industry concentrations are retail building (19%), hotel/motel (19%), industrial & warehouse (10%), and gas station & car wash (12%). Within our commercial and business loan portfolio, the largest industry concentrations are finance and insurance (34%), wholesalers (14%), retail trade (12%), manufacturing (11%), and services (10%).
Allowance for Credit Losses
The Bank has implemented a multi-faceted process to identify, manage, and mitigate the credit risks that are inherent in the loan portfolio. For new loans, each loan application package is fully analyzed by experienced reviewers and approvers. In accordance with current lending approval authority guidelines, a majority of loans are approved by the Management Loan Committee (“MLC”) and Directors Loan Committee (“DLC”). For existing loans, the Bank maintains a systematic loan review program, which includes internally conducted reviews and periodic reviews by external loan review consultants. Based on these reviews, loans are graded as to their overall credit quality, which is measured based on: payment capacity and collateral documentation; proper lien perfection; proper approval by loan committee(s); adherence to any loan agreement covenants; compliance with internal policies and procedures, and with laws and regulations; adequacy and strength of repayment sources including borrower or collateral generated cash flow; payment performance; and liquidation value of the collateral. We closely monitor loans that management has determined require further supervision because of the loan size, loan structure, and/or specific circumstances of the borrower.
When principal or interest on a loan is 90 days or more past due, a loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status unless it is considered to be both well-secured and in the process of collection. Further, a loan is considered a loss in whole or in part when (1) it appears that loss exposure on the loan exceeds the collateral value for the loan, (2) servicing of the unsecured portion has been discontinued, or (3) collection is not anticipated due to the borrower’s financial condition and general economic conditions in the borrower’s industry. Any loan or portion of a loan judged by management to be uncollectible is charged against the allowance for credit losses, while any recoveries are credited to the allowance.
Allowance for Credit Loss
On January 1, 2020 the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, “Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments”, or CECL, which significantly changed the credit losses estimation model for loan and investments. On March 27, 2020, President Donald Trump signed into law the CARES Act in response to the global pandemic. The CARES Act includes a provision that temporarily delays the required implementation date of ASU 2016-13. However, we chose not to elect to delay the adoption of ASU 2016-13 and implemented the CECL methodology as of January 1, 2020. On January 1, 2020, we recorded a $26.2 million day 1 CECL adjustment as a result of adopting the new standard.
The allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) was $206.7 million at December 31, 2020 compared to allowance for credit losses of $94.1 million at December 31, 2019. We recorded provisions for credit losses of $95.0 million in 2020 compared to $7.3 million in 2019, and $14.9 million in 2018. During 2020, we charged off $16.0 million in loans outstanding and recovered $7.4 million in loans previously charged off. Charge offs for the 2020 included the charge offs of $4.7 million in specific reserves held against purchased credit-impaired loans that were reclassified under the new CECL methodology. Total criticized loans, or loan rated special mention, substandard, doubtful, or loss at December 31, 2020 totaled $551.5 million compared to $400.7 million at December 31, 2019. The ACL was 1.52% of loans receivable at December 31, 2020 and 0.77% of loans receivable at December 31, 2019. The ACL to loans receivable ratio does not include non-credit related discount on acquired loans. Total discount on acquired loans at December 31, 2020 and 2019 totaled $23.3 million and $45.9 million, respectively. ACL on individually evaluated loans increased to $7.3 million at December 31, 2020 from $3.4 million at December 31, 2019. In addition to allowance for credit losses, we had $1.3 million in allowances for unfunded loan commitments as of December 31, 2020, compared to $636 thousand as of December 31, 2019.
The following table presents total nonaccrual and delinquent loans (loans past due 30+ days) as of the dates indicated:
We categorize loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt including but not limited to current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends. We analyze loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This analysis includes all non-homogeneous loans. Homogeneous loans are not risk rated and credit risk is analyzed largely by the number of days past due.
This analysis is performed on at least a quarterly basis. We use the following definitions for risk ratings:
•Pass: Loans that meet a preponderance or more of our underwriting criteria and evidence an acceptable level of risk.
•Special Mention: Loans that have potential weaknesses that deserve management’s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution’s credit position at some future date.
•Substandard: Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the repayment of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.
•Doubtful/Loss: Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or repayment in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.
Loans assigned a risk rating of Special Mention, Substandard, Doubtful, or Loss are referred to as Criticized Loans and loans assigned a risk rating of Substandard, Doubtful, or Loss are separately referred to as Classified Loans. The following table provides the detail of Criticized Loans by risk rating as of the dates indicated:
The following table shows the provision for credit losses, the amount of loans charged off, and recoveries on loans previously charged off together with the balance in the allowance for credit losses at the beginning and end of each year, the amount of average and total loans outstanding as well as other pertinent ratios as of the dates and for the years indicated:
The following table reflects our allocation of the allowance for credit losses by loan category and the ratio of each loan category to total loans as of the dates indicated:
The adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is determined upon an evaluation and review of the credit quality of the loan portfolio, taking into consideration economic forecasts, historical loan loss experience, relevant internal and external factors that affect the collection of a loan, and other pertinent factors. We use a combination of a modeled and non-modeled approach that incorporates current and future economic conditions to estimate lifetime expected losses on a collective basis. We incorporate in our modeled approach, Probability of Default (“PD”), Loss Given Default (“LGD”), and Exposure at Default (“EAD”) methodologies. For non-modeled loans, the allowance for credit losses is largely based on historical loss experience. Both approaches are combined with other quantitative factors and qualitative considerations in calculation of the allowance for credit losses for collectively assessed loans with similar risk characteristics.
For loans which do not share similar risk characteristics such as nonaccrual and TDR loans above $500 thousand, we evaluate these loans on an individual basis in accordance with ASC 326. These nonaccrual and TDR loans are considered to have different risk profiles than performing loans and therefore are evaluated separately. We ultimately decided to collectively assess TDRs and nonaccrual loans with balances below $500 thousand along with the performing and accrual loans in order to reduce the operational burden of individually assessing small TDR and nonaccrual loans with immaterial balances. For individually assessed loans, the ACL is measured using either 1) the present value of future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate; 2) the loan’s observable market price; or 3) the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent. For the collateral dependent loans, we obtain new appraisals to determine the fair value of collateral. The appraisals are based on an “as-is” valuation. To ensure that appraised values remain current, we either obtains updated appraisals every twelve months from a qualified independent appraiser or an internal evaluation of the collateral is performed by qualified personnel. If the third party market data indicates that the value of the collateral property has declined since the most recent valuation date, management adjusts the value of the property downward to reflect current market conditions. If the fair value of the collateral is less than the amortized balance of the loan, we recognizes an ACL with a corresponding charge to the provision for credit losses.
Individually evaluated loans at December 31, 2020 were $123.2 million, a net increase of $32.6 million from $90.7 million at December 31, 2019. The net increase in individually evaluated loans was due primarily to increase in nonaccrual loans in 2020.
We also maintain a separate ACL for our off-balance sheet unfunded loan commitments. We utilize a funding rate to allocate the allowance to undrawn exposures. This funding rate is used as a credit conversion factor to capture how much undrawn can potentially become drawn at any point. The funding rate is determined based on a lookback period of 8 quarters. Credit loss is not estimated for off-balance sheet credit exposures that are unconditionally cancellable by us at the time of measurement.
OREO
OREO consists of real estate properties acquired through foreclosure or similar means. OREO is recorded at fair value, less estimated selling costs. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, OREO totaled $20.1 million and $24.1 million, respectively. The number of OREO properties held at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 14 and 18, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, three properties were transferred to OREO totaling of $2.9 million and we sold seven OREO properties totaling $2.6 million. For the year ended December 31, 2019, nine properties were transferred to OREO totaling $19.4 million and we sold nine OREO properties totaling $3.2 million.
The changes in OREO for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:
Deposits
Deposits are our primary source of funds for loans and investments. We offer a wide variety of deposit account products to commercial and consumer customers. Total deposits increased to $14.33 billion at December 31, 2020 from $12.53 billion at December 31, 2019.
The increase in deposits during 2020 was primarily due to an increase in money market deposits, demand deposits, and savings deposits partially offset by a decline in time deposits. At December 31, 2020, we had $1.14 billion in brokered deposits and $300.0 million in California State Treasurer deposits compared to $1.48 billion in brokered deposits and $300.0 million in California State Treasurer deposits at December 31, 2019. The brokered deposits represented approximately 7.92% of our total deposits as of December 31, 2020 compared to 11.80% as of December 31, 2019. The California State Treasurer deposits have three to six months maturities with a weighted average interest rate of 0.15% and 1.65% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Although our deposits may vary with local and national economic conditions, we do not believe that our deposits are seasonal in nature. The following table sets forth the balances of our deposits by category for the periods indicated:
The following table presents the maturity schedules of our time deposits, as of dates indicated:
The following table indicates the maturity schedules of our time deposits in amounts of more than $250,000 as of December 31, 2020:
There is no assurance that we will be able to continue to replace maturing time deposits at competitive rates. However, if we are unable to replace these maturing time deposits with new deposits, we believe that we have adequate liquidity resources to fund these obligations through secured credit lines with the FHLB and FRB, as well as with liquid assets.
FHLB Advances and Federal Funds Purchased
We utilize a combination of short-term and long-term borrowings from the FHLB and other sources to help manage our liquidity position. However, borrowings are used as a secondary source of funds and deposits are our main source of funding and liquidity.
Federal Funds Purchased
Federal funds purchased generally mature within one to three business days from the transaction date. We did not have any federal funds purchased at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
FHLB Advances
We may borrow from the FHLB on a short term or long term basis to provide funding for certain loans or investment securities strategies, as well as for asset liability management strategies. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, FHLB advances totaled $250.0 million and $625.0 million, respectively with average remaining maturities of 0.8 years and 1.2 years, respectively. The weighted average rate for FHLB advances was 1.07% at December 31, 2020 compared to 1.84% at December 31, 2019. In third quarter of 2020, we utilized a portion of our excess liquidity to payoff $300.0 million in FHLB advances. These advances were paid off before maturity and resulted in a prepayment fee of $3.6 million. As of December 31, 2020, our remaining available FHLB borrowing capacity was $3.92 billion
Convertible Notes
During the second quarter of 2018, we issued $217.5 million aggregate principal amount of 2.00% convertible senior notes maturing on May 15, 2038 in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933. The convertible notes were issued as part of our plan to repurchase common stock. The convertible notes pay interest on a semi-annual basis to holders of the notes. The convertible notes can be called by us, in whole or in part, at any time after five years for the original issued amount in cash. Holders of the notes can put the notes for cash on the fifth, tenth, and fifteenth year of the notes. The net carrying balance of convertible notes at December 31, 2020 was $204.6 million, net of a $12.9 million in discounts, which represents the conversion option discount and capitalized issuance costs. At December 31, 2019, the net carrying balance of convertible notes was $199.5 million, net of $18.0 million in discounts and issuance costs. (See footnote 10 “Subordinated Debentures and Convertible Notes” for additional information regarding convertible notes issued)
Subordinated Debentures
At December 31, 2020, our nine wholly-owned subsidiary grantor trusts (“Trusts”) had issued $126.0 million of pooled trust preferred securities (“Trust Preferred Securities”). The Trust Preferred Securities accrue and pay distributions periodically at specified annual rates as provided in the related indentures for the securities. The Trusts used the net proceeds from the offering of the Trust Preferred Securities to purchase a like amount of Hope Bancorp’s subordinated debentures (the “Debentures”). The Debentures are the sole assets of the trusts. Our obligations under the Debentures and related documents, taken together, constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by us of the obligations of the trusts. The Trust Preferred Securities are mandatorily redeemable upon the maturity of the Debentures, or upon earlier redemption as provided in the indentures. We have the right to redeem the Debentures in whole (but not in part) on or after specific dates, at a redemption price specified in the indentures plus any accrued but unpaid interest to the redemption date. Debentures totaled $104.2 million at December 31, 2020 and $103.0 million at December 31, 2019.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Trusts are not reported on a consolidated basis pursuant to ASC 810, Consolidation. Therefore, the capital securities of $126.0 million are not presented on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Instead, the long-term subordinated debentures of $104.2 million, net of $25.7 million in discounts, as of December 31, 2020, issued by us to the Trusts and the investment in Trusts’ common stock of $3.9 million (included in other assets) are separately reported.
The following table summarizes our outstanding Debentures related to the Trust Preferred Securities at December 31, 2020:
Capital Resources
Historically, our primary source of capital has been the retention of earnings, net of dividend payments to stockholders and share repurchases. We seek to maintain capital at a level sufficient to assure our stockholders, customers, and regulators that Hope Bancorp and the Bank are financially sound. For this purpose, we perform ongoing assessments of capital related risks, components of capital, as well as projected sources and uses of capital in conjunction with projected increases in assets and levels of risk.
Our total stockholders’ equity increased $17.7 million, or 0.87%, to $2.05 billion at December 31, 2020 from $2.04 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase in our stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 was largely due to net income earned in 2020 totaling $111.5 million and $23.6 million from the increase in other comprehensive income, and $6.9 million due to stock compensation adjustments. These increases were offset by $36.2 million in share repurchases, $69.2 million in cash dividends paid, and a decrease of $18.9 million due to the Day 1 impact from the adoption of CECL, net of taxes. We elected to defer the $18.9 million Day 1 CECL impact to regulatory capital for two years in accordance with the revised regulatory CECL transition guidance.
At December 31, 2020, our ratio of common equity to total assets was 12.01% compared to 13.00% at December 31, 2019, and our tangible common equity represented 9.50% of tangible assets at December 31, 2020, compared with 10.27% of tangible assets at December 31, 2019. Tangible common equity per share was $12.81 at December 31, 2020, compared with $12.40 at December 31, 2019. Tangible common equity to tangible assets and tangible common equity per share are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provides investors with information that is useful in understanding our financial performance and position.
We provide certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide investors with meaningful supplemental information that is useful in understanding our financial performance and position. The methodologies for determining non-GAAP measures may differ among companies. The following tables reconciles non-GAAP financial measures used to the most comparable GAAP performance measures:
The following tables compare Hope Bancorp’s and the Bank’s capital ratios at December 31, 2020 to those required by our regulatory agencies to generally be deemed “adequately capitalized” for capital adequacy classification purposes:
New capital rules require a capital conservation buffer of 2.50% above the three minimum risked-weighted capital ratios. Our capital ratios at December 31, 2020 and 2019 exceeded all of the regulatory minimums including the fully-phased in capital conservation buffer.
Liquidity Management
Liquidity risk is the risk of reduction in our earnings or capital that could result if we were not able to meet our obligations when they come due without incurring unacceptable losses. Liquidity risk includes the risk of unplanned decreases or changes in funding sources and changes in market conditions that affect our ability to liquidate assets quickly and with minimum loss of value. Factors considered in liquidity risk management are the stability of the deposit base; the marketability, maturity, and pledging of our investments; the availability of alternative sources of funds; and our demand for credit.
The objective of our liquidity management is to have funds available to meet cash flow requirements arising from fluctuations in deposit levels and the demands of daily operations, which include funding of securities purchases, providing for customers’ credit needs, and ongoing repayment of borrowings.
We manage our liquidity actively on a daily basis and it is reviewed periodically by our management-level Asset/Liability Management Committee (“ALM”) and the Board Asset Liability Committee (“ALCO”). This process is intended to ensure the maintenance of sufficient funds to meet our liquidity needs, including adequate cash flow for off-balance-sheet commitments. In general, our liquidity is managed daily by controlling the level of federal funds and the funds provided by cash flow from operations. To meet unexpected demands, lines of credit are maintained with the FHLB, the Federal Reserve Bank, and other correspondent banks. The sale of investment securities and loans held for sale also serves as a source of funds.
Our primary sources of liquidity are derived from financing activities, which include customer and broker deposits, federal funds facilities, and borrowings from the FHLB and the FRB Discount Window. These funding sources are augmented by payments of principal and interest on loans, proceeds from sale of loans, pay down of investment securities, and the liquidation or sale of securities from our available for sale portfolio. Primary uses of funds include withdrawal of and interest payments on deposits, originations of loans, purchases of investment securities, payment of operating expenses, share repurchases, and payment of dividends.
Net cash inflows from operating activities totaled $165.9 million, $183.9 million, and $220.0 million during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Net cash inflows from operating activities for 2020 were primarily attributable to proceeds from sales of loans held for sale and net income partially offset by originations of held for sale loans.
Net cash outflows from investing activities totaled $1.83 billion, $36.8 million, and $1.15 billion during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Net cash outflows from investing activities during 2020 were primarily from purchases of securities available for sale, net increase in loans receivable, and purchase of loans receivable. These outflows were offset by proceeds received for securities available for sale that were paid down during the year, proceeds from sales of available for sale securities, and proceeds from sales of other loans.
Net cash inflows from financing activities totaled $1.32 billion, $91.9 million, and $895.1 million during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Net cash inflows from financing activities for 2020 was primarily attributable to an increase in deposits and proceeds from FHLB borrowings offset by the repayment of FHLB advances, treasury stock repurchases, and dividends paid on common stock.
When we have more funds than required for our reserve requirements or short-term liquidity needs, we sell federal funds to other financial institutions. Conversely, when we have less funds than required, we may purchase federal funds, borrow funds from the FHLB or the FRB’s Discount Window. As of December 31, 2020, the maximum amount that we were able to borrow on an overnight basis from the FHLB and the FRB was an aggregate of $4.88 billion, and we had $250.0 million in borrowings from the FHLB and no borrowings outstanding from the FRB. The FHLB System functions as a line of credit facility for qualifying financial institutions. As a member, we are required to own capital stock in the FHLB and may apply for advances from the FHLB by pledging qualifying loans and certain securities as collateral for these advances.
At times we maintain a portion of our liquid assets in interest bearing cash deposits with other banks, overnight federal funds sold to other banks, and in investment securities available for sale that are not pledged. Our liquid assets consist of cash and cash equivalents, interest bearing cash deposits with other banks, liquid investment securities available for sale, and loan repayments within 30 days. Liquid assets totaled $2.23 billion and $1.95 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $350.6 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $698.6 million at December 31, 2019.
Because our primary sources and uses of funds are deposits and loans, the relationship between gross loans and total deposits provides one measure of our liquidity. Typically, the closer the ratio of loans to deposits is to, or the more it exceeds 100%, the more we rely on borrowings and other sources to provide liquidity. Alternative sources of funds such as FHLB advances, brokered deposits, and other collateralized borrowings that provide liquidity as needed from diverse liability sources are an important part of our asset/liability management strategy. For 2020, our average gross loans to average deposits ratio was 93% and 99% for both 2019 and 2018.
We believe our liquidity sources to be stable and adequate to meet our day-to-day cash flow requirements. At December 31, 2020, management was not aware of any demands, commitments, trends, events, or uncertainties that will or are reasonably likely to have a material or adverse effect on our liquidity position. As of December 31, 2020, we are not aware of any material commitments for capital expenditures in the foreseeable future.
Off-Balance- Sheet Activities and Contractual Obligations
The Bank routinely engages in activities that involve, to varying degrees, elements of risk that are not reflected, in whole or in part, in the Consolidated Financial Statements. These activities are part of our normal course of business and include traditional off-balance-sheet credit-related financial instruments, interest rate swap contracts, operating leases, and interest commitments on our liabilities.
Traditional off-balance-sheet credit-related financial instruments are primarily commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. These activities may require us to make cash payments to third parties in the event specified future events occur. The contractual amounts represent the extent of our exposure in these off-balance-sheet activities. However, since certain off-balance-sheet commitments, particularly standby letters of credit, are expected to expire or be only partially used, the total amount of commitments does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. These activities are necessary to meet the financing needs of our customers.
We do not anticipate that our current off-balance-sheet activities will have a material impact on our future results of operations or financial condition. Further information regarding risks from our off-balance-sheet financial instruments can be found in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in
