Overview
Our business strategy is to acquire and develop behavioral healthcare facilities and improve our operating results within our facilities and our other behavioral healthcare operations. We strive to improve the operating results of our facilities by providing high-quality services, expanding referral networks and marketing initiatives while meeting the increased demand for behavioral healthcare services through expansion of our current locations as well as developing new services within existing locations. At December 31, 2020, we operated 572 behavioral healthcare facilities with approximately 18,100 beds in 40 states, the U.K. and Puerto Rico. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we added 460 beds in the U.S., consisting of 240 added to existing facilities and 220 added through the opening of two joint venture facilities, and we opened six CTCs. On January 19, 2021, we completed the sale of the U.K. business, which included 345 facilities and approximately 8,200 beds. For the year ending December 31, 2021, we expect to add approximately 300 beds to existing facilities, 170 beds through the opening of one wholly-owned facility and one joint venture facility and expect to open 11 CTCs.
We are the leading publicly traded pure-play provider of behavioral healthcare services in the U.S. Management believes that we are positioned as a leading platform in a highly fragmented industry under the direction of an experienced management team that
has significant industry expertise. Management expects to take advantage of several strategies that are more accessible as a result of our increased size and geographic scale, including continuing a national marketing strategy to attract new patients and referral sources, increasing our volume of out-of-state referrals, providing a broader range of services to new and existing patients and clients and selectively pursuing opportunities to expand our facility and bed count in the U.S. through acquisitions, de novo facilities, joint ventures and bed additions in existing facilities.
On January 19, 2021, we completed the U.K. Sale pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement in which we sold all of the securities of AHC-WW Jersey Limited, a private limited liability company incorporated in Jersey and a subsidiary of the Company, which constitutes the entirety of our U.K. business operations. The U.K. Sale resulted in approximately $1,525 million of gross proceeds before deducting the settlement of existing foreign currency hedging liabilities of $85 million based on the current GBP to USD exchange rate, cash retained by the buyer of approximately $75 million and transaction costs of $16 million. We used the net proceeds of approximately $1,425 million (or $1,350 million, net of cash retained by the buyer) to repay in full the outstanding balances of our TLA Facility of $312 million and our Tranche B-4 Facility $768 million of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and added $345 million of cash on the balance sheet. In addition to reducing our indebtedness, the U.K. Sale allows us to focus on our U.S. operations. As a result of the U.K. Sale, we reported, for all periods presented, results of operations and cash flows of the U.K. operations as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements.
Acquisitions
On April 1, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Bradford Recovery Center, a specialty treatment facility with 46 beds located in Millerton, Pennsylvania, for cash consideration of approximately $4.5 million.
On February 15, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Whittier Pavilion, an inpatient psychiatric facility with 71 beds located in Haverhill, Massachusetts, for cash consideration of approximately $17.9 million. Also on February 15, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Mission Treatment for cash consideration of approximately $22.5 million. Mission Treatment operates nine comprehensive treatment centers in California, Nevada, Arizona and Oklahoma.
Results of Operations
The following table illustrates our consolidated results of operations for the respective periods shown (dollars in thousands):
At December 31, 2020, we operated 227 behavioral healthcare facilities with approximately 9,900 beds in 40 states and Puerto Rico and 345 behavioral healthcare facilities with approximately 8,200 beds in the U.K. We reported, for all periods presented, results of operations and cash flows of the U.K. operations as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements.
The following table sets forth percent changes in same facility operating data for our U.S. Facilities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 compared to the previous years:
(a)
Results for the periods presented include facilities we have operated more than one year and exclude certain closed services.
(b)
Average length of stay is defined as patient days divided by admissions.
(c)
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income before provision for income taxes, equity-based compensation expense, debt extinguishment costs, legal settlements expense, loss on impairment, transaction-related expenses, interest expense and depreciation and amortization. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as an analytical indicator to measure the performance and to develop strategic objectives and operating plans. Adjusted EBITDA is commonly used as an analytical indicator within the health care industry, and also serves as a measure of leverage capacity and debt service ability. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of financial performance under GAAP, and the items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP and is thus susceptible to varying calculations, Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019

The Eleventh Amendment, among other things, amended the definition of “Consolidated EBITDA” to remove the cap on non-cash charges, losses and expenses related to the impairment of goodwill, which in turn provided increased flexibility to us in terms of our financial covenants.
On February 27, 2019, we entered into the Twelfth Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Twelfth Amendment, among other things, modified certain definitions, including “Consolidated EBITDA”, and increased our permitted Maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio, thereby providing increased flexibility to us in terms of our financial covenants.
On April 21, 2020, we entered into the Thirteenth Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Thirteenth Amendment amended the Consolidated Leverage Ratio in the existing covenant to increase the leverage ratio for the rest of 2020.
On November 13, 2020, we entered into the Fourth Repricing Facilities Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Fourth Repricing Facilities Amendment extended the maturity date of each of the existing revolving line of credit and the existing TLA Facility from November 30, 2021 to November 30, 2022. The Fourth Repricing Facilities Amendment also (1) replaced the revolving line of credit in an aggregate committed amount of $500.0 million to an aggregate committed amount of approximately $459.0 million and (2) replaced the TLA Facility aggregate outstanding principal amount of approximately $352.4 million to an aggregate principal amount of approximately $318.9 million. The interest rate margin applicable to both facilities remains unchanged from the prior facilities, and the commitment fee applicable to the new revolving line of credit also remains unchanged from the prior revolving line of credit. In connection with the Fourth Repricing Facilities Amendment, we recorded a debt extinguishment charge of $1.0 million, including the write-off of discount and deferred financing costs, which was recorded in debt extinguishment costs in the consolidated statements of operations.
On January 5, 2021, we made a voluntary payment of $105.0 million on our Tranche B-4 Facility. On January 19, 2021, we used a portion of the net proceeds from the U.K. Sale to repay $311.7 million of our TLA Facility and $767.9 million of our Tranche B-4 Facility of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Such repayments served to repay in full the outstanding balances of the TLA Facility and the Tranche B-4 Facility, at which point we had no variable-rate debt.
We had $441.6 million of availability under the revolving line of credit and had standby letters of credit outstanding of $17.4 million related to security for the payment of claims required by our workers’ compensation insurance program at December 31, 2020. Borrowings under the revolving line of credit are subject to customary conditions precedent to borrowing. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement requires quarterly term loan principal repayments of our TLA Facility of $9.5 million for March 31, 2021 to September 30, 2022, with the remaining principal balance of the TLA Facility due on the maturity date of November 30, 2022. We are required to repay the Tranche B-4 Facility in equal quarterly installments of approximately $2.3 million on the last business day of each March, June, September and December, with the outstanding principal balance of the Tranche B-4 Facility due on February 16, 2023. On April 17, 2018, we made an additional payment of $15.0 million, including $5.1 million on the Tranche B-3 Facility and $9.9 million on the Tranche B-4 Facility. On November 15, 2019, we made an additional payment of $20.0 million, including $7.0 million on the Tranche B-3 Facility and $13.0 million on the Tranche B-4 Facility.
Borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are guaranteed by each of our wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries (other than certain excluded subsidiaries) and are secured by a lien on substantially all of our and such subsidiaries’ assets. Borrowings with respect to the TLA Facility and our revolving credit facility (collectively, “Pro Rata Facilities”) under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate tied to Acadia’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio (defined as consolidated funded debt net of up to $50.0 million of unrestricted and unencumbered cash to consolidated EBITDA). The Applicable Rate for the Pro Rata Facilities was 2.5% for Eurodollar Rate Loans and 1.5% for Base Rate Loans at December 31, 2020. Eurodollar Rate Loans with respect to the Pro Rata Facilities bear interest at the Applicable Rate plus the Eurodollar Rate (based upon the LIBOR Rate prior to commencement of the interest rate period). Base Rate Loans with respect to the Pro Rata Facilities bear interest at the Applicable Rate plus the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the prime rate and (iii) the Eurodollar Rate plus 1.0%. At December 31, 2020, the Pro Rata Facilities bore interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.5%. In addition, we are required to pay a commitment fee on undrawn amounts under our revolving credit facility.
The interest rates and the unused line fee on unused commitments related to the Pro Rata Facilities are based upon the following pricing tiers:
The Tranche B-4 Facility bore interest as follows: Eurodollar Rate Loans bore interest at the Applicable Rate (as defined below) plus the Eurodollar Rate (based upon the LIBOR Rate prior to commencement of the interest rate period) and Base Rate Loans bore interest at the Applicable Rate plus the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the prime rate and (iii) the Eurodollar Rate plus 1.0%. As used herein, the term “Applicable Rate” means, with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans, 2.50%, and with respect to Base Rate Loans, 1.50%. At December 31, 2020, the Tranche B-4 bore interest rate at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.5%.
The lenders who provided the Tranche B-3 Facility and Tranche B-4 Facility are not entitled to benefit from our maintenance of the financial covenants under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Accordingly, if we fail to maintain the financial covenants, such failure shall not constitute an event of default under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with respect to the Tranche B-3 Facility or Tranche B-4 Facility until and unless the Amended and Restated Senior Credit Facility is accelerated or the commitment of the lenders to make further loans is terminated.
The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement requires us and our subsidiaries to comply with customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants, including a fixed charge coverage ratio, consolidated total leverage ratio and consolidated senior secured leverage ratio. We may be required to pay all of our indebtedness immediately if we default on any of the numerous financial or other restrictive covenants contained in any of our material debt agreements. Set forth below is a brief description of such covenants, all of which are subject to customary exceptions, materiality thresholds and qualifications:

•
the total leverage ratio may not be greater than the following levels as of the end of each fiscal quarter listed below:
•
the consolidated senior secured leverage ratio may not be greater than 3.50x as of the end of each fiscal quarter.
At December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all of the above covenants.

On June 24, 2020, we satisfied and discharged the indentures governing the 6.125% Senior Notes and the 5.125% Senior Notes by irrevocably depositing with a trustee sufficient funds equal to the Redemption Price for the 6.125% Senior Notes and the 5.125% Senior Notes and otherwise complying with the terms in the indentures relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the 6.125% Senior Notes and the 5.125% Senior Notes. In connection with the redemption of the 6.125% Senior Notes and the 5.125% Senior Notes, we recorded a debt extinguishment charge of $3.3 million, including the write-off of the deferred financing and other costs in the consolidated statements of operations.
5.625% Senior Notes due 2023
On February 11, 2015, we issued $375.0 million of 5.625% Senior Notes due 2023. On September 21, 2015, we issued $275.0 million of additional 5.625% Senior Notes. The additional notes formed a single class of debt securities with the 5.625% Senior Notes issued in February 2015. Giving effect to this issuance, we have outstanding an aggregate of $650.0 million of 5.625% Senior Notes. The 5.625% Senior Notes mature on February 15, 2023 and bear interest at a rate of 5.625% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year.

The redemption of this $1,040 million of additional debt, along with the payment of breakage costs of $6 million and estimated transaction costs of $9 million, is expected to be completed in early March 2021 and to be funded from cash from the balance sheet of $430 million and proceeds from a new senior secured credit facility of $625 million. We expect to enter into a new term loan and revolver as part of a five-year senior secured credit facility.

On June 24, 2020, we issued $450.0 million of 5.500% Senior Notes due 2028. The 5.500% Senior Notes mature on July 1, 2028 and bear interest at a rate of 5.500% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on January 1 and July 1 of each year, commencing on January 1, 2021.
5.000% Senior Notes due 2029
On October 14, 2020, we issued $475.0 million of 5.000% Senior Notes due 2029. The 5.000% Senior Notes mature on April 15, 2029 and bear interest at a rate of 5.000% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing on April 15, 2021. We used the net proceeds of the 5.000% Senior Note to prepay approximately $453.3 million of the outstanding borrowings on our existing Tranche B-3 Facility and used the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes and to pay related fees and expenses in connection with the offering. In connection with the 5.000% Senior Notes, we recorded a debt extinguishment charge of $2.9 million, including the write-off of discount and deferred financing cost, which was recorded in debt extinguishment costs in the consolidated statements of operations.
The indentures governing the Senior Notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit the Company’s ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to: (i) pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions or investments; (ii) incur additional debt or issue certain preferred stock; (iii) transfer or sell assets; (iv) engage in certain transactions with affiliates; (v) create restrictions on dividends or other payments by the restricted subsidiaries; (vi) merge, consolidate or sell substantially all of the Company’s assets; and (vii) create liens on assets.
The Senior Notes issued by the Company are guaranteed by each of the Company’s subsidiaries that guarantee the Company’s obligations under the Amended and Restated Senior Credit Facility. The guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several.
The Company may redeem the Senior Notes at its option, in whole or part, at the dates and amounts set forth in the indentures.
9.0% and 9.5% Revenue Bonds
On November 11, 2012, in connection with the acquisition of The Pavilion at HealthPark, LLC (“Park Royal”), we assumed debt of $23.0 million. The fair market value of the debt assumed was $25.6 million and resulted in a debt premium balance being recorded as of the acquisition date. The debt consisted of $7.5 million and $15.5 million of 9.0% and 9.5% Revenue Bonds, respectively.
On December 1, 2018, we exercised the option to redeem in whole the 9.0% and 9.5% Revenue Bonds at a redemption price equal to the sum of 104% of the principal amount of the 9.0% and 9.5% Revenue Bonds plus accrued and unpaid interest. In connection with the redemption of the 9.0% and 9.5% Revenue Bonds, we recorded a debt extinguishment charge of $0.9 million, which was recorded in debt extinguishment costs in the consolidated statements of operations.
Contractual Obligations
The following table presents a summary of contractual obligations (dollars in thousands):
(1)
Amounts include required principal and interest payments. The projected interest payments reflect interest rates in place on our variable-rate debt at December 31, 2020.
(2)
Amounts exclude variable components of lease payments.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
At December 31, 2020, we had standby letters of credit outstanding of $17.4 million related to security for the payment of claims as required by our workers’ compensation insurance program.
Market Risk
Interest Rate Risk
Our interest expense is sensitive to changes in market interest rates. Our long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2020 was composed of $1,947.0 million of fixed-rate debt and $1,175.4 million of variable-rate debt with interest based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin. A hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates (which would equate to a 0.27% higher rate on our variable-rate debt) would decrease our net income and cash flows by $2.6 million on an annual basis based upon our borrowing level at December 31, 2020. On January 5, 2021 we made a voluntary payment of $105.0 million on our Tranche B-4 Facility. On January 19, 2021 we paid in full balances of the TLA Facility and Tranche B-4 Facility, at which point we had no variable-rate debt.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. In preparing our financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses included in the financial statements. Estimates are based on historical experience and other available information, the results of which form the basis of such estimates. While management believes our estimation processes are reasonable, actual results could differ from our estimates. The following accounting policies are considered critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating performance and involve highly subjective and complex assumptions and assessments:
Revenue and Accounts Receivable
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) and the International Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09. ASU 2014-09’s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. We adopted ASU 2014-09 using the modified retrospective method effective January 1, 2018. As a result of certain changes required by ASU 2014-09, the majority of our provision for doubtful accounts are recorded as a direct reduction to revenue instead of being presented as a separate line item on the consolidated statements of operations. The adoption of ASU 2014-09 did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Our revenue is primarily derived from services rendered to patients for inpatient psychiatric and substance abuse care, outpatient psychiatric care and adolescent residential treatment. We receive payments from the following sources for services rendered in our facilities: (i) state governments under their respective Medicaid and other programs; (ii) commercial insurers; (iii) the federal government under the Medicare program administered by CMS; (iv) publicly funded sources in the U.K. (including the NHS, CCGs and local authorities in England, Scotland and Wales) and (v) individual patients and clients. We determine the transaction price based on established billing rates reduced by contractual adjustments provided to third-party payors, discounts provided to uninsured patients and implicit price concessions. Contractual adjustments and discounts are based on contractual agreements, discount policies and historical experience. Implicit price concessions are based on historical collection experience.
We derive a significant portion of our revenue from Medicare, Medicaid and other payors that receive discounts from established billing rates. The Medicare and Medicaid regulations and various managed care contracts under which these discounts must be calculated are complex, subject to interpretation and adjustment, and may include multiple reimbursement mechanisms for different types of services provided in the Company’s inpatient facilities and cost settlement provisions. Management estimates the transaction price on a payor-specific basis given its interpretation of the applicable regulations or contract terms. The services authorized and provided and related reimbursement are often subject to interpretation that could result in payments that differ from our estimates. Additionally, updated regulations and contract renegotiations occur frequently, necessitating regular review and assessment of the estimation process by management.
Settlements under cost reimbursement agreements with third-party payors are estimated and recorded in the period in which the related services are rendered and are adjusted in future periods as final settlements are determined. Final determination of amounts earned under the Medicare and Medicaid programs often occurs in subsequent years because of audits by such programs, rights of appeal and the application of numerous technical provisions. In the opinion of management, adequate provision has been made for any adjustments and final settlements. However, there can be no assurance that any such adjustments and final settlements will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. Our cost report receivables were $5.8 million and $13.7 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and were included in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Management believes that these receivables are properly stated and are not likely to be settled for a significantly different amount. The
net adjustments to estimated cost report settlements resulted in a decrease to revenue of $1.3 million and $0.4 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and an increase of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
The following table presents revenue by payor type and as a percentage of revenue in our U.S. Facilities for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):
The following tables present a summary of our aging of accounts receivable at December 31, 2020 and 2019:
December 31, 2020
December 31, 2019
Medicaid accounts receivable at December 31, 2020 and 2019 included approximately $1.2 million and $1.4 million, respectively, of accounts pending Medicaid approval.
Insurance
We are subject to medical malpractice and other lawsuits due to the nature of the services we provide. A portion of our professional liability risks are insured through a wholly-owned insurance subsidiary. We are self-insured for professional liability claims up to $3.0 million per claim and have obtained reinsurance coverage from a third party to cover claims in excess of the retention limit. The reinsurance policy has a coverage limit of $75.0 million in the aggregate. Our reinsurance receivables are recognized consistent with the related liabilities and include known claims and any incurred but not reported claims that are covered by current insurance policies in place. The reserve for professional and general liability risks was estimated based on historical claims, demographic factors, industry trends, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accrual for professional and general liabilities could be significantly affected should current and future occurrences differ from historical claim trends and expectations. While claims are monitored closely when estimating professional and general liability accruals, the complexity of the claims and wide range of potential outcomes often hampers timely adjustments to the assumptions used in these estimates. The professional and general liability reserve was $77.5 million at December 31, 2020, of which $9.7 million was included in other accrued liabilities and $67.8 million was included in other long-term liabilities. The professional and general liability reserve was $52.6 million at December 31, 2019, of which $4.7 million was included in other accrued liabilities and $47.9 million was included in other long-term liabilities. We estimate receivables for the portion of professional and general liability reserves that are recoverable under our insurance policies. Such receivable was $27.2 million at December 31, 2020, of which $6.8 million was included in other current assets and $20.4 million was included in other assets, and such receivable was $8.5 million at December 31, 2019, of which $3.0 million was included in other current assets and $5.5 million was included in other assets.
Our statutory workers’ compensation program is fully insured with a $0.5 million deductible per accident. The workers’ compensation liability was $23.0 million at December 31, 2020, of which $12.0 million was included in accrued salaries and benefits and $11.0 million was included in other long-term liabilities, and such liability was $20.8 million at December 31, 2019, of which $10.0 million was included in accrued salaries and benefits and $10.8 million was included in other long-term liabilities. The reserve for workers compensation claims was based upon independent actuarial estimates of future amounts that will be paid to claimants. Management believes that adequate provisions have been made for workers’ compensation and professional and general liability risk exposures.
Property and Equipment and Other Long-Lived Assets
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which typically range from 10 to 50 years for buildings and improvements, three to seven years for equipment and the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful lives for leasehold improvements. When assets are sold or retired, the corresponding cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the related accounts and any gain or loss is recorded in the period of sale or retirement. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation expense was $95.3 million, $87.9 million and $80.3 million for the years ended years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The carrying values of long-lived assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events, circumstances or operating results indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If this review indicates that the asset will not be recoverable, as determined based upon the undiscounted cash flows of the operating asset over the remaining useful lives, the carrying value of the asset will be reduced to its estimated fair value. Fair value estimates are based on independent appraisals, market values of comparable assets or internal evaluations of future net cash flows.
We performed an impairment review of long-lived assets in the fourth quarter of 2020, which indicated the carrying amounts of certain of our long-lived assets in the U.S. Facilities may not be recoverable. This created a non-cash impairment of $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. A 2019 impairment review resulted in a non-cash loss on impairment of $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. These items were recorded in loss on impairment on our consolidated statements of operations. No impairment was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
Our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of licenses and accreditations, trade names and certificates of need intangible assets that are not amortized, are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently if events indicate the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable. As of our annual impairment test on October 1, 2020, we had two operating segments for segment reporting purposes, U.S. Facilities and U.K. Facilities, each of which represents a reporting unit for purposes of our goodwill impairment test.
Our annual goodwill impairment and other indefinite-lived intangible assets test performed as of October 1, 2020 considered recent financial performance, including the impacts of COVID-19 on certain portions of the U.K. business. The 2020 impairment test of the U.K. Facilities indicated carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded the estimated fair value and resulted in a non-cash loss on impairment of the remaining goodwill of the U.K. Facilities of $356.2 million. The non-cash loss on impairment is included in loss on sale within discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations. As of our impairment test on October 1, 2020, the fair value of our U.S Facilities reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value, and therefore no impairment was recorded. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $0.6 million related to indefinite-lived assets related to closed facilities in the U.S., which is included in loss on impairment in the consolidated statements of operations.
Due to the classification of the U.K. Facilities in discontinued operations at December 31, 2020, we have one operating segment, behavioral health services, for segment reporting purposes. The behavioral healthcare services operating segment represents one reporting unit for future goodwill impairment tests.
Income Taxes
We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The amount of deferred taxes on these temporary differences is determined using the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, as applicable, based on tax rates and laws in the respective tax jurisdiction enacted as of the balance sheet date.
We review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, applicable tax strategies, and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences.
A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
We also have accruals for taxes and associated interest that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities. We accrue for tax contingencies when it is more likely than not that a liability to a taxing authority has been incurred and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated. Although we believe that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable, we nevertheless have established tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken by us resulting in additional liabilities for taxes and interest. These amounts are reviewed as circumstances warrant and adjusted as events occur that affect our potential liability for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, conclusion of tax audits, additional exposure based on current calculations, identification of new issues, release of administrative guidance, or rendering of a court decision affecting a particular tax issue.
