As of April 30, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $12,407, accounts receivable of $5,252 and prepaid expenses of $2,000. During the years ended April 30, 2021 and 2020, we received advances from our former sole officer of $0 and $29,391, respectively, and proceeds from equity issuances of $287,680 and $0, respectively. During the year ended April 30, 2021, the Company recognized revenue of $826,731, incurred cost of revenue of $731,251 and generated gross profit of $95,480. We did not generate any revenue from our business operations during the year ended April 30, 2020.
We will require additional funds for our budgeted expenses over the next 12 months. These funds may be raised through equity financing, debt financing, or other sources, which may result in further dilution in the equity ownership of our shares. There is still no assurance that we will be able to maintain operations at a level sufficient for an investor to obtain a return on his investment in our common stock. Further, we may continue to be unprofitable. We need to raise additional funds in the immediate future in order to proceed with our budgeted expenses.
Specifically, based on nominal operations we estimate our operating expenses and working capital requirements for the next 12 months to be as follows:
We will require additional financing in order to enable us to proceed with our plan of operations, as discussed above, including approximately $1,711,540 over the next 12 months to pay for our planned expenses. In addition, our planned expenses, including legal, accounting and audit fees, and general and administrative expenses, may be higher in the event we enter into any significant transactions. These planned cash requirements are in excess of our current cash and working capital resources. Although our cash requirements may be offset in part by anticipated revenues, we will require additional financing in order to continue operations, execute our business plan, and repay our liabilities. There is no assurance that any party will advance additional funds to us in order to enable us to sustain our plan of operations or to repay our liabilities.
We anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common stock in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our planned business activities. We presently do not have any arrangements for additional financing for the expansion of our future operations, and no potential lines of credit or sources of financing are currently available for the purpose of proceeding with our plan of operations. If we are not successful in raising sufficient capital to execute our business plan, we will be required to scale down or delay our plan of operation to accommodate our available resources.
Contractual Obligations
Not required for smaller reporting companies
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. A change in managements’ estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented.
Revenue Recognition
During the year ended April 30, 2021, the Company generated its first revenue since its establishment. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of products in accordance with ASC 606, “Revenue Recognition” following the five steps procedure:
Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with customers
Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract
Step 3: Determine the transaction price
Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations
Step 5: Recognize revenue when the entity satisfies a performance obligation
The Company engages in the business of organizing, promoting, and operating industry-specific group purchase organizations (GPOs). A GPO is an entity created to leverage the purchasing power of a group of businesses (or individuals) to obtain discounts from vendors. The Company identifies underserved markets, segments and industries where there is little to no competition and develops specific GPOs around them. The Company develops industry specific GPO that leverage the aggregated purchasing power of its members. The GPOs use collective buying power to obtain and negotiate discounts on products and services from vendors. The discounted rates are then shared with its members saving them money and time by also improving supply chain efficiencies.
The main business segments are HealthGPO, a Group Purchasing Organization for the Healthcare industry, and cbdGPO, a Group Purchasing Organization for the Hemp industry. In addition, the Company offers professional services through GPOPRO Services.
HealthGPO works with companies that have well priced high-quality products and services with advantageous terms. The Company’s primary offerings are volume supply acquisitions, access to quality personal protective equipment (PPE), essential necessities and medical equipment from non-traditional, yet fully accredited suppliers. Additionally, the Company identify “best of breed” products that have a unique value proposition and become distributors with some form of exclusivity and/or favorable terms. HealthGPO is developing a b2b healthcare portal to offer medical products to everyday business. Technology will continue to play an important role in exceeding our stated goals.
HealthGPO also addresses the needs of individual consumers who want access to products at a good price that is typically only available to healthcare professionals. The Company intend on developing a b2c (business to consumer) portal to sell healthcare and wellness products directly to consumers.
In accordance with ASC 606, revenues are recognized when:
·
The invoice has been generated and provided to the customer.
·
The performance obligations of delivery of products are stated in the invoice.
·
The transaction price has been identified in the invoice.
·
The Company has allocated the transaction price to performance obligation in the invoice.
·
The Company has shipped out the product and, therefore, satisfied the performance obligation.
Convertible Financial Instruments
The Company bifurcates conversion options from their host instruments and accounts for them as free-standing derivative financial instruments if certain criteria are met. The criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not remeasured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur, and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument. An exception to this rule is when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional, as that term is described under applicable U.S. GAAP.
When the Company has determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated from their host instruments, discounts are recorded for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in the instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the instrument.
Share-Based Compensation
Employees - The Company accounts for share-based compensation under the fair value method which requires all such compensation to employees to be calculated based on its fair value at the measurement date (generally the grant date) and recognized in the consolidated statement of operations over the requisite service period.
Nonemployees - During June 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2018-07, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting (“ASU 2018-07”) to simplify the accounting for share-based payments to nonemployees by aligning it with the accounting for share-based payments to employees. The Company elected to adopt ASU 2018-07 early. Under the requirements of ASU 2018-07, the Company accounts for share-based compensation to non-employees under the fair value method which requires all such compensation to be calculated based on the fair value at the measurement date (generally the grant date), and recognized in the statement of operations over the requisite service period.
