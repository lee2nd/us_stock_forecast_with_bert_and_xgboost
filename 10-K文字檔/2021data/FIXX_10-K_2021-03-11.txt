Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our “Selected Consolidated Financial Data” and our consolidated financial statements, related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. As a result of many important factors, including those set forth in the section captioned “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements. A discussion of the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 has been reported previously in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on March 12, 2020, under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Overview
We are a clinical-stage genetic medicines company dedicated to transforming the lives of patients suffering from rare genetic diseases with significant unmet medical needs by curing the underlying cause of the disease. Our proprietary platform is designed to utilize our human hematopoietic stem cell derived adeno-associated virus vectors, or AAVHSCs, to precisely and efficiently deliver single administration genetic medicines in vivo either through gene therapy or nuclease-free gene editing across a broad range of genetic disorders. Our diverse set of AAVHSCs allows us to precisely target, via a single injection, a wide range of disease-relevant tissues, including the liver, central nervous system, or CNS, peripheral nervous system, or PNS, bone marrow, muscle and eye. Our genetic medicines platform is designed to provide us the flexibility to choose the method we believe is best suited from either gene therapy or gene editing for each disease we pursue, based on such factors as the targeted disease biology, the biodistribution of our AAVHSCs to key tissues, and the rate of cell division the tissues exhibit. Our product development strategy is to continue to develop in parallel both gene therapy and gene editing, while initially leveraging the experience from our gene therapy product candidates to further advance our gene editing. We believe our dual technology platform will allow us to provide transformative cures using either modality.
The unique properties of our proprietary family of 15 novel AAVHSCs enable us to focus on a method of gene editing called gene integration, through the replacement of an entire diseased gene in the genome with a whole functional copy by harnessing the naturally occurring deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, repair process of homologous recombination, or HR. We believe our HR-driven gene editing approach will allow us to efficiently perform gene editing at therapeutic levels without unwanted on- and off-target modifications, and to directly measure and confirm those modifications in an unbiased manner to ensure only the intended changes are made. By utilizing the body’s natural mechanism of correcting gene defects, we also avoid the need for exogenous nucleases, or bacteria-derived enzymes used in other gene editing approaches to cut DNA, that are known to significantly increase the risk of unwanted modifications.
HMI-102 for Treatment of PKU in Adult Patients
We are currently in Phase 2 of the pheNIX clinical trial with our first and lead product candidate, HMI-102, a gene therapy for the treatment of adults with phenylketonuria, or PKU. In November 2020, we reported positive safety and efficacy clinical data from the dose-escalation phase of the trial. As of the data cutoff date of October 19, 2020, six patients in the dose-escalation phase of the pheNIX trial had received HMI-102 across three dose cohorts (low-dose Cohort 1, n=2; mid-dose Cohort 2, n=2; high-dose Cohort 3, n=2). The results showed that HMI-102 was generally well-tolerated, and resulted in marked reductions in phenylalanine, or Phe, and the Phe-to-tyrosine, or Tyr, ratio, or the Phe-to-Tyr ratio, at two doses. Phe is a registrable endpoint in PKU, and the Phe-to-Tyr ratio is a clinically relevant diagnostic measurement for PKU. Based on the safety and efficacy results observed in the dose-escalation phase, we have selected and advanced two doses to the randomized, concurrently controlled, dose expansion Phase 2 portion of the pheNIX trial, which has the potential to be converted to a registrational trial. We expect to report initial clinical data from this portion of the trial by the end of 2021.
Other Product Candidates
We are currently progressing two gene therapy product development candidates for the treatment of lysosomal storage diseases: HMI-203 for the treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II), or Hunter syndrome, and HMI-202 for the treatment of metachromatic leukodystrophy, or MLD.
We are in later-stage IND-enabling studies with HMI-203, an in vivo gene therapy product development candidate for the treatment of Hunter syndrome. HMI-203 is a potential one-time AAVHSC treatment designed to deliver functional copies of the IDS gene to multiple target organs, including those in the PNS and CNS, following a single I.V. administration. In preclinical studies, a single I.V. administration of HMI-203 resulted in robust biodistribution and human I2S, or hI2S, enzyme expression, leading to a significant reduction in heparin sulfate glycosaminoglycans, or GAGs, levels in the cerebrospinal fluid, brain, liver, heart, spleen, lung and kidney, compared with the vehicle-treated disease model. HMI-203 also led to significant changes in skeletal deformities compared with vehicle. We expect to initiate a Phase 1/2 dose-escalation clinical trial with HMI-203 in 2021.
We completed IND-enabling studies with HMI-202, a gene therapy CNS product development candidate for the treatment of MLD. We have generated preclinical data that demonstrates that a single I.V. administration of HMI-202 crossed the blood-brain-barrier and blood-nerve-barrier and led to durable reduction of sulfatides in all brain regions of the disease model. We are applying the learnings from the IND-enabling studies to further optimize an HMI-202 vector that may lead to a better therapeutic profile.
We are in later-stage IND-enabling studies with HMI-103, our lead gene editing product development candidate for the treatment of PKU in pediatric patients. We have generated in vivo preclinical data demonstrating Phe reduction following a single I.V. administration of the murine surrogate of HMI-103 in the PKU disease model out to 43 weeks (end of study). In addition, using quantitative molecular methods, we have demonstrated achievement of gene integration efficiencies in a humanized murine liver model that corresponded with Phe correction in the PKU murine model. These findings were peer-reviewed and published in PLOS ONE in May 2020. We expect to initiate a Phase 1/2 dose-escalation clinical trial with HMI-103 in 2021.
We also plan to name a development candidate in a new therapeutic area in 2021, demonstrating the broader capability of our AAVHSC platform, which we believe may allow us to target diseases with larger patient populations in the future.
On November 9, 2020, we entered into a stock purchase agreement, or the Stock Purchase Agreement, with Pfizer Inc., or Pfizer, pursuant to which Pfizer purchased 5,000,000 shares of our common stock through a private placement transaction at a purchase price of $12.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $60.0 million. For additional information, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
On February 26, 2021, we received notice from Novartis Institutes of BioMedical Research, Inc., or Novartis, that they had elected to terminate the collaboration and license agreement with respect to the ophthalmic target, which was the only remaining target under the agreement. Accordingly, the notice served as notice of Novartis’ termination of the agreement in its entirety, with an effective date of August 26, 2021, which is six months from the date of the notice. Novartis has agreed to work with us to effect the orderly wind down of activities in accordance with the agreement. As a result of this notice, we have regained worldwide exclusive rights from Novartis to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize our proprietary nuclease-free gene editing technology platform for the ophthalmic target. We plan to continue to advance the program toward naming a development candidate. The companies believe that results of studies conducted under the agreement provide early proof-of-principle and support a nuclease-independent approach to editing of relevant cell types in the eye after sub-retinal injection, and are the subject of a planned presentation at an upcoming scientific meeting. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Novartis collaboration and license agreement.
We have fully integrated process development and Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, manufacturing capabilities that support the full breadth and flexibility of our AAVHSC capsid library. Our process development expertise covers all gene therapy and gene editing development functions and incorporates deep characterization and understanding of vector design and their consequences. Our manufacturing process is a versatile system that rapidly delivers high quality vector at scale. The manufacturing capacity within our 25,000 square foot GMP manufacturing facility includes multi-suite and multi-product capabilities to support our clinical development programs in both gene therapy and gene editing and we are now producing all of the clinical material for the pheNIX trial in this facility. Our plug and play process and manufacturing platform is a commercial manufacturing process that has successfully produced several of our product candidates. We are currently operating three 500-liter bioreactors in our internal manufacturing facility and have successfully produced GMP material at the 500-liter scale for multiple pipeline candidates. Additionally, we have successfully executed our manufacturing platform with multiple product candidates at the 2,000-liter bioreactor scale.
Our management team has a successful track record of discovering, developing and commercializing therapeutics with a particular focus on rare diseases. We have a robust intellectual property portfolio with issued composition of matter patents in the United States for our family of 15 AAVHSCs and we believe the breadth and depth of our intellectual property is a strategic asset that has the potential to provide us with a significant competitive advantage. We continue to build on our intellectual property estate through our ongoing product and platform development efforts.
Since our inception in 2015, we have raised approximately $539 million in aggregate net proceeds through our initial public offering, or IPO, in April 2018, a follow-on public offering of common stock in April 2019, proceeds from the sale of common stock under an “at-the-market” sales agreement, equity investments and preferred stock financings. Included in our net proceeds is $50.0 million from a former collaboration partner, comprised of an up-front payment of $35.0 million and a $15.0 million equity investment and a $60.0 million equity investment from Pfizer Inc., or Pfizer, through a private placement transaction. We will require additional capital in order to advance HMI-102 and our other product candidates through clinical development and commercialization. We believe that our compelling preclinical data, positive clinical data with HMI-102,
scientific expertise, product development strategy, manufacturing capabilities, and robust intellectual property position us as a leader in the development of genetic medicines.
We were incorporated and commenced operations in 2015. Since our incorporation, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, developing our technology platform, advancing our lead product candidate, HMI-102 for the treatment of PKU, through IND-enabling studies and into a Phase 1/2 clinical trial, advancing HMI-103, HMI-203, and HMI-202 into IND-enabling studies, researching and identifying additional product candidates, developing and implementing manufacturing processes and internal manufacturing capabilities, building out our manufacturing and research and development space, enhancing our intellectual property portfolio, and providing general and administrative support for these operations. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of common stock, through the sale of preferred stock, and through funding from our collaboration partner.
To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the foreseeable future, if at all. We recognized $2.7 million and $1.7 million in collaboration revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Since inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $128.7 million and $103.9 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $328.4 million.
Our total operating expenses were $133.0 million and $111.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We expect our operating expenses to continue to increase in connection with our ongoing development activities related to our product candidates. Specifically, we anticipate that our expenses will increase due to costs associated with our Phase 1/2 pheNIX clinical trial with HMI-102, development activities including IND-enabling studies and clinical trials associated with our other product candidates, including HMI-103, our gene editing product candidate for PKU, HMI-203, our gene therapy product candidate for Hunter syndrome, HMI-202, our gene therapy product candidate for MLD, for which we are focusing on optimization of the vector, and research activities in additional therapeutic areas to expand our pipeline, hiring additional personnel in manufacturing, research, clinical and regulatory, quality and other functional areas, increased expenses incurred with contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to supply us with product for our clinical studies, costs to manufacture product for preclinical and clinical studies in our internal manufacturing facility and other costs including the maintenance and expansion of our intellectual property portfolio. In addition, we expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.
We have incurred significant capital expenditures for the buildout of a facility we have leased, including research and development labs, office space and manufacturing suites and the procurement of equipment and furniture for this facility and in support of our product development candidates and research initiatives. We expect to incur additional capital expenditures in support of our research and development activities and our manufacturing facility.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of our current and any future product candidates and our platform and technology and because the extent to which we may enter into collaborations with third parties for development of any of our product candidates is unknown, we are unable to predict the timing and amount of increased operating expenses and capital expenditures associated with completing the research and development of our product candidates. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:
•
the costs, timing, and results of our ongoing research and development efforts, including clinical trials, on HMI-102;
•
the costs, timing, and results of our ongoing research and development efforts for HMI-103, HMI-202 and HMI-203, all of which are in IND-enabling studies;
•
the costs, timing, and results of our research and development efforts for current and future product candidates in our gene therapy and gene editing pipeline;
•
the costs and timing of process development and manufacturing scale-up activities, and the adequacy of supply of our product candidates for preclinical studies and clinical trials through CMOs and internal manufacturing;
•
the costs and timing of capital expenditures for potential additional manufacturing capacity and related equipment and furniture;
•
the costs and timing of preparing, filing, and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims, including any claims by third parties that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights;
•
the effect of competitors and market developments; and
•
our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing or other agreements and the financial terms of such agreements for our product candidates.
We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our current projected operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the third quarter of 2022, including, subject to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, additional development activities related to our Phase 1/2 pheNIX clinical trial with HMI-102, the advancement of HMI-103, our lead gene editing product candidate for PKU, through IND-enabling studies and into a Phase 1/2 clinical trial, HMI-203, our lead in vivo gene therapy product candidate for Hunter syndrome, through IND-enabling studies and into a Phase 1/2 clinical trial, and HMI-202, an in vivo gene therapy product candidate for MLD, through additional preclinical studies as we focus on optimizing the program’s vector, the continued scale-up of our manufacturing processes and the expansion of our intellectual property portfolio. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be imprecise, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources.” Adequate additional funds may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. For example, the trading prices for our and other biopharmaceutical companies’ stock have been highly volatile as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we may face difficulties raising capital through sales of our common stock and any such sales may be on unfavorable terms. See “Risk Factors-The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel strain of coronavirus could adversely impact our business, including our preclinical studies and clinical trials.” in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of our shareholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect rights as a shareholder. Any future debt financing or preferred equity or other financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends and may require the issuance of warrants, which could potentially dilute the ownership interests of our shareholders.
If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate our product development programs or any future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with drug development, we are unable to predict when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate revenue from product sales, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
We are closely monitoring how the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting our employees, our Phase 1/2 pheNIX clinical trial, preclinical studies, manufacturing and overall operations. In response to the spread of COVID-19, we have taken steps to minimize the impact on our operations.
Operations - To protect the health of our employees and the third parties with whom we interact, most office-based employees continue to work from home, while essential staffing levels in our operations remain in place, including key personnel in our laboratories and manufacturing facility. For those employees on-site, we have developed shift schedules for our laboratories and manufacturing facility and a modified office layout and traffic flow pattern to increase spacing capabilities, reduce inter-office risks and allow for business continuity. We have increased cleaning protocols throughout our entire facility, limited visitors to only those who are critical to our ongoing operations and have cancelled all business travel. In addition, we have developed our own on-site COVID-19 surveillance testing for employees to help promote health and safety.
Phase 1/2 pheNIX clinical trial - We are currently in Phase 2 of our Phase 1/2 pheNIX clinical trial and are working with trial sites to mitigate potential COVID-19-related disruptions in order to help ensure the safety of patients and healthcare professionals. In addition, we have deployed home-health services which include home visits for patient monitoring and reporting, as well as the utilization of a centralized laboratory for testing enrolled patients. Despite our best efforts, disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted, and may continue to result, in delays in enrolling our Phase 1/2 pheNIX clinical trial. In addition, we could experience additional disruptions in conducting or completing this trial or other planned clinical trials and the incurrence of unforeseen costs as a result of these delays. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the ongoing global pandemic on the pheNIX trial and will make adjustments, as needed.
Preclinical studies - IND-enabling studies are continuing in support of our HMI-103 and HMI-203 programs and we have made operational changes to mitigate the risk of potential disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. All of our ongoing and planned preclinical studies at external CROs are progressing and we have accelerated shipments of reagents and supplies to avoid any disruption of activities. However, it is possible that the COVID-19 pandemic may have an impact in the future on our CROs’ ability to complete critical studies required for the progression of these programs. In addition, any planned or potential meetings with the FDA or other regulatory authorities about any of our development programs could be delayed as these regulatory bodies respond to the ongoing pandemic.
Manufacturing - We continue to operate our manufacturing facility at or near normal levels. We have on-hand all of the drug product needed for the expansion phase of the pheNIX clinical trial. In addition, during the first quarter of 2020, we began to accelerate the procurement of raw materials for future manufacturing, research and development needs to minimize potential supply chain interruptions. While we currently do not anticipate any interruptions in our manufacturing process, it is possible that the COVID-19 pandemic and response efforts may have an impact in the future on our and/or our third-party suppliers and CMOs’ ability to manufacture our product candidates or materials needed for our preclinical studies and clinical trials.
At this time, there is significant uncertainty relating to the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic and impact of related responses and as a result, we expect that the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our business, revenues, results of operations and financial condition. The impact of COVID-19 on our future results will largely depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the duration of the pandemic, travel restrictions and social distancing in the United States and other countries, business closures or business disruptions, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on financial markets and the global economy, the effectiveness of vaccines and vaccine distribution efforts and the effectiveness of other actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease. See “Risk Factors- The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel strain of coronavirus could adversely impact our business, including our preclinical studies and clinical trials.” in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Components of Our Results of Operations
Revenue
To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the foreseeable future. We recorded $2.7 million in collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 (see Notes 15 and 16 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding revenue recognition discussions).
Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses since inception have consisted solely of research and development costs and general and administrative costs.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our discovery efforts, and the development of our product candidates, and include:
•
salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, for personnel engaged in research and development functions;
•
expenses incurred under agreements with third parties, including contract research organizations, or CROs, and other third parties that conduct research, preclinical activities and clinical trials on our behalf as well as CMOs and our internal technical operations team that manufacture our product candidates for use in our preclinical testing, our Phase 1/2 pheNIX clinical trial and additional potential future clinical trials;
•
costs of outside consultants, including their fees and related travel expenses;
•
the costs of laboratory supplies and acquiring, developing and manufacturing preclinical study and clinical trial materials; and
•
facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs.
We expense research and development costs as incurred.
We typically use our employee and infrastructure resources across our development programs. We track outsourced development costs by product candidate or development program, but we do not allocate personnel costs, license payments made under our licensing arrangements or other internal costs to specific development programs or product candidates. These costs are included in other research and development expenses in the table below.
The following table summarizes our research and development expenses by product candidate or development program:
Research and development activities are central to our business model. We expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase substantially for the foreseeable future as we advance clinical trials of HMI-102, for the treatment of PKU, including our Phase 1/2 pheNIX clinical trial, continue to advance HMI-103, HMI-203, and HMI-202 through IND-enabling studies and into clinical trials and continue to discover and develop additional product candidates.
We cannot determine with certainty the duration and costs of future clinical trials of HMI-102 and IND-enabling studies and future clinical trials of our other product candidates in development or any other future product candidate we may develop or if, when, or to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. We may never succeed in obtaining marketing approval for any product candidate. The duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of HMI-102, our other product candidates in development and any other future product candidate we may develop will depend on a variety of factors, including:
•
the scope, rate of progress, expense and results of clinical trials of HMI-102, HMI-103, HMI-202, and HMI-203 as well as of any future clinical trials of other product candidates and other research and development activities that we may conduct;
•
uncertainties in clinical trial design and patient enrollment rates;
•
any delays in clinical trials as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic;
•
the actual probability of success for our product candidates, including the safety and efficacy results, early clinical data, competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability;
•
significant and changing government regulation and regulatory guidance;
•
the timing and receipt of any marketing approvals; and
•
the expense of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights.
A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate, or if we experience significant delays in our clinical trials due to patient enrollment or other reasons, we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in our executive, finance, human resources, business development and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include legal fees relating to intellectual property and corporate matters; professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and consulting services; insurance costs; travel expenses; and facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs, rent expense, maintenance of facilities and other operating costs.
We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our personnel headcount to support increased research and development activities relating to HMI-102, HMI-103, HMI-202, HMI-203 and any other product candidates we may develop. We also have incurred and expect to continue to incur increased expenses associated with being a public company, including costs of accounting, audit, compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with Nasdaq and SEC requirements; director and officer insurance costs; and investor and public relations costs.
Interest Income
Interest income consists of interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Our interest income has decreased due to lower yields on invested funds as well as lower invested balances during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. Market volatility resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to adversely impact our interest income.
Income Taxes
Since our inception in 2015, we have not recorded any U.S. federal or state income tax benefits for the net losses we have incurred in any year or for our earned research and development tax credits, due to our uncertainty of realizing a benefit from those items. As of December 31, 2020, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $265.1 million and $271.5 million, respectively, that expire at various dates through 2040. As of December 31, 2020, we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $34.2 million and $7.2 million, respectively, that expire at various dates through 2040. Included in the $34.2 million of federal research and development credit carryforwards is $29.0 million of orphan drug credit carryforwards.
Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgements that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.
Revenue Recognition-In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue (Topic 606): Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASU 2014-09”), which amends the guidance for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers. ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in FASB ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition (“ASC 605”), and creates a new Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”). On January 1, 2019, we adopted ASC 606 using the full retrospective transition method.
Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized for arrangements determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we perform the following five steps: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) we satisfy each performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that we will collect consideration we are entitled to in exchange for the goods or services we transfer to the customer.
We estimate the transaction price based on the amount expected to be received for transferring the promised goods or services in the contract. The consideration may include fixed consideration and variable consideration. At the inception of each
arrangement that includes variable consideration, we evaluate the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled to. We utilize either the most likely amount method or expected value method to estimate the amount expected to be received based on which method best predicts the amount expected to be received. The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price may be constrained and is included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in a future period.
Our contracts may include development and regulatory milestone payments that are assessed under the most likely amount method and constrained until it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur. Milestone payments that are not within our control, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. At the end of each reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of achievement of such development and clinical milestones and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect collaboration revenue in the period of adjustment.
For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). We allocate the transaction price based on the estimated standalone selling price of each performance obligation. We develop assumptions that require judgment to determine the stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract. We utilize key assumptions to determine the stand-alone selling price, which may include other comparable transactions, pricing considered in negotiating the transaction and the estimated costs. Variable consideration is allocated specifically to one or more performance obligations in a contract when the terms of the variable consideration relate to the satisfaction of the performance obligation and the resulting amounts allocated are consistent with the amounts we would expect to receive for the satisfaction of each performance obligation.
The consideration allocated to each performance obligation is recognized as revenue when control is transferred for the related goods or services. For performance obligations which consist of licenses and other promises, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress. We evaluate the measure of progress for our over-time arrangements at each reporting period and, if necessary, adjust the measure of performance and related revenue recognition and, if necessary, update the measure or progress and revenue recognized.
Accrued Research and Development Expenses-As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contract and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel and vendors to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated costs incurred for the services when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advanced payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:
•
CROs and other third parties in connection with performing research activities on our behalf and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf and CMOs in connection with producing product for our clinical studies;
•
vendors in connection with preclinical development activities; and
•
vendors related to product manufacturing and development and distribution of preclinical supplies.
We base our expenses related to preclinical and clinical studies on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with CROs that conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials and CMOs that manufacture product for our research and development activities on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. In accruing fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or amount of prepaid expense accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, we have not made any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses.
Stock-Based Compensation-We account for stock-based compensation transactions using a grant-date fair-value-based method under FASB Codification Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation.
We measure stock options and other stock-based awards granted to employees, directors, consultants or advisors of the company or its affiliates based on their fair value on the date of the grant and recognize compensation expense of those awards, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. We apply the straight-line method of expense recognition to all awards with only service-based vesting conditions and apply the graded-vesting method to all awards with performance-based vesting conditions or to awards with both service-based and performance-based vesting conditions.
We estimate the fair value of each stock option grant on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock and assumptions we make for the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield.
Emerging Growth Company Status
The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, permits an “emerging growth company,” which we are, to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of this extended transition period.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In February 2016, the FASB issued new leasing standards to increase transparency and comparability among organizations related to their leasing activities. For additional information regarding our adoption of the new leasing standards, please refer to Notes 2 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”) to improve financial reporting by requiring more timely recording of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments held by financial institutions and other organizations. ASU 2016-13 requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. ASU 2016-13 also requires enhanced disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an organization’s portfolio. ASU 2016-13 is effective for us beginning January 1, 2023, with early application permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.
In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting (“ASU 2018-07”), which changes certain aspects of the accounting for share-based payments granted to nonemployees. Under ASU 2018-07, most of the guidance on such payments to nonemployees would be aligned with the requirements for share-based payments granted to employees. We adopted ASU 2018-07 on January 1, 2020. The adoption of ASU 2018-07 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In October 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-10, Codification Improvements, which updates various codification topics by clarifying or improving disclosure requirements to align with the SEC’s regulations. We will adopt ASU 2020-10 as of the reporting period beginning January 1, 2021. The adoption of this update is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Results of Operations
Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Collaboration Revenue
Collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $2.7 million, compared to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, collaboration revenue consisted primarily of revenue recognized under our collaboration agreement with Novartis. We recognize such revenues consistent with the pattern of performance of our research and development activities under the collaboration, taking into consideration all upfront payments and research funding payments under this arrangement together as a single performance obligation. Collaboration revenue recognized under the collaboration in a given period is based on actual costs incurred during that period as a percentage of total estimated costs to complete the single performance obligation under the arrangement.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $100.4 million, compared to $89.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $11.0 million was due to an increase of $3.7 million in direct research expenses for HMI-102 including costs incurred with our CRO to conduct and manage our Phase 1/2 pheNIX clinical trial, as well as costs related to manufacturing clinical trial materials. Additionally, there was a $11.0 million increase in direct research expenses related to our other development-stage programs, including our newly announced HMI-203 program for Hunter syndrome, as well as a $9.8 million increase in employee-related costs due to additional employee headcount to support our ongoing development programs, research initiatives, technology platform and manufacturing capabilities resulting in increases in salaries, payroll taxes, stock-based compensation expense and recruiting costs. Partially offsetting these increases was a $13.5 million decrease in research and development costs related to laboratory supplies and research materials for our early-stage research programs.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $32.6 million, compared to $22.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $10.4 million was due to an increase in employee-related
expenses of $5.2 million, which included $3.4 million of increased stock-based compensation expense, an increase in facility costs of $1.4 million, an increase in legal costs and other professional fees of $0.9 million, an increase in insurance and taxes of $0.8 million, an increase in software expense of $0.7 million, an increase in consulting expense of $0.6 million, an increase in recruiting fees of $0.4 million and an increase in market research of $0.4 million .
Interest Income
Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1.6 million, compared to $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was the result of lower invested balances in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, as well as significantly lower yields on invested funds.
Net Loss
Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $128.7 million, compared to $103.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in net loss was primarily due to the increases in research and development and general and administrative expenses discussed above.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates. We expect that our research and development and general and administrative costs and our capital expenditures will increase in connection with conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates, contracting with CMOs producing material in our internal manufacturing facility to support preclinical studies and clinical trials, expanding our research and development laboratories and manufacturing facility, expanding our intellectual property portfolio, and providing general and administrative support for our operations. As a result, we will need additional capital to fund our operations, which we may obtain from additional equity or debt financings, collaborations, licensing arrangements, or other sources.
We do not currently have any approved products and have never generated any revenue from product sales. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of common stock, the sale of preferred stock and through an up-front payment from a collaboration partner. Since our inception in 2015, we have raised approximately $539 million in aggregate net proceeds through our IPO in April 2018, a follow-on public offering of common stock in April 2019, proceeds from the sale of common stock under an “at-the-market” sales agreement, equity investments and preferred stock financings. Included in our net proceeds is $50.0 million from a former collaboration partner, comprised of an up-front payment of $35.0 million and a $15.0 million equity investment and a $60.0 million equity investment from Pfizer through a private placement transaction.
In March 2020, we entered into a sales agreement, or the Sales Agreement, with Cowen and Company, LLC, or Cowen, as sales agent, pursuant to which we may, from time to time, issue and sell common stock with an aggregate value of up to $150.0 million in "at-the-market" offerings, or the ATM, under our Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-237131) filed with the SEC on March 12, 2020. Sales of common stock, if any, pursuant to the Sales Agreement, may be made in sales deemed to be an “at the market offering” as defined in Rule 415(a) of the Securities Act, including sales made directly through the Nasdaq Global Market or on any other existing trading market for our common stock. No securities were issued pursuant to the Sales Agreement during the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, there was $150.0 million of common stock remaining available for sale under the ATM. Simultaneous with the filing of the registration statement in March 2020, our previous Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-230664) filed with the SEC on April 1, 2019 and our prior sales agreement with Cowen providing for the offering, issuance and sale of up to an aggregate $100.0 million of our common stock from time to time in “at-the-market” offerings were terminated.
Strategic Collaborations and Investments
On November 9, 2020, we entered into the Stock Purchase Agreement with Pfizer, pursuant to which Pfizer purchased 5,000,000 shares of our common stock through a private placement transaction at a purchase price of $12.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $60.0 million. Under the Stock Purchase Agreement, Pfizer was granted an exclusive right of first refusal, or ROFR, for a 30-month period beginning on the date of the closing of the private placement to negotiate a potential collaboration on the development and commercialization of HMI-102 and HMI-103. Pfizer may exercise its right of first refusal under the ROFR one time for each of HMI-102 and HMI-103 during the ROFR period. In addition to the ROFR, the Stock Purchase Agreement provided for an information sharing committee comprised of representatives of each company which will serve as a forum for sharing information regarding the development of HMI-102 and HMI-103 during the ROFR
period. Additionally, Pfizer has designated a member to join our Scientific Advisory Board to participate in matters related to the development of these programs.
See Part I, Item 1. “Strategic Collaborations-Collaboration and License Agreement with the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Inc.” for additional information about our collaboration and license agreement with Novartis.
Cash Flows
Our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $217.4 million and $262.4 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We had no indebtedness as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
The following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for the period presented:
Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2020
Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $94.3 million, driven primarily by our net loss of $128.7 million as we incurred expenses associated with research and development activities on HMI-102, HMI-103, HMI-203, and HMI-202, including the Phase 1/2 pheNIX trial for our HMI-102 program, and research activities on other applications for our technology, and a decrease in operating lease liabilities of $2.3 million. These items were partially offset by net non-cash expenses of $22.8 million, which includes $13.2 million of stock-based compensation expense and $8.0 million of depreciation expense, and a decrease in working capital of $13.8 million.
Investing Activities
Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $204.9 million, attributable to maturities of short-term investments of $228.6 million, partially offset by purchases of short-term investments of $20.0 million and purchases of property and equipment of $3.7 million.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $53.1 million, primarily due to $52.0 million of net proceeds allocated to the issuance of common stock in a private placement transaction with Pfizer in November 2020.
Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2019
Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $91.4 million, driven primarily by our net loss of $103.9 million as we incurred expenses associated with research and development activities on HMI-102, HMI-103 and HMI-202, including the Phase 1/2 pheNIX trial for our HMI-102 program, and research activities on other applications for our technology. The funding of our net loss was partially offset by net non-cash expenses of $12.1 million, including $7.6 million of stock compensation expense and $6.3 million of depreciation expense. Changes to working capital were mostly offsetting, with $4.5 million in decreased accounts payable and $0.6 million in decreased deferred revenue netting against $2.8 million in decreased prepaid expenses and other current assets and $2.3 million in increased accrued expenses and other liabilities.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $51.8 million, attributable to $286.4 million in purchases of short-term investments and $21.8 million in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by maturities of short-term investments of $256.4 million.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $158.2 million, primarily due to $134.5 million of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in a public offering in April 2019 and $22.5 million of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock under an “at-the-market” sales agreement in December 2019.
Funding Requirements
Our operating expenses increased substantially in 2020 and are expected to increase in future years in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance our Phase 1/2 pheNIX clinical trial with HMI-102 and our preclinical activities including IND-enabling studies and expected Phase 1/2 clinical trials, continue to scale-up our manufacturing processes, engage with CMOs, manufacture materials for preclinical and clinical activities in our internal manufacturing facility and initiate additional human clinical trials. In addition, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. We also expect our capital expenditures to increase as we expand our operations.
Specifically, our expenses will increase as we:
•
pursue the preclinical and clinical development of HMI-102, including the ongoing pheNIX Phase 1/2 clinical trial, HMI-103, HMI-203 and HMI-202;
•
pursue the preclinical and clinical development of other product candidates based on our gene therapy and gene editing technology;
•
further scale up our internal manufacturing processes and capabilities, manufacture materials in our internal manufacturing facility and contract with CMOs to support our preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates;
•
further expand our manufacturing capacity;
•
operate our business in our facility with expanded research and development labs and manufacturing suites and purchase additional equipment for our operations;
•
in-license or acquire the rights to other products, product candidates or technologies;
•
maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;
•
hire additional personnel in research, manufacturing and regulatory and clinical development as well as management personnel; and
•
expand our operational, financial and management systems and increase personnel, including personnel to support our operations as a public company.
We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our current projected operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the third quarter of 2022, including, subject to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, additional development activities related to our Phase 1/2 pheNIX clinical trial with HMI-102, the advancement of HMI-103, our lead gene editing product candidate for PKU, through IND-enabling studies and into a Phase 1/2 clinical trial, HMI-203, our lead CNS/PNS gene therapy product candidate for Hunter syndrome, through IND-enabling studies and into a Phase 1/2 clinical trial, and HMI-202, a CNS gene therapy product candidate for MLD, through additional preclinical studies as we focus on optimizing the program’s vector, the continued scale-up of our manufacturing processes and the expansion of our intellectual property portfolio. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be imprecise, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical drugs, it is difficult to estimate with certainty the amount of our working capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:
•
the progress, costs and results of our preclinical development and initial clinical trials for HMI-102, including the pheNIX Phase 1/2 clinical trial, HMI-103, HMI-203, and HMI-202;
•
the progress, costs and results of our additional research and preclinical development programs in gene therapy and gene editing;
•
the costs, scope and timing of internal process development and manufacturing scale-up activities, the production of materials in our internal manufacturing facility, and outsourcing activities with CMOs associated with our lead product development programs and other programs we advance through preclinical and clinical development;
•
our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing or other agreements and the financial terms of such agreements;
•
the scope, progress, results and costs of any product candidates that we may derive from our platform technology or any other product candidates that we may develop;
•
the extent to which we in-license or acquire rights to other products, product candidates or technologies; and
•
the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending against any intellectual property-related claims.
In addition, the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our liquidity and future funding requirements is uncertain as of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as the pandemic continues to evolve globally. See “Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic” above and “Risk Factors- The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel strain of coronavirus could adversely impact our business, including our preclinical studies and clinical trials.” in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.
Until such time, if ever, that we can generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaboration agreements, other third-party funding, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements and marketing and distribution arrangements.
To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of our shareholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our shareholders as common stockholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through other third-party funding, collaboration agreements, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements or marketing and distribution arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market products or product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
Contractual Obligations
The following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020:
(1)
Represents future minimum lease payments under our operating leases for office and lab space in Bedford, Massachusetts that expire in October 2021 and February 2027. Future minimum lease payments are net of anticipated sublease payments of approximately $0.9 million in 2021.
(2)
Represents minimum annual license fees under our license agreements with Caltech and COH. These amounts do not include any potential contingent payments upon the achievement by us of specified clinical, regulatory and commercial events, as applicable, or patent prosecution or royalty payments we may be required to make under these license agreements. We have excluded these potential payments in the contractual obligations table because the timing and likelihood of these contingent payments are not currently known and would be difficult to predict or estimate. See Part I, Item 1. “Strategic Collaborations” for additional information about these license agreements, including with respect to potential payments thereunder.
We enter into contracts in the normal course of business with CROs and CMOs for clinical trials, preclinical research studies and testing, manufacturing and other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts do not contain any minimum purchase commitments and are cancelable by us upon prior notice of 30 days and, as a result, are not included in the table of contractual obligations above.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements and do not have any holdings in variable interest entities.
