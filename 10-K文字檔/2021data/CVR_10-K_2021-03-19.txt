RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Financial results for 2020 were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic that resulted in broad disruptions in most markets we serve. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern regarding the outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19. In response to the resulting pandemic, governments around the world took various preventative measures in order to control the spread of the virus, including restricting travel, full or partial business shutdowns and implementing social distancing policies. As a result,
we experienced a significant drop in orders, especially during the second quarter, and the global economy was plunged into a recession. Although business conditions had improved by late in the third quarter, the effects of the pandemic continued to impact our operations and those of our customers and suppliers. We saw further improvement in the markets we serve in the fourth quarter and recorded sales of $8,265,419 for the quarter compared to $7,645,259 in the previous quarter and $7,186,968 in the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase in sales resulted in an improvement in net income to $464,263, or $0.48 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to a net loss of $293,884, or $0.30 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2019. Full year net sales were $27,590,653 in 2020 compared to $32,873,002 in 2019, a decline of $5,282,349, or 16.1%. Full year net income in 2020 was $50,450, or $0.05 per share, compared to $538,314, or $0.56 per share, in 2019.
2020 Compared to 2019
Fastener segment revenues were $7,332,308 in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $6,286,948 reported in the relatively weak fourth quarter of 2019, an increase of $1,045,360, or 16.6%. Fastener segment revenues for the full year were $24,607,863 in 2020 compared to $28,989,667 in 2019, a decline of $4,381,804, or 15.1%. The drop in sales in 2020 was primarily related to the COVID-19 pandemic that resulted in shutdowns of business in many parts of the world starting late in the first quarter. Those shutdowns became widespread in the second quarter as different governments struggled to contain the spread of the virus. The automotive sector is the primary market for our fastener segment products and much of that sector was idled for an extended period of time during the second quarter when government-imposed restrictions were the most severe. While sales to automotive customers improved in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the prior quarter and the year earlier quarter, such sales declined $2,906,738, or 15.7% for the year. Similarly, sales to non-automotive customers improved in the fourth quarter, but declined $1,475,066, or 14.1%, for the year. The rebound in sales in the fourth quarter, combined with the reduction in certain overhead expenses in the wake of pandemic-related shutdowns, resulted in fastener segment gross margin of $1,638,836 compared to $794,076 in the year earlier quarter, an increase of $844,760. The reduction in sales for the full year was the primary factor impacting gross margins for 2020. For the full year 2020, fastener segment gross margins were $4,170,276 compared to $4,652,353 in 2019, a decline of $482,077.
Assembly equipment segment revenues were $933,111 in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to $900,020 in the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase of $33,091, or 3.7%. The increase was due to improved machine sales which offset declines in parts and tool sales during the quarter. For the full year 2020, assembly equipment segment revenues were $2,982,790, compared to $3,883,335 reported in 2019, a decline of $900,545, or 23.2%. The year to date decline was primarily due to the broad impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that dramatically reduced demand in the second and third quarters. Gross margins improved in the fourth quarter of 2020 to $255,296 from $90,954 in the fourth quarter of 2019, due in part to 2020 revenue being more heavily weighted toward higher margin machine sales and due to the disposal of certain excess inventory items in 2019. For the full year, assembly equipment segment gross margins declined, along with sales, to $744,926 from $1,092,177.
Selling and administrative expenses were $4,998,216 in 2020 compared to $5,252,946 in 2019, a decline of $254,730, or 4.8%. The decline was primarily due to a $214,000 reduction in salaries and benefits necessitated by the pandemic and a commission expense reduction of $117,000 related to lower sales in 2020. These reductions were partially offset by consulting expenses of $124,000 related to an ERP system conversion that was completed at one of our locations during the year. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 18.1% in 2020 compared to 16.0% in 2019.
Other income was $148,464 in 2020 compared to $191,730 in 2019. Other income is primarily comprised of interest income which declined during the year due to lower interest rates.
The Company’s effective income tax rates were 22.9% and 21.2% in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
DIVIDENDS
In determining to pay dividends, the Board considers current profitability, the outlook for longer-term profitability, known and potential cash requirements and the overall financial condition of the Company. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company reduced the regular quarterly dividend from $0.22 per share to $0.10 per share. The Company paid four regular quarterly dividends totaling $0.52 per share during 2020. On February 22, 2021, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share, restoring the dividend to the pre-pandemic amount. This dividend will be payable March 19, 2021 to shareholders of record on March 5, 2021. This continues the uninterrupted record of consecutive quarterly dividends paid by the Company to its shareholders that extends over 87 years.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Total capital expenditures in 2020 were $824,136. Fastener segment additions accounted for $614,835 of the total, including $410,114 for cold heading and screw machine equipment, $97,908 for inspection equipment and $40,000 for equipment to perform secondary operations on parts. The remaining $66,813 fastener segment additions consisted of parts cleaning and loading equipment. Assembly equipment segment additions in 2020 were $13,924 for production equipment. Investments for the benefit of both operating segments, primarily for building improvements, totaled $195,377 during 2020.
Capital expenditures during 2019 totaled $1,802,914. The fastener segment accounted for $1,522,541 of the total, including cold heading and screw machine equipment additions of $567,963, secondary processing equipment of $631,089, quality control equipment additions of $268,468 and $46,066 for general plant equipment. The remainder of the fastener segment additions relate to technology equipment. Assembly equipment segment additions totaled $233,697, primarily for production equipment. Additional investments of $46,676 were made in 2019 for building improvements and office equipment that benefit both operating segments.
Depreciation expense amounted to $1,347,305 in 2020 and $1,382,235 in 2019.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Working capital at December 31, 2020 was approximately $16.6 million, an increase of $0.1 million from the beginning of the year. The net change was primarily due to increases in accounts receivable and inventory of $0.6 million and $0.2 million, respectively, which were only partially offset by a reduction in cash, cash equivalents and certificates of deposit of $0.7 million. The Company’s investing activities in 2020 included the net maturities of certificates of deposit of $1.8 million, due to the near-zero interest rates brought on in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and capital expenditures of $0.8 million. The only financing activity during 2020 was the payment of approximately $0.5 million in dividends. The Company’s holdings in cash, cash equivalents and certificates of deposit amounted to $7.3 million at the end of 2020.
Management believes that current cash, cash equivalents and operating cash flow will be sufficient to provide adequate working capital for the next twelve months.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company has not entered into, and has no current plans to enter into, any off-balance sheet financing arrangements.
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. A summary of critical accounting policies can be found in Note 1 of the financial statements.
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
The Company’s financial statements and financial condition were not, and are not expected to be, materially impacted by new, or proposed, accounting standards. A summary of recent accounting pronouncements can be found in Note 1 of the financial statements.
OUTLOOK FOR 2021
After overcoming the worst period of the pandemic in the second quarter, the second half of 2020 results were more positive than those of the year earlier period which were negatively impacted by protracted trade disputes and slowing automotive sales. While the overall results in 2020 were heavily impacted by the global pandemic, the recent introduction of vaccines to guard against the worst effects of the virus offer hope of a return to more normal activities throughout the economy that could spur a broader economic recovery.
As we begin 2021, both our fastener segment and our assembly equipment segment have recently seen improved demand. However, both segments face challenges in the form of higher prices for raw materials, increased wages related to a tight labor market and sporadic supply chain disruptions that started during the pandemic. These factors, as well as the uncertainties that COVID-19 still presents, are expected to continue to provide challenges in the near-term. As we face the challenges ahead, we will continue our efforts to improve operational efficiency and pursue opportunities to develop new customer relationships and build on existing ones in all the markets we serve by emphasizing our experience, quality and customer service in a very competitive global marketplace.
While 2020 will likely be remembered for the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on everyday life, it also marked Chicago Rivet’s 100th year in existence. Such longevity is the result of the dedicated efforts of many people over the years, who consistently worked to exceed customer expectations related to quality, service and price. We are grateful for their contributions as well as for the loyalty of our customers and the support of our shareholders.
