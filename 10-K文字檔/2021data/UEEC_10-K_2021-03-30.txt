This discussion and analysis contain forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions.

Results of Operations years ending December 31, 2020 and 2019
The following table sets forth a summary of certain key financial information for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Year ended December 31, 2020 versus year ended December 31, 2019
During the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had $643 and $4,927 of revenues, respectively. The decrease in revenues is due to the continued focus, which commenced in 2018, of the Company’s capital and resources towards making our NORC technology and products more commercially viable by seeking to obtain a Class III PMA. The Company is continuing this strategy based on our belief that the greatest value to our shareholders will come from this PMA and, if granted, pursuing opportunities that we anticipate will be available to the Company.
Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $14,849,099 and $6,097,723, respectively. The increase in operating expenses is due primarily to an increase in consulting/professional fees offset by a decrease in research and development expenses. The increase in operating expenses is due primarily to an increase in stock-based compensation expense. The Company recorded $12,420,930 of stock-based compensation related to an amendment to the restricted stock award agreement made during the year. The amendment resulted in the vesting of 7,595,000 of restricted stock unit (“RSU”) awards and the immediate recognition of $5,392,450 of expenses and also $7,028,480 of stock-based compensation due to the amortization of the RSUs that vested on January 1, 2021 compared to stock-based compensation expense of $2,021,000 due to the change in vesting conditions of 2,150,000 shares of common stock previously held in escrow during the year ended December 31, 2019.
In addition, the Company issued 425,000 shares of common stock for services with a value of $301,875 during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 1,925,000 shares of common stock for services valued at $1,859,250 during the year ended December 31, 2019.
The increase in stock-based compensation was offset by a decrease in research and development expense of $421,170.
Other income (expense) for 2020 and 2019 was $(862,749) and $(508,183), respectively. The increase in other expense was due to the increase in total interest expense of $38,045 and loss on debt settlement of $316,521. The increase in interest expense is due to the amortization of beneficial conversion features on convertible notes payable and convertible notes payable - related party during the current year totaling $546,228 compared to $508,183 in the prior year. The loss on debt settlement is due to the Company issuing shares of common stock with a fair value of $866,482 for the conversion of $549,567 of convertible notes payable and accrued interest.
Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $15,711,400 as compared to a net loss of $6,602,295 for the prior year. The increase in the net loss is due to an increase in stock-based stock compensation of $8,842,555, a decrease in research and development expenses of $421,170 and an increase in the loss on debt settlement of $316,521 compared to the prior year for the reasons described above.
Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had a negative working capital of $1,054,612. The Company has not yet attained a level of operations, and for the foreseeable future will not be pursuing commercial operations, which will allow it to meet its current overhead expense obligations while it focuses on its strategy of seeking an FDA Class III PMA. The report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our 2020 and 2019 financial statements includes an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. While the Company has funded its initial operations with private placements, and secured loans from related parties, there can be no assurance that adequate financing will continue to be available to the Company and, if available, on terms that are favorable to the Company. Our ability to continue as a going concern is also dependent on many events outside of our direct control, including, among other things, our ability to achieve our business goals and objectives, as well as improvement in the economic climate.
Cash Flows
The Company’s cash on hand as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $46,076 and $16,624, respectively.

Critical Accounting Policies
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Under ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue from the sale of its HemoStyp product by applying the following steps: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied.
The Company receives orders for its HemoStyp products directly from its customers. Revenues are recognized based on the agreed upon sales or transaction price with the customer when control of the promised goods are transferred to the customer. The transfer of goods to the customer and satisfaction of the Company’s performance obligation will occur either at the time when products are shipped or when the products arrive and are received by the customer. No discounts were offered by the Company. The Company does not provide an estimate for returns as there is no anticipation for any returns in the normal course of business.
Stock Based Compensation
The Company accounts for share-based compensation under the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. Under the fair value recognition provisions, stock-based compensation expense is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, or liabilities incurred, whichever is more reliably measured. Share-based compensation for all stock-based awards to employees and directors is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period.
The Company accounts for stock compensation arrangements with non-employees in accordance with Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2018-07, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which requires that such equity instruments are recorded at the value on the grant date.
