Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and the Results of Operations.
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with “Selected Consolidated Financial Data” and our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report.
Discussion and Analysis of the Company’s financial condition and the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 is contained in Item 7 of Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 filed with the SEC on March 16, 2020.
This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from our expectations. Actual results and the timing of events may differ significantly from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those set forth under Item 1 - “ Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements,” Item 1A - “Risk Factors,” and elsewhere in this report. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements.
Financial Highlights for the Year Ended December 31, 2020
● Net income of $180.5 million increased 133% compared to December 31, 2019.
● Diluted earnings per share of $5.77 increased 143% compared to December 31, 2019.
● The $103.2 million, or 133%, increase in net income compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily driven by a $101.8 million, or 83%, increase in net interest income that reflected significant growth in mortgage warehouse loans, and a $61.2 million, or 173%, increase in gain on sale of loans, primarily from higher growth in both single-family and multi-family mortgages.
● Partially offsetting the increases to net income was a $38.0 million increase in the provision for income taxes due to the 138% increase in pre-tax income, and a $33.1 million, or 52%, increase in noninterest expenses. The increase in noninterest expense reflected higher salaries and employee benefits, including commissions, to support the strong growth in our businesses, as well as increases in loan expenses.
● Total assets of $9.6 billion increased $3.3 billion, or 51%, compared to December 31, 2019, driven by record-setting loan growth.
● Return on average assets was 2.12% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 1.47% for the year ended December 31, 2019.
● Asset quality remained strong, as nonperforming loans (nonaccrual and accruing loans greater or equal to 90 days past due) represented $6.3 million, or 0.11% of loans receivable at December 31, 2020, compared to $4.7 million, or 0.15% of loans receivable at December 31, 2019.
● During the year ended December 31, 2020, we did not experience significant disruption of business with existing customers related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company had only 11 loans remaining in payment deferral arrangements, with unpaid balances of $937,000 that represented 0.01% of total loans and loans held for sale at December 31, 2020. This compared favorably to the unpaid balances of $80.6 million at June 30, 2020 and $1.6 million at September 30, 2020. Despite the positive trends, we maintained $590,000 in our allowance for loan loss reserves for COVID-19 uncertainties as of December 31, 2020.
● The net interest margin of 2.69% increased 29 basis points compared to 2.40% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The net interest spread of 2.58% increased by 42 basis points compared to 2.16% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our diverse business model is designed to maximize overall profitability in both rising and falling interest rate environments, and unlike many other banks and holding companies, our future profitability relies less upon changes in net interest margin.
● We began borrowing from the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (“PPPLF”) during the third quarter of 2020 and the Federal Reserve discount window during the second quarter 2020, which has contributed to lower interest expenses and increased borrowing capacity.
● During this time of unprecedented loan growth at Merchants, we also increased our borrowing capacity with the FHLB the Federal discount window, and PPPLF, based on available collateral. As of December 31, 2020, we had $2.6 billion in available borrowing capacity, compared to $1.5 billion at December 31, 2019.
● A 139% increase in warehouse loan volume compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was well ahead of industry volume increases of 64%, as reported by the Mortgage Bankers Association. We have benefited from the increased loan origination and refinancing activity due to lower market interest rates.
● The volume of loans originated and acquired for sale in the secondary market through our multi-family business increased by $1.1 billion, or 116%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.

See “Company Overview and Our Business Segments,” in Item 1 “Business”, “Operating Segment Analysis for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019” in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and the Results of Operations”, and “Segment Information,” in Note 25 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about our segments.
Primary Factors We Use to Evaluate Our Business
As a financial institution, we manage and evaluate various aspects of both our results of operations and our financial condition. We evaluate the comparative levels and trends of the line items in our consolidated balance sheet and income statement as well as various financial ratios that are commonly used in our industry. We analyze these ratios and financial trends against our own historical performance, our budgeted performance and the financial condition and performance of comparable financial institutions in our region.
Results of operations
In addition to net income, the primary factors we use to evaluate and manage our results of operations include net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense.
Net interest income. Net interest income represents interest income less interest expense. We generate interest income from interest (net of any servicing fees paid or costs amortized over the expected life of the loans) and fees received on interest-earning assets, including loans, investment securities and dividends on FHLB stock we own. We incur interest expense from interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, including interest-bearing deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is the most significant contributor to our revenues and net income. To evaluate net interest income, we measure and monitor: (a) yields on our loans and other interest-earning assets; (b) the costs of our deposits and other funding sources; (c) our net interest margin; and (d) the regulatory risk weighting associated with the assets. Net interest margin is calculated as the annualized net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Because noninterest-bearing sources of funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and shareholders’ equity, also fund interest-earning assets, net interest margin includes the benefit of these noninterest-bearing sources.
Changes in market interest rates, the slope of the yield curve, and interest we earn on interest-earning assets or pay on interest-bearing liabilities, as well as the volume and types of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing liabilities and shareholders’ equity, usually have the largest impact on changes in our net interest spread, net interest margin and net interest income during a reporting period.
Noninterest Income. Noninterest income consists of, among other things: (a) gain on sale of loans; (b) loan servicing fees; (c) fair value adjustments to the value of mortgage servicing rights; (d) mortgage warehouse fees; and (e) other noninterest income.
Gain on sale of loans includes placement and origination fees, capitalized mortgage servicing rights, trading gains and losses, and other related income. Loan servicing fees are collected as payments are received for loans in the servicing portfolio. Fair value adjustments to the value of mortgage servicing rights are also included in noninterest income. Mortgage warehouse fees are recognized at the time of funding and collected at the time of sale.
Noninterest expense. Noninterest expense includes, among other things: (a) salaries and employee benefits, including commissions; (b) loan origination expenses; (c) occupancy and equipment expense; (d) professional fees; (e) FDIC insurance expense; (f) technology expense; and (g) other general and administrative expenses.
Salaries and employee benefits includes commissions, other compensation, employee benefits and employment tax expenses for our personnel. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we migrated employees to work-from-home arrangements in mid-March 2020 and continued operating without disruption to our customers. Most employees returned to the office part-time by December 2020. We have also assessed our internal control environment and believe we have the necessary precautions in place to ensure business continuity.
Loan expenses include third party processing for mortgage warehouse financing activities and loan-related origination expenses. Occupancy expense includes depreciation expense on our owned properties, lease expense on our leased properties and other occupancy-related expenses. Equipment expense includes furniture, fixtures and equipment related expenses. Professional fees include legal, accounting, consulting and other outsourcing arrangements. FDIC insurance expense represents the assessments that we pay to the FDIC for deposit insurance. Technology expense includes data processing fees paid to our third-party data processing system provider and other data service providers. Other general and administrative expenses include expenses associated with travel, meals, training, supplies and postage.
Noninterest expenses generally increase as we grow our business. Noninterest expenses have increased significantly over the past few years as we have grown organically, and as we have built out and modernized our operational infrastructure and implemented our plan to build an efficient, technology-driven mortgage banking operation with significant operational capacity for growth.
Financial Condition
The primary factors we use to evaluate and manage our financial condition are asset levels, liquidity, capital and asset quality.
Asset Levels. We manage our asset levels based upon forecasted closings or fundings within our business segments to ensure we have the necessary liquidity and capital to meet the required regulatory capital ratios. Each segment evaluates its funding needs by forecasting the fundings and sales of loans, communicating with customers on their projected funding needs, and reviewing its opportunities to add new customers.
Liquidity. We manage our liquidity based upon factors that include: (a) our amount of custodial and brokered deposits as a percentage of total deposits (b) the level of diversification of our funding sources (c) the allocation and amount of our deposits among deposit types (d) the short-term funding sources used to fund assets (e) the amount of non-deposit funding used to fund assets (f) the availability of unused funding sources; (g) off-balance sheet obligations; (h) the availability of assets to be readily converted into cash without a material loss on the investment ;(i) the amount of cash and cash equivalent securities we hold; (j) the repricing characteristics; (k) maturity and duration of our assets when compared to the repricing characteristics of our liabilities and other factors; and (l) costs of available funding options.
Capital. We manage our regulatory capital based upon factors that include: (a) the level and quality of capital and our overall financial condition; (b) the trend and volume of problem assets; (c) the dollar amount of mortgage servicing rights as a percentage of capital; (d) the level and quality of earnings; (e) the risk exposures in our balance sheet; and (f) other factors. In addition, since 2014 we have annually increased our capital through net income less dividends and equity issuances.
Asset Quality. We manage the diversification and quality of our assets based upon factors that include: (a) the level, distribution, severity and trend of problem, classified, delinquent, nonaccrual, nonperforming and restructured assets; (b) the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses; (c) the diversification and quality of loan and investment portfolios; (d) the extent of counterparty risks; (e) credit risk concentrations; and (f) other factors.
Recent Developments and Material Trends
Economic and Interest Rate Environment. The results of our operations are highly dependent on economic conditions, mortgage volumes, and market interest rates. Residential mortgage volumes fluctuate based on economic conditions, market interest rates, and the credit parameters set by the GSEs. In December 2015, the Federal Reserve raised the Federal Funds rate for the first time in nine years with additional increases throughout 2016, 2017 and 2018. Then in July 2019, the Federal Reserve reversed course with a 25 basis points decrease, followed by another 25 basis point decrease in both September and October of 2019. During 2020, the Federal Reserve reduced the Federal Funds rates by 150 basis points, leading to historically low rates in the range of 0.0% to 0.25%, which was the lowest the rates have been since 2008.
The lower interest rates in 2020 and 2019 contributed to the significant loan growth we experienced for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, particularly related to single family mortgage refinancing activity that increased net interest income in our Mortgage Warehousing segment. However, we do not anticipate that this trend of growth will necessarily continue. Supporting this expectation are reports from the Mortgage Bankers Association, which has forecasted a 64% increase in single family residential mortgage volume, to $3.692 trillion for 2020, from $2.253 trillion in 2019, and a decrease of 20%, to $2.959 trillion in 2021, followed by a decrease to $2.201 trillion for 2022.
COVID-19 Pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has had an ongoing global impact on nearly every aspect of daily life in the U.S. since early 2020. As infection and death rates continued to accelerate throughout 2020, many businesses and schools were forced to close or alter their way of business to ensure public safety. Businesses shifted to work-from-home arrangements for their employees, and some had to juggle new childcare and home-schooling responsibilities due to shutdowns. Despite government intervention to facilitate financial assistance and small business loans, as well as the roll-out of a vaccine in early 2021 to prevent COVID-19, many businesses are still likely to suffer losses or closures. Personal illnesses and business closures have impacted nearly every industry, including the mortgage banking industry. However, we believe Merchants has minimal direct credit exposure on loans to consumer, commercial, and other small businesses that have been most negatively impacted by COVID-19. As of December 31, 2020 we had only 11 loans in payment deferral arrangements, with unpaid balances of $937,000 that represented 0.01% of total loans and loans held for sale. We continue to monitor the situation and may need to adjust future expectations as developments occur.
Regulatory Environment. We believe the most important trends affecting community banks in the United States over the foreseeable future will be related to heightened regulatory capital requirements, regulatory burdens generally, including the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations thereunder, and interest margin compression. We expect that troubled community banks will continue to face significant challenges when attempting to raise capital. We also believe that heightened regulatory capital requirements will make it more difficult for even well-capitalized, healthy community banks to grow in their communities by taking advantage of opportunities in their markets that result as the economy improves. We believe these trends will favor community banks that have sufficient capital, a diversified business model and a strong deposit franchise.
As described further in Item 1 - “Supervision and Regulation-Merchants Bank and FMBI-Capital Requirements and Basel III” the federal regulators finalized and adopted rules regarding CBLR in November 2019. Under CBLR, if a qualifying depository institution or depository institution holding company elects to use such measure, such institution or holding company will be considered well capitalized if its ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets (i.e., leverage ratio) exceeds a 9% threshold, subject to a limited two quarter grace period, during which the leverage ratio cannot go 100 basis points below the then applicable threshold, and will not be required to calculate and report risk-based capital ratios. In April 2020, under the CARES Act, the 9% leverage ratio threshold was temporarily reduced to 8% in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The threshold increased to 8.5% in 2021 and will return to 9% in 2022. On December 2, 2020 the FDIC issued an interim final rule related to COVID-19 as it pertains to eligibility to utilize CBLR. The rule allows organizations with less than $10 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2019, to use the assets on that date to determine the applicability of various regulatory asset thresholds during 2020 and
2021. The Company, Merchants Bank, and FMBI elected to begin using CBLR for the first quarter of 2020 and all intend to utilize this measure for the foreseeable future.
General and Administrative Expenses. We expect to continue incurring increased noninterest expense attributable to general and administrative expenses related to building out and modernizing our operational infrastructure, marketing and other administrative expenses to execute our strategic initiatives, expenses to hire additional personnel and other costs required to continue our growth.
Allowance for Loan Losses. One of our key operating objectives has been, and continues to be, maintenance of an appropriate level of allowance for loan losses for probable incurred losses in our loan portfolio. The provision for loan losses recorded in prior years was primarily due to growth in our loan portfolio, as our historical loss rates remained very low. As we anticipate that our loan portfolio could moderate in 2021, we could similarly expect the provision to decrease, but could also be influenced by any changes to problem loans in our portfolio and or the loan type mix within the portfolio. Additional details are provided in the Allowance for Loan Losses portion of the Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. While it is too early to know the full extent of potential future losses associated with the impact of COVID-19, the Company continues to monitor the situation and may need to adjust future expectations as developments occur.
Acquisition of FMBI. On January 2, 2018, we acquired FMBI, an Illinois chartered bank located in Joy, Illinois, for a purchase price of approximately $5.5 million. The acquisition provided us membership to the FHLB Chicago, allowing us to participate in their Mortgage Partnership Finance Program.
Acquisition of FMNBP. On October 1, 2018, we acquired FMNBP, a national banking association located in Paxton, Illinois, for a purchase price of approximately $21.9 million, and FMNBP was merged into FMBI, with FMBI as the surviving bank.
Acquisition of NattyMac. On December 31, 2018, we acquired the assets of NattyMac, a warehouse funding operation located in Clearwater, Florida, from Home Point Financial Corporation (“Home Point”). Additionally, the Company repaid the balance, and related interest, of the $30 million subordinated debt that Home Point had invested in the Company.
Issuance of Preferred Stock. During 2019, we raised approximately $171.1 million in new capital, net of expenses and repurchases, through the issuance of preferred stock. At current levels, our total dividends on preferred stock are expected to be approximately $14.5 million annually.
Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
General. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $180.5 million, an increase of $103.2 million, or 133%, over the net income of $77.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to a $101.8 million, or 83%, increase in net interest income that reflected significant growth in mortgage warehouse loans, and an increase of $61.2 million, or 173%, in gain on sale of loans, primarily from higher growth in both single-family and multi-family mortgages.
Partially offsetting the increases to net income was a $38.0 million increase in the provision for income taxes due to the 138% increase in pre-tax income, and a $33.1 million, or 52%, increase in noninterest expenses, reflecting higher salaries and employee benefits, including commissions, to support the strong growth in our businesses, as well as increases in loan expenses from higher volume.
Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased $101.8 million, or 83%, to $224.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $122.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was due to a $3.2 billion increase in our average interest earning assets and a 42 basis point increase in our interest rate spread, to 2.58%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 2.16% for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Our net interest margin increased 29 basis points, to 2.69%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 2.40% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in net interest margin reflected lower funding costs that outpaced the lower overall market interest rates on loans.
Interest Income. Interest income increased $70.8 million, or 33%, to $282.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $212.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily attributable to a $77.5 million increase in interest on loans and loans held for sale from higher volumes and was partially offset by lower overall market interest rates.
The average balance of loans, including loans held for sale, during the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $2.9 billion, or 72%, to $7.0 billion from $4.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, while the average yield on loans decreased 82 basis points to 3.77% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 4.59% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in average balances of loans and loans held for sale was primarily due to significant increases in warehouse funding and multi-family volume. The decrease in the average yield on loans was primarily due to the overall decrease in interest rates in the economy period to period.
The average balance of mortgage loans in process of securitization increased 102%, to $381.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $188.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, while the average yield decreased by 62 basis points to 2.92% for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The average balance of interest-earning deposits increased 22%, to $665.3 million, for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $547.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, while the average yield decreased 160 basis points to 0.67% for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The average balance of taxable securities available for sale decreased $2.4 million, or 1%, to $279.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $281.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, and the average yield decreased 107 basis points, to 1.13%, for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Interest Expense. Total interest expense decreased $31.1 million, or 35%, to $58.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $89.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Interest expense on deposits decreased 38%, to $52.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $84.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was attributable to 114 basis point decrease in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits, to 0.79% for the year ended December 31, 2020, from 1.93% for the same period in 2019. The decrease in the cost of deposits was primarily due to custodial interest-bearing checking accounts that are tied to lower short-term LIBOR rates, lower rates on brokered certificates of deposits, and the overall decrease in interest rates in the economy period to period. The lower rates were partially offset by a $2.2 billion, or 50%, increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits, to $6.6 billion compared to the $4.4 billion balance at December 31, 2019. The increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits was primarily due to interest-bearing checking accounts and money market accounts.
Interest expense on borrowings increased 27%, to $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was due primarily to a $567.2 million, or 678%, increase in the average balance of borrowings outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2020 that was partially offset by a 504 basis point decrease in the average cost of borrowings to 0.98%, compared to 6.02% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The higher average balances for the year ended December 31, 2020 reflected an increase in borrowing from the FHLB, the Federal Reserve discount window, and the PPPLF at much lower rates. Also included in borrowings, our warehouse structured financing agreements provide for an additional interest payment for a portion of the earnings generated. As a result, the cost of borrowings increased from a base rate of 0.46% and 3.26%, to an effective rate of 0.98% and 6.02% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The following table presents, for the periods indicated, information about (i) average balances, the total dollar amount of interest income from interest-earning assets and the resultant average yields; (ii) average balances, the total dollar amount of interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and the resultant average rates; (iii) net interest income; (iv) the interest rate spread; and (v) the net interest margin. Yields have been calculated on a pre-tax basis. Nonaccrual loans are included in loans and loans held for sale.
(1)
Average balances are average daily balances.
(2)
Represents the average rate earned on interest-earning assets minus the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities.
(3)
Represents net interest income (annualized) divided by total average earning assets.
(4)
Reflects changes in LIBOR on mortgage custodial deposits.
Increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in weighted average interest rates. The following table sets forth the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income during the periods shown. Information is provided with respect to (i) effects on interest income attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate) and (ii) effects on interest income attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). Changes applicable to both volume and rate have been allocated to volume. Yields have been calculated on a pre-tax basis.
The following table summarizes the increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense resulting from changes in average balances (volume) and changes in average interest rates:
Provision for Loan Losses. We recorded a provision for loan losses of $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $7.9 million, compared with the year ended December 31, 2019. The allowance for loan losses was $27.5 million, or 0.50% of loans receivable at December 31, 2020, compared to $15.8 million, or 0.52% of loans receivable at December 31, 2019. The increase in the allowance for loan losses compared to prior periods reflected increases associated with loan growth and uncertainties surrounding COVID-19. Additional details are provided in the Allowance for Loan Losses portion of the Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. While it is too early to know the full extent of potential future losses associated with the impact of COVID-19, the Company continues to monitor the situation and may need to adjust future expectations as developments occur.
Noninterest Income. Noninterest income increased $80.4 million, or 171%, to $127.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $47.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to a $61.2 million, or 173% increase in gain on sale of loans, to $96.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $35.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily from an increase in volume from single-family and multi-family mortgage loans.
A summary of the gain on sale of loans for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is below:
Also contributing to the increase in noninterest income was a $13.8 million increase in mortgage warehouse fees that reached $20.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase resulted from the significant increase in loan volume compared to the same period in the prior year.
Partially offsetting the increase on gain on sale of loans and mortgage warehouse fees was a $683,000 decrease in loan servicing fees associated with fair value adjustments to mortgage servicing rights. Loan servicing fees included a negative fair market value adjustment of $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a negative fair market value adjustment of $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense increased $33.1 million, or 52%, to $96.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $63.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was due primarily to a $21.1 million, or 55%, increase in salaries and employee benefits to support business growth, with commissions representing $13.6 million of that increase. The efficiency ratio was 27.4% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with 37.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Income Taxes. Income tax expense increased 153%, to $62.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $24.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was due primarily to the 138% increase in pre-tax income. Our effective tax rate was 25.8% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 24.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Asset Quality
The Company believes it has minimal direct credit exposure on loans to consumer, commercial and other small businesses that may be negatively impacted by COVID-19. As of December 31, 2020, we had only 11 loans remaining in payment deferral arrangements, with unpaid balances of $937,000 that represented 0.01% of total loans and loans held for sale. This compared favorably to the unpaid balances of $1.6 million at September 30, 2020 and $80.6 million at June 30, 2020. We made loans to small businesses that could benefit from the CARES Act, particularly in the SBA’s Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”). As of December 31, 2020, the Company has funded approximately $94 million in PPP loans since the PPP was launched on April 3, 2020, with a current balance of $60 million.
Total nonperforming loans (nonaccrual and greater than 90 days late but still accruing) were $6.3 million, or 0.11% of total loans, at December 31, 2020, compared to $4.7 million, or 0.15% of total loans, at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily related to one collateralized agricultural loan that was delinquent greater than 90 days, with repayment still anticipated.
As a percentage of nonperforming loans, the allowance for loan losses was 435.1% at December 31, 2020 compared to 338.6% at December 31, 2019. The changes were primarily due to the increase in the allowance for loan losses associated with loan growth.
Total loans greater than 30 days past due were $47.8 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $12.6 million at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to one loan that is in the process of forbearance, the terms of which will bring the loan current. The loan is secured by a multi-family property, is fully collateralized based on current information, and full repayment is expected through a refinance or sale at or before the proposed new maturity date.
Traditional Special Mention (Watch) loans were $152.9 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $60.3 million at December 31, 2019. The increase primarily reflected outstanding balances of certain multi-family projects that have experienced cost over-runs funded by the borrower and lower than projected rent collections and occupancy levels, all of which have contributed to lower than projected cash flow of the projects. The increase is also associated with the delinquent loan described above in the process of forbearance. An additional category of Special Mention (Watch) loans was added as of June 30, 2020, and as of December 31, 2020 included $678,000 in arrangements related to COVID-19 deferral plans that were not already included in the traditional Special Mention or Substandard loans categories. Classified (substandard, doubtful and loss) loans were $14.5 million at December 31, 2020 and $12.5 million at December 31, 2019. Although we currently do not anticipate COVID-19 to have a material increase to Special Mention of Classified loans, given the industries in which we provide funding, we continue to monitor the situation.
We had $181,000 of recoveries and $361,000 of charge offs during the year ended December 31, 2020, and $162,000 of recoveries and $964,000 of charge offs during the year ended December 31, 2019.
Operating Segment Analysis for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Our reportable segments are Multi-family Mortgage Banking, Mortgage Warehousing, and Banking. As discussed in “Our Business Segments” of Item 1 and Note 25 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, our reportable segments have been determined based upon their business processes and economic characteristics. This determination also gave consideration to the structure and management of various product lines.
Our segment financial information was compiled utilizing the accounting policies described in Note 1, “Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” and Note 25, “Segment Information,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. As a result, reported segments and the financial information of the reported segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information reported by other financial institutions. Furthermore, changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in future changes to previously reported segment financial data. Transactions between segments consist primarily of borrowed funds. Intersegment interest expense is allocated to the Mortgage Warehousing and Banking segments based on Merchants Bank’s cost of funds. The provision for loan losses is allocated based on information included in our allowance for loan losses analysis and specific loan data for each segment.
The Other segment presented below, in Note 25 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, and elsewhere in this report includes general and administrative expenses for provision of services to all segments, internal funds transfer pricing offsets resulting from allocations to or from the other segments, certain elimination entries, and investments in qualified affordable housing limited partnerships.
The following table presents our primary operating results for our operating segments for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Multi-family Mortgage Banking. The Multi-family Mortgage Banking segment reported net income of $29.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $14.4 million, or 98%, compared with $14.8 million reported for the year ended December 31, 2019. The growth was primarily due to an increase in gain on sale of loans.
Partially offsetting the increase in gain on sale of loans was a $18.8 million, or 83%, increase in noninterest expenses, primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits associated with higher commissions and additional employees to support growth.
Noninterest income included a $5.8 million negative fair value market adjustment to mortgage servicing rights for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a negative fair value market adjustment of $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The volume of loans originated and acquired for sale in the secondary market increased by $1.1 billion, or 116%, to $2.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $917.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Total assets in the Multi-family segment increased 12%, to $210.7 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $188.9 million at December 31, 2019. These assets do not include multi-family and healthcare financing loans of $2.7 billion at December 31, 2020 and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2019 that are reported in our Banking segment.
Mortgage Warehousing. The Mortgage Warehousing segment reported net income of $106.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of 206% over the $34.8 million reported for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to a $85.0 million increase in net interest income after provision for loan losses, associated with significantly higher volume. The volume of loans funded during the year ended December 31, 2020 amounted to $110.6 billion, an increase of $64.4 billion, or 139%, compared to the same period in 2019. This compared favorably to the 64% industry increase in single-family residential loan volumes from the year ended December 31, 2019, as reported by the Mortgage Bankers Association. The growth in volume also contributed to a $13.9 million increase in noninterest income related to warehouse fees.
Partially offsetting the growth in net interest income and noninterest income compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was a $25.4 million increase in income taxes from 212% higher pre-tax net income.
Total assets in the Mortgage Warehousing segment increased 57%, to $4.9 billion at December 31, 2020, compared to $3.1 billion at December 31, 2019.
Banking. The Banking segment reported net income for the year ended December 31, 2020, of $53.6 million, an increase of 68% over the $31.9 million reported for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to a $28.4 million increase in noninterest income, reflecting significant growth in gain on sale of single-family
mortgage loans. Additionally, the increase was also due to a $18.8 million increase in net interest income, reflecting higher loan volume.
Partially offsetting the increase in noninterest income and net interest income compared to the prior year was a $8.8 million increase in noninterest expense, primarily associated with higher loan expenses and deposit insurance related to the growth in deposits and assets. Also partially offsetting the increase in noninterest income and net interest income compared to the prior year was a $8.7 million increase in income taxes that reflected a 73% increase in pre-tax net income, and an $8.0 million increase in the provision for loan losses and uncertainties related to COVID-19.
Total assets in the Banking segment increased 49%, to $4.5 billion at December 31, 2020, compared to $3.0 billion at December 31, 2019.
See “Our Business Segments,” in Item 1 “Business”, and Note 25, “Segment Information,” in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about our segments.
Financial Condition
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $9.6 billion in total assets, $7.4 billion in deposits, and $810.6 million in total shareholders’ equity. Total assets as of December 31, 2020 included approximately $179.7 million of cash and cash equivalents, $8.6 billion of loans, which was comprised of $3.1 billion of loans held for sale and $5.5 billion of loans held for investment, net of allowance for loan losses. Total assets also include $338.7 million of mortgage loans in process of securitization that primarily represent pre-sold multi-family rental real estate loan originations in mortgage backed securities pending settlements that typically occur within 30 days. There were $269.8 million of available for sale securities that are match funded with related custodial deposits. There are restrictions on the types of securities, as these are funded by certain custodial deposits where we set the cost of deposits based on the yield of the related securities. Mortgage servicing rights at December 31, 2020 were $82.6 million based on the fair value of the multi-family rental real estate and single-family mortgage loan servicing.
Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2020 and 2019
Total Assets. Total assets increased 51%, to $9.6 billion at December 31, 2020, from $6.4 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase was due primarily to increases in net loans receivable of $2.5 billion and loans held for sale of $976.4 million. Partially offsetting the increase in assets was a $327.0 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents.
While we do not expect to continue the same asset growth rate we experienced in 2020 and do expect to continue to meet the eligibility of and utilize CBLR, including any applicable grace period (as discussed under the caption Liquidity and Capital Resources below), we may take advantage of market conditions that could present opportunities for continued growth, even if such opportunities result in us exceeding $10 billion in assets.
Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents decreased $327.0 million, or 65%, to $179.7 million at December 31, 2020, from $506.7 million at December 31, 2019. The decrease reflected strategies to manage cash and borrowings most cost-effectively for our increased funding activities. Less cash is required to be on hand, as our borrowing capacity has increased.
Mortgage Loans in Process of Securitization. Mortgage loans in process of securitization increased $68.8 million, or 26%, to $338.7 million at December 31, 2020, from $269.9 million at December 31, 2019. These represent loans that our banking subsidiary, Merchants Bank, has funded and are held pending settlement, primarily as Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities with a firm investor commitment to purchase the securities. The 26% increase was primarily due to a significant increase in the volume of loans that had not yet settled with government agencies.
Securities Available for Sale. Securities available for sale decreased $20.4 million, or 7%, to $269.8 million at December 31, 2020, from $290.2 million at December 31, 2019. The decrease in securities available for sale was primarily due to purchases of $596.8 million, offset by calls, maturities, sales, and repayments of securities totaling $617.0 million during the period. We invest in available for sale securities primarily using funds from escrow deposits held at Merchants Bank, received in connection with our multi-family mortgage servicing activities. The available for
sale securities are funded by, and paired with as to interest rates, escrow custodial deposits held at the Company on loans serviced by us. This portfolio of securities is structured to achieve a favorable interest rate spread.
FHLB stock. FHLB stock increased 247%, to $70.7 million at December 31, 2020, from $20.4 million at December 31, 2019. The increase in FHLB stock was due primarily to additional borrowing from the FHLB that allows us to manage our liquidity and funding costs more effectively. Additional stock purchases are required by the FHLB in order to facilitate increased borrowing capacity.
Loans Held for Sale. Loans held for sale, comprised primarily of single-family residential real estate loan participations that meet Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae eligibility, increased $976.4 million, or 47%, to $3.1 billion at December 31, 2020, from $2.1 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase in loans held for sale was primarily due to higher warehouse volumes for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Loans Receivable, Net. The following table shows our allocation of loans held for investment as of the dates presented:
Loans receivable, net, which are comprised of loans held for investment, increased $2.5 billion, or 83%, to $5.5 billion at December 31, 2020, compared to December 31, 2019. The increase in net loans was comprised primarily of:
● an increase of $1.4 billion, or 104%, in multi-family and healthcare financing loans, to $2.7 billion at December 31, 2020,
● an increase of $840.6 million, or 110%, in mortgage warehouse lines of credit loans, to $1.6 billion at December 31, 2020, and
● an increase of $265.0 million, or 64%, in residential real estate, to $678.8 million at December 31, 2020.
The increase in multi-family and healthcare financing was due to higher origination volume for construction, bridge and other loans generated through our Multi-family segment that will remain on our balance sheet until they convert to permanent financing or are otherwise paid off over an average of one to three years.
The increase in mortgage warehouse lines of credit was primarily due to an increase in single-family refinancing activity associated with lower market interest rates. Our growth in this business was higher than the industry overall. We reported a 139% increase in mortgage warehouse volumes, while the industry saw a 64% industry increase in single-family residential loan volumes for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, as reported by the Mortgage Bankers Association.
The increase in residential real estate loans was primarily due to growth in first-lien HELOC loans.
As of December 31, 2020, approximately 94% of the total net loans at Merchants Bank reprice within three months.
Allowance for Loan Losses. The following table presents an analysis of the allowance for loan losses for the periods presented:
The following table presents an analysis of the allowance for loan losses for the periods presented:
The following table sets forth the amounts of nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets at the dates indicated:
The allowance for loan losses of $27.5 million at December 31, 2020 increased $11.7 million compared to December 31, 2019, primarily reflecting increases associated with loan growth and uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. Loan growth drove approximately $10.1 million, or 87%, of the $11.7 million increase, while additional provision associated with the COVID-19 pandemic represented approximately $590,000, or 5% of the increase.
The $10.1 million increase in the allowance for loan losses associated with loan growth compared to December 31, 2019, was largely driven by the 110% growth in mortgage warehouse loans and 104% growth in multi-family and healthcare financing loans compared to December 31, 2019. Loss factors applied to mortgage warehouse loans have traditionally represented the lowest loss factors of all loan categories utilized to compute allowances for loan losses. At December 31, 2020, the higher concentration of warehouse loans, which have lower loss factors in the allowance, has contributed to the overall percentage of the allowance for loan losses to total loans to decrease by 2 basis points, from 0.52% at December 31, 2019, to 0.50% at December 31, 2020.
The Company has minimal direct credit exposure on loans to consumer, commercial, and other small businesses that may be negatively impacted by COVID-19, but management has analyzed and increased the qualitative factors in these and other loan categories for potential future loan losses attributable to COVID-19. Accordingly, the Company increased the allowance by approximately $590,000 since December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we did not experience significant disruption of business with existing customers related to COVID-19. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had only 11 loans remaining in payment deferral arrangements, with unpaid balances of $937,000 that represented 0.01% of total loans and loans held for sale. This compared favorably to the unpaid balances of $1.6 million at September 30, 2020 and $80.6 million at June 30, 2020. If any of these 11 loans were not already classified on the Special Mention (Watch) list, they have been added to a new category of Special Mention
(Watch) loans specifically related to COVID-19 deferral arrangements. Because it is still too early to know the full extent of potential future losses associated with the impact of COVID-19, the Company continues to monitor the situation and may need to adjust future expectations with additional increases to its provision for loan losses as developments occur.
Also influencing the overall level of the allowance for loan losses is our differentiated strategy to typically hold loans with shorter durations and to maintain strict underwriting standards that enable us to sell the majority of our loans while meeting the criteria of government agencies.
Premises and Equipment, Net. Premises and equipment, net, increased 2%, to $29.8 million at December 31, 2020, compared to December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to capitalization of software.
Goodwill. Goodwill of $15.8 million at December 31, 2020 remained unchanged compared to December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s market capitalization was above its book value, despite stock market volatility related to the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy. Given the continued strength of the Company’s results, we do not believe there exists any impairment to goodwill or intangible assets.
Mortgage Servicing Rights. Mortgage servicing rights increased $8.2 million, or 11%, to $82.6 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $74.4 million at December 31, 2019. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, additions included originated and purchased servicing of $21.9 million. These increases were offset by paydowns of $7.8 million and a fair value decrease of $5.8 million. Mortgage servicing rights are recognized in connection with sales of loans when we retain servicing of the sold loans, as well as upon purchases of loan servicing portfolios. The mortgage servicing rights are recorded and carried at fair value. The fair value decrease recorded during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was driven primarily by the decline in short term interest rates that drive the valuation of escrow deposits held in conjunction with the servicing, and the decline in mortgage rates that increased borrower prepayment assumptions. Further decreases in interest rates could result in additional reductions to fair market values. The opposite could occur if interest rates increase.
Deposits. Deposits increased $1.9 billion, or 35%, to $7.4 billion at December 31, 2020, from $5.5 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to growth in traditional demand accounts that were partially offset by significantly lower levels of brokered certificates of deposits, as we shifted to utilize more cost-effective funding to match expected duration of our loans, including borrowing through the FHLB, Federal Reserve discount window and PPPLF. This strategy could reverse if deposit costs become more cost effective in the future.
Demand deposits increased $3.0 billion, or 142%, to $5.1 billion at December 31, 2020, while savings deposits increased $774.5 million, or 64%, to $2.0 billion at December 31, 2020. Certificates of deposit accounts decreased $1.8 billion, or 84%, to $356.7 million at December 31, 2020, primarily driven by the decrease in brokered deposits outstanding period to period.
We have decreased our use of total brokered deposits by 46%, to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2020 from $2.2 billion at December 31, 2019. Brokered deposits represented 16% of total deposits at December 31, 2020, compared to 39% of total deposits at December 31, 2019.
● Brokered certificates of deposit accounts decreased $1.9 billion, or 99%, to $29.2 million at December 31, 2020 from $2.0 billion at December 31, 2019. The decrease reflected our shift to utilize more cost-effective funding to match the expected duration of our loans, including borrowing through the FHLB, Federal Reserve discount window and the PPPLF.
● Brokered savings deposits increased $139.8 million, or 76%, to $324.4 million at December 31, 2020 from $184.6 million at December 31, 2019.
● Brokered demand deposit accounts increased by $810.2 million, to $820.2 million at December 31, 2020.
Although our brokered deposits are short-term in nature, they may be more rate sensitive compared to other sources of funding. In the future, those depositors may not replace their brokered deposits with us as they mature, or we may have to pay a higher rate of interest to keep those deposits or to replace them with other deposits or other sources of
funds. Not being able to maintain or replace those deposits as they mature would adversely affect our liquidity. Additionally, if Merchants Bank and FMBI do not maintain its well-capitalized position, it may not accept or renew any brokered deposits without a waiver granted by the FDIC.
Interest-bearing deposits increased $1.3 billion, or 26%, to $6.6 billion at December 31, 2020, and noninterest-bearing deposits increased $581.6 million, or 214%, to $853.6 million at December 31, 2020.
The following tables show the average balance amounts and the average contractual rates paid on our deposits for the periods indicated:
The following table shows time deposits of $100,000 or more by time remaining until maturity:
Borrowings. Borrowings totaled $1.3 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $1.2 billion, or 643%, from December 31, 2019, in order to maintain an appropriate level of cash to fund our businesses. Depending on rates and timing, borrowing can be, and has been during the year ended December 31, 2020, a more effective liquidity management alternative than utilizing brokered certificates of deposits. The Company has also started utilizing the Federal Reserve discount window and PPPLF which is contributing to lower interest expenses. We have benefited from the reduced rates offered by the Federal Reserve in response to the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020, but if rates return to more normal levels, other funding options may be more cost-effective.
During this time of unprecedented loan growth at Merchants, we also increased our borrowing capacity with the FHLB, the Federal Reserve discount window, and PPPLF, based on available collateral. As of December 31, 2020, we had $2.6 billion in available borrowing capacity, compared to $1.5 billion at December 31, 2019.
The following table sets forth certain information regarding our borrowings at the dates and for the periods indicated:
(1) The weighted-average interest rate at the end of the period reflects the stated interest rates on the borrowings. In addition to the stated rate, the borrowing term on subordinated debt includes payment of an amount equal to a portion of the net income from our warehouse structured finance arrangements, which is the driver of the higher average interest rate during the period relative to the stated rate at end of period.
Total Shareholders’ Equity. Total shareholders’ equity increased $156.9 million, or 24%, to $810.6 million at December 31, 2020, from $653.7 million at December 31, 2019. The increase resulted primarily from net income of $180.5 million, which was partially offset by dividends paid on common and preferred shares of $14.5 million and $9.2 million, respectively, during the period.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity
Our primary sources of funds are business and consumer deposits, escrow and custodial deposits, brokered deposits, principal and interest payments on loans, and proceeds from sale of loans. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash, short-term investments, including interest-bearing demand deposits, mortgage loans in process of securitization, and loans held for sale. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period.
Our cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $(874.9) million and $(1.3) billion for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities, which consists primarily of net change in loans receivable and purchases, sales and maturities of investment securities, was $(2.5) billion and $(957.7) million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities, which is comprised primarily of net change in borrowings and deposits, was $3.1 billion and $2.4 billion for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
At December 31, 2020, we had $1.5 billion in outstanding commitments to extend credit that are subject to credit risk and $3.1 billion outstanding commitments subject to certain performance criteria and cancellation by the Company, including loans pending closing, unfunded construction draws, and unfunded lines of warehouse credit. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet our current loan origination commitments.
Within our role as a multi-family mortgage servicer for other banks and investors, we may be obligated to remit principal and interest payments to investors on certain loans regardless of the borrower’s ability to make payments, which could become more likely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. If there are situations where a borrower is granted a forbearance, the Company believes it has sufficient liquidity to cover these required advances. We have not received any requests for forbearance in our multi-family portfolio that is serviced for others as of December 31, 2020 but remain confident in our ability to fund potential advances we may be required to make as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from December 31, 2020 totaled $240.0 million. Management expects that a substantial portion of the maturing certificates of deposit will be renewed.
However, if a substantial portion of these deposits is not retained, we may decide to utilize FHLB advances, the Federal Reserve discount window, brokered deposits, or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense.
At December 31, 2020, based on available collateral, we had access of up to an additional $2.6 billion in available unused borrowing capacity with the FHLB the Federal Reserve discount window, and PPPLF. This liquidity enhances the ability to effectively manage interest expense and assets levels in the future. The Company began utilizing the PPPLF during the third quarter 2020, and the Federal Reserve discount window during the second quarter 2020, which contributed to lowering interest expenses.
Capital Resources
The access to and cost of funding new business initiatives, the ability to engage in expanded business activities, the ability to pay dividends, the level of deposit insurance costs and the level and nature of regulatory oversight depend, in part, on our capital position. The Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC on December 30, 2019, which was declared effective on January 9, 2020, under which we can issue up to $300 million aggregate offering amount of registered securities to finance our growth objectives.
The assessment of capital adequacy depends on a number of factors, including asset quality, liquidity, earnings performance, changing competitive conditions and economic forces. We seek to maintain a strong capital base to support our growth and expansion activities, to provide stability to our current operations and to promote public confidence in our Company.
Shareholders’ Equity. Shareholders’ equity was $810.6 million as of December 31, 2020, compared to $653.7 million as of December 31, 2019. The $156.9 million increase resulted primarily from net income of $180.5 million, which was partially offset by dividends paid on common and preferred shares of $14.5 million and $9.2 million, respectively, during the period.
7% Preferred Stock. In March 2019 the Company issued 2,000,000 shares of 7.00% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Series A Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, without par value, and with a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share (“Series A Preferred Stock”). The Company received net proceeds of $48.3 million after underwriting discounts, commissions and direct offering expenses. In April 2019, the Company issued an additional 81,800 shares of Series A Preferred Stock to the underwriters related to their exercise of an option to purchase additional shares under the associated underwriting agreement, resulting in an additional $2.0 million in net proceeds, after underwriting discounts.
In June 2019 the Company issued 874,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock for net proceeds of $21.85 million.
In September 2019, the Company repurchased and subsequently retired those 874,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock at an aggregate cost of $21.85 million. There were no brokerage fees in connection with the transactions.
Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock, to the extent declared by the Company’s board, are payable quarterly at an annual rate of $1.75 per share through March 31, 2024. After such date, quarterly dividends will accrue and be payable at a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus a spread of 460.5 basis points per year. In the event that three-month LIBOR is less than zero, three-month LIBOR shall be deemed to be zero. The Company may redeem the Series A Preferred Stock at its option, subject to regulatory approval, on or after April 1, 2024, as described in the prospectus supplement relating to the offering filed with the SEC on March 22, 2019.
6% Preferred Stock. In August 2019 the Company issued 5,000,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of its 6.00% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Series B Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, without par value, and with a liquidation preference of $1,000.00 per share (equivalent to $25.00 per depositary share)(“Series B Preferred Stock”). After deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and direct offering expenses, the Company received total net proceeds of $120.8 million.
Dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock, to the extent declared by the Company’s board, are payable quarterly at an annual rate of $60.00 per share (equivalent to $1.50 per depositary share) through September 30, 2024. After such date, quarterly dividends will accrue and be payable at a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus a
spread of 456.9 basis points per year. In the event that three-month LIBOR is less than zero, three-month LIBOR shall be deemed to be zero. The Company may redeem the Series B Preferred Stock at its option, subject to regulatory approval, on or after October 1, 2024, as described in the prospectus supplement relating to the offering filed with the SEC on August 13, 2019.
8% Preferred Stock. The Company previously issued a total of 41,625 shares of 8% Non-Cumulative, Perpetual Preferred Stock, without par value, with a liquidation preference of $1,000.00 per share (“8% Preferred Stock”) in a private placement offering.
Dividends on the 8% Preferred Stock, to the extent declared by the Company’s board, are payable quarterly at an annual rate of $80.00 per share. As of December 31, 2020, the 8% Preferred Stock became redeemable by the Company at any time, subject to regulatory approval and upon at least 30 days’ prior notice to the holders thereof.
Common Shares/Dividends. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had 28,747,083 common shares issued and outstanding. In February 2021, the Board declared quarterly dividends at an annual rate of $0.36 per share.
Capital Adequacy. The following table presents the Company’s capital ratios. In 2020, the Company elected to use CBLR, whereas in 2019 the Company was required to maintain capital ratios under the Basel III, risk-based capital framework.

(1) As defined by regulatory agencies.
On November 13, 2019, the federal regulators finalized and adopted a regulatory capital rule establishing CBLR, which became effective on January 1, 2020. The intent of CBLR is to provide a simple alternative measure of capital adequacy for electing qualifying depository institutions and depository institution holding companies, as directed under the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act. Under CBLR, if a qualifying depository institution or depository institution holding company elects to use such measure, such institution or holding company will be considered well capitalized if its ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets (i.e., leverage ratio) exceeds 9%, subject to a limited two quarter grace period, during which the leverage ratio cannot go 100 basis points below the then applicable threshold, and will not be required to calculate and report risk-based capital ratios. Eligibility criteria to utilize CBLR includes the following:
● Total assets of less than $10 billion,
● Total trading assets plus liabilities of 5% or less of consolidated assets,
● Total off-balance sheet exposures of 25% or less of consolidated assets,
● Cannot be an advanced approaches banking organization, and
● Leverage ratio greater than 9%, or temporarily reduced threshold established in response to COVID-19.
In April 2020, under the CARES Act, the 9% leverage ratio threshold was temporarily reduced to 8% in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The threshold increased to 8.5% in 2021 and will return to 9% in 2022. The Company, Merchants Bank, and FMBI elected to begin using CBLR in the first quarter of 2020 and all intend to utilize this measure for the foreseeable future and thus will not calculate or report risk-based capital ratios.
On December 2, 2020 the FDIC issued an interim final rule related to COVID-19 as it pertains to eligibility to utilize CBLR. The rule allows organizations with less than $10 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2019, to use the assets on that date to determine the applicability of various regulatory asset thresholds during 2020 and 2021.
At December 31, 2020, the Company, Merchants Bank, and FMBI met all of the regulatory capital requirements with CBLR to be classified as well capitalized, and management is not aware of any conditions or events since the most recent regulatory notification that would change the Company’s, Merchants Bank’s, or FMBI’s category.
At December 31, 2020, the Company reported a CBLR (Tier 1 leverage) capital level of $792.5 million, or 8.6% of adjusted total assets, which is above the required level of $738.0 million, or 8.0%. Merchants Bank reported a Tier 1 leverage capital level of $781.2 million, or 8.7% of adjusted total assets, which is above the required level of $718.1 million, or 8.0%. FMBI reported a Tier 1 leverage capital level of $24.5 million, or 9.8% of adjusted total assets, which is above the required level of $20.0 million, or 8.0%.
Failure to exceed the leverage ratio threshold required under CBLR in the future, subject to any applicable grace period, would require the Company, Merchants Bank, and/or FMBI to return to the risk-based capital ratio thresholds previously utilized under the fully phased-in Basel III Capital Rules to determine capital adequacy.
Contractual obligations
The following table summarizes aggregated information about our outstanding contractual obligations and other long-term liabilities as of December 31, 2020. The payment amounts represent those amounts contractually due to the recipients.
Borrowings are fully described in Note 12 of the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Operating lease obligations are in place primarily for facilities and land on which banking facilities are located. See Note 24 of our Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 for additional information.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.
In the normal course of operations, we engage in a variety of financial transactions that, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, are not recorded in our financial statements. These transactions involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate and liquidity risk. Such transactions are used primarily to manage customers’ requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments, lines of credit and standby letters of credit.
For information about our loan commitments, unused lines of credit and standby letters of credit, see Note 24 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
We have not engaged in any other off-balance-sheet transactions in the normal course of our lending activities.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income and expenses. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions that we use are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations.
As an “emerging growth company” we may delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period until December 31, 2022, at the latest. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.
The following represent our critical accounting policies:
Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is the estimated amount considered necessary to cover inherent, but unconfirmed, credit losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses, which is included in net interest income. In determining the allowance for loan losses, management makes significant estimates and has identified this policy as one of our most critical accounting policies.
Management performs a quarterly evaluation of the allowance for loan losses. Consideration is given to a variety of factors in establishing this estimate including, but not limited to, current economic conditions, delinquency statistics, geographic and industry concentrations, the adequacy of the underlying collateral, the financial strength of the borrower, results of internal loan reviews and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change.
The analysis has two components, specific and general allowances. The specific allowance is for unconfirmed losses related to loans that are determined to be impaired. Impairment is measured by determining the present value of expected future cash flows or, for collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral, adjusted for market conditions and selling expenses. If the fair value of the loan is less than the loan’s carrying value, a specific reserve is established for the difference. The general allowance, which is for loans reviewed collectively, is determined by segregating the remaining loans by type of loan, risk weighting (if applicable) and payment history. We also analyze historical loss experience, delinquency trends, general economic conditions and geographic and industry concentrations. This analysis establishes historical loss percentages and qualitative factors that are applied to the loan groups to determine the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessary for loans that are reviewed collectively. The qualitative component is critical in determining the allowance for loan losses as certain trends may indicate the need for changes to the allowance for loan losses based on factors beyond the historical loss history. Not incorporating a qualitative component could misstate the allowance for loan losses. Actual loan losses may be significantly more than the allowances we have established which could result in a material negative effect on our financial results.
Mortgage Servicing Rights. Mortgage servicing assets are recognized separately when rights are acquired through purchase or through sale of financial assets. Servicing rights resulting from the sale or securitization of loans originated by us are initially measured at fair value at the date of transfer. We have elected to initially and subsequently measure the mortgage servicing rights for mortgage loans using the fair value method. Under the fair value method, the servicing rights are carried in the balance sheet at fair value and the changes in fair value are reported in earnings in the period in which the changes occur.
Fair value is based on market prices for comparable mortgage servicing contracts, when available, or alternatively, is based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. The valuation model is from an independent third party and it incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing cash flows, such as the cost to service, the discount rate, the custodial assets earnings rate, an inflation rate, ancillary income, prepayment speeds, prepayment penalties, and default rates and losses. We review the reasonableness of the assumptions and the methodology to ensure the estimated fair value complies with accounting standards generally accepted in the United States. These variables change from quarter to quarter as market conditions and projected interest rates change and may have an adverse impact on the value of the mortgage-servicing right and may result in a reduction to noninterest income.
Fair Value Measurements. The fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. We estimate the fair value of a financial instrument and any related asset impairment using a variety of valuation methods. Where financial instruments are actively traded and have quoted market prices, quoted market prices are used for fair value. When the financial instruments are not actively traded, other observable market inputs, such as quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, may be used, if available, to determine fair value. When observable market prices do not exist, we estimate fair value. These estimates are subjective in nature and imprecision in estimating
these factors can impact the amount of gain or loss recorded. A more detailed description of the fair values measured at each level of the fair value hierarchy and the methodology utilized by us can be found in Note 21 of our Consolidated Financial Statements “Disclosures About Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities.”
