ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth under “Risk Factors and Uncertainties” and elsewhere in this document. See “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” above.
Overview
We are an exploration company, using tried and proven methods to search for gold, silver, and other metals as become indicated, on properties located in the State of Nevada in the Western United States. Our significant properties consist of our Eureka Projects (Lookout Mountain, Windfall, Oswego and other targets) in the Battle Mountain - Eureka Trend located in the North-Central portion of the state, and the Seven Troughs Project, located in the Northwest portion of the state.
We raised funds to acquire and explore these properties through private placements of our common stock and warrants with investors, through debt placements, and through joint venture arrangements with other mining exploration and development companies in our business sector. Our business plans employ strategies to locate and analyze gold and silver properties to determine the existence, quantity and quality of mineral deposits and advance those deposits for the benefit of our shareholders. We may seek to develop those properties ourselves or engage larger mining companies to purchase, develop, joint venture and otherwise exploit the properties for the purpose of production of these discovered precious metals.
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, we accomplished the following:
1.We announced and closed two private placements of units of our equity for a total of approximately $4,476,000 cash;
2.We paid off approximately $250,000 of outstanding debt and the interest that accrued thereon;
3.We issued shares for exercise of warrants for a total of approximately $637,000;
4.We an Annual General Meeting of shareholders, wherein we reorganized the Board of Directors, and later added a qualified person to the Board, expanded the number of authorized shares, and increased the number of shares that can be issued under our share incentive plan;
5.We granted stock options to the Board members and to officers;
6.Drill results reported from FY 2020 exploration season: During early fiscal 2021, we announced drill results confirming new areas of high-grade gold inside the existing resource and to the east in the Water Well Zone.
7.Geophysics: Our team applied geophysics in conjunction with geologic mapping and 3D modeling to develop targets beyond the resource area for testing in the 2021 drill program. Zonge Geosciences, Inc. completed a CSAMT survey along four lines totaling 19 line-kilometers. The four survey lines transect six major target areas on the Eureka Project. These data are expected to provide enhanced insights into the alteration, structural geology, and stratigraphy of the rocks in three dimensions. After completing the CSAMT survey, Zonge also completed a new 25 line-kilometer IP survey focused on the Windfall target.
8.Geochemistry: We completed a soil geochemical survey across unsurveyed areas of the property. The survey began with an orientation survey to test sampling and analytical methodology over an area of known mineralization. Systematic sampling commenced after a period of training and completion of the orientation survey. Ultimately, the sampling team collected approximately 900 samples, mostly in the northeastern part of the claim block. The new sampling augments the existing geochemical coverage across the projected northern extensions of the three gold trends on the property. Samples were submitted to ALS Global Laboratory for analysis by state-of-the-art ultra-trace level technology, which is likely to yield much more robust and comprehensive data than seen in previous surveys. The soil geochemistry survey is expected to provide high-resolution data that will support future drill targeting.
9.Drilling: RC drilling commenced in mid-July 2021 and five holes (1,409 meters) were completed before the end of the fiscal year. Three of these holes were aimed at expanding the WWZ mineralization to the north, including the northernmost hole, which was collared more than 200 meters from previous high-grade intercepts. Two additional holes were drilled on the western side of the resource and farther southwest on a new exploration target. Subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, Timberline reported results of the first five holes drilled during 2021. Each of the three new drill holes in the Water Well Zone intersected a significant thickness of gold mineralization at the base of the Dunderberg Shale, where it was expected to occur. These results grew the WWZ appreciably, more than doubling the surface projection “footprint” of the gold mineralization.
Summary
Fiscal year 2021 has seen continuing strong trends in the gold price from a low of approximately $1,660 to a high of approximately $1,980 per ounce, with a trend moving around $1,780 per ounce at year end. We believe the global economic environment and monetary climate continue to favor a strong gold price for the foreseeable future. While volatility is to be expected, our expectation is that we can identify and pursue opportunities to advance our projects and take advantage of the current gold price and market volatility.
During fiscal year 2021, we executed on an additional financing that provided for the advancement of our flagship Eureka Project as well as improvements in our team and corporate infrastructure. At the time of this writing, we are still in the midst of reporting results from the fiscal year 2021 exploration program. The partial drill results and geophysical data already announced continue to indicate the potential for significant advancement of the project through expansion of known mineralization and emerging new target areas. We believe that our management and our board of directors have been strengthened during the year and that the team possesses the knowledge and experience to evaluate and take advantage of financing and strategic opportunities and to provide for the advancement of our several projects
Exploration Plans and Budgets
Our exploration focus during fiscal 2022 will continue to be on the Eureka Project. Our financial and human resources will be dedicated to the advancement of the Lookout Mountain, Water Well, Oswego, and other targets across the property. The results of our drilling, mapping, geochemical and geophysical work completed during Fiscal 2020, and especially Fiscal 2021, exploration seasons significantly advanced our understanding of the overall geologic setting of the Eureka Project,, highlighting several areas with potential for significant gold mineralization.
Our preliminary exploration budget for fiscal 2022 is expected to reach $3.0 million, funded largely by our cash reserves as we enter into the new calendar year. By the time the 2021 - 2022 drill program concludes, we expect to have completed approximately sixteen (16) new drill holes in the Water Well Zone (adjacent to the Lookout Mountain resource) and 8 new drill holes at the Oswego Target. At the time of this writing, exploration drilling continues at the Eureka Project and assay results are pending on all but 3 of the holes mentioned above. Timberline anticipates conducting additional drilling at the Water Well Zone, the Oswego Target, and the Windfall Trend. Details of the work plan for later in Fiscal 2022 will be based in part on the results yet to be received from the current drill program.

Our consolidated net loss for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 increased significantly from the prior year, primarily as a result of our increased exploration program, which included significant increases in drilling and geophysical activities. We also experienced significant increases in shared-based compensation costs and foreign exchange losses arising from our private placement priced in CDN$ measured against a strengthened USD$ exchange rate. These costs were offset by the non-cash costs in fiscal year 2020 related to the abandonment of the Elder Creek property and the nonrecurrence of a loss on extinguishment of debt. Professional fees expenses were higher as a result of increased utilization of legal professionals during fiscal 2021, largely related to the annual shareholders meeting. Salaries and benefits increased due to long-overdue increases to management salaries. General and administrative expenses increased as management executed on marketing, investor relations, and other programs that were not possible in previous years as placement funds became available to do so. Other expenses for fiscal 2021 were generally consistent with the prior year.
Financial Condition and Liquidity
At September 30, 2021, we had assets of $17,716,406, consisting of cash of $3,327,352; property, mineral rights and equipment, net of depreciation, of $13,821,085, reclamation bonds of $538,696, and other assets in the amount of $29,273.
On September 30, 2021, we had total liabilities of $570,144 and total assets of $17,716,406. This compares to total liabilities of $792,085 and total assets of $16,886,921 on September 30, 2020. As of September 30, 2021, our liabilities consist of $118,247 for asset retirement obligations, $270,991 of senior unsecured notes payable - related party, net of discount, and $176,761 of trade payables and accrued liabilities and $4,145 interest payable to a related party. Of these liabilities, $180,906 are due within 12 months. The decrease in liabilities compared to September 30, 2020 is largely due to payments on the senior unsecured note payable and the associated accrued interest - related party as we were able to apply funds raised during fiscal 2021. Other liabilities were affected positively or negatively by individual small changes in other components of liabilities. The increase in total current assets was due to an increase in cash as a result of a private placement shortly before the end of the fiscal year.
On September 30, 2021, we had working capital of $3,170,019 and stockholders’ equity of $17,146,262 compared to working capital of $2,155,400 and stockholders’ equity of $16,094,836 for the year ended September 30, 2020. Working capital experienced a favorable change because of an increase in cash from the private placement, reduced by payments against the accrued interest - related party, with other liabilities affected positively or negatively by individual small changes in other components of liabilities.
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, we used cash from operating activities of $4,263,754, compared to $1,606,489 used for fiscal 2020. There was a net loss of $4,707,815 for fiscal 2021 compared to a net loss of $3,377,091 for fiscal 2020. The causal factors are disclosed above in the comparative table and discussion above. At the end of fiscal 2021, we have accumulated approximately $50.9 million and $26.6 million in federal and state net operating losses, respectively, which may enable us to generate like amounts in net income prior to incurring any significant income tax obligation. Federal net operating losses of $44.8 million will expire in various amounts from 2024 through 2038, while $6.1 million do not expire. The state net operating loss will expire in fiscal years ending September 30, 2022 through September 30, 2041.
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, we used cash of $13,430 from investment activities, compared with cash provided by investment activities of $78,939 in fiscal 2020. During fiscal 2021, we paid $92,000 to purchase mineral properties, while receiving $78,570 for lease payments to us for company-owned mineral properties. During fiscal 2020, we paid $33,000 to purchase mineral properties, while receiving $110,487 for lease payments to us for company-owned mineral properties, $205,194 for advance from Lookout Mountain LLC and $29,770 of cash acquired upon obtaining control of Lookout Mountain LLC, and $233,512 to increase reclamation bonds.
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, cash of $5,083,810 was provided by financing activities, compared to cash of $4,017,519 provided during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, cash of $4,475,818 was provided through the sale of stock and warrants, net of offering costs, $637,001 was provided from exercise of warrants, reduced by $29,009 paid on debt. This compares to cash of $4,198,000 provided through the sale of stock and warrants, net of offering costs, $248,052 provided from exercise of warrants, reduced by $178,533 paid on the payment obligation and $250,000 paid on a senior unsecured note payable for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020.
Going Concern:
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis that the Company is a going concern, which contemplates the realization of our assets and the settlement of our liabilities in the normal course of our operations. Disruptions in the credit and financial markets over the past several years have had a material adverse impact on a number of financial institutions and investors and have limited access to capital and credit for many companies. In addition, commodity prices and mining equities have seen significant volatility which increases the risk to precious metal investors. Market disruptions and alternative investment options, among other things, make it more difficult for us to obtain, or increase our cost of obtaining, capital and financing for our operations. Our access to additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to obtain financing through equity investments, we will seek multiple solutions including, but not limited to, asset sales, corporate transactions, credit facilities or debenture issuances in order to continue as a going concern.
Prior to the close of fiscal 2021, we closed on a private placement of our common stock and warrants to generate $4,475,818 cash, a portion of which was used to reduce debt obligation of $250,000 together with interest thereon. At September 30, 2021, we had working capital of $3,170,019. We have $180,906 outstanding in current liabilities and a cash balance of $3,327,352. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have sufficient cash to meet our normal operating commitments for the next 12 months. Therefore, we do not expect to be required to engage in financial transactions to increase our cash balance or
decrease our cash obligations in the near term. However, we are an exploration company with exploration programs that require significant cash expenditures. A significant drilling program, such are those we have planned, can result in in depletion of cash and return us to a position of insufficient cash to support normal operations for the following 12 months. Such cash-raising efforts may include equity financings, corporate transactions, joint venture agreements, sales of assets, credit facilities or debenture issuances, or other strategic transactions.
The audit opinion and notes that accompany our consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2021 disclose a ‘going concern’ qualification to our ability to continue in business. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern. We have incurred losses since our inception. We do not have sufficient cash to fund normal operations and meet all of our obligations for the next 12 months without deferring payment on certain current liabilities and/or raising additional funds. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. We believe that the going concern condition cannot be removed with confidence until the Company has entered into a business climate where funding of its activities is more assured. If the going concern basis were not appropriate for these financial statements, adjustments would be necessary in the carrying value of assets and liabilities, the reported expenses and the balance sheet classifications used.
We plan, as funding allows, to follow up on our positive drill results on our Eureka and Paiute Projects. Principally, we plan to execute drilling as part of the ongoing exploration program at Eureka. Also, subject to available capital, we may continue prudent exploration programs on our material exploration properties and/or fund some exploratory activities on early-stage properties.
We will require additional funding and/or reductions in exploration and administrative expenditures in future periods. Given current economic conditions, we cannot provide assurance that necessary financing transactions will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Without additional financing, we would have to curtail our exploration and other expenditures while we seek alternative funding arrangements to provide sufficient capital to meet our ongoing, non-discretionary expenditures, and maintain our primary mineral properties. If we cannot obtain sufficient additional financing, we may be unable to make required property payments on a timely basis and be forced to return some or all of our leased or optioned properties to the underlying owners.
Financing activities
Private Placements:
On June 25, 2021, we closed on total subscriptions for a private placement offering for 23,070,798 Units of the Company at a price of $0.20 per Unit. Each Unit consisted of one share of our common stock and one-half common share purchase Series M Warrant (each whole such warrant a “Warrant”), with each Warrant exercisable to acquire an additional share of our common stock at a price of $0.30 per share until the Warrant expiration date of May 31, 2023. A total of 23,070,798 shares and 11,535,399 Warrants issued for net proceeds of $4,475,818 to us, net of $138,342 finders fees. In addition, 596,248 Series M Warrants were issued for finders fees.
The private placement offering was completed under Rule 506(b) of Regulation D promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, solely to persons who qualified as accredited investors. Subscribers who were resident in Canada were required to qualify as accredited investors under Canadian National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus Exemptions.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance-sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, liquidity, or capital expenditures.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a complete summary of the significant accounting policies used in the presentation of our financial statements. As described in Note 2, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. We believe that our most critical accounting estimates are related to asset impairments and asset retirement obligations.
Our critical accounting policies and estimates are as follows:
Asset Impairments
Significant property acquisition payments for active exploration properties and the fair value of equity instruments, including common shares and warrants, issued for properties are capitalized. The evaluation of our mineral properties for impairment is based on market conditions for minerals, underlying mineralized material associated with the properties, and future costs that may be required for ultimate realization through mining operations or by sale. If no mineable ore body is discovered, or market conditions for minerals deteriorate, there is the potential for a material adjustment to the value assigned to mineral properties.
We review the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. In cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment or abandonment loss is recognized equal to an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. The factors considered by management in performing this assessment include current operating results, trends and prospects, the manner in which the asset is used, and the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors.
Asset Retirement Obligations
We have an obligation to reclaim our properties after the surface has been disturbed by exploration methods at the site. As a result, we have recorded a liability for the fair value of the reclamation costs we expect to incur in association with our Eureka Property. We estimate applicable inflation and credit-adjusted risk-free rates, as well as expected reclamation time frames. To the extent that the estimated reclamation costs change, such changes will impact future reclamation expense recorded. A liability is recognized for the present value of estimated environmental remediation (asset retirement obligation) in the period in which the liability is incurred, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The offsetting balance is charged to the related long-lived asset. Adjustments are made to the liability for changes resulting from passage of time and changes to either the timing or amount of the original present value estimate underlying the obligation.
