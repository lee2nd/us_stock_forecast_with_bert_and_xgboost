ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” included below in this annual report on Form 10-K.
Overview
We are a biotechnology company that is focused primarily in the field of regenerative medicine. Our MultiStem cell therapy, a patented and proprietary allogeneic stem cell product, is our lead platform product and is currently in clinical development in several therapeutic and geographic areas. Our most advanced program is an ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of ischemic stroke. Our current clinical development programs are focused on treating neurological conditions, inflammatory and immune disorders, certain pulmonary conditions, cardiovascular disease and other conditions where the current standard of care is limited or inadequate for many patients, particularly in the critical care segment.
Current Programs
Our MultiStem cell therapy product development programs in the clinical development stage include the following:
•Ischemic Stroke: We are conducting a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of MultiStem cell therapy for the treatment of ischemic stroke, referred to as MASTERS-2. Our MASTERS-2 clinical trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to enroll 300 patients in North America, Europe and certain other international locations, who have suffered moderate to moderate-severe ischemic stroke. We initiated the study with a limited number of high-enrolling sites and are bringing on additional sites over time in line with clinical product supply and clinical operations objectives. Enrollment has been impacted at some clinical sites due to operational restrictions at the hospital sites, including hospital staff redeployment in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and supply constraints, which have hampered the initiation of new sites. Given the recent headwinds, we hope to complete enrollment of the trial in 2022. The MASTERS-2 study has received several regulatory distinctions including Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, designation, Fast Track designation and Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy, or RMAT, designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, as well as a Final Scientific Advice positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency, or EMA.
In addition, HEALIOS K.K., or Healios, has an ongoing clinical trial, TREASURE, evaluating the safety and efficacy of administration of MultiStem cell therapy for the treatment of ischemic stroke in Japan. TREASURE will be evaluated under the progressive regulatory framework for regenerative medicine therapies in Japan. Under the new framework, Healios’ ischemic stroke program has been awarded the Sakigake designation by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, or PMDA, which is designed to expedite regulatory review and approval and is analogous to Fast Track designation from the FDA. Healios has reported that current enrollment of patients in the clinical trial exceeds 90%. We look forward to the completion of both the MASTERS-2 and TREASURE trials and using the accelerated pathways to review and approval afforded to us by the regulators in the United States, Europe and Japan.
•ARDS: In January 2019 and January 2020, we announced summary results and one-year follow up results, respectively, from our exploratory clinical study of the intravenous administration of MultiStem cell therapy to treat patients who are suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS. The study results continue to demonstrate a predictable and favorable tolerability profile. Importantly, there were lower mortality and a greater number of ventilator-free and ICU-free days in the MultiStem-treated patient group compared to the placebo group. Average quality-of-life outcomes were higher in the MultiStem group compared to placebo through one year. In April 2020, the FDA authorized the initiation of a Phase 2/3 pivotal study to assess the safety and efficacy of MultiStem therapy in subjects with moderate to severe ARDS induced by COVID-19, or the MACOVIA study, and the first patients were enrolled in May 2020. In September 2020, MultiStem cell therapy received RMAT designation for the ARDS program. The MACOVIA study features an open-label lead-in followed by a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 portion, and the study is presently designed to enroll up to approximately 400 patients at leading pulmonary critical care centers throughout the United States. However, the scope and timing of our MACOVIA study may be adjusted depending on regulatory discussions and funding sources. Healios has initiated a clinical trial in Japan for patients with pneumonia-induced ARDS, which is referred to as the ONE-BRIDGE study. Current patient enrollment progress exceeds 90% of the target enrollment for the ONE-BRIDGE study. In April 2020, Healios announced the addition of a small cohort to examine the treatment of COVID-19-induced ARDS patients, and the small cohort has been fully enrolled.
•Trauma: In April 2020, the FDA authorized the initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating MultiStem cell therapy for the early treatment of traumatic injuries and the subsequent complications that result following severe
trauma. The trial is being conducted by The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, or UTHealth, at the Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center in Houston, Texas, one of the busiest Level 1 trauma centers in the United States. This study is being supported under a grant awarded to the McGovern Medical School at UTHealth from the Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium, and the Memorial Hermann Foundation is providing additional funding. We are providing the investigational clinical product for the trial as well as regulatory and operational support. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the pace of activity for the study since the trauma center also attends to COVID-19 patients; however, the site announced that enrollment commenced in December 2020.
We are engaged in preclinical development and evaluation of MultiStem cell therapy in other indications for human health, as well as certain indications in the animal health field, and we conduct such work both through our own internal research efforts and through a broad global network of collaborators. We also engage in discussions with third parties about collaborating in the development of MultiStem cell therapy for various programs and/or various geographic territories and may enter into one or more business partnerships to advance these programs over time. We may also elect to develop certain programs independently.
While the MultiStem product platform continues to advance, we are engaged in process development initiatives intended to increase manufacturing scale, reduce production costs and enhance process controls and product quality, among other things. These initiatives are being conducted both internally and outsourced to select contractors, and the related investments are meant to enable us to meet potential commercial demand in the event of eventual regulatory approval. Until such time as we are able to manufacture products ourselves in accordance with good manufacturing practices, we will continue to rely on third-party manufacturers to make our MultiStem product for clinical trials and eventual commercial sales. These third parties may not deliver sufficient quantities of our MultiStem product, manufacture MultiStem product in accordance with specifications, or comply with applicable government regulations. From time to time, such third-party manufacturers, or their material suppliers, may experience production delays, stoppages or interruptions in supply, which may affect the initiation, execution and timing of completion of our and our partners' clinical trials or commercial activities.
In addition to our manufacturing efforts, in other areas we are stepping up our planning and preparations for the potential commercialization of our MultiStem product candidate. We are advancing our strategies for market access and reimbursement, working with third-party experts to plan and undertake initiatives to position the product appropriately and effectively communicate to payors its value to them and patients. We are developing our go-to-market strategies, which could include third-party marketing partners in certain areas and the creation of a commercial sales force in other areas. We are also working with outside experts to develop proprietary solutions to the unique requirements related to the cell therapy supply chain and clinical site logistics. For example, working with an outside partner, we have been developing a proprietary cryogenic system designed to securely store and dispense our product in hospital pharmacies or other suitable clinical locations. Our intention is to be prepared to enable commercialization as soon as reasonably possible following potential successful completion of pivotal studies, application and approval by regulators.
We have a collaboration with Healios that covers MultiStem cell therapy for ischemic stroke and ARDS in Japan. The collaboration also includes the use of our technology for Healios’ organ bud program targeted to liver disease and other indications, as well as certain other rights, including a license for the use of our MultiStem product to treat certain ophthalmological indications and a license to treat diseases of the liver, kidney, pancreas and intestinal tissue through administration of our products in combination with induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPSC-derived cells. We provide product supply and manufacturing services to Healios, and in the event that we fail to perform our responsibilities to supply clinical trial product to Healios, then under certain circumstances, we may be required to grant Healios a license to make the product solely for use in its licensed fields and territories.
Financial
We have entered into a series of agreements with Healios, our collaborator in Japan and currently our largest stockholder. Under the collaboration that began in 2016, Healios is responsible for the development and commercialization of the MultiStem product for the licensed fields in the licensed territories, and we provide services to Healios for which we are compensated. Each license agreement with Healios has defined economic terms, and we may receive success-based milestone payments, some of which may be subject to credits. While there is no assurance that we will receive milestone proceeds under the Healios collaboration, any milestone payment we receive is non-refundable and non-creditable towards future royalties or any other payment due from Healios. Also, we are entitled to receive tiered royalties on net product sales, as defined in the license agreements.
In connection with an equity investment in us made by Healios in 2018, Healios had a warrant to purchase up to 4,000,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price equal to a reference price, as defined, but no less than $1.76 per share. In March 2020, Healios exercised the warrant in full at $1.76 per share and in April 2020 we received proceeds of approximately $7.0 million in accordance with the terms of the warrant.
We have had equity purchase agreements in place since 2011 with Aspire Capital Fund LLC, or Aspire Capital, that provide us the ability to sell shares to Aspire Capital from time-to-time. Currently we have an agreement with Aspire Capital that was entered into in November 2019, or the 2019 Equity Facility, and includes Aspire Capital's commitment to purchase up to an aggregate of $100.0 million of shares of our common stock over a defined timeframe. Our prior $100.0 million equity facility that was entered into in 2018, or the 2018 Equity Facility, was fully utilized and terminated during the first quarter of 2020. The terms of the 2019 Equity Facility are similar to the previous equity facilities with Aspire Capital, and we issued 350,000 shares of our common stock to Aspire Capital as a commitment fee in November 2019 and filed a registration statement for the resale of 31,000,000 shares of our common stock. The terms of this 2018 Equity Facility were similar to the previous equity facilities with Aspire Capital, and we issued 450,000 shares of our common stock to Aspire Capital as a commitment fee in February 2018 and we registered for the resale of 24,700,000 shares of our common stock. Also, in connection with the 2018 Equity Facility, Aspire Capital invested $1.0 million to purchase 500,000 shares of common stock at $2.00 per share.
During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we sold 11,425,000, 14,475,000 and 8,708,582 shares, respectively, to Aspire Capital at average prices of $1.67, $1.41 and $1.78 per share, respectively. In the first quarter of 2021 through March 19, 2021, we generated $26.6 million in proceeds from the use of our equity purchase arrangement.
Results of Operations
Since our inception, our revenues have consisted of license fees, contract revenues, royalties and milestone payments from our collaborators, and grant proceeds. We have not derived revenue from our commercial sale of therapeutic products to date since we are in clinical development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of external clinical and preclinical study fees, manufacturing and process development costs, salaries and related personnel costs, legal expenses resulting from intellectual property prosecution processes, facility costs, and laboratory supply and reagent costs. We expense research and development costs as they are incurred. We expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development to enhance our technologies, advance clinical trials of our product candidates, expand our regulatory affairs and product development capabilities, conduct preclinical studies of our product, manufacture our product candidates and prepare for potential commercialization of our MultiStem cell therapy product. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs, professional fees and other corporate expenses. We expect to continue to incur substantial losses through at least the next several years.
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019
Revenues. Revenues decreased to $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $5.6 million in 2019. Contract revenues from our collaboration with Healios decreased $4.1 million period-over-period. Grant revenue decreased by $0.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the completion of grant-funded projects. Our collaboration revenues fluctuate from period-to-period based on new licenses conferred and the delivery of goods and services under our arrangement with Healios. We expect our collaboration revenues to vary over time as we contract with Healios to perform manufacturing services and as we potentially enter into new collaborations.
Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses increased to $63.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $39.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in research and development expenses year-over-year of $24.0 million related primarily to increased clinical trial, manufacturing and process development costs of $15.0 million, internal research supply costs of $4.2 million, personnel costs of $3.0 million, including stock-based compensation, outside service costs of $0.9 million and other costs of $0.9 million. Based on our current clinical development, manufacturing, process development and regulatory affairs plans, we expect our 2021 annual research and development expenses to be higher compared to 2020, and such costs will vary over time based on clinical manufacturing campaigns, the timing and stage of clinical trials underway, manufacturing process development projects and regulatory initiatives. These variations in activity level may also impact our accounts payable, accrued expenses and prepaid expenses balances from period-to-period. Other than external expenses for our clinical and preclinical programs, we do not track our research expenses by project; rather, we track such expenses by the type of cost incurred.
General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased to $15.9 million in 2020 from $11.4 million in 2019. The $4.5 million increase was due primarily to increases in personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, legal and professional services and other outside services. We expect our general and administrative expenses will increase in 2021.
Depreciation. Depreciation expense increased to $0.9 million in 2020 from $0.7 million in 2019 due to additional equipment being placed in service.
Other (Expense) Income, net. Other expense, net, for the year ended December 31, 2020 was ($0.4) million, and other income, net, was $0.9 million for 2019, and was comprised of interest income and expense and foreign currency gains and losses.
Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018
See the Management Discussion and Analysis section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for a discussion of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our sources of liquidity include our cash balances. At December 31, 2020, we had $51.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, and at March 19, 2021, we had $61.5 million in cash and cash equivalents. We have primarily financed our operations through business collaborations, grant funding and equity financings, including through our equity facility. The COVID-19 pandemic could negatively impact our ability to access financing sources on the same or reasonably similar terms as were available to us before the pandemic. We conduct all of our operations through our subsidiary, ABT Holding Company. Consequently, our ability to fund our operations depends on ABT Holding Company’s financial condition and its ability to make dividend payments or other cash distributions to us. There are no restrictions such as government regulations or material contractual arrangements that restrict the ability of ABT Holding Company to make dividend and other payments to us.
We incurred losses since inception of operations in 1995 and had an accumulated deficit of $496.4 million at December 31, 2020. Our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development, clinical and preclinical product development, manufacturing and process development, acquisition and licensing costs, and general and administrative costs associated with our operations.
We use all of our sources of capital to develop our technologies, to discover and develop therapeutic product candidates, to prepare for potential commercialization of our product candidates, develop business collaborations and to potentially acquire certain technologies and assets.
In April 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering of common stock, generating gross proceeds of approximately $57.6 million and net proceeds of approximately $53.7 million through the issuance of 25,587,500 shares of common stock at an offering price of $2.25 per share.
In connection with an equity investment in us made by Healios in 2018, Healios had a warrant to purchase up to 4,000,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price equal to a reference price, as defined, but not less than $1.76 per share. In March 2020, Healios exercised the warrant in full at $1.76 per share, and in April 2020, we received proceeds of approximately $7.0 million in accordance with the terms of the warrant.
In 2018, we entered into an investor rights agreement, or the Investor Rights Agreement, with Healios that governs certain of our and Healios’ rights relating to its ownership of our common stock. Under the Investor Rights Agreement, Healios is permitted to participate in certain equity issuances as a means to maintain its proportionate ownership of our common stock as of the time of such issuance. In May 2020, we entered into a purchase agreement with Healios, providing for Healios to purchase shares of our common stock in connection with certain equity issuances to Aspire Capital. In May 2020, we sold Healios 310,526 shares of our common stock at $1.72 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $534,105, in accordance with the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement.
We have had equity purchase agreements in place with Aspire Capital since 2011 that provide us the ability to sell shares to Aspire Capital from time to time. Currently, we are party to the 2019 Equity Facility which includes Aspire Capital's commitment to purchase up to an aggregate of $100.0 million of shares of our common stock over a defined timeframe. The 2018 Equity Facility was fully utilized and terminated during the first quarter of 2020. The terms of the 2019 Equity Facility are similar to the previous equity purchase agreements, and we issued 350,000 shares of our common stock to Aspire Capital as a commitment fee in November 2019 and filed a registration statement for the resale of 31,000,000 shares of our common stock in connection with the equity facility. The 2018 Equity Facility provided us with the ability to sell shares to Aspire Capital up to $100.0 million in aggregate. The terms of the 2018 Equity Facility were similar to the previous equity facilities with Aspire Capital, and we issued 450,000 shares of our common stock to Aspire Capital as a commitment fee in 2018 and registered for resale of 24,700,000 shares of our common stock. Also in connection with the 2018 Equity Facility, Aspire Capital invested $1.0 million to purchase 500,000 shares of our common stock at $2.00 per share.
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we sold 11,425,000 and 14,475,000 shares, respectively, to Aspire Capital at average prices of $1.67 and $1.41 per share, respectively.
We filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, that was declared effective in January 2020 and allowed for the sale of equity securities up to $100.0 million over a three-year period. Following our underwritten public offering in April 2020, this shelf registration statement was replaced by a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that was declared effective in June 2020 and allowed for the sale 35,000,000 shares of our common stock over a three-year period, which is fully available to us. Whether we sell securities under the registration statement will depend on a
number of factors, including the market conditions at that time, our cash position at that time and the availability and terms of alternative sources of capital.
By the end of the first quarter of 2019, we had received all of the upfront and quarterly installment payments in connection with the June 2018 expansion of our collaboration with Healios. We are also entitled to receive potential milestones payments, subject to certain credits, and royalties from Healios under our licensed programs. We receive payments from Healios for clinical product supply and other manufacturing-related services, and are negotiating the terms for potential commercial product supply. Certain proceeds from Healios may be used by Healios to offset milestone payments that may become due in the future.
We will require substantial additional funding in order to continue our research and product development programs, including clinical trials of our product candidates and process development and manufacturing projects, and to prepare for possible regulatory approval and commercial activities. At December 31, 2020, we had available cash and cash equivalents of $51.5 million, and at March 19, 2021, we had $61.5 million in cash and cash equivalents. We intend to meet our short-term liquidity needs with available cash, including available proceeds from our existing equity facility, potential delays in certain non-core programs, and our ability to defer certain spending. Furthermore, we are actively pursuing new collaborative opportunities and other potential sources of funding, which could reduce the current level of usage of our equity facility and potentially accelerate certain costs. If sufficient capital is available, we would plan to accelerate our clinical activity and preparation for regulatory application, approval and commercialization, including commercial manufacturing.
Importantly, we are approaching near-term milestones, including the results of Healios’ two clinical trials, followed by the results of our MASTERS-2 clinical trial, which we would expect to have a significant impact, favorable or unfavorable, on our ability to access capital from potential third-party commercial partners or the equity capital markets, for example. Depending on the outcome of these milestones, we may accelerate or may delay certain programs. In the longer term, we will have to continue to generate additional capital to meet our needs until we would become cash flow positive as a result of the sales of our clinical products, if they are approved for marketing. Such capital would come from new and existing collaborations and the related license fees, milestones and potential royalties, the sale of equity securities from time to time including through our equity facility, grant-funding opportunities, deferral of certain discretionary costs and the staging of certain development costs, as needed.
Additionally, we may raise capital from time to time through our equity purchase arrangement with Aspire, subject to its volume and price limitations and equity offerings. In the first quarter of 2021 through March 19, 2021, we generated an additional $26.6 million in proceeds from the use of our equity purchase arrangement, and we have 12,205,000 shares remaining for future issuance under the current registration statement. We also manage our cash by deferring certain discretionary costs and staging certain development costs to extend our operational runway, as needed. Over time, we may consider borrowing from financing institutions or royalty financing arrangements.
Our capital requirements over time depend on a number of factors, including progress in our clinical development programs, preparing for potential commercialization of our product candidates, potential product launch, our clinical and preclinical pipeline of additional opportunities and their stage of development, additional external costs such as payments to contract research organizations and contract manufacturing organizations, additional personnel costs and the costs in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing patent claims. Furthermore, delays in product supply for our and Healios’ clinical trials may impact the timing and cost of such studies, and delays in product supply following Healios’ potential product launch may impact the timing of royalties that we may receive. The availability of funds impacts our ability to advance multiple clinical programs concurrently, and any shortfall in funding could result in our having to delay or curtail research and development efforts. Further, these requirements may change at any time due to technological advances, business development activity or competition from other companies. We cannot assure you that adequate funding will be available to us or, if available, that it will be available on acceptable terms.
We expect to continue to incur substantial losses through at least the next several years and may incur losses in subsequent periods, and our ability to commercialize our product candidates is uncertain. The amount and timing of our future losses are highly uncertain. Our ability to achieve and thereafter sustain profitability will be dependent upon, among other things, successfully developing, commercializing and obtaining regulatory approval or clearances for our technologies and products resulting from these technologies.
Cash Flow Analysis
Net cash used in operating activities was $61.8 million, $35.3 million and $13.4 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and represented the use of cash to fund operations, clinical trials, preclinical research and process development activities; net of receipts from collaborative arrangements such as Healios. Net cash used in operating activities may fluctuate significantly period-to-period, as it has over the past several years, primarily due to the receipt of collaboration fees and payment of specific clinical trial costs, such as clinical manufacturing campaigns, contract research organization costs and manufacturing process development projects. These variations in activity level may also impact our accounts payable, accrued expenses and prepaid expenses balances from period-to-period.
Net cash used in investing activities was $1.2 million, $0.6 million and $0.9 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to the purchase of equipment for our manufacturing and process development activities, which was partially offset by insurance proceeds received in 2018. We expect that our capital equipment expenditures will increase in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily to support our manufacturing and manufacturing process development needs.
Financing activities provided net cash of $79.5 million in 2020, $19.9 million in 2019, and $36.0 million in 2018. In April 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering of common stock, generating net proceeds of approximately $53.7 million million, and Healios exercised its warrant for which we received proceeds of $7.0 million. In May 2020, we also received $0.5 million from Healios from the issuance of our common stock related to its participation right under the Investor Rights Agreement. In 2018, Healios invested $21.1 million in our common stock and a warrant. Additional proceeds relate to our equity sales to Aspire Capital in each of the three years, net of shares of common stock retained in exchange for withholding tax payments on share-based awards.
Critical Accounting Policies and Management Estimates
The SEC defines critical accounting policies as those that are, in management’s view, important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operation and demanding of management’s judgment. Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates on experience and on various assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
Refer to Note B to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards.
