Our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes the following sections:
•
Overview that discusses our business and some of the relevant trends.
•
Results of Operations that includes a detailed discussion of our revenue and expenses.
•
Liquidity and Capital Resources which discusses key aspects of our statements of cash flows, changes in our financial position and our financial commitments.
•
Significant changes since our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K in the Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments underlying our financial statements.
Overview
Plus Therapeutics is committed to developing and delivering innovative treatments for rare and difficult to treat cancers, with a focus on cancers of the central nervous system. Plus Therapeutics’ mission is to transform the clinical care of cancer patients through its innovative drugs that have the potential to improve survival and quality of life.
Plus has a nanoscale drug development platform and the requisite expertise to innovate and produce new and better therapeutics for rare cancers. We believe that this approach will produce investigational drugs that provide unique benefits such as improved mechanism of action, better tumor targeting, improved pharmacokinetics and higher treatment doses to the tumor. Benefits such as these may then improve the overall efficacy of drugs while reducing the side effects associated with more traditional drug delivery methods. To support this goal, Plus Therapeutics has an established, GMP-validated nanoscale drug R&D and commercial scale manufacturing facility in San Antonio, TX. This facility is ideally suited to produce nanoliposomal drug candidates for research, development, clinical and commercial use.
As part of our strategy to leverage our nanotechnology platform and expertise, we use a simple multi-step model that management believes allows Plus to best address unmet market needs or underserved medical conditions while managing risks and minimizing development costs. This model includes: (1) market landscape mapping, (2) internal drug redesign, (3) in house drug manufacturing, (4) performance of critical non-clinical (i.e. bench, animal) analyses, (5) scale-up manufacturing for commercial purposes and performance of early-stage clinical trials, and (6) partnering for late-stage clinical trials, regulatory approval, and, ultimately, commercial launch.
Pipeline
Plus Therapeutics currently has four investigational drugs, three of which are at the clinical stage for rare and difficult to treat cancers. The three clinical stage drugs in our pipeline are:
1)
Rhenium NanoLiposomes (RNL™), a patented radiotherapy for patients with recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM) that is currently being evaluated in the U.S. NCI-supported, multi-center ReSPECT™ Phase 1 dose-finding clinical trial;
2)
DocePLUS™, a patented chemotherapy for patients with solid tumors that has been evaluated in a completed U.S. single-center Phase 1 clinical trial; and
3)
DoxoPLUS™, a generic chemotherapy that has been evaluated in a completed, bioequivalence clinical trial in the U.S., Canada, and Ukraine versus Janssen’s CAELYX® in patients with ovarian cancer.
In addition, Plus has an early preclinical investigational drug which is a proprietary combination of Rhenium Nanpoliposomes and liposomal doxorubicin. Theoretically, this combination could provide a synergistic combination of both chemotherapy and radiation in a single treatment.
Current business activities related to both DocePLUS and DoxoPLUS are focused on identification of potential partners for these two drugs.
Plus’ RNL™ technology was a key part of the licensed radiotherapeutic portfolio that we acquired from NanoTx, Corp. (“NanoTx”) on May 7, 2020. The licensed radiolabeled nanoliposome platform can be applied toward several cancer targets and was developed by a multi-institutional consortium based in Texas at the Mays Cancer Center / UT Health San Antonio MD Anderson Cancer Center now led by Dr. Andrew Brenner, MD, PhD, who is the Kolitz Chair in Neuro-Oncology Research and Co-Leader of the Experimental and Developmental Therapeutics Program. The licensed technology was previously funded by both the National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute (NIH/NCI) and the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT). Dr.
Brenner’s RNL research program has an active $3M award from NIH/NCI which will financially support the continued clinical development of RNL for recurrent glioblastoma through the completion of a Phase 2 clinical trial and enrollment of up to 55 patients.
Plus Therapeutics’ lead investigational drug, RNL™, is a novel injectable radiotherapy designed to deliver targeted high dose radiation directly into a brain tumor in a safe, effective, and convenient manner to optimize patient outcomes. RNL™, which is composed of radionuclide Rhenium-186 (186Re) and a nanoliposomal carrier, is infused directly into the brain tumor via precision brain mapping and convection enhanced delivery. The RNL radiation dose delivered to patients may be up to 15-20x greater than what is possible with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). Some additional potential benefits of RNL compared to EBRT include:
-
RNL can be visualized in real-time during administration, possibly giving doctors better control of radiation dosing and distribution.
-
Potentially more effectively treats the bulk tumor and microscopic disease in surrounding healthy tissue.
-
Using a small catheter, RNL is infused directly into the targeted tumor, which may reduce radiation exposure to healthy cells. By contrast, EBRT is less targeted and selective.
-
RNL is given during a single 3- to 4-day in-patient hospital visit, while EBRT requires out-patient visits 5 days a week for approximately 6 weeks.
Recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) affects approximately 12,000 patients annually in the U.S. and is the most common and lethal form of brain cancer. The average life expectancy with glioblastoma is less than 24 months, with a one-year survival rate of 40.8% and a five-year survival rate of only 6.8%. GBM can cause headaches, seizures, vision changes and other neurological complications. Despite the best available medical treatments to eliminate the initial brain tumor, some microscopic disease frequently remains, with tumor regrowth within months. In fact, approximately 90% of patients experience tumor recurrence. This tumor type is incredibly difficult to remove completely, and often is resistant or quickly develops resistance to most available therapies. The treatment of GBM remains a significant challenge and it has been nearly a decade since the FDA approved a new therapy for this disease. There is no clear standard of care for recurrent GBM and even the few currently approved treatments, in aggregate, provide only marginal survival benefit. Current approved therapies are associated with significant side effects, which limit dosing and prolonged use.
By infusing the RNL™ drug directly into the tumor, bypassing the blood-brain barrier, normal brain and external tissues may be spared from radiation damage. We believe that radiation in the form of high energy electrons may be effective against glioblastoma if an adequate dose can be effectively delivered. For comparison, current EBRT protocols for recurrent glioblastoma typically recommend a total maximum dose of about 35 Gy. In contrast, the most recently dosed patient with RNL in our clinical trial received over 500 Gy without significant adverse effects to-date.
RNL is currently being evaluated for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma in the Phase 1 multi-center ReSPECT™ dose-finding clinical trial. ReSPECT is evaluating the safety, tolerability, and distribution of RNL for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma. Thus far, RNL has demonstrated early potential efficacy signals in patients with adequate dosing and tumor coverage with two patients surviving more than 30 months, compared to a median survival of approximately 9 months with the current standard of care. The sixth dose escalation cohort of this trial has been completed, which increased the RNL drug volume to 8.8 milliliters and radiation dose to 22.3 millicuries. The increased treatment volume in the sixth cohort will allow treatment of tumors up to approximately 4.5 cm in size, which may include the majority of glioblastoma tumors that appear in the recurrent setting. No treatment-related SAEs have been observed thus far. ReSPECT is supported by an award from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH).
In September 2020, the FDA granted both Orphan Drug designation and Fast Track designation to RNL for the treatment of patients with glioblastoma.
Based on substantial preclinical work completed and published, RNL is thought to have potential clinical benefits in other difficult to treat cancers such as leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, peritoneal carcinomatosis, recurrent head and neck cancer, and pediatric brain cancer.
Recent Developments
Piramal Master Services Agreement
On January 8, 2021, we entered into a Master Services Agreement (the “MSA”) with Piramal Pharma Solutions, Inc. (“Piramal”), for Piramal to perform certain services related to the development, manufacture, and supply of our RNL-Liposome Intermediate Drug Product. The MSA includes the transfer of analytical methods, development of microbiological methods, process transfer and optimization, intermediate drug product manufacturing, and stability studies for us. The transfer will be performed at
Piramal’s facility located in Lexington, Kentucky. The parties contemplate that the MSA will lead to clinical and commercial supply agreements between us and Piramal.
The MSA has a term of five years and will automatically renew for successive one-year terms unless either party notifies the other no later than six months prior to the original term or any additional terms of its intention to not renew the MSA. We have the right to terminate the MSA for convenience upon thirty days’ prior written notice. Either party may terminate the MSA upon an uncured material breach by the other party or upon the bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party.
Clinical Trials
In December 2020, we completed the sixth cohort of our National Cancer Institute (NCI)-supported, multi-center ReSPECT™ Phase 1 dose-finding clinical trial evaluating Rhenium NanoLiposomes (RNL™) for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma (GBM). The sixth cohort of the ReSPECT trial included an increase in both the RNL drug volume and radiation dose to 8.8 milliliters and 22.3 millicuries, respectively. RNL is designed to safely, effectively and conveniently deliver a very high dose of radiation, with a dose that is up to 25 times greater than currently used external beam radiation therapy, directly into the brain tumor for maximum effect. In addition, in December 2020, we started using University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center as an active clinical trial site in our ongoing ReSPECT™ Phase 1 clinical trial, currently supported by the National Cancer Institute (NCI).
Recent Financings
At-the-Market Transaction
On October 23, 2020, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the “Distribution Agreement”) with Canaccord Genuity LLC (“Canaccord”), pursuant to which we may issue and sell, from time to time, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $10,000,000 (the “ATM Shares”), depending on market demand, with Canaccord acting as an agent for sales. Sales of the ATM Shares may be made by any method permitted by law deemed to be an “at the market offering” as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), including, without limitation, sales made directly on or through the NASDAQ Capital Market. Canaccord will use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell the ATM Shares we request to be sold on our behalf, consistent with Canaccord’s normal trading and sales practices, under the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Distribution Agreement. We have no obligation to sell any of the ATM Shares. We may instruct Canaccord not to sell the ATM Shares if the sales cannot be effected at or above the price we designate from time to time and we may at any time suspend sales pursuant to the Distribution Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued 1,616,331 shares under the Distribution Agreement for net proceeds of approximately $3.2 million. During 2021 and through the date of filing of this Form 10-K, the Company issued 536,070 shares under the Distribution Agreement for net proceeds of $1.5 million.
Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement
On September 30, 2020, we entered into a purchase agreement (the “2020 Purchase Agreement”) and registration rights agreement pursuant to which Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (“Lincoln Park”) has committed to purchase up to $25.0 million of our common stock. Under the terms and subject to the conditions of the 2020 Purchase Agreement, we have the right, but not the obligation, to sell to Lincoln Park, and Lincoln Park is obligated to purchase up to $25.0 million of our common stock. Such sales of common stock by us, if any, will be subject to certain limitations, and may occur from time to time, at our sole discretion, over the 36-month period commencing November 6, 2020, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The number of shares we may sell to Lincoln Park on any single business day in a regular purchase is 50,000, but that amount may be increased up to 100,000 shares, depending upon the market price of our common stock at the time of sale and subject to a maximum limit of $500,000 per regular purchase. The purchase price per share for each such regular purchase will be based on prevailing market prices of our common stock immediately preceding the time of sale as computed under the 2020 Purchase Agreement. In addition to regular purchases, we may also direct Lincoln Park to purchase other amounts as accelerated purchases or as additional accelerated purchases if the closing sale price of the common stock exceeds certain threshold prices as set forth in the 2020 Purchase Agreement. We issued 180,701 shares of common stock to Lincoln Park as a commitment fee in connection with entering into the 2020 Purchase Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued 353,113 shares, excluding 180,701 shares issued as commitment fee, under the 2020 Purchase Agreement for net proceeds of approximately $0.7 million. During 2021 and through the date of filing of this Form 10-K, we issued 985,186 shares of our common stock under the 2020 Purchase Agreement for total proceeds of $2.9 million.
Recent Exercise of Warrants
In February 2021, certain warrant holders exercised warrants to purchase 896,500 shares of our common stock for total exercise proceeds of $2.0 million.
COVID-19 Impact
A novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. COVID-19 has presented substantial public health and economic challenges and is affecting economies, financial markets, and business operations around the world. International and U.S. governmental authorities in impacted regions have taken action in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19, including issuing varying forms of “stay-at-home” orders, and restricting business functions outside of one’s home. In response, we have put restrictions on employee travel and working from our executive offices with many employees continuing their work remotely. While we have implemented additional health and safety precautions and protocols in response to the pandemic and government guidelines, we have not experienced a significant impact on our business and operations. However, we may experience disruptions that could adversely impact our business operations as well as our preclinical studies and clinical trials. We are currently continuing the clinical trials we have underway in sites across the U.S., and we expect that COVID-19 precautions may directly or indirectly impact the timeline for some of our clinical trials. Some of our clinical trial sites, including those located in areas severely impacted by the pandemic, have placed new patient enrollment into clinical trials on hold or, for patients traveling from out-of-state, have implemented a 14-day self-quarantine before appointments. In addition, some clinical trial sites have imposed limited accessibility to conduct clinical monitoring and training on-site. We considered the impacts of COVID-19 on the assumptions and estimates used to prepare our financial statements and determined that there were no material adverse impacts on our results of operations and financial position at December 31, 2020.
The full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve as of the date of this report. For example, as certain states and regions across the United States have relaxed various restrictions on businesses and other activities, it is uncertain whether and to what extent federal, state, or local governments may reinstate additional restrictions and safety protocols in response to any increases in COVID-19 cases. Although there are vaccines available, the ability to obtain a vaccine or know when herd immunity will be met, is difficult to anticipate As such, it is uncertain as to the full magnitude that the pandemic will have on our operations, including our preclinical studies and clinical trials, financial condition, liquidity, and future results of operations. Management is actively monitoring the global situation and its impact on our clinical program and timeline, financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, industry, and workforce. We continue to evaluate the extent to which delays as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our ability to manufacture our product candidates for our clinical trials and conduct other research and development operations and maintain applicable timelines. Given the daily evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak and the global responses to curb its spread, we are not able to estimate the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity for fiscal year 2020.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) was signed into law on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act, among other things, includes tax provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of employer’s social security payments, net operating loss utilization and carryback periods, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property (QIP). The CARES Act had no material impact on our income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2020. We continue to evaluate the impact of the CARES Act on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
Results of Operations
Development revenue
We recognized a total of $0.3 million in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, as well as $0.3 million in qualified expenditures for those periods. Our BARDA contract was terminated in December 2019 and the contract close out process was completed during 2020, and we do not expect additional BARDA revenue in the future.
Development revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $7.0 million, which included $4.6 million of revenue recognized under the BARDA contract based on finalization of the indirect cost rates during fiscal years 2012 through 2019.
Research and development expenses
Research and development expenses include costs associated with the design, development, testing, and enhancement of our product candidates, payment of regulatory fees, laboratory supplies, pre-clinical studies, and clinical studies.
The following table summarizes the components of our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):
The decrease in research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 is due primarily to decreased professional services as a result of discontinuing manufacturing subsequent to sale of our former cell therapy business, as well as reduction in research and development expenses related to Doceplus and Doxoplus.
We expect aggregate research and development expenditures to increase in absolute dollars during 2021 due to the expected costs of development of the RNL™ therapy acquired from NanoTx.
In process research and development acquired from NanoTx
In process research and development acquired from NanoTx in the amount of $781,000 represents the upfront cash payment and fair value of 230,769 shares of common stock, with fair value of $1.65 per share, issued to NanoTx in accordance with the terms of the License Agreement.
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses include costs for administrative personnel, legal and other professional expenses, and general corporate expenses. The following table summarizes the general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):
General and administrative expenses increased by $1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019 due to increase of legal and professional fees in the year ended December 31, 2020.
We expect general and administrative expenditures to remain generally consistent in 2021 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2020.
Share-based compensation expenses
Share-based compensation expenses include charges related to options and restricted stock awards issued to employees, directors and non-employees. We measure stock-based compensation expenses based on the grant-date fair value of any awards granted to our employees. Such expense is recognized over the requisite service period.
The following table summarizes the components of our share-based compensation expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):
On June 16, 2020, our stockholders approved the 2020 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2020 Plan”). The 2020 Plan replaced our 2014 Equity Incentive Plan. Pursuant to the 2020 Plan, we reserved for issuance 550,000 shares of our common stock for future awards, and granted 444,000 options to our employees, directors, and, as appropriate, to non-employee service providers. In addition, previously-granted options will continue to vest in accordance with their original terms. As of December 31, 2020, the total
compensation cost related to non-vested stock options and stock awards not yet recognized for all our plans is approximately $704,000 which is expected to be recognized as a result of vesting under service conditions over a weighted average period of 2.81 years.
Financing items
The following table summarizes interest income, interest expense, and other income and expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):
The decrease in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 was primarily due to the repayments of debt principal of $3.1 million 2019 and $5.0 million in 2020. The changes in fair value of our warrant liabilities are primarily due to fluctuations in the valuation inputs for the warrants. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein for disclosure and discussion of our warrant liabilities.
We expect interest expense in 2021 to decrease as compared with 2020 due to principal repayment of $5.0 million on April 1, 2020. In April, June, July and September 2020, we entered into revised warrant agreements with the holders of 3,447,500 Series U warrants and in September 2020, we entered into revised warrant agreements for 75,000 of Representative Warrants (defined below). In return for reducing the strike price of the warrants, the warrant holders agreed to amend the settlement provisions upon fundamental transactions. The amended Series U warrants meet the requirements for equity classification under authoritative accounting guidance and are no longer subject to fair value accounting post amendment.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Short-term and long-term liquidity
The following is a summary of our key liquidity measures (for continuing operations) at December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):
To date, these operating losses have been funded primarily from outside sources of invested capital in our common stock, proceeds raised from the Loan and Security Agreement, and gross profits. We have had, and we will continue to have, an ongoing need to raise additional cash from outside sources to fund our future clinical development programs and other operations. Our inability to raise additional cash would have a material and adverse impact on operations and would cause us to default on our loan.
On October 23, 2020, we entered into the Distribution Agreement with Canaccord, pursuant to which we may issue and sell, from time to time, ATM Shares, depending on market demand, with Canaccord acting as an agent for sales. Sales of the ATM Shares may be made by any method permitted by law deemed to be an “at the market offering” as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), including, without limitation, sales made directly on or through the NASDAQ Capital Market. Canaccord will use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell the ATM Shares we request to be sold on our behalf, consistent with Canaccord’s normal trading and sales practices, under the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Distribution Agreement. We have no obligation to sell any of the ATM Shares. We may instruct Canaccord not to sell the ATM Shares if the sales cannot be effected at or above the price we designate from time to time and we may at any time suspend sales pursuant to the Distribution Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued 1,616,331 shares under the Distribution Agreement for net proceeds of approximately $3.2 million. During 2021 and through the date of filing of this Form 10-K, the Company issued 536,070 shares under the Distribution Agreement for net proceeds of $1.5 million.
On September 30, 2020, we entered into the 2020 Purchase Agreement and a registration rights agreement with Lincoln Park, pursuant to which Lincoln Park committed to purchase up to $25.0 million of our common stock. Under the terms and subject to the conditions of the 2020 Purchase Agreement, we have the right, but not the obligation, to sell to Lincoln Park, and Lincoln Park is obligated to purchase up to $25.0 million of our common stock. Such sales of common stock by us, if any, will be subject to certain limitations, and may occur from time to time, at our sole discretion, over the 36-month period commencing November 6, 2020, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. The net proceeds under the 2020 Purchase Agreement will depend on the frequency and prices at which we sell shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park. We expect that any proceeds received from such sales to Lincoln Park will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued 353,113 shares, excluding 180,701 shares issued as commitment fee, under the 2020 Purchase Agreement for net proceeds of approximately $0.7 million. During 2021 and through the date of filing of this Form 10-K, we issued 985,186 shares of our common stock under the 2020 Purchase Agreement for total proceeds of $2.9 million.
On March 29, 2020, we entered into the Ninth Amendment, pursuant to which, among other things, Oxford agreed to defer the start date of principal repayment from May 1, 2020 to May 1, 2021. In addition, on April 1, 2020, we made a $5.0 million paydown of principal upon execution of the Ninth Amendment. As a result of this Ninth Amendment, the term of the Term Loan has been extended from September 1, 2021 to September 1, 2024, with all other major terms remained consistent.
In September 2019, we finalized the indirect cost rate under the BARDA Agreement for indirect costs incurred during the years 2012 through 2019, which resulted in approximately $4.6 million of revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019. The BARDA contract was terminated in December 2019 and the contract close out process was completed during the year ended December 31, 2020.
In September 2019, we entered into an underwriting agreement with H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC (the “Representative”), as representative of the underwriters (the “Underwriters”), pursuant to which we sold in an underwritten public offering an aggregate of (i) 289,000 Class A Units, each consisting of one share of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and one Series U warrant to purchase one share of common stock, and (ii) 2,711,000 Class B Units, each consisting of one pre-funded Series V warrant to purchase one share of common stock and one Series U warrant to purchase one share of common stock at a public offering price of $5.00 per Class A Unit and $4.9999 per Class B Unit (the “September 2019 Offering”). In addition, we granted the Underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 450,000 shares of our common stock and/or Series U warrants at the public offering price, less the underwriting discounts and commissions. The Underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional 450,000 Series U warrants. We also issued to the Representative warrants (in the form of the Series U warrants) to purchase 75,000 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $6.25 per share of common stock (the “Representative Warrants”). In September 2020, we entered into revised warrant agreements for the Representative Warrants that reduced the strike price of the warrants to $2.82 per share.
On April 24, 2019, we received $3.3 million of net cash proceeds related to the sale of the UK subsidiary and our cell therapy assets (excluding such assets used in Japan or relating to our contract with BARDA), of which $1.7 million was used to pay down principal, interest and fees on the Loan and Security Agreement, and on April 25, 2019, we received $2.4 million of net cash proceeds related to the sale of our Japanese subsidiary, Cytori Therapeutics, K.K., and substantially all of our cell therapy assets used in Japan, of which $1.4 million was used to pay down principal, interests and fees on the Loan and Security Agreement.
In August 2019, we consummated a 1-for-50 reverse stock split pursuant to which the minimum bid price of our common stock rose above $1.00. On August 29, 2019, the Company received written notice from Nasdaq staff that the Company had regained compliance with the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) concerning our minimum bid price per share of its common stock.
On August 16, 2019, we received written notice from the Nasdaq indicating that the Company no longer meets the requirements for continued listing under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(4) due to the our failure to meet the minimum 500,000 publicly held shares requirement for continued listing. On September 11, 2019, we received written notice from Nasdaq staff that, based on having 786,807 publicly held shares outstanding as of August 31, 2019, we had regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(4).
On August 19, 2019, we received written notice from Nasdaq indicating that, based on our stockholders’ deficit of $6.3 million as of June 30, 2019, as reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2019, we were no longer in compliance with the minimum stockholders’ equity requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1), which requires listed companies to maintain stockholders’ equity of at least $2.5 million.
We continue to seek additional capital through strategic transactions and other financing alternatives. Without additional capital, current working capital and cash generated from sales will not provide adequate funding for research and product development activities at their current levels. If sufficient capital is not raised, we will at a minimum need to significantly reduce or curtail our research and development and other operations, and this would negatively affect our ability to achieve corporate growth goals. Although the stock markets and our stock price have recovered to some extent in recent weeks, there may likely be continued market volatility due to the pandemic or other events, which could cause our stock price to decline. This in turn will likely negatively impact our ability to raise funds through equity-related financings. Further, a continued global economic downturn may impair our ability to obtain additional financing through other means, such as strategic transactions or debt financing. The overall deterioration
of the credit and financial markets due to the COVID-19 pandemic will likely generally reduce our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our operations.
Should we be unable to raise additional cash from outside sources or if we are unable to do so in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms, it would have a material adverse impact on our operations.
Cash (used in) provided by operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is summarized as follows (in thousands):
Operating activities
Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $8.4 million compared to $5.9 million in the same period of 2019. Overall, our operational cash use increased during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, due primarily to timing of cash payments made for operating assets and liabilities.
Investing activities
Net cash used in investing activities for year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily related to cash payments of $0.4 million made for in process research and development assets from NanoTx, and $0.1 million for purchases of fixed assets. Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 were related to the sale of the cell therapy business for gross proceeds of $5.6 million.
Financing Activities
Net cash used for financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was related to repayment of $5.0 million of the Term Loan in April 2020, and cash payments of $0.1 million for our finance leases, offset by cash proceeds received from issuance of common stock of $4.0 million and warrant exercises of $1.1 million. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily related to net proceeds of $16 million received from the September 2019 Offering, and the sale of common stock under the purchase agreement dated September 21, 2018 with Lincoln Park, proceeds from the exercise of warrants of $0.5 million, partially offset by the principal payment of long-term obligations of $3.7 million.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements (as defined by applicable regulations of the SEC) that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses, and that affect our recognition and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
While our estimates are based on assumptions we consider reasonable at the time they were made, our actual results may differ from our estimates, perhaps significantly. If results differ materially from our estimates, we will make adjustments to our financial statements prospectively as we become aware of the necessity for an adjustment.
We believe it is important for you to understand our most critical accounting policies. These are our policies that require us to make our most significant judgments and, as a result, could have the greatest impact on our future financial results.
Impairment
We assess certain of our long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill, for potential impairment when there is a change in circumstances that indicates carrying values of assets may not be recoverable. Such long-lived assets are deemed to be impaired when the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset (or asset group) are less than the asset’s carrying amount. Any required impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value and would be recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and a charge to operating expense. There was no impairment in 2020 or 2019.
Goodwill
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. We perform our impairment test annually during the fourth quarter. The goodwill is considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its respective fair value. We perform the annual impairment analysis by comparing our estimated fair value, calculated from our market capitalization, to our carrying amount. In connection with the sale of our Cell Therapy business to Lorem Vascular Pte, Ltd. (“Lorem”) pursuant to the Asset and Shares Sale and Purchase Agreement (the “Lorem Purchase Agreement”) dated March 30, 2019, we disposed approximately $3.5 million of goodwill that was attributed to the businesses sold. As of December 31, 2020, we had $0.4 million of remaining goodwill related to our ongoing business. Our annual evaluation for impairment of goodwill consists of one reporting unit. We completed our most recent annual evaluation for impairment as of December 31, 2020, and determined that no impairment existed and, consequently, no impairment charge has been recorded during the year.
Warrant Liability
Liability classified warrants issued in connection with the September 2019 Offering and the rights offering closed on July 25, 2018 and originally filed under a Form S-1 registration statement in April 2018 (the “2018 Rights Offering”) do not trade in an active securities market, and as such, we estimate the fair value of these warrants using an option pricing model. Following the authoritative accounting guidance, warrants with variable exercise price features or with potential cash settlement outside control of the Company are accounted for as liabilities, with changes in the fair value included in operating expenses. We estimated the fair value of the warrants using the option pricing model. As mentioned above, in April, June, July and September 2020, we entered into revised warrant agreements with the holders of 3,447,500 Series U warrants, and in September 2020, we entered into revised warrant agreements for 75,000 of Representative Warrants, both originally issued in connection with the September 2019 Offering and initially accounted for as liabilities. In return for reducing the strike price of the warrants, the warrant holders agreed to amend the settlement provisions upon fundamental transactions. The amended Series U warrants meet the requirements for equity classification under authoritative accounting guidance and are no longer subject to fair value accounting post amendment.
