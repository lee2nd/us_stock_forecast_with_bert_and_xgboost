Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis of our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and related notes for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Certain statements made or incorporated by reference in this report and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in our press releases and in statements made by or with the approval of authorized personnel constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and are subject to the safe harbor created thereby. Forward looking statements reflect intent, belief, current expectations, estimates or projections about, among other things, our industry, management’s beliefs, and future events and financial trends affecting us. Words such as “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “may,” “will” and variations of these words or similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements. In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward looking statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are reasonable, such statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These differences can arise as a result of the risks described above in the section entitled “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this report, as well as other factors that may affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Forward looking statements in this report speak only as of the date hereof, and forward-looking statements in documents incorporated by reference speak only as of the date of those documents. Unless otherwise required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In light of these risks and uncertainties, we cannot assure you that the forward-looking statements contained in this report will, in fact, transpire.
Overview
The management’s discussion and analysis is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.

Recent Developments
On January 28, 2021, we entered into letter agreements (the “Letter Agreements”) with certain existing institutional and accredited investors to exercise certain outstanding warrants (the “Existing Warrants”) to purchase up to an aggregate of 39,740,500 shares of the Company’s common stock at their original exercise price of $1.55 per share (the “Exercise”). The Existing Warrants (the “Registered Existing Warrants”) and the shares of common stock underlying the Registered Existing Warrants were previously registered pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-248623). In consideration for the exercise of the Existing Warrants for cash, the exercising holders will receive new unregistered warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 39,740,500 shares of common stock (the “New Warrants”) at an exercise price of $2.37 per share and with an exercise period of five years from the initial issuance date.
The Special Equities Group, a division of Bradley Woods & Co. Ltd., acted as warrant solicitation agent and will receive a cash fee of approximately $4.3 million.
The gross proceeds to the Company from the Exercise were approximately $61.6 million. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the Exercise for acquisitions of children’s and family intellectual property, and/or companies in the children’s and family entertainment space.
On February 1, 2021, the Company through GBI Acquisition LLC, a New Jersey limited liability company, and 2811210 Ontario Inc., a company organized under the laws of the Province of Ontario, two wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company, closed its previously announced acquisition pursuant to a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with (i) Harold Aaron Chizick, (ii) Jennifer Mara Chizick, (iii) Wishing Thumbelina Inc.

Total consideration paid by the Company in the transaction at closing consisted of $8.5 million in cash and 1,966,292 shares (the “Closing Shares”) of the Company’s common stock, $0.001 par value per share (the “Common Stock”) with a value of approximately $3.5 million, both as subject to certain purchase price adjustments. Of the Closing Shares, 674,157 shares of Common Stock, with a value of approximately $1.2 million, were deposited into an escrow account to cover potential post-closing indemnification obligations of Sellers under the Purchase Agreement. Additionally, the Purchase Agreement also provides for the issuance of additional shares of Common Stock with an aggregate value of up to $8.0 million that may be issued to the Sellers if certain EBITDA and performance levels are achieved within a four-year period commencing on the date of the Purchase Agreement.
The parties to the Purchase Agreement made certain representations, warranties and covenants, agreed to certain indemnification terms as set forth in the Purchase Agreement, and agreed to enter into certain employment agreements in connection with the Acquisition.
Prior to the closing of the Acquisition, neither the Company nor any of its affiliates, or any director or officer of the Company or any of its affiliates, or any associate of any such director or officer, had any material relationship with the Sellers. The terms of the Purchase Agreement, including the purchase price, were determined by arm’s length negotiations between the Company and Sellers.

Coronavirus (COVID-19)
With respect to the ongoing and evolving coronavirus (“COVID-19”) outbreak, which was designated as a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, COVID-19 has caused substantial disruption in international and U.S. economies and markets. COVID-19 has had an adverse impact on the entertainment industry and, if repercussions of COVID-19 are prolonged, could have a significant adverse impact on our business, which could be material. The majority of the Company’s employees have been working remotely from home, with only a few individuals monitoring the office as needed. We have not experienced any disruption in our supply chain, nor have we experienced any negative impact from our animation production partners. With regard to content distribution, we have observed demand increases for streaming entertainment services in 2020. In terms of our consumer products business, we are starting to see some negative impact from COVID-19 as consumer activity decelerates in the U.S. and across the world. Global supply chain issues had a negative impact on the timing of certain toy releases. If the COVID-19 outbreak is prolonged, we will see a negative impact on our revenues.
The Company’s management cannot at this point estimate the impact of COVID-19 on its business and no provision for COVID-19 is reflected in the accompanying financial statements. We will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state, local or foreign authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and stockholders. It is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, including the effects on our customers, suppliers or vendors, or on our financial results.
Results of Operations
Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Our summary results for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are below.
Licensing and royalty revenue include items for which we license the rights to our copyrights and trademarks of our brands and those of the brands for which we act as a licensing agent. During the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019, this category decreased $102,373, or 12%, primarily due to decreases revenues generated from Rainbow Rangers and Llama Llama properties in 2019.
Television & Home Entertainment revenue is generated from distribution of our properties for broadcast on television, VOD, or SVOD in domestic and international markets and the sale of DVDs for home entertainment through our partners. Fluctuations in Television & Home Entertainment revenue occur period over period based on the achievement of revenue recognition criteria such as the start of a license period and the delivery of the content to the customer. During the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, Television & Home Entertainment revenue decreased $3,352,437 or 70%. This decrease was primarily due to the revenue generated in 2019 from the delivery of the Llama Llama Season 2 to Netflix and Rainbow Rangers Season 1 to Nickelodeon and Shanghai Senyu Media in China. The revenue generated in 2020 was due to the delivery of Rainbow Rangers Season 2 to Nickelodeon.
Advertising sales are generated on the Kartoon Channel in the form of either flat rate promotions or advertising impressions served. Advertising sales increased by $29,476, or 13%, during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the addition of new distribution partners, increased advertising impressions served and additional ad campaigns in 2020. This was a result of our efforts to continue to grow this area of the business through new distribution channels and with new partners.
Product sales represent physical products in which we hold intellectual property rights such as trademarks and copyrights to the characters and which are manufactured and sold by us directly. During the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, product sales associated with Warren Buffett’s Secret Millionaire Club decreased by $438, or 15%.
Marketing and sales expenses increased $87,390, or 12%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to a slight decrease in marketing and advertising expenses to promote the Rainbow Rangers and Llama Llama properties.
Direct operating costs include costs of our product sales, unamortizable post-production costs, film and television cost amortization expense, and participation expense related to agreements with various animation studios, post-production studios, writers, directors, musicians or other creative talent with which we are obligated to share net profits of the properties on which they have rendered services. Direct operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $2,444,539, or 54%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded film and television cost amortization expense of $979,598 and participation expense of $1,043,214, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, where we recorded expenses of $2,230,024 and $1,690,936, respectively. The decreases in direct operating costs in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year reflect decreases in film amortization expense, participation expense and dubbing costs related to the delivery of Llama Llama to Netflix and the delivery of Rainbow Rangers to Nickelodeon in 2019.
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, employee benefits, share-based compensation related to stock options, insurances, rent, depreciation, and amortization as well as other professional fees related to finance, accounting, legal and investor relations.
General and administrative costs for year ended December 31, 2020 increased $10,307,243, or 145%, compared to the same period in 2019. This increase is primarily due to an increase of $8,745,186 in stock based compensation, $648,493 in professional fees, and $680,779 in increased salaries and wages. Fluctuations in other general and administrative expenses comprise the balance of the variance.
Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $372,652, compared to the same period in 2019. The increase in interest expense was due to the costs associated with the Senior Convertible Notes exceeding the face amount of the notes. The excess was recorded as interest expense.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Working Capital
As of December 31, 2020, we had current assets of $108,566,089, including cash and cash equivalents of $100,456,324, and current liabilities of $7,178,906, resulting in working capital of $101,387,183, compared to a negative working capital of $3,650,136 as of December 31, 2019.
Increases in working capital were primarily the result of the increase in cash of $100,151,203 resulting from capital raises and warrant exercises and an increase in prepaid expenses of $6,608,554 resulting from the $500,000 cash payment, issuance of shares and warrants for prepayment of production and marketing services.
Decreases in working capital were primarily the result of the repayment of the Secured Convertible Notes in the amount of $2,373,952, an increase in the warrant derivative liability of $1,197,068, an increase in participations payable.
Comparison of Cash Flows for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019

The decrease was partially offset by the increase in net loss for 2020 and by the impairment loss on intangible assets in 2019.
The Company incurred a loss before income taxes of $401,669,805 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to a loss before income taxes of $11,481,245 for the year ended December 31, 2019.

The Company plans to continue producing, distributing, and marketing animated and live action programming for children. This will require significant investments of capital.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our accounting policies are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Below is a summary of the critical accounting policies, among others, that management believes involve significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for by the purchase method. In accordance with FASB ASC 350 Intangibles Goodwill and Other, goodwill and certain intangible assets are presumed to have indefinite useful lives and are thus not amortized, but subject to an impairment test annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise. We complete the annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests at the end of each fiscal year. In testing goodwill, we initially use a qualitative approach and analyze relevant factors to determine if events and circumstances have affected the value of the goodwill. If the result of this qualitative analysis indicates that the value has been impaired, we then apply a quantitative approach to calculate the difference between the goodwill’s recorded value and its fair value. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the recorded value exceeds its fair value. Goodwill, in addition to being tested for impairment annually, is tested for impairment at interim periods if an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company performed a qualitative analysis of the carrying value of goodwill. Based on the results of our analysis, we concluded that there is no impairment to the goodwill balance and no adjustment is necessary at this time.
Other intangible assets have been acquired, either individually or with a group of other assets, and were initially recognized and measured based on fair value. In accordance with FASB ASC 350 Intangible Assets, the costs of new product development and significant improvement to existing products are capitalized while routine and periodic alterations to existing products are expensed as incurred. Annual amortization of these intangible assets is computed based on the straight-line method over the remaining economic life of the asset.
Film and Television Costs
We capitalize production costs for episodic series produced in accordance with FASB ASC 926-20 Entertainment-Films - Other Assets - Film Costs. Accordingly, production costs are capitalized at actual cost and then charged against revenue based on the initial market revenue evidenced by a firm commitment over the period of commitment. We expense all capitalized costs that exceed the initial market firm commitment revenue in the period of delivery of the episodes.
We capitalize production costs for films produced in accordance with FASB ASC 926-20 Entertainment-Films - Other Assets - Film Costs. Accordingly, production costs are capitalized at actual cost and then charged against revenue quarterly as a cost of production based on the relative fair value of the film(s) delivered and recognized as revenue. We evaluate our capitalized production costs annually and limit recorded amounts by our ability to recover such costs through expected future sales.
Additionally, for both episodic series and films, from time to time, we develop additional content, improved animation and bonus songs/features for our existing content. After the initial release of the film or episodic series, the costs of significant improvement to existing products are capitalized while routine and periodic alterations to existing products are expensed as incurred.
Debt and Attached Equity Linked Instruments
The Company measures issued debt on an amortized cost basis, net of debt premium/discount and debt issuance costs amortized using the effective interest rate method or the straight-line method when the latter does not lead to materially different results.
The Company accounts for the proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes payable in accordance with FASB ASC 470-20 Debt with Conversion and Other Options. Pursuant to FASB ASC 470-20, the intrinsic value of the embedded conversion feature (beneficial conversion interest), which is in the money on the commitment date is included in the discount to debt and amortized to interest expense over the term of the note agreement. When the conversion option is not separated, the Company accounts for the entire convertible instrument including debt and the conversion feature as a liability.
The Company analyzes freestanding equity-linked instruments including warrants attached to debt to conclude whether the instrument meets the definition of the derivative and whether it is considered indexed to the Company’s own stock. If the instrument is not considered indexed to Company’s stock, it is classified as an asset or liability recorded at fair value. If the instrument is considered indexed to Company’s stock, the Company analyzes additional equity classification requirements per ASC 815-40 Contract’s in Entity’s Own Equity. When the requirements are met the instrument is recorded as part of Company’s equity, initially measured based on its relative fair value with no subsequent re-measurement. When the equity classification requirements are not met, the instrument is recorded as an asset or liability, measured at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recorded in earnings.
When required, the Company also considers the bifurcation guidance for embedded derivatives per FASB ASC 815-15 Embedded Derivatives.
Revenue Recognition
On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the new accounting standard ASC 606 (“Topic 606”), Revenue from Contracts with Customers and all the related amendments (“new revenue standard”) using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under ASC 605 (“Topic 605”).
As a result of the change, beginning January 1, 2018, the Company began recognizing revenue related to licensed rights to exploit functional IP in two ways. For minimum guarantees, the Company recognizes fixed revenue upon delivery of content and the start of the license period. For functional IP contracts with a variable component, the Company estimates revenue such that it is probable there will not be a material reversal of revenue in future periods. Revenue under these types of contracts was previously recognized when royalty statements were received. The Company began recognizing revenue related to licensed rights to exploit symbolic IP substantially similarly to functional IP. Although it has a different recognition pattern from functional IP, the valuation method is substantially the same, depending on the nature of the license.
The Company sells advertising on its App and OTT based “Kartoon Channel! in the form of either flat rate promotions or impressions served. For flat rate promotions with a fixed term, the Company recognizes revenue when all five revenue recognition criteria under FASB ASC 606 are met. For impressions served, the Company delivers a certain minimum number of impressions on the channel to the advertiser for which the advertiser pays a contractual CPM per impression. Impressions served are reported to the Company on a monthly basis, and revenue is reported in the month the impressions are served.
The Company recognizes revenue related to product sales when we complete our performance obligation, which is when the goods are transferred to the buyer.
Direct Operating Costs
Direct operating costs include costs of our product sales, non-capitalizable film costs, film and television cost amortization expense, and participation expense related to agreements with various animation studios, post-production studios, writers, directors, musicians or other creative talent with which we are obligated to share net profits of the properties on which they have rendered services.
Share-Based Compensation
As required by FASB ASC 718 - Stock Compensation, the Company recognizes an expense related to the fair value of our share-based compensation awards, including stock options, using the Black-Scholes calculation as of the date of grant. The Company has elected to use the graded attribution method for awards which are in-substance, multiple awards based on the vesting schedule.
Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings (loss) per common share (“EPS”) is calculated by dividing net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding, plus the assumed exercise of all dilutive securities using the treasury stock or “as converted” method, as appropriate. During periods of net loss, all common stock equivalents are excluded from the diluted EPS calculation because they are antidilutive.
Income Taxes
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using presently enacted tax rates. At each balance sheet date, the Company evaluates the available evidence about future taxable income and other possible sources of realization of deferred tax assets and records a valuation allowance that reduces the deferred tax assets to an amount that represents management’s best estimate of the amount of such deferred tax assets that more likely than not will be realized.
Concentration of Risk.
The Company’s cash is maintained at three financial institutions and from time to time the balances for this account exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (“FDIC”) insured amount. Balances on interest bearing deposits at banks in the United States are insured by the FDIC up to $250,000 per account. As of December 30, 2020, the Company had four accounts with an uninsured balance of $99,260,006.
For the year ended December 30, 2020, the Company had two customers whose total revenue exceeded 10% of the total consolidated revenue. Those customers accounted for 44% of the total revenue and 22% of accounts receivable. For the year ended December 30, 2019, the Company had two customers whose total revenue each exceeded 10% of the total consolidated revenue. Those customers accounted for 65% and 57% of the total revenue and accounts receivable respectively for the year ended December 31, 2019 respectively.
The major customers for the year ended December 31, 2020 are the same as the major customers at December 31, 2019. There is significant financial risk associated with a dependence upon a small number of customers. The Company periodically assesses the financial strength of these customers and establishes allowances for any anticipated bad debt. At December 31, 2020, the Company recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts in the amount of $43,676. In 2019, no allowance for bad debt had been established for the major customers as these amounts were expected to be fully collectible.
Fair value of financial instruments
The carrying amounts of cash, receivables, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity of the instruments. The carrying amount of the Facility (as defined below) approximates fair value since the debt carries a variable interest rate that is tied to either the current Prime or LIBOR rates plus an applicable spread.
The Company adopted FASB ASC 820 as of January 1, 2008, for financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis. FASB ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. FASB ASC Topic 820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). These tiers include:
· Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets;
· Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and
· Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In March 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-02, Subtopic 926-20 and Subtopic 920-350. The update aligns the accounting for production costs of an episodic television series with the accounting for production costs of films by removing the content distinction for capitalization. The amendments also require that an entity reassess estimates of the use of a film in a film group and account for any changes prospectively. The amendments in this update require that an entity test a film or license agreement for program material within the scope of Subtopic 920-350 for impairment at a film group level when the film or license agreement is predominantly monetized with other films and/or license agreements. For public business entities, the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We have prospectively adopted ASU 2016-18. The impact to our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows were not material.
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity. The update simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by removing certain separation models in Subtopic 470-20, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options, for convertible instruments. As part of the amendment, the embedded conversion features are no longer separated from the host contract for convertible instruments with conversion features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital. The FASB has eliminated the cash conversion and beneficial conversion feature models. The FASB has also modified accounting rules relating to application of the scope exception from derivative accounting. The amendments revise the guidance in ASC 815-40-25-10, to remove three out of seven conditions from the settlement guidance, referred to as additional equity classification requirements. Following the above amendments, more convertible debt instruments will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost and more convertible preferred stock will be accounted for as a single equity instrument measured at its historical cost, as long as no features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. The amendments are effective for public business entities, excluding smaller reporting companies, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, including smaller reporting companies the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We have prospectively adopted ASU No. 2020-06. The impact to our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows were not material.
Various other accounting pronouncements have been recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or were applicable to specific industries and are not expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
