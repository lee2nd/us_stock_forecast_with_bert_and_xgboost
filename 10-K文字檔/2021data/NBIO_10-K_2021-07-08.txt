Results of Operations
The following summary of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, which are included herein.
Expenses
Operating expenses for the year ended March 31, 2021 were $2,150,368 including research and development costs of $321,938, general and administrative expenses of $359,259 and consulting of $1,469,171 compared to the year ended March 31, 2020 in which our operating expenses were $3,447,311 with research and development costs of $293,709 and general and administrative costs of $3,153,602, representing a decrease of $1,315,943 in operating expenses in fiscal 2021 over 2020.
Other income totaled $441,601 for the year ended March 31, 2021 compared to other expense of $556,848 for the same period in 2020. Other income consisted of change in fair value of $646,250, gain on debt forgiveness of $151,308, interest expense of $269,382 and finance costs of $19,411 and debt discount interest of $67,250 in the year ended March 31, 2021 compared to interest expense of $86,632 and a decrease in fair value of $470,216 for the same period in 2020.
Revenue, Net Income and Loss
The Company recorded revenue of $750,000 from the initial payment from the sale of a license agreement during the year ended March 31, 2021 and zero revenue in the same period in 2020. Deferred revenue of $250,000 was also recorded in the year ended March 31, 2021.
Our net loss for the year ended March 31, 2021 was $958,767 compared to a net loss of $4,004,153 during the year ended March 31, 2020. The decrease in net loss is due to a sale of the license agreement for an initial payment of $750,000 plus lower expenses in the year ended March 31, 2021 over 2020.
Our operations to date have been financed by the sale of our common stock and initial payment of a licenses sale. Our largest expenses to date have been research and development, IND filings and tests required for the filing and consulting fees. The research and development will grow as we have begun clinical trial for phase 1 studies.
We do not anticipate generating revenues in the foreseeable future other than future licenses sales or additional payments from licenses in effect, and any revenues that we generate may not be sufficient to cover our operating expenses. If we do not succeed in raising additional capital, we may have to cease operations and you may lose your entire investment.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At March 31, 2021 we had cash of $1,435 and receivable of $750,000 compared to cash of $3,218 in cash at March 31, 2020. Our accounts payable and accrued expense at March 31, 2021 was $636,831 consisting of $538,395 in accounts payable and $98,436 in accrued expense as compared to $852,664 in accounts payable as of March 31, 2020 consisting of accounts payable of $738,778, accrued consulting of $97,500 and accrued interest of $16,386 .
We have limited revenues from a license sale to satisfy our ongoing liabilities, however it is not known how much and the timing of the receipts of revenue. Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. Unless we secure additional equity or debt financing, of which there can be no assurance, we may not be able to continue any operations.
Working Capital
Our total current assets, as of March 31, 2021, consisted of $751,435 in cash and accounts receivable as compared to total current assets of $3,218 in cash as of March 31, 2020. The increase in current assets was due to the initial payment from a licenses sale during the year ended March 31, 2021.
Our total current liabilities as of March 31, 2021 were $1,223,940 as compared to total current liabilities of $2,878,922 as of March 31, 2020 The decrease in current liabilities was primarily attributed to due related parties of $123,217 from $1,283,607,derivative liability decrease to $302,156 compared to $603,836 in 2020 , offset by notes payable for convertible note of $ 161,736 in 2021 compared to $88,815 net of discount and note payable of zero in 2021 compared to $50,000 in the same period in 2020, The company also recorded a gain in debt forgiveness of $151,308 further reducing the accounts payable in 2021 over the same period in 2020.
As of March 31, 2021 the Company’s negative working capital was $472,505 compared to negative working capital of $2,875,704 as of March 31, 2020. The decrease in negative working capital of $2,403,199 from 2021 to 2020 can be attributed accounts receivable of $750,000 in 2021 over 2020 , decrease in accounts payables and accrued expenses of $215,833 and the decrease of accrual due related parties of $1,160,390.
Cash Flows

Cash used in operating activities was $986,784 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 compared to cash used in operating activities of $554,325 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. The increase in cash used in operating activities is attributed mainly to accounts receivable of $750,000, and accrual of amounts due related parties decreased of $1,071,846 in 2021 over 2020
Investing Activities
Cash used in investing activities was zero for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020 and 2021.
Financing Activities
Cash provided by financing activities during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 was $985,000, compared to $426,071 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. The cash provided by financing activities is due to the sale of preferred shares for $640,000, proceeds from convertible note of $295,000 and proceeds from note payable of $50,000 in 2021 compared to the sale of common stock and warrants of $115,000 proceeds from convertible notes of $150,000, proceeds from notes payable of $50,000 and the sale of preferred shares of $110,000.
Cash Requirements
We will require additional funds to fund our budgeted expenses over the next 12 months. These funds may be raised through equity financing, debt financing, or other sources, which may result in further dilution in the equity ownership of our shares. There is still no assurance that we will be able to maintain operations at a level sufficient for investors to obtain returns on their investments in our common stock. Further, we may continue to be unprofitable. We need to raise additional funds in the immediate future in order to proceed with our budgeted expenses including the clinical trials of our product.
Going Concern
The financial statements accompanying this report have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that our company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. Our company has not generated revenues since inception and has never paid any dividends and is unlikely to pay dividends or generate earnings in the immediate or foreseeable future. The continuation of our company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from our shareholders, the ability of our company to obtain necessary equity financing to achieve our operating objectives, and the attainment of profitable operations. As of March 31, 2021, our company has accumulated deficit of $18,351,416 and a working capital deficit of $472,505. We do not have sufficient working capital to enable us to carry out our stated plan of operation for the next twelve months.
Due to the uncertainty of our ability to meet our current operating expenses and the capital requirements noted below in their report on the financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2021 our independent auditors, included an explanatory paragraph regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements contain additional note disclosures describing the circumstances that lead to this disclosure by our independent auditors.
The continuation of our business is dependent upon us raising additional financial support. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.
Future Financings
We will require additional financing of an estimated $20,000,000 to enable us to proceed with our plan of operations, including completion of our phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials plus presentation of data to the FDA to proceed to phase 3 clinical trials. These cash requirements are more than our current cash and working capital resources. Accordingly, we will require additional financing to continue operations and to repay our liabilities. There is no assurance that any party will advance additional funds to us to enable us to sustain our plan of operations or to repay our liabilities.
We anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common stock to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our planned business activities.
We presently do not have any arrangements for additional financing for the expansion of our exploration operations, and no potential lines of credit or sources of financing are currently available for proceeding with our plan of operations.
If we are unable to raise the funds that we require to execute our plan of operation, we intend to scale back our operations commensurately with the funds available to us.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
