Overview
We were incorporated in the State of Delaware as of December 9, 2005 as 43010, Inc. to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited to, locating and negotiating with a business entity for combination in the form of a merger, stock-for-stock exchange or stock-for-assets exchange. On October 7, 2008, pursuant to the terms of a stock purchase agreement, Mr. Greg Halpern purchased a total of 100,000 shares of our common stock from Michael Raleigh for an aggregate of $30,000 in cash. The total of 100,000 shares represents 100% of our issued and outstanding common stock at the time of the transfer. As a result, Mr. Halpern became our sole shareholder. As part of the acquisition, and pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, Michael Raleigh, our then President, CEO, CFO, and Chairman resigned from all the positions he held in the company, and Mr. Halpern was appointed as our President, CEO CFO and Chairman.
In May of 2010, we acquired the world-wide rights to all fields of use for Max Sound HD Audio Technology. In November of 2010, we opened our post-production facility for Max Sound HD Audio in Santa Monica California. In February of 2012, after several successful demonstrations to multi-media industry company executives, we decided to shift the focus of the Company to the marketing of the Max Sound HD Audio Technology and commenced the name change from So Act Network, Inc. to Max Sound Corporation and the symbol from SOAN to MAXD.
On December 3, 2012, the Company completed the purchase of the assets of Liquid Spins, Inc., a Colorado corporation (“Liquid Spins”). Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, the assets of Liquid Spins were exchanged for 24,752,475 shares of common stock of the Company (the “Shares”), equal to $10,000,000 and a purchase price of $.404 per share. The assets of Liquid Spins purchased included: record label distribution agreements; Liquid Spins technology inventory; independent arts programs; retail contracts for music distribution; physical inventory and office equipment; design and retail ready concepts; brand value; records; publishing catalog; and web assets. During 2016, the Company reviewed the intangible asset for impairment and determined that certain items had been impaired due to obsolescence. As a result of this review, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $ 15,703,617 that is recorded as impairment loss on intangible asset.
No later than June 20, 2014, MAXD entered into a representation agreement with VSL Communications, Inc., making MAXD the exclusive agent to VSL to enforce all rights with respect to patented technology owned and controlled by VSL. In particular, the Company announced that it had acquired a worldwide license and
representation rights to a patented video and data technology “Optimized Data Transmission System and Method” which enables end-user licensees to transport 100% of data bandwidth content in only 3% of the bandwidth with the identical lossless quality. Significantly, this represents thirty-three times reduction associated with transport cost and the time it takes for the video or digital content to be viewed by an end-user. As described more fully in the Legal Proceedings Section, The Company has since filed suit against Google, Inc., YouTube, LLC, and On2 Technologies, Inc., alleging willful infringement of the patent.
On May 22, 2014, MAXD entered into a representation agreement with architect Eli Attia giving MAXD the exclusive rights to sue violators of Eli Attia’s intellectual property rights. While Eli Attia was teaching his invention at Google [x], the project was internally valued by Google at $120 Billion USD a year. Since then, Flux has since been spun-out of Google [x], funded and has quickly growing, upon information and belief, to over 800 employees according to one of its founders. MAXD, on behalf of Attia’s, have since filed suit against Google, Inc., Flux Factory, and various executives of these companies for misappropriation of trade secrets. Since this time, the Company has advanced the case(s) and has signed additional agreements with the inventor as late
as February 21st, 2017 and with additional counsel in June 2018 to support the RICO claim.
On November 29, 2016, MAXD entered into an agreement with Vedanti Systems Limited and Vedanti Licensing Limited (VLL) that resolves their dispute over the international Optimized Data Transmission (ODT) patent portfolio previously owned by Vedanti. The agreement further provides that VLL and MAXD will become co-owners of the pioneering portfolio.
Videos and news relating to the Company is available on the company website at www.maxd.audio. The MAX-D Technology Highlights Video summarizes the HD Audio™ process and shows the need for high definition (HD) Audio in several key vertical markets. The video explains MAX-D as what we believe to be the only dynamic HD Audio™ that is being offered to various markets.
Plan of Operation
We began our operations on October 8, 2008, when we purchased the Form 10 Company from the previous owners. Since that date, we have conducted financings to raise initial start-up money for the building of our internet search engine and social networking website and to start our operations. In 2011, the Company shifted the focus of its business operations from their social networking website to the marketing of the MaxSound HD Audio Technology and in 2014 the Company began litigations against Google and others for infringement of its technologies and associated legal rights to the various proprietary technologies.
The Company believes that Max Sound HD Audio Technology is a game changer for several vertical markets whose demand will create revenue opportunities in 2021.
We expect our financial requirements to increase with the additional expenses needed to market and promote the MAX-D HD Audio Technology. We plan to fund these additional expenses through financings and through loans from our stockholders and/or officers based on existing lines of credit and we are also considering various private funding opportunities until such time that our revenue stream is adequate enough to provide the necessary funds.
Results of Operations
For the year ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019:
General and Administrative Expenses: Our general and administrative expenses were $89,929 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $110,547 for the year ended December 30, 2019, representing a decrease of 20,618, or approximately 19%, as a result of decrease in the general operation of the Company included decreasing personnel, product development and marketing of our Max Sound Technology.

Net Loss: Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1,497,818. While the operational expenses in marketing our Max Sound technology decreased from the same period of last year, the overall amount of our net loss substantially decreased as a result of a decrease in operating expenses and a decrease in the fair value of embedded derivative liability associated with the convertible debt.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, were $0 and $0, respectively. We have an accumulated deficit of $82,972,471 for the period from December 9, 2005 (inception) to December 31, 2020 and have negative cash flow from operations of $18,236 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Our financial statements have been presented on the basis that it is a going concern, which contemplates the realization of revenues from our subscriber base and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have incurred losses from inception. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
From our inception through December 31, 2020, our primary source of funds has been the proceeds of private offerings of our common stock, private financing, and loans from stockholders. For the past 24 months we have not conducted any capital raising activities.
In the year ended December 31, 2020 the Company issued no convertible notes and agreed with its only two debt holders to eliminate all of the moving conversion rights until the S.E.C rightfully enforces Regulation Sho to restore the Company’s equity stolen by Knight Securities and other bad market actors who continue unimpeded in their daily illegal naked short selling of the Company’s shares and in absolute and direct violation of the existing law.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
All other newly issued accounting pronouncements but not yet effective have been deemed either immaterial or not applicable.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). GAAP requires the use of estimates; assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenues and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information regarding contingencies, risk and financial condition. We
believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP and are consistently and conservatively applied. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements.
Use of Estimates:
In preparing financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition:
Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is assured. We had $0 and $0 in revenue for the ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Stock-Based Compensation:
In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. Under FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 718, companies are required to measure the compensation costs of share-based compensation arrangements based on the grant-date fair value and recognize the costs in the financial statements over the period during which employees are required to provide services. Share-based compensation arrangements include stock options, restricted share plans, performance-based awards, share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans. As such, compensation cost is measured on the date of grant at their fair value. Such compensation amounts, if any, are amortized over the respective vesting periods of the option grant. The Company applies this statement prospectively.
Equity instruments (“instruments”) issued to other than employees are recorded on the basis of the fair value of the instruments, as required by FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 718. FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 505, Equity Based Payments to Non-Employeesdefines the measurement date and recognition period for such instruments. In general, the measurement date is when either a (a) performance commitment, as defined, is reached or (b) the earlier of (i) the non-employee performance is complete or (ii) the instruments are vested. The measured value related to the instruments is recognized over a period based on the facts and circumstances of each particular grant as defined in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.
Derivative Financial Instruments
Fair value accounting requires bifurcation of embedded derivative instruments such as conversion features in convertible debt or equity instruments, and measurement of their fair value for accounting purposes. In determining the appropriate fair value, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. In assessing the convertible debt instruments, management determines if the convertible debt host instrument is conventional convertible debt and further if there is a beneficial conversion feature requiring measurement. If the instrument is not considered conventional convertible debt, the Company will continue its evaluation process of these instruments as derivative financial instruments.
Once determined, derivative liabilities are adjusted to reflect fair value at each reporting period end, with any increase or decrease in the fair value being recorded in results of operations as an adjustment to fair value of derivatives. In addition, the fair value of freestanding derivative instruments such as warrants, are also valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company accounts for its long-lived assets in accordance with ASC Topic 360-10-05, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." ASC Topic 360-10-05 requires that long-lived assets, such as technology rights, be reviewed for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the historical cost carrying value of an asset may no longer be appropriate. The Company assesses recoverability of the carrying value of an asset by estimating the future net cash flows expected to result from the asset, including the eventual disposition. If the future net cash flows are less than the carrying value of an
asset, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the difference between the asset's carrying value and fair value or disposable value.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, financings, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons, also known as “special purpose entities”.
