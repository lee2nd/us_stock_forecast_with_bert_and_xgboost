Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
You should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors.”
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company, discovering and developing novel small molecule therapeutics to treat unmet needs in autoimmunity and cancer. We are developing our lead product candidate, KZR-616, a first-in-class selective immunoproteasome inhibitor, in severe autoimmune diseases where limited treatment options exist. We are conducting Phase 2 clinical trials of KZR-616 in three autoimmune diseases of high unmet need: the MISSION trial in patients with lupus nephritis; and the PRESIDIO trial in patients with dermatomyositis or polymyositis. We believe that the immunoproteasome is a validated target for the treatment of a wide variety of autoimmune diseases given the compelling published activity seen with non-selective proteasome inhibitors administered to patients with severe autoimmune diseases. Based on results from our Phase 1a studies in healthy volunteers and the preliminary results from the Phase 1b portion of the MISSION trial in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, also known as lupus or SLE, KZR-616 has largely avoided adverse effects associated with currently marketed non-selective proteasome inhibitors, as exhibited in clinical studies conducted by third parties, including side effects which we believe prevent them from being utilized as a chronic treatment in autoimmune disorders. In addition, we have seen encouraging clinical activity and biomarker data in SLE patients.
Additionally, we are advancing our novel research platform targeting the Sec61 translocon and the protein secretion pathway to discover and develop small molecule therapeutics targeting oncology indications. Our first clinical candidate in this program, KZR-261, has demonstrated broad anti-tumor activity in preclinical models of both solid and hematologic malignancies. KZR-261 is undergoing laboratory studies and manufacturing activities in support of an investigational new drug application, which we anticipate submitting to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in mid-2021 for a Phase 1 clinical trial in solid tumors. We believe this discovery platform has the potential to yield small molecule candidates that, if successfully developed and approved, could serve as alternatives to currently marketed biologic therapeutics to act as cytotoxic anti-cancer agents or to block the secretion of novel targets of interest in immuno-oncology or inflammation.
Since the commencement of our operations in 2015, we have devoted substantially all our resources to performing research and development activities in support of our product development efforts, hiring personnel, raising capital to support and expand such activities and providing general and administrative support for these operations. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. We have funded our operations to date primarily from the issuance and sale of convertible preferred stock and from public offerings of common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase common stock as described below. We acquired exclusive worldwide rights to KZR-616 and an accompanying library of similar molecules pursuant to a license agreement, or the Onyx License Agreement, with Onyx Therapeutics, Inc., or Onyx, a wholly owned subsidiary of Amgen, Inc. in June 2015. Patent coverage for KZR-616 extends to at least 2034.
Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our current or future product candidates and programs. Our net losses were $41.7 million, $35.1 million and $23.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and we expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $126.0 million. We anticipate that a substantial portion of our capital resources and efforts in the foreseeable future will be focused on discovering, completing the necessary development, obtaining regulatory approval and preparing for potential commercialization of our product candidates.
We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from period to period, depending on the timing of our planned clinical trials and expenditures on other research and development activities. We expect our expenses will increase substantially over time as we:
●
continue the ongoing and planned development of KZR-616 and KZR-261;
●
seek to discover and develop additional product candidates, including preclinical studies and clinical trials for such product candidates;
●
maintain, protect and expand our portfolio of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets and know-how;
●
seek marketing approvals for KZR-616, KZR-261 and any future product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;
●
establish a sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any product candidate for which we may obtain marketing approval;
●
continue to build a portfolio of product candidates through the acquisition or in-license of drugs, product candidates or technologies;
●
implement operational, financial, management and compliance systems; and
●
attract, hire and retain additional administrative, clinical, regulatory and scientific personnel; and
●
incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses associate with operating as a public company.
Critical Accounting Polices and Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Accrued Research and Development Costs
We record accrued expenses for estimated costs of our research and development activities conducted by third-party service providers, which include the conduct of clinical studies, contract manufacturing activities and preclinical studies. We record the estimated costs of research and development activities based upon the estimated amount of services provided but not yet invoiced and include these costs in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and within research and development expense in the consolidated statements of operations. These costs are a significant component of our research and development expenses. We record accrued expenses for these costs based on factors such as estimates of the work completed and in accordance with agreements established with these third-party service providers. Any payments made in advance of services provided are recorded as prepaid assets, which are expensed as the contracted services are performed.
We estimate the amount of work completed through discussions with internal personnel and external service providers as to the progress or stage of completion of the services and the agreed-upon fee to be paid for such services. We make judgments and estimates in determining the accrued balance in each reporting period. As actual costs become known, we adjust our accrued estimates. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed, the number of patients enrolled and the rate of patient enrollment may vary from our estimates and could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. Our accrued expenses are dependent, in part, upon the receipt of timely and accurate reporting from clinical research organizations and other third-party service providers. For the periods presented, we have experienced no material differences between our accrued expenses and actual expenses.
Stock-Based Compensation
We recognize compensation costs related to stock options granted to employees and directors based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant. We estimate the grant date fair value, and the resulting stock-based compensation expense, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The grant date fair value of the stock-based awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods, which are generally the vesting period of the respective awards.
The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of subjective assumptions which determine the fair value of stock-based awards, including the expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock. These assumptions include:
●
Expected term-The expected term represents the period that the stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. We used the simplified method, which calculates the expected term as the average of the time to vesting and the contractual life of the options. For non-employees, we use the contractual term.
●
Expected volatility- The expected volatility was estimated based on the weighted average historical volatilities of our common stock price and a peer group of comparable publicly traded life sciences and biotechnology companies over a period equal to the expected term of the stock option grants as we do not have significant trading history for our common stock. The comparable companies were chosen based on their size, stage in the life cycle or area of specialty. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available.
●
Risk-free interest rate-The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the expected term of the awards.
●
Expected dividend-We have never paid dividends on our common stock and have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock. Therefore, we used an expected dividend yield of zero.
We will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected term and expected volatility utilized for our stock-based compensation calculations on a prospective basis.
Historically, for all periods prior to our IPO, the fair value of the shares of common stock underlying our share-based awards were estimated on each grant date by our board of directors. In order to determine the fair value of our common stock underlying option grants, our board of directors considered, among other things, timely valuations of our common stock prepared by unrelated third-party valuation firms in accordance with the guidance provided by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, and a number of objective and subjective factors including important developments in our operations, sales of convertible preferred stock, actual operating results and financial performance, the conditions in the biotechnology industry and the economy in general, the stock price performance and volatility of comparable public companies, and the lack of liquidity of our common stock, among other factors. For the options granted subsequent to our IPO, our board of directors will determine the fair value of each share of underlying common stock based on the closing price of our common stock as reported on the date of grant.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in 2020” for more information. There are no new accounting pronouncements yet to be adopted that are expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.
Financial Operations Overview
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates, which include:
●
employee-related expenses, which include salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation;
●
fees paid to consultants for services directly related to our product development and regulatory effort;
●
expenses incurred under agreements with third-party contract organizations, investigative clinical trial sites and consultants that conduct research and development activities on our behalf;
●
costs associated with preclinical studies and clinical trials;
●
costs associated with technology and intellectual property licenses;
●
the costs related to production of clinical supplies; and
●
facilities and other allocated expenses, which include expenses for rent and other facility related costs and other supplies.
We expense all research and development costs in the periods in which they are incurred. Costs for certain development activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information and data provided to us by our vendors, collaborators and third-party service providers.
We are eligible under the AusIndustry Research and Tax Development Tax Incentive Program to obtain a cash amount from the Australian Taxation Office. The tax incentive is available to us on the basis of specific criteria with which we must comply related to research and development expenditures in Australia. These research and development tax incentives are recognized as contra research and development expense when the right to receive the tax incentive has been attained and funds are considered to be collectible. The amounts are determined based on a cost-reimbursement basis, and the incentive is related to our research and development expenditures and is due to us regardless of whether any Australian tax is owed. Amounts related to the AusIndustry Research and Development Tax Incentive Program are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the incentive will be received, the relevant expenditure has been incurred by our Australian subsidiary, Kezar Life Sciences Australia Pty Ltd, a proprietary company limited by shares, and the amount of the consideration can be reliably measured.
The following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended:
We expect our research and development expenses to increase substantially for the foreseeable future as our product candidates advance into later stages of development. The process of conducting the necessary clinical research to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming, and the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. As a result, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when and to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates.
General and Administrative Expenses
Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, allocated facilities costs and expenses for outside professional services, including legal, human resource, information technology and audit services. Personnel costs consist of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation. We will incur additional expenses as we increase the size of our administrative function to support the growth of our business.
Interest Income
Our interest income consists of interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.
Results of Operations
A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 is included in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on March 12, 2020.
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses increased by $3.6 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $1.1 million in clinical trial related costs for KZR-616, an increase of $0.8 million in preclinical expenses related to the protein secretion program, an increase of $1.7 million in personnel expenses due to an increase in headcount, an increase of $0.3 million in stock-based compensation and an increase of $0.2 million in facility-related expenses, offset by a decrease of $1.0 million in manufacturing expenses. In addition, the Australian Research and Development Tax Incentive credit earned for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $0.5 million compared to the same period in 2019, which is recorded as a reduction in our research and development expenses.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses increased by $1.9 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $0.5 million in personnel expenses due to an increase in headcount and salaries, an increase of $0.6 million in stock-based compensation, an increase of $0.6 million in consulting and professional fees and an increase of $0.2 million in directors and officers liability insurance.
Interest Income
Interest income decreased by $1.1 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease was attributable to lower interest rates on our marketable securities.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
As of December 31, 2020, we had $21.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and $119.2 million of marketable securities invested in a U.S. Treasury money market fund, U.S. Treasury securities, commercial paper and corporate debt securities. As of December 31, 2020, our cash equivalents and marketable securities had an average maturity of approximately six months and the longest maturity was eleven months.
We have incurred operating losses and experienced negative operating cash flows since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for at least the foreseeable future. Our net loss was $41.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, and we had an accumulated deficit of $126.0 million as of December 31, 2020.
We believe that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2020 will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements through at least the next 12 months from the date these financial statements are issued. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect.
Public Offerings
In February 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering of 18,965,385 shares of our common stock and, to certain investors in lieu thereof, pre-funded warrants to purchase 2,884,615 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.001 per share. The public offering price of our common stock was $2.60 per share and the public offering price of each pre-funded warrant was $2.599 per underlying share. The net proceeds from the public offering were approximately $53.3 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses paid by us.
In June 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering of 7,590,909 shares of our common stock and, to certain investors in lieu thereof, pre-funded warrants to purchase 909,091 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.001 per share. In July 2020, we issued an additional 427,707 shares of common stock, pursuant to the exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares of common stock. The public offering price of our common stock was $5.50 per share and the public offering price of the pre-funded warrants was $5.499 per underlying share. The net proceeds from the public offering were approximately $45.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses paid by us.
At-the-Market Offering Program
In September 2020, we entered into a Sales Agreement, or the ATM Agreement, with Cowen and Company, LLC, or Cowen, pursuant to which we can offer and sell, from time to time at our sole discretion through Cowen, as our sales agent, shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $50.0 million. Any shares of common stock sold will be issued pursuant to our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-248752). We will pay Cowen a commission equal to 3.0% of the gross sales proceeds of any shares of common stock sold through Cowen under the ATM Agreement and also have provided Cowen with indemnification and contribution rights. We sold approximately $11.0 million of our common stock pursuant to the ATM Agreement in February 2021, and approximately $39.0 million of common stock remains available for future sale.
Funding Requirements
Our primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses, primarily research and development expenditures. Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay these expenses, as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable, accrued expenses and prepaid expenses.
We will require additional financing to fund working capital and pay our obligations. We may pursue financing opportunities through the issuance of debt or equity. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in acquiring additional funding at levels sufficient to fund our operations or on terms favorable to us or at all. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including the following:
●
the progress, timing, scope, results and costs of our clinical trials and preclinical studies for our product candidates, including the ability to enroll patients in a timely manner for our clinical trials;
●
the costs of obtaining clinical and commercial supplies for KZR-616, KZR-261 and any other product candidates we may identify and develop;
●
the cost, timing and outcomes of regulatory approvals;
●
the extent to which we may acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies;
●
the cost of attracting, hiring and retaining qualified personnel;
●
our ability to successfully commercialize any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval; and
●
the cost of preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights.
Further, our operating plan may change, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements for clinical trials and other research and development expenditures. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical studies.
If we need to raise additional capital to fund our operations, funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve and has already resulted in a significant disruption of global financial markets. If the disruption persists and deepens, we could experience an inability to access additional capital, which could in the future negatively affect our operations. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or suspend one or more of our preclinical studies, clinical trials, research and development programs or commercialization efforts. We may seek to raise any necessary additional capital through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations and other licensing arrangements. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.
Cash Flows
The following summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2020, cash used in operating activities was $36.9 million, which consisted of a net loss of $41.7 million and a net change of $2.0 million in our net operating assets and liabilities, and adjusted by non-cash charges of $6.8 million. The non-cash charges consisted of $1.5 million for depreciation and amortization and $4.9 million for stock-based compensation expense, $0.3 million of amortization of premium and discounts on marketable securities. The change in our net operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase of $1.4 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a decrease of $0.9 million in operating lease liabilities, offset by an increase of $0.3 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses due to timing of payments and increased clinical and manufacturing expenditures.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was $29.9 million, which consisted of a net loss of $35.1 million, adjusted by a net change of $0.9 million in our net operating assets and liabilities and non-cash charges of $4.3 million. The non-cash charges consisted of $1.3 million for depreciation and amortization and $4.0 million for stock-based compensation expense, offset by $1.0 million of amortization of premium and discounts on marketable securities. The change in our net operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase of $0.5 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a decrease of $0.8 million in operating lease liabilities, offset by an increase of $2.2 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses due to timing of payments and increased clinical and manufacturing expenditures.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in operating activities was $20.8 million, which consisted of a net loss of $23.2 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of $2.3 million and a net change of $0.1 million in our net operating assets and liabilities. The non-cash charges consisted of $0.2 million for depreciation and amortization, $2.0 million for stock-based compensation expense and $0.1 million for loss on disposal of property and equipment. The change in our net operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase of $1.0 million in prepaid expenses, including upfront payments for insurance premiums, clinical and toxicology activities, offset by an increase of $1.4 million in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities due to professional services, manufacturing and clinical expenditures as well as an increase of $0.3 million related to deferred rent.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in investing activities was $56.5 million primarily relating to the purchases of marketable securities exceeding maturities of such marketable securities. Payments for the purchases of property and equipment was $0.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, cash provided by investing activities was $20.4 million primarily relating to the maturities of marketable securities $123.3 million exceeding purchases of such marketable securities $102.3 million. Payments for the purchases of property and equipment was $0.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2019.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in investing activities was $83.9 million primarily consisted of $119.2 million in purchases of marketable securities offset by $36.5 million of maturities of such marketable securities. Payments for the purchases of property and equipment was $1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by financing activities was $99.6 million, consisting of $99.2 million of net proceeds received from the underwritten public offerings and $0.4 million from the issuance of common stock pursuant to our employee equity plans.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, cash provided by financing activities was $0.3 million, consisting of proceeds from the issuance of common stock pursuant to our employee equity plans.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, cash provided by financing activities was $77.9 million consisting of $77.7 million in net proceeds from our IPO and $0.2 million from the issuance of common stock pursuant to our employee equity plans.
Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments
The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 (in millions):
(1)
Amounts in the table represent the operating lease obligations of office and laboratory space at 4000 Shoreline Court, South San Francisco, California. The minimum lease payments above do not include common area maintenance charges or real estate taxes.
Except as disclosed in the table above, we have no long-term debt or capital leases and no material non-cancelable purchase commitments with service providers, as we have generally contracted on a cancelable, purchase order basis.
The contractual obligations table does not include any potential contingent payments upon the achievement by us of clinical, regulatory and commercial events, as applicable, or royalty payments that we may be required to make under license agreements we have entered into or may enter into with various entities pursuant to which we have in-licensed certain intellectual property, including our Onyx License Agreement. Under the Onyx License Agreement, we are obligated to pay Onyx milestone payments of up to $172.5 million in the aggregate upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and sales milestones. We excluded the contingent payments given that the timing and amount (if any) of any such payments cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. See the section titled “Business-License Agreement with Onyx” for additional information.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements and do not have holdings in any variable interest entities.
JOBS Act Accounting Election
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
In addition, we intend to rely on the other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if as an “emerging growth company” we intend to rely on such exemptions, we are not required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor’s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis) and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation-related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the Chief Executive Officer’s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply until December 31, 2023 or until we no longer meet the requirements of being an emerging growth company, whichever is earlier.
