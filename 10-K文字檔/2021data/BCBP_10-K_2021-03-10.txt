ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
General
This discussion, and other written material, and statements management may make, may contain certain forward-looking statements regarding the Company’s prospective performance and strategies within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company intends such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and is including this statement for purposes of said safe harbor provisions.
Forward-looking information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors, which include, but are not limited to, factors discussed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other documents filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe future plans, strategies and expectations of the Company, are generally identified by the use of the words “plan,” “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “project,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “predicts,” “forecasts,” “potential,” or “continue” or similar terms or the negative of these terms. The Company’s ability to predict results or the actual effects of its plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Accordingly, actual results may differ materially from anticipated results.
Factors that could have a material adverse effect on the operations of the Company and its subsidiaries include, but are not limited to, changes in market interest rates, general economic conditions, legislation, and regulation; changes in monetary and fiscal policies of the United States Government, including policies of the United States Treasury and Federal Reserve Board; changes in the quality or composition of the loan or investment portfolios; changes in deposit flows, competition, and demand for financial services, loans, deposits and investment products in the Company’s local markets; changes in accounting principles and guidelines; war or terrorist activities; and other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory, geopolitical and technological factors affecting the Company’s operations, pricing and services. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this discussion. Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, the Company cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Except as required by applicable law or regulation, the Company undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date on which such statements were made.
Critical Accounting Policies
Critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the Company’s financial position and results of operations that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experiences and management’s judgment. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates. Below are those policies applied in preparing the Company’s consolidated financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions. For additional accounting policies, see Note 2 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”
Allowance for Loan Losses
Loans receivable are presented net of an allowance for loan losses and net deferred loan fees. In determining the appropriate level of the allowance, management considers a combination of factors, such as economic and industry trends, real estate market conditions, size and type of loans in portfolio, nature and value of collateral held, borrowers’ financial strength and credit ratings, and prepayment and default history. The calculation of the appropriate allowance for loan losses requires a substantial amount of judgment regarding the impact of the aforementioned factors, as well as other factors, on the ultimate realization of loans receivable. In addition, our determination of the amount of the allowance for loan losses is subject to review by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance and the FDIC, as part of their examination process. After a review of the information available, our regulators might require the establishment of an additional allowance. Any increase in the allowance for loan loss required by regulators would have a negative impact on our earnings.
Other-than-Temporary Impairment of Securities
If the fair value of a security is less than its amortized cost, the security is deemed to be impaired. Management evaluates all securities with unrealized losses quarterly to determine if such impairments are “temporary” or “other-than-temporary” in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 320, Investments - Debt Securities. Accordingly, temporary impairments are accounted for based upon the classification of the related securities as either available for sale or held to maturity.
Temporary impairments on available for sale securities are recognized, on a tax-effected basis, through Other Comprehensive Income (“OCI”) with offsetting entries adjusting the carrying value of the securities and the balance of deferred taxes. Conversely, the carrying values of held to maturity securities are not adjusted for temporary impairments. Information concerning the amount and duration of temporary impairments on both available for sale and held to maturity securities is generally disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Other-than-temporary impairments are accounted for based upon several considerations. First, other-than-temporary impairments on debt securities that the Company has decided to sell as of the close of a fiscal period, or will, more likely than not, be required to sell prior to the full recovery of fair value to a level equal to or exceeding amortized cost, are recognized in earnings. If neither of these conditions regarding the likelihood of the sale of debt securities are applicable, then the other-than-temporary impairment is bifurcated into credit-related and noncredit-related components. A credit-related impairment represents the amount by which the present value of the cash flows that are expected to be collected on a debt security fall below its amortized cost. The noncredit-related component represents the remaining portion of the impairment not otherwise designated as credit-related. Credit-related other-than-temporary impairments are recognized in earnings and noncredit-related other-than-temporary impairments are recognized in OCI.
Deferred Income Taxes
The Company records income taxes using the asset and liability method. Accordingly, deferred tax assets and liabilities: (i) are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements or the consolidated and separate entity tax returns; (ii) are attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases; and (iii) are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making this assessment, management considers the profitability of current core operations, future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and ongoing, feasible and permissible tax planning strategies. Deferred tax assets have been reduced by a valuation allowance for all portions determined not likely to be realized. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period of enactment. The valuation allowance is adjusted, by a charge or credit to income tax expense, as changes in facts and circumstances warrant.
Goodwill
The Company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other,” which allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. Based on a quantitative assessment, management determined that the Company’s recorded goodwill totaling $5.2 million, which resulted from the 2018 acquisition IAB, is not impaired as of December 31, 2020.
COVID-19 Overview
With the global outbreak of COVID-19, the Company remains focused on protecting the health and wellbeing of its employees and the communities in which it operates while assuring the continuity of its business operations.
The Company activated its dedicated pandemic team that proactively implemented its business continuity plans and has taken a variety of measures to ensure the ongoing availability of services, while taking health and safety measures, including enhanced cleaning and hygiene protocols in all of its facilities and remote work policies, where possible. To date, as a result of these business continuity measures, the Company has not experienced significant disruptions in its operations.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had over $260 million of cash on hand and available wholesale borrowing capacity of over $770 million.
COVID-19 Response
Operational Initiatives
oThe pandemic response team meets on an as-needed basis and actively monitors guidance released by regulators and banking associations.
oIn-person meetings are closely managed and are held on an as needed basis only.
oMany employees are working remotely, temporarily relocated or are working alternate days to increase social distancing.
oBarriers have been installed in branches and back offices to provide protection.
oBranch and operational offices are cleaned and sanitized biweekly and employees have access to masks, gloves and disinfectant.
oMasks are required for entry and social distancing is strictly enforced.
oManagement provides updates to employees on a regular basis.
oThe Call Center is open seven days a week to assist with customer inquiries.
oBeginning on January 11, 2021, branch offices began offering appointment banking services to lessen the spread of the virus and to protect employees and customers. We have recommended that our customers utilize our ATM and drive-through services wherever possible.
Allowance for Loan Losses (“ALLL”)
oAs several of the Company’s asset quality metrics have been adversely affected in 2020, management determined it is prudent to increase its loan loss reserves through the addition of $1.9 million and $9.4 million in loan loss provisions for the three-month and full-year periods ended December 31, 2020, respectively, due primarily to the economic downturn as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This compares to a credit of $475,000 and $2.1 million in loan loss provisions for the three-month and full-year periods ended December 31, 2019, respectively. The loan loss reserve to total loans ratio was 1.44 percent at December 31, 2020, compared to 1.08 percent at December 31, 2019. The increased reserve includes provisions taken in response to changes in risks associated with loan classification assignments, increases in impaired loans and a declining economy in New Jersey and New York.
oThe Bank considered qualitative factors, such as changes in underwriting policies, current economic conditions, delinquency statistics, the adequacy of the underlying collateral and the financial strength of borrowers in arriving at its loan loss provision. All of these factors are likely to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Individual deferred loans were stress tested to assess potential credit risks. The impact of COVID-19 is likely to be felt over the next several quarters. Adjustments to the ALLL may be required as the full impact of COVID-19 on the borrowers’ capacity to make payments and the value of the underlying collateral becomes known.
Loan Deferments
oThe Bank, like other financial institutions, has received a significant number of requests to defer principal and/or interest payments, and has agreed to such deferrals or is in the process of doing so on a case by case basis. The banking regulatory agencies, through an Interagency Statement dated April 7, 2020, encouraged financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who request loan modifications or deferrals as a result of COVID-19.
oThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, was signed into law on March 27, 2020, and provided over $2.0 trillion in emergency economic relief to individuals and businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Under Section 4013 of the CARES Act, loans less than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019 will be considered current for COVID-19 modifications. A financial institution can then suspend the requirements under GAAP for loan modifications related to COVID-19 that would otherwise be categorized as a TDR, and suspend any determination of a loan modified as a result of COVID-19 as being a TDR, including the requirement to determine impairment for accounting purposes. Most of these loans are accruing interest and the Bank is considering the loans within the overall allowance for loan loss analysis.
oThe Bank began receiving requests for loan deferments on March 13, 2020. The forbearance period provided by the Bank was generally three months with the Bank retaining the sole option to extend the forbearance period for an additional three months. Payments received upon the expiration of the forbearance period were first applied to interest accrued, then towards escrow advances, and any remaining amount towards principal.
The Bank has worked diligently with its customers by reaching out to them as the end of the three-month deferral term was approaching, and to understand the need for any prudent requests of an extension of the deferral period. The Bank has been encouraged with the results. The status of active loans at December 31, 2020 that had requested deferrals is as follows:
Management continues to perform detailed stress testing of loan deferments related to various loan to value and cash flow scenarios. The specific ALLL reserves allocated to these stress tests are deemed to be adequate and will continue to be analyzed as the economic conditions progress.
Paycheck Protection Program (PPP)
oAs a qualified SBA lender, the Bank was automatically authorized to originate PPP loans.
oThe Bank had closed and funded approximately $133 million for almost 1,100 PPP loans.
oThe Company received processing fees from the SBA and recorded approximately $980,000 of net fees to interest income during the year and a net gain of $333,000 on the sale of these loans in December 2020.
Main Street lending Program
oThe Main Street Lending Program is a program announced on April 9, 2020, under which the Federal Reserve will purchase loans that banks give to small and mid-sized businesses. The Federal Reserve will purchase 95 percent of each loan.
oThe program is designed to keep credit flowing to small and mid-sized businesses that were in good financial standing before the onset of the COVID-19 crisis, but which are now under extreme stress due to stay-at-home and business closure orders from state and local governments. The Bank has been approved as an eligible lender, and has received inquiries since the program became operational on July 8, 2020 but has not funded any loans under this program.
‎
Industry Exposure
oThe Company has identified various industries that may be particularly adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Deferrals are loans in which payment was deferred for a period of three to six months. COVID-modified loans are not considered TDR-restructured loans under the CARES Act. Though the hotspots may change through the progression of the pandemic, the following identifies the sectors with the most deferment requests, and the status of these loans at December 31, 2020 (Dollars in Thousands):
IT Changes
oTo protect the well-being of our staff and customers, the Company has set up resources for some employees to work from home. To facilitate the move, we allocated laptop computers to staff and enhanced our ability to access the network offsite.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
oThe Company was well positioned with adequate levels of cash and liquid assets as of December 31, 2020, as well as wholesale borrowing capacity of over $770 million. At December 31, 2020, the Company’s equity to asset ratio was 8.83 percent and the Bank’s capital was in excess of regulatory requirements. The Company will continue to monitor the effects of COVID-19 in determining future cash dividends and any requirement for additional capital each quarter.
Financial Condition at December 31, 2020 and 2019
Total assets decreased by $86.5 million, or 3.0 percent, to $2.821 billion at December 31, 2020 from $2.908 billion at December 31, 2019. The decrease in total assets was mainly related to decreases in total cash and cash equivalents, partly offset by increases in loans receivable, a purchase of $60.0 million of BOLI, and purchases of investment securities.
Total cash and cash equivalents decreased by $289.1 million, or 52.5 percent, to $261.2 million at December 31, 2020 from $550.3 million at December 31, 2019. This decrease was mainly related to increases in loans receivable and investment securities, a purchase of $60.0 million of BOLI, net repayments of borrowings and a decrease in deposits.
Loans receivable, net increased by $116.6 million, or 5.4 percent, to $2.295 billion at December 31, 2020 from $2.178 billion at December 31, 2019. Total loan increases for the year ended December 31, 2020 included increases of $83.9 million in commercial real estate and multi-family loans, $51.0 million in construction loans, $6.7 million in commercial business loans, and $140,000 in consumer loans, partly offset by decreases of $11.0 million in home equity loans and $4.0 million in residential one-to-four family loan. Included within the net increase in loans receivable were $48.4 million of purchased loans, which the Company bought in the second quarter of 2020. The allowance for loan losses increased $9.9 million to $33.6 million, or 205.2 percent of non-accruing loans and 1.44 percent of gross loans, at December 31, 2020 as compared to an allowance for loan losses of $23.7 million, or 570.5 percent of non-accruing loans and 1.08 percent of gross loans, at December 31, 2019.
Total investment securities increased by $23.4 million, or 24.8 percent, to $117.5 million at December 31, 2020 from $94.1 million at December 31, 2019, representing purchases of $77.1 million in securities, partly offset by sales, repayments, calls and maturities.
Deposit liabilities decreased by $44.0 million, or 1.9 percent, to $2.318 billion at December 31, 2020 from $2.362 billion at December 31, 2019. The decrease in deposit liabilities mainly related to the maturity of certain high-rate, promotional certificate of deposit accounts in the third and fourth quarters. Some of these matured deposits went into other forms of deposits and others were withdrawn from the Bank. Total decreases for the year ended December 31, 2020 included $440.9 million in certificates of deposit, including listing service and brokered deposit accounts. Listing service and brokered certificates of deposit, which were used as additional sources of deposit liquidity to fund loan growth, totaled $17.0 million and $20.0 million, respectively, at December 31, 2020. The decreases in these categories of total deposit liabilities was partly offset by increases of $219.8 million in NOW deposit accounts, $130.4 million in non-interest-bearing deposit accounts, $37.2 million in savings and club accounts, and $9.4 million in money market checking accounts.
Debt obligations decreased by $54.4 million, or 19.3 percent, to $228.2 million at December 31, 2020 from $282.6 million at December 31, 2019. The weighted average interest rate of FHLB advances was 1.66 percent at December 31, 2020 and 2.16 percent at December 31, 2019. The fixed interest rate of our subordinated debt balances was 5.625 percent at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company opted to extinguish $47.0 million in FHLB advances which held a weighted average rate of 2.24%. The advances were originally set to mature in 2021 and 2022. The effect of the extinguishment of the debt reduced the weighted average cost of FHLB borrowings by approximately 12 basis points on an annualized basis. The related expense for the extinguishment of this debt is included in noninterest expense.
Stockholders’ equity increased by $9.7 million, or 4.1 percent, to $249.2 million at December 31, 2020 from $239.5 million at December 31, 2019. Retained earnings increased by $9.9 million, or 20.5 percent, to $58.3 million at December 31, 2020 from $48.4 million at December 31, 2019, related to the net effect of net income less dividends paid for the year ended December 31, 2020. Accumulated other comprehensive income increased $2.0 million to a loss of $205,000 at December 31, 2020 from a loss of $2.2 million at December 31, 2019, related to significant improvements in the value of available-for-sale securities, as a result of the general decrease in market interest rates. Additional paid-in-capital for preferred stock increased by $707,000 to $25.7 million at December 31, 2020 from $25.0 million at December 31, 2019, primarily related to the issuance of $11.2 million of Series H 3.5% preferred stock, partly offset by the redemption of $10.5 million of the Company’s then-outstanding preferred stock, which included the Company’s Series C 6% and Series F 6% preferred stock. Treasury stock increased $4.9 million to $26.9 million at December 31, 2020 from $22.0 million at December 31, 2019, related to the repurchase of Company common shares.
Analysis of Net Interest Income
Net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income depends on the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on them, respectively.
The following table sets forth average balance sheets, yields and costs, and certain other information for the years indicated. All average balances are daily average balances. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts and premiums, which are included in interest income.
___________________________
(1) Excludes allowance for loan losses.
(2) Includes Federal Home Loan Bank of New York stock.
(3) Interest rate spread represents the difference between the average yield on interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities.
(4) Net interest margin represents net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets.
Rate/Volume Analysis
The table below sets forth certain information regarding changes in our interest income and interest expense for the years indicated. For each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to (i) changes in average volume (changes in average volume multiplied by old rate); (ii) changes in rate (change in rate multiplied by old average volume); (iii) changes due to combined changes in rate and volume; and (iv) the net change.
Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Net income decreased by $177,000, or 0.8 percent, to $20.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in net income was primarily related to a decrease in total interest income and an increase in the provision for loan losses, partly offset by an increase in total noninterest income, a decrease in total interest expense, a decrease in total noninterest expense, and a decrease in the income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2019.
Net interest income decreased by $2.2 million, or 2.7 percent, to $80.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $82.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in total interest income resulted primarily from a decrease in the average yield on interest-earning assets of 60 basis points to 3.99 percent for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 4.59 percent for the year ended December 31, 2019, partly offset by an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets of $147.7 million, or 5.5 percent, to $2.840 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $2.692 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in total interest expense related to a decrease in the average rate on interest-bearing liabilities of 38 basis points to 1.44 percent for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 1.82 percent for the year ended December 31, 2019, partly offset by an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities of $41.2 million, or 1.8 percent, to $2.292 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $2.251 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. The lower rates for interest income and interest expense were driven by the reduction of the federal funds rate by 175 basis points from October, 2019 through March, 2020.
Interest income on loans receivable decreased by $6.8 million, or 6.0 percent, to $107.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $114.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the average yield on loans of 32 basis points to 4.62 percent for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 4.94 percent for the year ended December 31, 2019, partly offset by an increase in the average balance of loans receivable of $14.3 million, or 0.6 percent, to $2.320 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $2.305 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. In the second quarter of 2020, the Company purchased $48.4 million in loans and originated $127.0 million in PPP loans, which increased the average balance of loans receivable for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The Bank sold nearly all of its PPP loans in the fourth quarter of 2020, and had recognized $908,000 in net deferred fee income for those loans. The decrease in the average yield on loans followed the declining interest rate environment. Interest income on loans also included $1.2 million of amortization of purchase credit fair value adjustments related to the April 2018 acquisition of IAB, for the year ended December 31, 2020, which added approximately six basis points to the average yield on interest earning assets.
Interest income on securities increased by $128,000 or 3.9 percent, to $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of securities of $2.5 million, or 2.2 percent, to $118.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $115.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as well as an increase in the average yield on securities of five basis points to 2.91 percent for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 2.86 percent for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in the average balance of securities resulted from the purchases of new securities, partly offset by faster prepayment speeds, sales, repayments, calls, and maturities, while the increase in the average yield on securities related to higher-yield securities purchased during the year.
Interest income on other interest-earning assets decreased by $3.4 million, or 54.7 percent, to $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the average yield on other interest-earning assets of 161 basis points to 0.71 percent for the year ended December 31, 2020, from 2.32 percent for the year ended December 31, 2019, partly offset by an increase in the average balance of other interest earning assets of $130.9 million, or 48.3 percent, to $402.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $271.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in the average yield on other interest-earning assets correlated to the decreases in the Fed funds rate. The increase in the average balance of other interest-earning assets related to the curtailment of loan growth beginning in 2019, high levels of loan prepayments, an increase in deposits, and the Company’s strategy of maintaining strong levels of liquidity.
Total interest expense decreased by $7.9 million, or 19.4 percent, to $33.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $40.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in the average rate on interest-bearing liabilities of 38 basis points to 1.44 percent for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 1.82 percent for the year ended December 31, 2019, partly offset by an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities of $41.2 million, or 1.8 percent, to $2.292 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $2.251 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in the average cost of funds related to the declining interest rate environment. The increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities primarily resulted from increased deposits, including those from new branches opened over the last few years.
Total deposit interest expense decreased by $7.1 million, or 21.5 percent, to $25.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $33.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in the average rate on deposits of 40 basis points to 1.29 percent for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 1.69 percent for the year ended December 31, 2019, partly offset by an increase in the average balance of deposits of $59.3 million, or 3.0 percent, to $2.016 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $1.956 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in the average rate paid on deposits was primarily due to repricing our deposit base to align with the recent Fed rate reductions. The increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities primarily resulted from increased deposits, including those from new branches opened over the last few years.
Total borrowing interest expense decreased by $813,000, or 10.3 percent, to $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The average balance of borrowings decreased by $18.2 million, or 6.2 percent, to $276.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $294.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as well as a decrease in the average rate on borrowings of 12 basis points to 2.56 percent for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 2.68 percent for the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company opted to extinguish $47.0 million in FHLB advances which held a weighted average rate of 2.24%. The advances were originally set to mature in 2021 and 2022. The extinguishment of this debt decreased both the average balance of borrowings and the average rate on borrowings for the year ended December 31, 2020. The effect of the extinguishment of the debt reduced the weighted average cost of FHLB borrowings by approximately 12 basis points on an annualized basis. The related non-recurring expense for the extinguishment of this debt is included in noninterest expense.
Net interest margin was 2.83 percent for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 3.07 percent for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in the net interest margin was the result of the current volatile financial market attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has fueled the low interest rate environment.
The provision for loan losses increased by $7.4 million to $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The provision for loan losses is established based upon management’s review of the Company’s loans and consideration of a variety of factors, including but not limited to: (1) the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio; (2) current economic conditions; (3) actual losses previously experienced; (4) the dynamic activity and fluctuating balance of loans receivable; and (5) the existing level of reserves for loan losses that are probable and estimable. The higher provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 was significantly influenced by the impact of COVID-19 on economic conditions and the increased risk of loan defaults. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company experienced $465,000 in net recoveries compared to $694,000 in net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2019. The Bank had non-accrual loans totaling $16.4 million, or 0.70 percent, of gross loans at December 31, 2020 as compared to $4.2 million, or 0.19 percent, of gross loans at December 31, 2019. The allowance for loan losses was $33.6 million, or 1.44 percent of gross loans at December 31, 2020, and $23.7 million, or 1.08 percent of gross loans at December 31, 2019. The amount of the allowance is based on estimates and the ultimate losses may vary from such estimates. Management assesses the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis and makes provisions for loan losses as necessary in order to maintain the adequacy of the allowance. While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans, future loan loss provisions may be necessary based on changes in the aforementioned criteria. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the allowance for loan losses and may require the Company to recognize additional provisions based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination. Management believes that the allowance for loan losses was adequate at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.
Total noninterest income increased by $7.1 million, or 131.7 percent, to $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in total noninterest income was mainly related to a gain on sale of premises of $4.4 million, an increase in the realized and unrealized gain on equity securities of $1.6 million, BOLI income of $1.0 million, an increase in the gain on sale of investment securities of $702,000, and an increase in other noninterest income of $248,000, partly offset by a decrease in fees and service charges of $411,000, a decrease in gains on the sale of other real estate owned properties of $215,000, a decrease of $144,000 in gains on the sale of loans, and a decrease in the gains on the sale of impaired loans of $81,000. The gain on sale of premises relates to the completion of a sale/leaseback of certain offices that the Company sold to a private investor group in September, 2020. The unrealized gains or losses on equity securities are based on market conditions. The BOLI income relates to an initial purchase of $60.0 million of BOLI product in the third quarter of 2020. The increase in other noninterest income related primarily to the reversal of certain liabilities previously recorded for IAB acquired loans that paid off in 2020. The lower level of loan sales was attributable to the curtailment of loan growth, while the decline in fees and service charges related in part to the pandemic condition as well as lower servicing fee income resulting from fewer loan sales.
Total noninterest expense decreased by $1.5 million, or 2.8 percent, to $54.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $55.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Salaries and employee benefits expense decreased by $2.5 million, or 8.9 percent, to $25.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $28.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily related to $1.3 million of costs deferred for PPP loans and fewer full-time equivalent employees, partly offset by normal compensation increases. The costs deferred represent current period salaries and benefit costs associated with direct PPP loan origination costs, which were initially amortized over the life of the loan, and then expensed in calculating the gain when the loans were sold. The average number of full-time equivalent employees for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 329, as compared with 361 for the same period in 2019.
Occupancy and equipment expense increased by $1.1 million, or 10.2 percent, to $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, largely related to building sanitization costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the addition of the Newark branch during 2020.
Professional fees expense decreased $351,000, or 17.3 percent, to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily related to a legal settlement provided for in the prior-year period.
Data processing and service fees increased by $625,000, or 19.6 percent, to $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, largely attributable to additional branches and system applications.
Regulatory assessments increased by $430,000, or 47.0 percent, to $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $914,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily related to the receipt of FDIC Small Bank Assessment Credits of $548,000 in the year ended December 31, 2019, and increases in the assessment rate and in the assessment base.
The Company recognized an expense of $1.1 million for a loss on extinguishment of debt, related to prepayments of high-cost FHLB borrowings, for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Other noninterest expense decreased by $1.9 million, or 22.7 percent, to $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Other noninterest expense consisted of loan expense, business development, office supplies, correspondent bank fees, telephone and communication and miscellaneous fees and expenses. The decrease in the current period was primarily related to a reduction of business development and loan-related expenses, largely attributable to the current pandemic condition.
There were also less significant variances in advertising expense, other real estate owned expense, and directors’ fees, which netted to a decrease in expenses of $10,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
The income tax provision decreased by $743,000, or 8.0 percent, to $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in the income tax provision was a result of lower taxable income and a lower effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to that same period for 2019. The consolidated effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 29.1 percent compared to 30.7 percent for the year ended December 31, 2019. The lower rate in the current period related primarily to non-taxable BOLI income and lower non-deductible costs in the current year period.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The overall objective of our liquidity management practices is to ensure the availability of sufficient funds to meet financial commitments and to take advantage of lending and investment opportunities. The Company manages liquidity in order to meet deposit withdrawals on demand or at contractual maturity, to repay borrowings and other obligations as they mature, and to fund loan and investment portfolio opportunities as they arise.
The Company’s primary sources of funds to satisfy its objectives are net growth in deposits (primarily retail), principal and interest payments on loans and investment securities, proceeds from the sale of originated loans and FHLB and other borrowings. The scheduled amortization of loans is a predictable source of funds. Deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. The Company has other sources of liquidity if a need for additional funds arises, including unsecured overnight lines of credit and other collateralized borrowings from the FHLB and other correspondent banks.
At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company had no overnight borrowings outstanding with the FHLB. The Company utilizes overnight borrowings from time to time to fund short-term liquidity needs. The Company had total outstanding borrowings of $228.2 million at December 31, 2020 as compared to $282.6 million at December 31, 2019.
At December 31, 2020, the Company had the ability to obtain additional funding from the FHLB of $245.7 million, utilizing unencumbered loan collateral. The Company expects to have sufficient funds available to meet current loan commitments in the normal course of business through typical sources of liquidity. Time deposits scheduled to mature in one year or less totaled $581.3 million at December 31, 2020. Based upon historical experience data, management estimates that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with the Company.
The Company was well-positioned with adequate levels of cash and liquid assets as of December 31, 2020, as well as wholesale borrowing capacity of over $770 million, to cover the decrease in cash flow resulting from COVID-19 loan deferments.
At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the capital ratios of the Bank exceeded the quantitative capital ratios required for an institution to be considered “well-capitalized”.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Bank engages in a variety of financial transactions that, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, are not recorded in the financial statements. These transactions include commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit. While these contractual obligations represent future cash requirements, a portion of our commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon.
