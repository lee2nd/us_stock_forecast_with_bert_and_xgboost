ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Our management’s discussion and analysis provides a narrative about our financial performance and condition that should be read in conjunction with the audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in this annual report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward looking statements reflecting our current expectations and estimates and assumptions about events and trends that may affect our future operating results or financial position. Our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth in the sections of this annual report on Form 10-K titled “Risk Factors” beginning at page 13 above and “Forward-Looking Statements” beginning at page 4 above.
Results of Operations
Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Our cash as of December 31, 2020 was $52,702. As a result of our minimal amount of revenues and ongoing expenditures in pursuit of our business, we have incurred net losses since our inception. Our accumulated deficit at December 31, 2020 was $36,569,246. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our net loss was $4,125,363.
Our operating revenues and expenses for our fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and the changes between those periods for the respective items are summarized as follows:
Revenues
Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased to $401,905 as compared to $242,696 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in revenue was primarily due to receiving additional contracts to develop an app for a third party.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the December 31, 2019 were $2,176,760 and $1,284,822 respectively, an increase of 69.4%. The increase in operating expenses was due primarily to costs associated with the launch of the Fan Pass app on July 24, 2020, which entailed higher software development costs to complete the app and artists’ fees for live streaming performances at the app launch, coupled with increased expenditures on sales and marketing and investor relations related to launch.
Net Loss
Our operating results have recognized net loss in the amount of $4,125,363 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to a net loss of $10,183,410 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily related to a loss on extinguishments of debt and to a provision for settlement of a lawsuit in 2019, which did not occur in 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Working Capital
Current liabilities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $5,436,963 and $16,041,805 respectively, a decrease of $10,604,842. The primary reason for the decrease was a reduction in derivative liabilities by $ 11,458,000 attributable to the conversion to common stock of certain convertible debentures and promissory notes during 2020, offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $450,380.
We currently do not have sufficient capital to fund our needs for the next 12 months. We rely on financing from convertible debt, promissory notes, and sale of stock to fund our operations.
Cash Flows
Operating Activities
Cash provided by operating activities
The Company used $492,080 in cash from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to a use of $488,864 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is due to expenditures related to the launch of the Fan Pass app.
Cash provided by financing activities
Financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 generated cash of $533,500 as compared to generating $474,500 of cash for the year ended December 31, 2019. The higher cash provided from financing activities in the current year is primarily attributable to proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes ,the receipt of short-term loans and proceeds from sales of common stock and convertible Series C preferred stock.
There was no significant impact on the Company’s operations as a result of inflation for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Series B Preferred Stock Purchase Agreements
On August 8, 2019 the Company filed a Designation of Series B convertible Preferred Stock with the state of Nevada, designating 1,000,000 shares of the Series B Preferred Stock with a stated value of $1.00 per share. A holder of Series B Preferred Stock has the right to convert their Series 30 days following the first day of the month following the initial issuance of the Series B Preferred and continuing for a period of 60 (Sixty) months. The holders of Series B Preferred stock shall have no voting rights. The holders of Series B Preferred stock shall not be entitled to receive any dividends. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company or deemed liquidation event, the holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to be paid the liquidation amount, as defined out of the assets of the Company available for distribution to its shareholders, after distributions to holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and before distributions to holders of Common Stock B Preferred Stock into fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock. Initially, the conversion price for the Series B Preferred Stock is $.25 per share, subject to standard anti-dilution adjustments. Additionally, each share of Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to, as a dividend, a pro rata portion of an amount equal to 10% (Ten Percent) of the Net Revenues (“Net Revenues” being Gross Sales minus Cost of Goods Sold) derived from the subscriptions and other sales, but excluding and net of Vimeo fees, processing fees and up sells, generated by Fan Pass Inc., the wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation. The Series B Dividend shall be calculated and paid on a monthly basis in arrears starting on the day.

The Series C Preferred Stock does not have any voting rights. Each share of Series C Preferred Stock will carry an annual dividend in the amount of eight percent (8%) of the Stated Value of $1.00 (the “Divided Rate”), which shall be cumulative and compounded daily, payable solely upon redemption, liquidation or conversion and increase to 22% upon an event of default as defined. In the event of any default other than the Company’s failure to issue shares upon conversion, the stated price will be $1.50. In a default event where the Company fails to issue shares upon conversion, the stated price will $2.00. The holder shall have the right six months following the issuance date, to convert all or any part of the outstanding Series C Preferred Stock into shares of common stock of the Company. The conversion price shall equal the Variable Conversion Price. The “Variable Conversion Price” shall mean 71% multiplied by the market price, representing a discount rate of 29%. Market price means the average of the two lowest trading prices for the Company’s common stock during the twenty trading day period ending on the latest complete trading day prior to the conversion date. Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, or upon any deemed liquidation event, after payment or provision for payment of debts and other liabilities of the Company, and after payment or provision for any liquidation preference payable to the holders of any Preferred Stock ranking senior upon liquidation to the Series C Preferred Stock, if any, but prior to any distribution or payment made to the holders of Common Stock or the holders of any Preferred Stock ranking junior upon liquidation to the Series C Preferred Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, the Holders will be entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Company available for distribution to its stockholders. The Company will have the right, at the Company’s option, to redeem all or any portion of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock, exercisable on not more than three trading days prior written notice to the Holders, in full, in accordance with Section 6 of the designations at a premium of up to 35% for up to six months.

On May 29, 2020 the Company defaulted on the shares by being late with the filing of the Form 10-K, thereby increasing the dividend rate to 22% and the stated value to $1.50 per share. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, 38,000 shares of Series C convertible preferred stock were issued to an investor under preferred stock purchase agreements at a price of approximately $0.87 per share for a total of $33,000.
During the three months ended September 30, 2020 the holder of the Series C converted 62,500 Series C shares to 3,822,958 common shares for a redemption value of $96,750 including accrued dividends plus premium of $38,292, which totaled $135,042 recorded into equity.

Debt Restructure Agreement
On March 26, 2019 three officers forgave debt totaling $400,000 and a company controlled by two officers of the Company forgave debt totaling $600,000. The debt forgiveness is considered a capital transaction and therefore $1,000,000 was recorded as an increase in additional paid-in capital for December 31, 2019.
On March 26, 2019, the Company entered into a Debt Restructuring Agreement with related parties Robert A. Rositano Jr., Dean Rositano , Frank Garcia , and Checkmate Mobile, Inc. and Alpha Capital Anstalt , Coventry Enterprises, LLC , Palladium Capital Advisors, LLC, EMA Financial, LLC, Michael Finkelstein, and Barbara R. Mittman, each being a debt holder of the Company.
The debt holders agreed to convert their debt of approximately $6.3 million and accrued interest of approximately $1.8 million into an initial 5,902,589 shares of common stock as set forth in the Agreement upon the Company meeting certain milestones including but not limited to: the Company effecting a reverse stock split and maintaining a stock price of $1.00 per share; being current with its periodic report filings pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act; certain vendors and Company employees forgiving an aggregate of $1,000,000 in amounts owed to them; the Company raising not less than $400,000 in common stock at a post-split price of not less than $.20 per share; and certain other things as further set forth in the Agreement. The debt holders will be subject to certain lock up and leak out provisions as contained in the Agreement. As part of the Agreement the parties signed a Rights to Shares Agreement. Whereas the Agreement called for all the shares to be delivered at closing, the holders are generally restricted to beneficial ownership of up to 4.99% of the company’s common shares outstanding. The Rights to Shares Agreement allows for the Company to issue shares to each holder up the 4.99% limitation while preserving the holders’ rights to the total shares in schedule A of the Agreement. Accordingly, the 5,902,589 common shares were recorded as issuable in equity, On December 26, 2019, all parties signed an amendment to the Agreement which set forth, among other things, the following:
Company Principals have given Holders notice that it has satisfied all conditions of closing.
The Agreement is considered Closed as of November 5, 2019 (“Settlement Date”) and any conditions of closing not satisfied are waived.
Reset Dates. The “Reset Dates” as set forth in Section 1(h) of the Agreement shall be as follows: March 4, 2020 and July 2, 2020. As of the reset dates the holders can convert all or part of the settled note amounts at the lower of (i) 75% of the closing bid price for the Common Stock on such respective Reset Date, or (ii) the VWAP for the Company’s Common Stock for the 7 trading days immediately preceding and including such respective Reset Dates. This reset provision provides for the issuance of additional shares above the initial 5,902,589 shares for no additional consideration as measured at each of the two reset dates.
On March 4, 2020 the Company became obligated to issue an additional 36,193,098 shares of common stock and on July 2, 2020 it became obligated to issue an additional 63,275,242 shares, for a total amount of shares due of 105,370,930.
On September 21, 2020, Ellis International LP (as successor to Alpha Capital Anstalt) submitted a request to drawdown and, on September 29, 2020, was issued 687,355 common shares against its entitlement above and reclassified from issuable shares in the accompanying balance sheet and statement of changes in stockholder equity.
On November 9, 2020 and on December 9, 2020 Coventry Enterprises requested and was issued 915,000 and 1,262,000 common shares respectively, and on November 23, 2020 Barbara Mittman requested and was issued 1,134,353 (net) common shares against their respective entitlement under the debt settlement agreement, which was reclassified from issuable shares.
Going Concern
At December 31, 2020, we had a working capital deficiency, an accumulated deficit, and a stockholders’ deficit of $5,288,362, $36,569,246 and $5,288,362 respectively and incurred a net loss and cash used in operations of $3,949,156 and $492,080 respectively in 2020. We have generated minimal revenues and have incurred losses since inception. Accordingly, we will be dependent on future additional financing in order to seek other business opportunities in the online entertainment industry or new business opportunities. We are considered a development stage company in the online entertainment industry. As of December 31, 2020, there is no assurance that we will be able raise sufficient capital to sustain our operations. We expect to incur further losses in the development of our business, all of which casts substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due.
Application of Critical Accounting Policies
Use of Estimates
The preparation of these statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses in the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to valuation of convertible debenture conversion options, derivative instruments, deferred income tax asset valuations, financial instrument valuations, share-based payments, other equity-based payments, and loss contingencies. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to bereasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company’s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.
Revenue Recognition
In accordance with ASC 606, revenue is recognized when the following criteria have been met; valid contracts are identified with specific customers, performance obligations have been identified, price is determinable, price is allocated to performance obligations, and the Company has satisfied the performance obligations. Revenue generally is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company derived revenues primarily from the development of apps for a third party of $ 397,333 and $ 239,477 respectively, and such revenues were recognized upon completion of services. Secondarily, the Company’s other revenues from subscription fees and merchandising sales from the Friendable and Fan Pass apps totaled $4,572 for the year ended December 31,2020 (2019:$3,225) and were recognized when received.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances are present, we assess the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows.
If the total of the future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell.
Stock-based compensation
We record stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Based Compensation, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense based on estimated fair values for all share-based awards made to employees and directors, including stock options. In 2019 the Company adapted ASU 2018-17 which expands the measurement requirements to non employees.
ASC 718 requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model as its method in determining fair value. This model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables. These subjective variables include, but are not limited to our expected stock price volatility over the terms of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense in the statement of operations over the requisite service period.
Financial Instruments
FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell anasset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value, as required by ASC 820, must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurements requires judgment, and may affect the valuation of the assets and liabilities being measured and their placement within the fair value hierarchy. The carrying values of accounts payable, convertible debentures and promissory note approximate fair values because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. Unless otherwise noted, it is management’s opinion that we are not exposed to significant interest, currency or credit risks arising from these financial instruments.
Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Share
We compute net loss per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share. ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the statement of operations. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
We have implemented all other new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off -balance sheet arrangements
