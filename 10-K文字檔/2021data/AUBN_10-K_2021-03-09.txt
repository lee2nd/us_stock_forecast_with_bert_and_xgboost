31, 2020 and 2019 and our results of operations for
the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The
purpose of this discussion is to provide information about our financial
condition and results of operations which is not otherwise apparent
from the consolidated financial statements. The
following discussion and analysis should be read along with
our consolidated financial statements and the related notes
included elsewhere herein. In addition, this discussion and analysis
contains forward-looking statements, so you should
refer to Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and “Special Cautionary Notice
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”.
OVERVIEW
The Company was incorporated in 1990 under the laws of the State of
Delaware and became a bank holding company after
it acquired its Alabama predecessor,
which was a bank holding company established in 1984. The Bank,
the Company's
principal subsidiary, is an Alabama
state-chartered bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System
and has operated
continuously since 1907. Both the Company and the Bank are
headquartered in Auburn, Alabama. The Bank conducts its
business primarily in East Alabama, including Lee County and
surrounding areas. The Bank operates full-service branches
in Auburn, Opelika, Notasulga and Valley,
Alabama.
The Bank also operates loan production offices
in Auburn and
Phenix City, Alabama.

Financial Summary
The Company’s net earnings were $7.5
million for the full year 2020, compared to $9.7 million for the full year
2019.
Basic and diluted net earnings per share were $2.09 per share
for the full year 2020, compared to $2.72 per share for the full
year 2019.
The decrease in full year 2020 net earnings was primarily driven
by the negative impact of the COVID-19
pandemic, which resulted in elevated provision for loan losses,
compared to 2019, in addition to a lower interest rate
environment.
Net interest income (tax-equivalent) was $24.8 million in 2020,
a 7% decrease compared to $26.6 million in 2019.
This
decrease was primarily due to net interest margin compression
resulting from the Federal Reserve’s
interest rate reductions
in response to COVID-19.
Net interest margin (tax-equivalent) decreased
to 2.92% in 2020, compared to 3.43% in 2019,
primarily due to the lower interest rate environment and changes
in our asset mix resulting from the significant increase in
customer deposits.
At December 31, 2020, the Company’s
allowance for loan losses was $5.6 million, or 1.22%
of total loans, compared to
$4.4 million, or 0.95% of total loans, at December 31, 2019.
Excluding Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loans, the
Company’s allowance for loan
losses was 1.27% of total loans at December 31, 2020.
The Company recorded a provision
for loan losses of $1.1 million in 2020 compared to a
negative provision for loan losses of $0.3 million during 2019.
The
increase in the provision for loan losses was related to changes
in economic conditions and portfolio trends driven by the
impact of COVID-19 and resulting adverse economic conditions,
including higher unemployment in our primary market
area.
The provision for loan losses is based upon various estimates
and judgements, including the absolute level of loans,
loan growth, credit quality and the amount of net charge
-offs.
Net recoveries as a percent of average loans were 0.03% in
2020 compared to net charge-offs as a percent
of average loans of 0.03% in 2019.
Noninterest income was $5.4 million in 2020 compared to
$5.5 million in 2019.
Although total noninterest income was
largely unchanged in 2020, 2019 included a $1.7
million gain that resulted from the termination of a loan guarantee
program operated by the State of Alabama.
This decrease was partially offset by an increase
in mortgage lending income of
$1.5 million during 2020 compared to 2019, as lower interest
rates for mortgage loans increased refinancing activity and
pricing margins improved.
Noninterest expense was $19.6 million in 2020 compared to
$19.7 million in 2019.
The decrease was primarily due to a
reduction of $0.6 million in salaries and benefits expense which was offset
by an increase of $0.6 million in various
expenses related to the planned redevelopment of the Company’s
headquarters in downtown Auburn.
Income tax expense was $1.6 million in 2020 and $2.4
million in 2019 reflecting an effective tax rate of 17.72%
and
19.57%, respectively.
This change was primarily due to a decrease in the level of
earnings before taxes relative to tax-
exempt sources of income.
The Company’s effective
income tax rate is principally impacted by tax-exempt earnings
from
the Company’s investments in
municipal securities
and bank-owned life insurance.
The Company paid cash dividends of $1.02 per share in 2020,
an increase of 2% from 2019. At December 31, 2020, the
Bank’s regulatory capital ratios
were well above the minimum amounts required to be “well capitalized”
under current
regulatory standards with a total risk-based capital ratio of
18.31%, a tier 1 leverage ratio of 10.32% and common equity
tier 1 (“CET1”) of 17.27% at December 31, 2020.
COVID-19 Impact Assessment
In December 2019, COVID-19 was first reported in China and
has since spread to a number of other countries, including
the United States. In March 2020, the World
Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global
pandemic and the United
States declared a National Public Health Emergency.
The COVID-19 pandemic has severely restricted the level
of
economic activity in our markets. In response to the COVID-19
pandemic, the State of Alabama, and most other states,
have taken preventative or protective actions to prevent the spread
of the virus, including imposing restrictions on travel
and business operations and a statewide mask mandate, advising or
requiring individuals to limit or forego their time
outside of their homes, limitations on gathering of people and
social distancing, and causing temporary closures of
businesses that have been deemed to be non-essential.
Though certain of these measures have been relaxed or
eliminated,
increases in reported cases could cause these measures to be
reestablished.
Auburn University, a major
source of economic
activity in Lee County, went to
remote instruction on March 16, 2020.
Auburn University announced its guidelines for the
remainder of the 2020/2021 school year,
which involves both remote and in person instruction as well as other social
distancing measures.
The economic effects of these measures are
not presently known.
COVID-19 has significantly affected local state, national
and global health and economic activity and its future effects
are
uncertain and will depend on various factors, including, among others,
the duration and scope of the pandemic, the
development and distribution of COVID-19 testing and contact
tracing, effective drug treatments and vaccines, together
with governmental, regulatory and private sector responses.
COVID-19 has had continuing significant effects on the
economy, financial markets and
our employees, customers and vendors. Our business, financial condition
and results of
operations generally rely upon the ability of our borrowers to
make deposits and repay their loans, the value of collateral
underlying our secured loans, market value, stability and liquidity and
demand for loans and other products and services we
offer, all of which are affected
by the pandemic.
See “Balance Sheet Analysis - Loans” for supplemental COVID
disclosures.
We have implemented
a number of procedures in response to the pandemic to support
the safety and well-being of our
employees, customers and shareholders.
●
We believe our
business continuity plan has worked to provide essential banking
services to our communities and
customers, while protecting our employees’ health.
As part of our efforts to exercise social distancing in
accordance with the guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control
and the Governor of the State of Alabama,
starting March 23, 2020, we limited branch lobby service to appointment
only while continuing to operate our
branch drive-thru facilities and ATMs.
On June 1, 2020, we re-opened some of our branch lobbies as permitted
by
state public health guidelines.
We continue to provide
services through our online and other electronic channels.
In addition, we established remote work access to help employees
stay at home where job duties permit.
●
We are
focused on servicing the financial needs of our commercial and consumer
clients with extensions and
deferrals to loan customers effected by COVID-19,
provided such customers were not more than 30 days past
due
at the time of the request; and
●
We are
a participating lender in the PPP.
PPP loans are forgivable, in whole or in part, if the
proceeds are used for
payroll and other permitted purposes in accordance with the requirements
of the PPP.
These loans carry a fixed
rate of 1.00% and a term of two years (loans made before June 5,
2020) or five years (loans made on or after June
5, 2020), if not forgiven, in whole or in part.
Payments are deferred until either the date on which the Small
Business Administration (“SBA”) remits the amount of forgiveness
proceeds to the lender or the date that is 10
months after the last day of the covered period if the borrower
does not apply for forgiveness within that 10-month
period.
We believe these loans
and our participation in the program is good for our customers
and the
communities we serve.

The Company extended $36.5 million in loans to 423 small businesses
under the PPP during 2020.
We collected
approximately $1.5 million in fees related to our PPP loans,
which are being recognized net of related costs, as a yield
adjustment over the life of the underlying PPP loans.
During 2020, we received payments and forgiveness on 158
loans
totaling
$17.5 million.
The outstanding balance for the remaining 265 loans as December
31, 2020 was approximately
$19.0 million.
On December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small
Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues
Act (the “Economic Aid
Act”) was signed into law. The
Economic Aid Act provides a second $900 billion stimulus
package, including $325 billion
in additional PPP loans.
As of February 28, 2021, the Company has extended $17.4
million in loans to 169 small
businesses under the PPP provided by the Economic Aid Act.
We continue to closely
monitor this pandemic, and are working to continue our services
during the pandemic and to address
developments as those occur.
Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020
,
and our financial condition
at that date reflect only the initial effects of the pandemic,
and may not be indicative of future results or financial
conditions, including possible additional monetary or fiscal stimulus,
and the possible effects of the expiration or extension
of temporary accounting and bank regulatory relief measures
in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
As of December 31, 2020,
all of our capital ratios were in excess of all regulatory requirements to be
well capitalized.
The
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our borrowers
could result in adverse changes to credit quality and our regulatory
capital ratios.
We continue to closely

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The accounting and financial reporting policies of the Company conform
with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles and with general practices within the banking industry.
In connection with the application of those principles, we
have made judgments and estimates which, in the case of the determination
of our allowance for loan losses, our
assessment of other-than-temporary impairment, recurring and non-recurring
fair value measurements, the valuation of
other real estate owned, and the valuation of deferred tax assets,
were critical to the determination of our financial position
and results of operations. Other policies also require subjective
judgment and assumptions and may accordingly impact our
financial position and results of operations.
Allowance for Loan Losses
The Company assesses the adequacy of its allowance for loan
losses prior to the end of each calendar quarter.
The level of
the allowance is based upon management’s
evaluation of the loan portfolio, past loan loss experience,
current asset quality
trends, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations
that may affect a borrower’s ability to
repay (including
the timing of future payment), the estimated value of any underlying
collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, economic
conditions, industry and peer bank loan loss rates and other pertinent
factors, including regulatory recommendations. This
evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including
the amounts and timing of future cash flows
expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible
to significant change. Loans are charged off, in whole
or
in part, when management believes that the full collectability of the
loan is unlikely. A loan
may be partially charged-off
after a “confirming event” has occurred which serves to validate
that full repayment pursuant to the terms of the loan is
unlikely.
The Company deems loans impaired when, based on current information
and events, it is probable that the Company will
be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual
terms of the loan agreement. Collection of all amounts due
according to the contractual terms means that both the interest
and principal payments of a loan will be collected as
scheduled in the loan agreement.
An impairment allowance is recognized if the fair value of the
loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan. The
impairment is recognized through the allowance. Loans that are
impaired are recorded at the present value of expected
future cash flows discounted at the loan’s
effective interest rate, or if the loan is collateral dependent,
impairment
measurement is based on the fair value of the collateral, less estimated
disposal costs.
The level of allowance maintained is believed by management to
be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the
portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is increased
by provisions charged to expense and decreased by charge-
offs, net of recoveries of amounts previously charged
-off.
In assessing the adequacy of the allowance, the Company also
considers the results of its ongoing internal, independent
loan review process. The Company’s
loan review process assists in determining whether there are
loans in the portfolio
whose credit quality has weakened over time and evaluating the risk characteristics
of the entire loan portfolio. The
Company’s loan review process includes
the judgment of management, the input from our independent
loan reviewers, and
reviews that may have been conducted by bank regulatory agencies
as part of their examination process. The Company
incorporates loan review results in the determination of whether
or not it is probable that it will be able to collect all
amounts due according to the contractual terms of a loan.
As part of the Company’s quarterly assessment
of the allowance, management divides the loan portfolio
into five segments:
commercial and industrial, construction and land development, commercial
real estate, residential real estate, and consumer
installment loans. The Company analyzes each segment and
estimates an allowance allocation for each loan segment.
The allocation of the allowance for loan losses begins with a
process of estimating the probable losses inherent for these
types of loans. The estimates for these loans are established by category
and based on the Company’s internal
system of
credit risk ratings and historical loss data. The estimated loan loss allocation
rate for the Company’s internal system
of
credit risk grades is based on its experience with similarly graded
loans. For loan segments where the Company believes it
does not have sufficient historical loss data, the Company
may make adjustments based, in part, on loss rates of peer
bank
groups. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, and for the years then ended,
the Company adjusted its historical loss rates for the
commercial real estate portfolio segment based, in part, on loss rates of peer
bank groups.
The estimated loan loss allocation for all five loan portfolio segments
is then adjusted for management’s
estimate of
probable losses for several “qualitative and environmental” factors.
The allocation for qualitative and environmental
factors is particularly subjective and does not lend itself to exact mathematical
calculation.
This amount represents
estimated probable inherent credit losses which exist, but have not yet
been identified, as of the balance sheet date, and are
based upon quarterly trend assessments in delinquent and nonaccrual
loans, credit concentration changes, prevailing
economic conditions, changes in lending personnel experience,
changes in lending policies or procedures and other
influencing factors.
These qualitative and environmental factors are considered
for each of the five loan segments and the
allowance allocation, as determined by the processes noted
above, is increased or decreased based on the incremental
assessment of these factors.
The Company regularly re-evaluates its practices in determining the
allowance for loan losses. Since the fourth quarter of
2016, the Company has increased its look-back period each quarter
to incorporate the effects of at least one economic
downturn in its loss history. The
Company believes the extension
of its look-back period is appropriate due to the risks
inherent in the loan portfolio. Absent this extension, the early
cycle periods in which the Company experienced significant
losses would be excluded from the determination of the allowance for
loan losses and its balance would decrease. For the
year ended December 31, 2020, the Company increased its look
-back period to 47 quarters to continue to include losses
incurred by the Company beginning with the first quarter of 2009.
The Company will likely continue to increase its look-
back period to incorporate the effects of at least one
economic downturn in its loss history.
During 2020, the Company
adjusted certain qualitative and economic factors related to changes in
economic conditions driven by the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic and resulting adverse economic conditions,
including higher unemployment in our primary market
area.
Further adjustments may be made in the future as a result of the ongoing COVID
-19 pandemic.
Assessment for Other-Than-Temporary
Impairment of Securities
On a quarterly basis, management makes an assessment to determine
whether there have been events or economic
circumstances to indicate that a security on which there is an
unrealized loss is other-than-temporarily impaired.
For debt securities with an unrealized loss, an other-than
-temporary impairment write-down is triggered when (1)
the
Company has the intent to sell a debt security,
(2) it is more likely than not that the Company will be required
to sell the
debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or
(3) the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized
cost basis of the debt security.
If the Company has the intent to sell a debt security or if it is more
likely than not that it will
be required to sell the debt security before recovery,
the other-than-temporary write-down is equal to the entire
difference
between the debt security’s amortized
cost and its fair value.
If the Company does not intend to sell the security or it is not
more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security
before recovery, the other
-than-temporary impairment write-
down is separated into the amount that is credit related (credit loss component)
and the amount due to all other factors.
The
credit loss component is recognized in earnings and is the difference
between the security’s
amortized cost basis and the
present value of its expected future cash flows.
The remaining difference between the security’s
fair value and the present
value of future expected cash flows is due to factors that are not credit
related and is recognized in other comprehensive
income, net of applicable taxes.
The Company is required to own certain stock as a condition of
membership, such as Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”)
and Federal Reserve Bank (“FRB”).
These non-marketable equity securities are accounted for at
cost which equals par or
redemption value.
These securities do not have a readily determinable fair value as their
ownership is restricted and there is
no market for these securities.
The Company records these non-marketable equity securities
as a component of other
assets, which are periodically evaluated for impairment. Ma
nagement considers these non-marketable equity securities to
be long-term investments. Accordingly,
when evaluating these securities for impairment, management considers
the
ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than by recognizing temporary
declines in value.
Fair Value
Determination
U.S. GAAP requires management to value and disclose certain of the
Company’s assets and liabilities
at fair value,
including investments classified as available-for-sale
and derivatives. ASC 820,
Fair Value
Measurements and Disclosures
,
which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
value in accordance with U.S. GAAP and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements.
For more information regarding fair value measurements and disclosures,
please refer to Note 15, Fair Value,
of the consolidated financial statements that accompany this report.
Fair values are based on active market prices of identical assets or
liabilities when available.
Comparable assets or
liabilities or a composite of comparable assets in active markets are
used when identical assets or liabilities do not have
readily available active market pricing.
However, some of the Company’s
assets or liabilities lack an available or
comparable trading market characterized by frequent transactions between
willing buyers and sellers. In these cases, fair
value is estimated using pricing models that use discounted cash
flows and other pricing techniques. Pricing models and
their underlying assumptions are based upon management’s
best estimates for appropriate discount rates, default rates,
prepayments, market volatility and other factors, taking into
account current observable market data and experience.
These assumptions may have a significant effect on the reported
fair values of assets and liabilities and the related income
and expense. As such, the use of different models and
assumptions, as well as changes in market conditions, could
result in
materially different net earnings and retained earnings
results.
Other Real Estate Owned
Other real estate owned (“OREO”), consists of properties obtained
through foreclosure or in satisfaction of loans and is
reported at the lower of cost or fair value, less estimated costs to
sell at the date acquired with any loss recognized as a
charge-off through the allowance for loan
losses. Additional OREO losses for subsequent valuation adjustments
are
determined on a specific property basis and are included as a
component of other noninterest expense along with holding
costs. Any gains or losses on disposal of OREO are also reflected
in noninterest expense. Significant judgments and
complex estimates are required in estimating the fair value of OREO, and
the period of time within which such estimates
can be considered current is significantly shortened during periods
of market volatility. As a
result, the net proceeds
realized from sales transactions could differ significantly
from appraisals, comparable sales, and other estimates used
to
determine the fair value of other OREO.
Deferred Tax
Asset Valuation
A valuation allowance is recognized for a deferred tax asset if, based
on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-
than-not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be
realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets
is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during
the periods in which those temporary differences
become
deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred
tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax
planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon
the level of taxable income over the last three years and
projections for future taxable income over the periods in which
the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes
it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these
deductible differences at December 31,
2020. The amount
of the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however,
could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income are
reduced.

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS
Net Interest Income and Margin
Net interest income (tax-equivalent) was $24.8 million in 2020,
compared to $26.6 million in 2019.
This decrease was due
to a decline in the Company’s net interest
margin (tax-equivalent).
The tax-equivalent yield on total interest-earning assets decreased
by 59 basis points in 2020 from 2019 to 3.38%.
This
decrease was primarily due to the lower rate environment, including
a 150 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate
that occurred in March 2020 and changes in our asset mix from the
significant short-term liquidity increase in customer
deposits.
The cost of total interest-bearing liabilities decreased 12 basis points
in 2020 from 2019 to 0.68%.
Such costs declined less
than the declines in rates earned on our interest earning assets.
The Company continues to deploy various asset liability management
strategies to manage its risk to interest rate
fluctuations. The Company’s net
interest margin could experience pressure due to reduced
earning asset yields and
increased competition for quality loan opportunities.
Provision for Loan Losses
The provision for loan losses represents a charge to earnings
necessary to provide an allowance for loan losses that
management believes, based on its processes and estimates,
should be adequate to provide for the probable losses on
outstanding loans. The provision for loan losses was $1.1 million
in 2020, compared to a negative provision for loan losses
of $0.3 million in 2019. The increase in the provision for loan losses
was related to adverse changes in economic conditions
and portfolio trends driven by the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, including
higher unemployment in our primary market
area. The provision for loan losses is based upon various factors,
including the absolute level of loans, loan growth, the
credit quality, and the amount of
net charge-offs or recoveries.
Based upon its assessment of the loan portfolio, management
adjusts the allowance for loan losses to an amount it believes
should be appropriate to adequately cover its estimate of probable
losses in the loan portfolio. The Company’s
allowance
for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.22% at December
31, 2020, compared to 0.95% at December 31, 2019.
At December 31, 2020, the Company’s
allowance for loan losses was 1.27% of total loans, excluding
PPP loans. While the
policies and procedures used to estimate the allowance for loan losses, as well
as the resulting provision for loan losses
charged to operations, are considered adequate
by management and are reviewed from time to time by our regulators,
they
are based on estimates and judgments and are therefore approximate
and imprecise. Factors beyond our control (such as
conditions in the local and national economy,
local real estate markets, or industries) may have a material
adverse effect on
our asset quality and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses resulting
in significant increases in the provision for
loan losses.

The Company’s income from mortgage
lending is primarily attributable to the (1) origination and sale
of new mortgage
loans and (2) servicing of mortgage loans. Origination income, net, is
comprised of gains or losses from the sale of the
mortgage loans originated, origination fees, underwriting fees and
other fees associated with the origination of loans, which
are netted against the commission expense associated with these
originations. The Company’s normal
practice is to
originate mortgage loans for sale in the secondary market and
to either sell or retain the MSRs when the loan is sold.
MSRs are recognized based on the fair value of the servicing
right on the date the corresponding mortgage loan is sold.
Subsequent to the date of transfer, the Company
has elected to measure its MSRs under the amortization method.
Servicing
fee income is reported net of any related amortization expense.
The Company evaluates MSRs for impairment on a quarterly basis.
Impairment is determined by grouping MSRs by
common predominant characteristics, such as interest rate and loan
type.
If the aggregate carrying amount of a particular
group of MSRs exceeds the group’s aggregate
fair value, a valuation allowance for that group is established.
The valuation
allowance is adjusted as the fair value changes.
An increase in mortgage interest rates typically results in an increase in
the
fair value of the MSRs while a decrease in mortgage interest rates
typically results in a decrease in the fair value of MSRs.

mortgage lending income for 2020 and 2019.

The increase in mortgage lending income was primarily due to
an increase in mortgage refinance activity.
The Company’s
income from mortgage lending typically fluctuates as mortgage
interest rates change and is primarily attributable to the
origination and sale of new mortgage loans. The increase in mortgage
lending income was partially offset by a decrease in
servicing fees, net of related amortization expense as prepayment
speeds increased during 2020, resulting in increased
amortization expense.
Income from bank-owned life insurance increased primarily due
to $0.3 million in non-taxable death benefits received in
2020. The assets that support these policies are administered
by the life insurance carriers and the income we receive (i.e.,
increases or decreases in the cash surrender value of the policies
and death benefits received) on these policies is dependent
upon the returns the insurance carriers are able to earn on the
underlying investments that support these policies. Earnings
on these policies are generally not taxable.
In 2019, the Company recognized a gain of $1.7 million resulting
from the termination of a Loan Guarantee Program (the
"Program") operated by the State of Alabama.
For more information regarding the Program, please refer
to Note 5, Loans
and Allowance for Loan Losses, of the consolidated financial
statements that accompany this report.
The decrease in other noninterest income was primarily due to
a $0.3 million pre-tax gain from an insurance recovery
received in the first quarter of 2019.

The decrease in salaries and benefits expense was primarily due
to lower full-time equivalent employees, incentive accruals
and an increase in deferred costs related to the PPP
loan program.
The increase in net occupancy and equipment expense was primarily
due to various expenses related to the redevelopment
of the Company’s headquarters in downtown
Auburn. This amount includes revised depreciation estimates and other
temporary relocation costs. For more information regarding changes
in accounting estimates, please refer to Note 1,
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the consolidated
financial statements that accompany this report.
Income Tax
Expense
Income tax expense was $1.6 million in 2020 compared to
$2.4 million in 2019.
The Company’s effective
income tax rate
was 17.72%
in 2020, compared to 19.57% in 2019.
This change was primarily due to a decrease in the level of earnings
before taxes relative to tax-exempt sources of income. The Company’s
effective income tax rate is principally impacted
by
tax-exempt earnings from the Company’s
investments in municipal securities and bank-owned life insurance.
BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS
Securities
Securities available-for-sale were $335.2
million at December 31, 2020, compared to $235.9 million at December
31, 2019.
This increase reflects an increase in the amortized cost basis
of securities available-for-sale of $91.9 million, and
an
increase of $7.4 million in the fair value of securities available
-for-sale. The increase in the amortized cost
basis of
securities available-for-sale was primarily attributable
to management allocating more funding to the investment portfolio
following the significant increases in customer deposits. The
increase in the fair value of securities was primarily due to a
decrease in long-term interest rates. The average annualized
tax-equivalent yields earned on total securities were 2.11%
in
2020 and 2.72% in 2019.
The following table shows the carrying value and weighted average
yield of securities available-for-sale as of December
31, 2020 according to contractual maturity.
Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities of mortgage-backed
securities (“MBS”) because the mortgages underlying the securities
may be called or prepaid with or without penalty.

Total loans, net of unearned

,
and $460.9 million at December 31, 2019.
Excluding PPP loans, total loans, net of unearned income, were
$442.7 million, a decrease of $18.2 million, or 4% from
December 31, 2019.
This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in commercial
real estate loans and residential real
estate loans of $15.2 million and $8.4 million, respectively,
as lower rates increased refinance activity and payoffs for
multi-family residential and consumer mortgage loans.
Four loan categories represented the majority of the
loan portfolio
at December 31, 2020: commercial real estate (55%), residential real
estate (18%), commercial and industrial (18%) and
construction and land development (7%).
Approximately 21% of the Company’s
commercial real estate loans were
classified as owner-occupied at December 31, 2020.
Within the residential real estate portfolio
segment, the Company had junior lien mortgages of approximately $8.7
million,
or 2%, and $10.8 million, or 2%, of total loans, net of unearned
income at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
For
residential real estate mortgage loans with a consumer purpose,
the Company had no loans that required interest only
payments at December 31, 2020,
compared to approximately $0.8 million at December 31, 2019.
The Company’s
residential real estate mortgage portfolio does not include any option
ARM loans, subprime loans, or any material amount
of other high-risk consumer mortgage products.
The average yield earned on loans and loans held for sale was 4.74%
in 2020 and 4.83% in 2019.
The specific economic and credit risks associated with our loan portfolio
include, but are not limited to, the effects of
current economic conditions, including the COVID-19 pandemic’s
effects, on our borrowers’ cash flo
ws, real estate market
sales volumes, valuations, availability and cost of financing properties,
real estate industry concentrations, competitive
pressures from a wide range of other lenders, deterioration in certain
credits, interest rate fluctuations, reduced collateral
values or non-existent collateral, title defects, inaccurate appraisals,
financial deterioration of borrowers, fraud, and any
violation of applicable laws and regulations.
The Company attempts to reduce these economic and credit
risks through its loan-to-value guidelines for collateralized
loans, investigating the creditworthiness of borrowers and monitoring borrowers’
financial position. Also, we have
established and periodically review,
lending policies and procedures. Banking regulations limit a
bank’s credit exposure
by
prohibiting unsecured loan relationships that exceed 10% of its
capital; or 20% of capital, if loans in excess of 10% of
capital are fully secured. Under these regulations, we are prohibited
from having secured loan relationships in excess of
approximately $20.4 million. Furthermore, we have an internal
limit for aggregate credit exposure (loans outstanding plus
unfunded commitments) to a single borrower of $18.3
million. Our loan policy requires that the Loan Committee of the
Board of Directors approve any loan relationships that exceed
this internal limit. At December 31, 2020,
the Bank had no
relationships exceeding these limits.
We periodically
analyze our commercial loan portfolio to determine if a concentration
of credit risk exists in any one or
more industries. We
use classification systems broadly accepted by the financial services
industry in order to categorize our
commercial borrowers. Loan concentrations to borrowers in the
following classes exceeded 25% of the Bank’s
total risk-
based capital at December 31, 2020 (and related balances
at December 31, 2019).

In light of disruptions in economic conditions caused by COVID
-19, the financial regulators have issued guidance
encouraging banks to work constructively with borrowers affected
by the virus in our community.
This guidance, including
the Interagency Statement on COVID-19 Loan Modifications and
the Interagency Examiner Guidance for Assessing Safety
and Soundness Considering the Effect of the COVID
-19 Pandemic on Institutions, provides that the agencies will not
criticize financial institutions that mitigate credit risk through
prudent actions consistent with safe and sound practices.
Specifically, examiners will
not criticize institutions for working with borrowers as part
of a risk mitigation strategy
intended to improve existing loans, even if the restructured
loans have or develop weaknesses that ultimately result in
adverse credit classification.
Upon demonstrating the need for payment relief, the bank will work
with qualified borrowers
that were otherwise current before the pandemic to determine
the most appropriate deferral option.
For residential
mortgage and consumer loans the borrower may elect to defer
payments for up to three months.
Interest continues to
accrue and the amount due at maturity increases.
Commercial real estate, commercial, and small business borrowers may
elect to defer payments for up to three months or pay scheduled
interest payments for a nine-month period.
The bank
recognizes that a combination of the payment relief options may be
prudent dependent on a borrower’s business type.
As
of December 31, 2020 we have granted loan payment deferrals
or payments of interest-only primarily on commercial and
industrial and commercial real estate loans totaling $32.3
million, or 7% of total loans.
This was a decline from $87.1
million, or 18% of total loans at September 30, 2020
and $112.7 million, or 24% of total loans at June 30,
2020.
The tables
below provide information concerning the composition of these
COVID-19 modifications as of December 31, 2020, all of
which represent second deferral requests.

Section 4013 of the CARES Act provides that a qualified loan modification
is exempt by law from classification as a TDR
pursuant to GAAP.
In addition, the Interagency Statement on COVID-19 Loan Modifications
provides circumstances in
which a loan modification is not subject to classification as a TDR
if such loan is not eligible for modification under
Section 4013.
Allowance for Loan Losses
The Company maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level
that management believes appropriate to adequately cover
the Company’s estimate of probable
losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses was $5.
million at
December 31, 2020 compared to $4.4 million at December 31,
2019, which management believed to be adequate at each of
the respective dates. The judgments and estimates associated
with the determination of the allowance for loan losses are
described under “Critical Accounting Policies.”
A summary of the changes in the allowance for loan losses and certain
asset quality ratios for each of the five years in the
five year period ended December 31, 2020 is presented below.

As described under “Critical Accounting Policies”, management assesses
the adequacy of the allowance prior to the end of
each calendar quarter. The
level of the allowance is based upon management’s
evaluation of the loan portfolios, past loan
loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio,
adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s
ability to repay
(including the timing of future payment), the estimated value
of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan
portfolio, economic conditions, industry and peer bank loan loss
rates, and other pertinent factors. This evaluation is
inherently subjective as it requires various material estimates
and judgments including the amounts and timing of future
cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may
be susceptible to significant change. The ratio of our
allowance for loan losses to total loans outstanding was 1.22
%
at December 31,
2020, compared to 0.95% at December 31,
2019.
At December 31, 2020, the Company’s
allowance for loan losses was 1.27% of total loans, excluding PPP
loans.
In
the future, the allowance to total loans outstanding ratio will increase
or decrease to the extent the factors that influence our
quarterly allowance assessment,
including the duration and magnitude of COVID-19
effects, in their entirety either improve
or weaken.
In addition our regulators, as an integral part of their examination process,
will periodically review the
Company’s allowance for loan
losses, and may require the Company to make additional provisions
to the allowance for
loan losses based on their judgment about information available
to them at the time of their examinations.
Nonperforming Assets
At December 31, 2020 the Company had $0.5 million in nonperforming
assets compared
to $0.2 million at December 31,

than 90 days past due, unless the loan is both well-secured
and in the process of collection. At December 31, 2020
and
2019, respectively, the Company
had $0.5 million and $0.2 million in loans on nonaccrual.
At December 31, 2020 there were $0.1 million in loans 90 days
past due and still accruing interest, compared to none at
December 31, 2019.
Other Real Estate Owned
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively,
the Company held no OREO properties acquired from borrowers.
Potential Problem Loans
Potential problem loans represent those loans with a well-defined
weakness and where information about possible credit
problems of borrowers has caused management to have serious doubts
about the borrower’s ability to comply with present
repayment terms.
This definition is believed to be substantially consistent with the
standards established by the Federal
Reserve, the Company’s primary regulator,
for loans classified as substandard, excluding nonaccrual loans.
Potential
problem loans, which are not included in nonperforming assets,
amounted to $2.9 million, or 1.0% of total loans at
December 31, 2020, compared to $4.4 million, or 1.0% of
total loans at December 31, 2019.

million, or 29% of total deposits, at December 31, 2020,
compared to $196.2 million, or 27% of total deposits at December
31, 2019. These increases reflect deposits from
customers who received PPP loans, the impact of government stimulus
checks, delayed tax payments and reduced customer
spending during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The average rates paid on total interest-bearing deposits were
0.68% in 2020 and 0.80% in 2019.
Other Borrowings
Other borrowings generally consist of short-term borrowings
and long-term debt.
Short-term borrowings generally consist
of federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements
to repurchase with an original maturity of one year
or less.
The Bank had available federal fund lines totaling $41.0 million
with none outstanding at December 31, 2020 and 2019,
respectively. Securities sold
under agreements to repurchase totaled $2.4 million and $1.1
million at December 31, 2020
and 2019, respectively.
The average rates paid on short-term borrowings was 0.48%
and 0.49% in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Information
concerning the average balances, weighted average rates, and
maximum amounts outstanding for short-term borrowings
during the two-year period ended December 31, 2020 is included
in Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial
statements included in this annual report.
The Company had no long-term debt outstanding at December
31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
CAPITAL ADEQUACY
The Company's consolidated stockholders' equity was $107.7
million and $98.3 million as of December 31, 2020 and
2019,
respectively.
The increase from December 31, 2019 was primarily driven
by net earnings of $7.5 million and other
comprehensive income due to the change in unrealized gains
on securities available-for-sale, net of tax, of $5.5
million,
which was partially offset by cash dividends paid of $3.6
million.
On January 1, 2015, the Company and Bank became subject
to the rules of the Basel III regulatory capital framework and
related Dodd-Frank Wall
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act changes. The
rules included the implementation of a
capital conservation buffer that is added to
the minimum requirements for capital adequacy purposes. The capital
conservation buffer was subject
to a three year phase-in period that began on January 1, 2016
and was fully phased-in on
January 1, 2019 at 2.5%. A banking organization with a
conservation buffer of less than the required
amount will be subject
to limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments
and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive
officers. At December 31, 2020,
the Bank’s ratio was sufficient
to meet the fully phased-in conservation buffer.
Effective March 20, 2020, the Federal Reserve and
the other federal banking regulators adopted an interim final rule that
amended the capital conservation buffer.
The interim final rule was adopted as a final rule on August
26, 2020. The new
rule revises the definition of “eligible retained income” for purposes
of the maximum payout ratio to allow banking
organizations to more freely use their capital buffers
to promote lending and other financial intermediation activities,
by
making the limitations on capital distributions more gradual.
The eligible retained income is now the greater of (i) net
income for the four preceding quarters, net of distributions and
associated tax effects not reflected in net income; and
(ii)
the average of all net income over the preceding four quarters.
The interim final rule only affects the capital buffers,
and
banking organizations were encouraged to make prudent
capital distribution decisions.
The Federal Reserve has treated us as a “small bank holding company’
under the Federal Reserve’s policy.
Accordingly,
our capital adequacy is evaluated at the Bank level, and not for
the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. The Bank’s
tier 1 leverage ratio was 10.32%, CET1 risk-based capital ratio
was 17.27%, tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 17.27%, and
total risk-based capital ratio was 18.31%
at December 31, 2020.
These ratios exceed the minimum regulatory capital
percentages of 5.0% for tier 1 leverage ratio, 6.5% for CET1
risk-based capital ratio, 8.0% for tier 1 risk-based capital ratio,
and 10.0% for total risk-based capital ratio to be considered
“well capitalized.” The Bank’s
capital conservation buffer was
10.31%
at December 31, 2020.
MARKET AND LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT
Management’s objective is to manage
assets and liabilities to provide a satisfactory,
consistent level of profitability within
the framework of established liquidity,
loan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies. The
Bank’s Asset Liability
Management Committee (“ALCO”) is charged with
the responsibility of monitoring these policies, which are designed
to
ensure an acceptable asset/liability composition. Two
critical areas of focus for ALCO are interest rate risk and liquidity
risk management.
Interest Rate Risk Management
In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to
market risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates because
assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times.
For example, if liabilities reprice faster than assets, and
interest rates are generally rising, earnings will initially decline.
In addition, assets and liabilities may reprice at the same
time but by different amounts. For example, when the general
level of interest rates is rising, the Company may increase
rates paid on interest bearing demand deposit accounts and savings
deposit accounts by an amount that is less than the
general increase in market interest rates. Also, short-term and
long-term market interest rates may change by different
amounts. For example, a flattening yield curve may reduce the
interest spread between new loan yields and funding costs.
Further, the remaining maturity of various assets
and liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change.
For
example, if long-term mortgage interest rates decline sharply,
mortgage-backed securities in the securities portfolio may
prepay earlier than anticipated, which could reduce earnings.
Interest rates may also have a direct or indirect effect on loan
demand, loan losses, mortgage origination volume, the fair value of
MSRs and other items affecting earnings.
ALCO measures and evaluates the interest rate risk so that we can meet customer
demands for various types of loans and
deposits. ALCO determines the most appropriate amounts of
on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items. Measurements
used to help manage interest rate sensitivity include an earnings simulation
and an economic value of equity model.
Earnings simulation
. Management believes that interest rate risk is best estimated by our
earnings simulation modeling.
On at least a quarterly basis, the following 12 month time period
is simulated to determine a baseline net interest income
forecast and the sensitivity of this forecast to changes in interest rates.
The baseline forecast assumes an unchanged or flat
interest rate environment. Forecasted levels of earning assets,
interest-bearing liabilities, and off-balance sheet financial
instruments are combined with ALCO forecasts of market interest rates
for the next 12 months and other factors in order to
produce various earnings simulations and estimates.
To help limit interest rate
risk, we have guidelines for earnings at risk which seek to
limit the variance of net interest
income from gradual changes in interest rates.
For changes up or down in rates from management’s
flat interest rate
forecast over the next 12 months, policy limits for net interest income
variances are as follows:
+/- 20% for a gradual change of 400 basis points
+/- 15% for a gradual change of 300 basis points
+/- 10% for a gradual change of 200 basis points
+/- 5% for a gradual change of 100 basis points
The following table reports the variance of net interest income over the next
12 months assuming a gradual change in
interest rates up or down when compared to the baseline net
interest income forecast at December 31, 2020.

At December 31, 2020, our earnings simulation model indicated
that we were in compliance with the policy guidelines
noted above.
Economic Value
of Equity
Economic value of equity (“EVE”) measures the extent that estimated
economic values of our assets, liabilities and off-
balance sheet items will change as a result of interest rate changes.
Economic values are estimated by discounting expected
cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items,
which establishes a base case EVE. In contrast with our
earnings simulation model which evaluates interest rate risk over
a 12 month timeframe, EVE uses a terminal horizon
which allows for the re-pricing of all assets, liabilities, and off
-balance sheet items. Further, EVE
is measured using values
as of a point in time and does not reflect any actions that ALCO
might take in responding to or anticipating changes in
interest rates, or market and competitive conditions.
To help limit interest rate
risk, we have stated policy guidelines for an instantaneous
basis point change in interest rates,
such that our EVE should not decrease from our base case by more
than the following:
45% for an instantaneous change of +/-
400 basis points
35% for an instantaneous change of +/-
300 basis points
25% for an instantaneous change of +/-
200 basis points
15% for an instantaneous change of +/-
100 basis points
The following table reports the variance of EVE assuming an immediate
change in interest rates up or down when
compared to the baseline EVE at December 31, 2020.

At December 31, 2020, our EVE model indicated that we were
in compliance with the policy guidelines noted above.
Each of the above analyses may not, on its own, be an accurate
indicator of how our net interest income will be affected
by
changes in interest rates. Income associated with interest-earning assets
and costs associated with interest-bearing liabilities
may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates.
In addition, the magnitude and duration of changes in interest
rates may have a significant impact on net interest income. For
example, although certain assets and liabilities may have
similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react in different
degrees to changes in market interest rates, and other
economic and market factors, including market perceptions. Interest
rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate
in advance of changes in general market rates, while interest
rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind
changes in general market rates. In addition, certain assets, such as
adjustable rate mortgage loans, have features (generally
referred to as “interest rate caps and floors”) which limit changes
in interest rates. Prepayment and early withdrawal levels
also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the maturity
of certain instruments. The ability of many
borrowers to service their debts also may decrease during periods
of rising interest rates or economic stress, which may
differ across industries and economic sectors. ALCO reviews
each of the above interest rate sensitivity analyses along with
several different interest rate scenarios in seeking satisfactory,
consistent levels of profitability within the framework of the
Company’s established liquidity,
loan, investment, borrowing, and capital policies.
The Company may also use derivative financial instruments
to improve the balance between interest-sensitive assets and
interest-sensitive liabilities and as one tool to manage interest rate
sensitivity while continuing to meet the credit and
deposit needs of our customers. From time to time, the Company
may enter into interest rate swaps (“swaps”) to facilitate
customer transactions and meet their financing needs. These
swaps qualify as derivatives, but are not designated as hedging
instruments. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had
no derivative contracts to assist in managing interest rate
sensitivity.
Liquidity Risk Management
Liquidity is the Company’s ability
to convert assets into cash equivalents in order
to meet daily cash flow requirements,
primarily
for deposit withdrawals, loan demand and maturing obligations.
Without proper management of its liquidity,
the
Company could experience higher costs of obtaining funds due to
insufficient liquidity, while
excessive liquidity can lead
to a decline in earnings due to the cost of foregoing alternative
higher-yielding investment opportunities.
Liquidity is managed at two levels. The first is the liquidity of
the Company. The second
is the liquidity of the Bank. The
management of liquidity at both levels is essential, because the Company
and the Bank are separate and distinct legal
entities with different funding needs and sources, and each
are subject to regulatory guidelines and requirements. The
Company depends upon dividends from the Bank for liquidity to
pay its operating expenses, debt obligations and
dividends. The Bank’s payment of
dividends depends on its earnings, liquidity,
capital and the absence of any regulatory
restrictions.
The primary source of funding and liquidity for the Company has
been dividends received from the Bank. If needed, the
Company could also issue common stock or other securities. Primary uses
of funds by the Company include dividends paid
to stockholders and stock repurchases.
Primary sources of funding for the Bank include customer deposits,
other borrowings, repayment and maturity of securities,
and sale and repayment of loans.
The Bank has access to federal funds lines from various banks
and borrowings from the
Federal Reserve discount window.
In addition to these sources, the Bank has participated
in the FHLB's advance program
to obtain funding for its growth. Advances include both fixed
and variable terms and are taken out with varying maturities.
As of December 31,
2020, the Bank had a remaining available line of credit with the FHLB
totaling $281.4 million.
As of
December 31, 2020, the Bank also had $41.0 million of federal
funds lines, with none outstanding.
Primary uses of funds
include repayment of maturing obligations and growing the loan
portfolio.
The following table presents additional information about our
contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020, which by
their terms had contractual maturity and termination dates subsequent
to December 31, 2020:

Management believes that the Company and the Bank have adequate
sources of liquidity to meet all known contractual
obligations and unfunded commitments, including loan commitments and
reasonable borrower, depositor,
and creditor
requirements over the next 12 months.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
At December 31, 2020, the Bank had outstanding standby letters
of credit of $1.2 million and unfunded loan commitments
outstanding of $75.0 million. Because these commitments generally
have fixed expiration dates and many will expire
without being drawn upon, the total commitment level does not
necessarily represent future cash requirements. If needed
to
fund these outstanding commitments, the Bank has the ability to
liquidate federal funds sold or securities available-for-sale,
or on a short-term basis to borrow and purchase federal funds
from other financial institutions.
Residential mortgage lending and servicing activities
Since 2009, we have primarily sold residential mortgage loans in
the secondary market to Fannie Mae while retaining the
servicing of these loans. The sale agreements for these residential mortgage
loans with Fannie Mae and other investors
include various representations and warranties regarding the origination
and characteristics of the residential mortgage
loans. Although the representations and warranties vary among investors,
they typically cover ownership of the loan,
validity of the lien securing the loan, the absence of delinquent taxes
or liens against the property securing the loan,
compliance with loan criteria set forth in the applicable agreement,
compliance with applicable federal, state, and local
laws, among other matters.
As of December 31, 2020, the unpaid principal balance of residential
mortgage loans, which we have originated and sold,
but retained the servicing rights was $267.2 million. Although these
loans are generally sold on a non-recourse basis,
except for breaches of customary seller representations and
warranties, we may have to repurchase residential mortgage
loans in cases where we breach such representations or warranties or
the other terms of the sale, such as where we fail to
deliver required documents or the documents we deliver are defective.
Investors also may require the repurchase of a
mortgage loan when an early payment default underwriting review reveals
significant underwriting deficiencies, even if the
mortgage loan has subsequently been brought current. Repurchase demands
are typically reviewed on an individual loan by
loan basis to validate the claims made by the investor and to
determine if a contractually required repurchase event has
occurred. We
seek to reduce and manage the risks of potential repurchases or other claims
by mortgage loan investors
through our underwriting, quality assurance and servicing practices,
including good communications with our residential
mortgage investors.
The Company was not required to repurchase any loans during 2020
and 2019 as a result of representation and warranty
provisions contained in the Company’s
sale agreements with Fannie Mae, and had no pending repurchase
or make-whole
requests at December 31, 2020.
We service all residential
mortgage loans originated and sold by us to Fannie Mae. As servicer,
our primary duties are to:
(1) collect payments due from borrowers; (2) advance certain delinquent
payments of principal and interest; (3) maintain
and administer any hazard, title, or primary mortgage insurance policies
relating to the mortgage loans; (4) maintain any
required escrow accounts for payment of taxes and insurance
and administer escrow payments; and (5) foreclose on
defaulted mortgage loans or take other actions to mitigate the
potential losses to investors consistent with the agreements
governing our rights and duties as servicer.
The agreement under which we act as servicer generally specifies
a standard of responsibility for actions taken by us in
such capacity and provides protection against expenses and liabilities incurred
by us when acting in compliance with the
respective servicing agreements. However,
if we commit a material breach of our obligations as servicer,
we may be subject
to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period
following notice. The standards governing servicing and
the possible remedies for violations of such standards are determined
by servicing guides issued by Fannie Mae as well as
the contract provisions established between Fannie Mae and
the Bank. Remedies could include repurchase of an affected
loan.
Although to date repurchase requests related to representation and
warranty provisions, and servicing activities have been
limited, it is possible that requests to repurchase mortgage loans may
increase in frequency if investors more aggressively
pursue all means of recovering losses on their purchased loans.
As of December 31, 2020, we believe that this exposure is
not material due to the historical level of repurchase requests
and loss trends, the results of our quality control reviews, and
the fact that 99% of our residential mortgage loans serviced for
Fannie Mae were current as of such date. We
maintain
ongoing communications with our investors and will continue
to evaluate this exposure by monitoring the level and number
of repurchase requests as well as the delinquency rates in our
investor portfolios.
Section 4021 of the CARES Act allows borrowers under 1-to
-4 family residential mortgage loans sold to Fannie Mae to
request forbearance to the servicer after affirming that
such borrower is experiencing financial hardships during the
COVID-19 emergency.
Except for vacant or abandoned properties, Fannie Mae servicers
may not initiate foreclosures on
similar procedures or related evictions or sales until December
31, 2020. The forbearance period has been extended,
generally, to March 31,
2021.
The Bank sells mortgage loans to Fannie Mae and services these on an
actual/actual basis.
As a result, the Bank is not obligated to make any advances to
Fannie Mae on principal and interest on such mortgage loans
where the borrower is entitled to forbearance.
Effects of Inflation and Changing Prices
The consolidated financial statements and related consolidated
financial data presented herein have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP and practices within the banking industry
which require the measurement of financial position and
operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering
the changes in the relative purchasing power of money
over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies,
virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution
are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more
significant impact on a financial institution’s
performance
than the effects of general levels of inflation.
CURRENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS
The following ASU has been issued by the FASB
but is not yet effective.
●
ASU 2016-13,
Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic
326):
Measurement of Credit Losses on
Financial
Instruments;
Information about this pronouncement is described in more detail
below.
ASU 2016-13,
Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic
326): - Measurement of Credit
Losses on Financial
Instruments
, amends guidance on reporting credit losses for assets held at
amortized cost basis and available for sale debt
securities. For assets held at amortized cost basis, the new standard
eliminates the probable initial recognition threshold in
current GAAP and, instead, requires an entity to reflect its current estimate
of all expected credit losses using a broader
range of information regarding past events, current conditions and
forecasts assessing the collectability of cash flows. The
allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted
from the amortized cost basis of the financial assets to
present the net amount expected to be collected. For
available for sale debt securities, credit losses should be measured in a
manner similar to current GAAP,
however the new standard will require that credit losses be
presented as an allowance
rather than as a write-down. The new guidance affects entities
holding financial assets and net investment in leases that are
not accounted for at fair value through net income. The amendments
affect loans, debt securities, trade receivables, net
investments in leases, off-balance sheet credit exposures,
reinsurance receivables, and any other financial assets not
excluded from the scope that have the contractual right to receive
cash. For public business entities, the new guidance was
originally effective for annual and interim periods
in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. The
Company has
developed an implementation team that is following a general
timeline. The team has been working with an advisory
consultant, with whom a third-party software license has been purchased.
The Company’s preliminary evaluation
indicates
the provisions of ASU No. 2016-13 are expected to impact the Company’s
consolidated financial statements, in particular
the level of the reserve for credit losses. The Company is continuin
g
to evaluate the extent of the potential impact and
expects that portfolio composition and economic conditions at
the time of adoption will be a factor.
On October 16, 2019,
the FASB approved
a previously issued proposal granting smaller reporting companies a postponement
of the required
implementation date for ASU 2016-13. The Company will now be
required to implement the new standard in January 2023,
with early adoption permitted in any period prior to that date.
Table 1
- Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to results presented in accordance with GAAP,
this annual report on Form 10-K includes certain designated net
interest income amounts presented on a tax-equivalent basis, a
non-GAAP financial measure, including the presentation of
total revenue and the calculation of the efficiency ratio.
The Company believes the presentation of net interest income
on a tax-equivalent basis provides comparability of net
interest income from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and
facilitates comparability within the industry.
Although the
Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures enhance
investors’ understanding of its business and performance,
these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered
an alternative to GAAP.
The reconciliation of these non-
GAAP financial measures from GAAP to non-GAAP is presented below.
