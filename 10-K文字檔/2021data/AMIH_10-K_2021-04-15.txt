Plan of Operations
The Company intends to continue to grow its business both organically and through identifying acquisition targets over the next 12 months in the technology, health and wellness space. Specifically, the Company will continue to make additional and ongoing technology enhancements to its LifeGuru life coaching platform, further develop, market and advertise its telemedicine platform, and identify strategic acquisitions that complement the Company’s vision of bridging the gap between primary care, preventative care and wellness. As these opportunities arise, the Company will determine the best method for financing its growth which may include the issuance of additional debt instruments, common stock, preferred stock, or a combination thereof, all of which may result in significant dilution to existing shareholders.

Results of Operations
Revenues
We had revenues of $5,797,629 and $1,699,886 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The significant increase in revenues in 2020 was due primarily to two construction contracts for an apartment and clubhouse rebuild at Gateway Village, Texas, and the replacement of a roof replacement at Port Arthur, Texas. The total revenues generated by such contracts totaled $7,333,264 from the 4th quarter of 2019 through the end of 2020.
We recognized revenues in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606. A five-step process has been designed for the individual or pool of contracts to keep financial statements focused on this principle. Revenues from fixed-price and cost-plus contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method, whereby revenues on long-term contracts were recorded on the basis of the Company’s estimates of the percentage of completion of contracts based on the ratio of actual cost incurred to total estimated costs. This cost-to-cost method was used because management considered it to be the best available measure of progress on these contacts. Revenues from cost-plus-fee contracts were recognized on the basis of costs incurred during the period plus the fee earned, measured on the cost-to-cost method. Revenues from time-and-material and rate chart contracts were recognized currently as work is performed. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized revenues of $5,795,629 and $1,699,886, respectively, in connection with these two construction contracts.
Cost of Revenues
We had cost of revenues of $4,852,631 and $1,519,941 during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cost of revenues include all direct material, sub-contractor, labor and certain other direct costs, as well as those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor and fringe benefits. Selling, general, and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability may result in revisions to cost and income, which are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. Changes in estimated job profitability resulting from job performance, job conditions, contract penalty provisions, claims, change orders, and settlements, are accounted for as changes in estimates in the current period. Claims for additional contract revenue are recognized when realization of the claim is probable and the amount can be reasonably determined.
Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was 83.7% and 89.4% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue in 2020 was approximately the same as 2019 due primarily to the two construction contracts for an apartment and clubhouse rebuild at Gateway Village, Texas and the replacement of a roof in Port Arthur, Texas.
Operating Expenses
General and administrative expenses were $4,329,730 and $3,044,851 during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in 2020 was due primarily to stock-based compensation in the amount of $2,860,813, which was $2,303,390 in 2019, and rental expenses of $61,099 (excluding discontinued operations), which was $0 in 2019. The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2020 was also due to a new subsidiary launched in August 2020 to provide its customers with unlimited, 24/7 access to board certified physicians and licensed mental and behavioral health counselors and therapists via a newly developed, monthly subscription based online telemedicine platform.
Other Expenses
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we incurred interest expense of $219,202 and $60,862, respectively, of which $3,345 and $8,995, respectively, were recorded as imputed interest in connection with related party loans.
Amortization of debt discount was $777,964 and $76,230 during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
We had a loss of $107,574 and $147,495, respectively, due to change in derivative liabilities during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. See also “Note 12 - Derivative Liabilities”, to the notes to financial statements included herein.
We also had an impairment loss of $670,488 primarily attributable to the investment in Life Guru, an impairment loss of $631,541 attributable to discontinued operations, and settlement loss of $1,155,685 in connection with the common shares issued for notes settlement in 2020. We had neither impairment loss, nor settlement loss in 2019.
Discontinued operations
Customer traffic and demand at our VISSIA Waterway, Inc. and VISSIA McKinney MedSpa locations which were re-opened after mandatory closures associated with COVID-19 in June and August 2020, respectively, failed to rebound to pre-closure levels due to COVID-19 and the pandemic’s effects on the economy, and because we are unable to predict the length of the pandemic or ultimate outcome thereof, and further due to our limited capital resources, effective in October 2020, we made the decision to close both our VISSIA Waterway, Inc. and VISSIA McKinney locations and discontinued such operations. While such locations are closed, they are not generating any revenue; however, we are still required to pay the rent and utilities for each location and are accruing rents of approximately $4,500 and $6,100 per month at our Mckinney, TX and Woodlands, TX Vissia locations, respectively. Such continuing expenses, without corresponding revenues, may have a significant negative affect on our results of operations and cash flows. Separately, Legend Nutrition’s lease was up January 31, 2021, and the Company chose not to renew the lease, closed the store, and not continue in that line of business moving forward.
VISSIA Waterway, Inc., VISSIA McKinney LLC and Legend Nutrition (collectively referred to as “Discontinued Subsidiaries”) have been presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
The operating results for Discontinued Subsidiaries have been presented in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, as discontinued operations and are summarized below:
Net Loss
We had a net loss of $6,185,747, or $0.17 per share from continuing operations and $1,154,142 or $0.03 per share from discontinued operations during the year ended December 31, 2020, totaling an aggregate of $7,339,889 or $0.20 per share in total net loss. We had a net loss of $3,131,760, or $0.12 per share from continuing operations and $80,488 or $0.00 per share from discontinued operations during the year ended December 31, 2019, for a total net loss of $3,212,248. The increase in net loss in 2020 was primarily attributable to non-cash expenses in connection with stock-based compensation, amortization of debt discount, the change in derivative values associated with outstanding convertible debt, impairment loss due to the investment in Life Guru, and settlement loss in connection with the common shares issued for notes settlement, offset by the increase in gross profit, each as discussed above.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had total assets of $265,499 and $2,192,476, respectively, including $123,684 and $583,759 of assets of discontinued operations, respectively.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had total liabilities of $1,656,505 and $3,301,409, respectively, which consisted of accounts payable, accrued interest and accrued compensation in the amount of $214,697 and $156,534, respectively, rights-of-use liability of $87,653 and $0, respectively, convertible notes payable (net of discount) and loans payable to related parties and non-related parties (net of discount) in the amounts of $79,845, $55,000 and $135,392, respectively, and derivative liabilities of $517,366 and $458,745, respectively. We also had $566,552 of net liabilities related to discontinued operations. The Company had a total stockholders’ deficit of $1,391,006 and $1,108,933 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in operating activities was $2,134,845, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $900,435 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Negative cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2020, were due primarily to the net loss of $7,339,889, plus the decrease in billing in excess of costs and estimated earnings by $1,657,998, partially offset by non-cash expenses, including stock-based compensation of $2,860,813, amortization of debt discount of $777,964, loss on loans settlement by $1,041,445, impairment loss of $670,488 and non-cash lease expense of $26,141. Comparatively, positive cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2019, were due primarily to non-cash expenses, including stock based compensation of $2,303,390, amortization of debt discount of $76,230, changes in derivative liabilities of $147,495, plus the increase in billing in excess of costs and estimated earnings of $1,657,998, offset by our net loss of $3,212,248.
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had cash used in investing activities of $23,901 and $103,554, respectively. The net cash used in investing activities in 2020 was solely attributable to capital expenditures for property and equipment. We paid $70,000 cash for license in 2019 in addition to the purchase of property and equipment.
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, net cash flows provided by financing activities were $978,669 and $443,033, respectively, primarily attributable to the proceeds from notes payable to related parties and non-related parties during the respective periods. We had proceeds of $11,919 from related party borrowings and proceeds of $960,250 from non-related party borrowings in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to proceeds of $165,571 and $370,000, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2019. We made repayments of $40,000 to related party borrowings and repayments of $0 to non-related party borrowings in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to repayments of $121,038 and $6,500, respectively, in 2019. We had proceeds of $46,500 from sales of stock in 2020 (which shares of stock were sold in connection with our Regulation A offering (discussed below)), which was $35,000 in 2019.
We had cash of $25,144 and a working capital deficit of $1,439,454, as of December 31, 2020. On the short-term basis, we will be required to raise a significant amount of additional funds over the next 12 months to sustain operations and pay outstanding liabilities. On the long-term basis, we will potentially need to raise capital to grow and develop our business.
To date we have sold (a) 431,250 shares of our common stock in consideration for $181,500 in cash through our Regulation A offering, which relates to the sale of up to 10,800,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $0.50 per share; and (b) 18,916,774 shares of our common stock in exchange for the conversion of $2,634,119 in debt.
It is likely that we will require significant additional financing within the next 12 months and if we are unable to raise the needed funds on an acceptable basis, we may be forced to cease or curtail operations.
Additional information regarding the Company’s (a) accrued compensation for related parties can be found in “Note 10 - Accrued Compensation for Related Parties”; (b) notes payable can be found in “Note 10 - Notes Payable”; (c) related party loans can be found in “Note 11 - Loans from Related Parties”; derivative liabilities can be found in “Note 12 - Derivative Liabilities”; billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings can be found in “Note 13 - Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contract”, in the notes to unconsolidated financial statements included herein.
Critical Accounting Policies
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606. The underlying principle is that the Company recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods and services to customers in an amount that they expect to be entitled to in the exchange for goods and services provided. A five-step process has been designed for the individual or pools of contracts to keep financial statements focused on this principle.
Revenues from fixed-price and cost-plus contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method, whereby revenues on long-term contracts are recorded on the basis of the Company’s estimates of the percentage of completion of contracts based on the ratio of actual cost incurred to total estimated costs. This cost-to-cost method is used because management considers it to be the best available measure of progress on these contacts. Revenues from cost-plus-fee contracts are recognized on the basis of costs incurred during the period plus the fee earned, measured on the cost-to-cost method.
Revenues from time-and-material and rate chart contracts are recognized currently as work is performed.
Revenues from maintenance service contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract once the Company has an agreement, service has begun, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assumed.
Cost of revenues include all direct material, sub-contractor, labor and certain other direct costs, as well as those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor and fringe benefits. Selling, general, and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability may result in revisions to cost and income, which are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. Changes in estimated job profitability resulting from job performance, job conditions, contract penalty provisions, claims, change orders, and settlements, are accounted for as changes in estimates in the current period. Claims for additional contract revenue are recognized when realization of the claim is probable and the amount can be reasonably determined.
The asset, “cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contract” represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed. The liability, “billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts,” represents billings in excess of revenues recognized. The Company had no such asset and liability as of December 31, 2020, since the two construction contracts for an apartment and clubhouse rebuild at Gateway Village, Texas and the replacement of a roof in Port Arthur, Texas were completed in 2020.
Fair value of financial instruments
The Company measures its financial and non-financial assets and liabilities, as well as makes related disclosures, in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”), which provides guidance with respect to valuation techniques to be utilized in the determination of fair value of assets and liabilities. Approaches include, (i) the market approach (comparable market prices), (ii) the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow), and (iii) the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). ASC 820 utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels:
Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.
Level 3: Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.
Our financial instruments include cash, accounts receivable, other receivable, inventories, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, convertible note payable, and derivative liabilities.
The carrying values of the Company’s cash, accounts receivable, other receivable, inventories, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate their fair value due to their short-term nature.
The Company’s convertible notes payable are measured at amortized cost.
The derivative liabilities are stated at their fair value as a level 3 measurement. The Company used the Lattice Model to determine the fair values of these derivative liabilities. See “Note 12 - Derivative Liabilities” of the financial statements included herein, for the Company’s assumptions used in determining the fair value of these financial instruments.
Convertible note payable
The Company accounts for convertible notes payable in accordance with the Under Financial Accounting Standard Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification No. 815, Derivatives and Hedging, since the conversion feature is not indexed to the Company’s stock and can’t be classified in equity. The Company allocates the proceeds received from convertible notes payable between the liability component and conversion feature component. The conversion feature that is considered embedded derivative liabilities has been recorded at their fair value as its fair value can be separated from the convertible note and its conversion is independent of the underlying note value. The Company has also recorded the resulting discount on debt related to the conversion feature and is amortizing the discount using the effective interest rate method over the life of the debt instruments.
Derivative liabilities
The Company accounts for derivative liabilities in accordance with the FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). ASC 815 requires companies to recognize all derivative liabilities in the balance sheet at fair value, and marks it to market at each reporting date with the resulting gains or losses shown in the Statement of Operations.
Stock based compensation
The Company recognizes compensation costs to employees under FASB Accounting Standards Codification 718 “Compensation - Stock Compensation” (“ASC 718”). Under ASC 718, companies are required to measure the compensation costs of share-based compensation arrangements based on the grant-date fair value and recognize the costs in the financial statements over the period during which employees are required to provide services. Share based compensation arrangements include stock options and warrants. As such, compensation cost is measured on the date of grant at their fair value. Such compensation amounts, if any, are amortized over the respective vesting periods of the option grant.
On July 27, 2018, the inception date, the Company adopted ASU No. 2018-07 “Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting.” These amendments expand the scope of Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation (which currently only includes share-based payments to employees) to include share-based payments issued to nonemployees for goods or services. Consequently, the accounting for share-based payments to nonemployees and employees will be substantially aligned.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act of 1934.
