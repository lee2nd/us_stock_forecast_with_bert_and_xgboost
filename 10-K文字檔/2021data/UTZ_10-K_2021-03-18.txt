Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our fiscal year end is the Sunday closest to December 31. Our fiscal year 2019 ended December 29, 2019 and was a fifty-two-week period and our fiscal year 2020 ended January 3, 2021 and was a fifty-three-week fiscal year. Our fiscal quarters are comprised of thirteen weeks each, except for fifty-three-week fiscal periods for the which the fourth quarter is comprised of fourteen weeks, and end on the thirteenth Sunday of each quarter (fourteenth Sunday of the fourth quarter, when applicable).
Overview
We are a leading manufacturer, marketer, and distributor of high-quality, branded snacking products in the United States. We produce a broad offering of salty snacks, including potato chips, pretzels, cheese snacks, veggie snacks, pork skins, pub/party mixes, and other snacks. Our iconic portfolio of authentic, craft, and “better for you” brands, which includes Utz®, ON THE BORDER®, Zapp’s®, Golden Flake®, Good Health®, Boulder Canyon®, Hawaiian® Brand, and TORTIYAHS!®, among others, enjoys strong household penetration in the United States, where our products can be found in approximately 49% of U.S. households. We operate 14 manufacturing facilities with a broad range of capabilities, and our products are distributed nationally to grocery, mass merchant, club, convenience, drug and other retailers through direct shipments, distributors, and more than 1,600 direct-store-delivery (“DSD”) routes. Our company was founded in 1921 in Hanover, Pennsylvania, and benefits from 100 years of brand awareness and heritage in the salty snack industry. We have historically expanded our geographic reach and product portfolio organically and through acquisitions. Based on 2020 retail sales, we are second-largest producer of branded salty snacks in our Core geographies, where we have acquired strong regional brands and distribution capabilities in recent years.
Business Combination
On August 28, 2020, CCH domesticated into a Delaware corporation and changed its name to "Utz Brands, Inc." (the “Domestication”) and consummated the acquisition of certain limited liability company units of UBH, the parent of Utz Quality Foods, LLC (“UQF”), as a result of a new issuance by UBH and purchases from UBH’s existing equity holders pursuant to a Business Combination Agreement, dated as of June 5, 2020 (the “Business Combination Agreement”) among CCH, UBH and Series U of UM Partners, LLC (“Series U”) and Series R of UM Partners, LLC (“Series R” and together with Series U, the “Continuing Members”), following the approval at the extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders of CCH held on August 27, 2020.
UBI was determined to be the accounting acquirer and UBH was determined to be the accounting acquiree, in accordance with ASC 810, as the Company is considered to be the primary beneficiary of UBH after the Business Combination. Under the ASC 805, Business Combinations, acquisition method of accounting, purchase price allocation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed of UBH are presented based on their estimated fair values as of the closing of the Business Combination.
As a result of the Business Combination, UBI’s financial statement presentation distinguishes UBH as the “Predecessor” for periods prior to the closing of the Business Combination. UBI, which includes consolidation of UBH subsequent to the Business Combination, is the “Successor” for periods after the closing of the Business Combination. As a result of the application of the acquisition method of accounting in the Successor period, the financial statements for the Successor period are presented on a full step-up basis as a result of the Business Combination, and are therefore not comparable to the financial statements of the Predecessor period that are not presented on the same full step-up basis due to the Business Combination.
Key Developments and Trends
Our management team monitors a number of developments and trends that could impact our revenue and profitability objectives.
Long-Term Demographics, Consumer Trends, and Demand - We participate in the attractive and growing $28 billion U.S. salty snacks category, within the broader $97 billion market for U.S. snack foods. The salty snacks category has grown retail sales at an approximately 5.6% compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) over the last four years, including the increased in-home consumption of salty snacks due to COVID-19 during 2020. During fiscal 2020, snacking occasions are on the rise as consumers increasingly seek out convenient, delicious snacks for both on-the-go and at-home lifestyles. According to data from the Hartman Group, The Consumer Goods Forum, and IRI, approximately 50% of U.S. eating occasions are snacks, with 95% of the U.S. population snacking daily and the average American snacking 2.6 times per day based upon the latest available IRI data. Additionally, the salty snacks category has historically benefited from favorable competitive dynamics, including low private label penetration and category leaders competing primarily through marketing and innovation. We expect these consumer and category trends to continue to drive strong retail sales growth for salty snacks.
As a staple food product with resilient consumer demand and a predominantly domestic supply chain, the salty snack category is well positioned to navigate periods of economic disruption or other unforeseen global events. The U.S. salty snack category has demonstrated strong performance through economic downturns historically, growing at a 4% CAGR from 2007 to 2010 during the last recession. More recently, the U.S. salty snack category demonstrated strong performance during the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic which began in March 2020 in the U.S. For the 52 weeks ended December 27, 2020, U.S. retail sales for salty snacks based on IRI data increased by 9.1% versus the comparable prior year period while our retail sales increased by 15.1% in the same period.
Competition - The salty snack industry is highly competitive and includes many diverse participants. Our products primarily compete with other salty snacks but also compete more broadly for certain eating occasions with other snack foods. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the salty snack industry include taste, convenience, product variety, product quality, price, nutrition, consumer brand awareness, media and promotional activities, in-store merchandising execution, customer service, cost-efficient distribution, and access to retailer shelf space. We believe we compete effectively with respect to each of these factors.
Operating Costs - Our operating costs include raw materials, labor, manufacturing overhead, selling, distribution, general and administrative expenses. We manage these expenses through annual cost saving and productivity initiatives, sourcing and hedging programs, pricing actions, refinancing and tax optimization. Additionally, we maintain ongoing efforts led by our project management office, or PMO, to expand our profitability, including implementing significant reductions to our operating cost structure in both supply chain and overhead costs.
Taxes - On March 27, 2020, The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) was enacted which includes various tax provisions with retroactive effect. The CARES Act is an approximately $2 trillion emergency economic stimulus package in response to the Coronavirus outbreak, which among other things contains numerous income tax provisions. Some of these tax provisions are effective retroactively for years ending before the date of enactment. We deferred $7.8 million of payroll tax deposits per the CARES Act. The deferred payroll taxes must be deposited in two installments, with half due on December 31, 2021 and the remainder on December 31, 2022. We continue to evaluate the impact of the CARES Act; however, we believe it is unlikely to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flow.
Financing Costs - We regularly evaluate our variable and fixed-rate debt. We continue to use low-cost, short- and long-term debt to finance our ongoing working capital, capital expenditures and other investments and dividends. Our weighted average interest rate for the combined fifty-three weeks period ended January 3, 2021 was 4.9%, down from 5.5% during the same timeframe in fiscal 2019. We have begun to use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate changes, which can drive cash flow variability related to our debt. Refer to Note 8. "Long-Term Debt" and Note 9. "Derivative Financial Instruments and Purchase Commitments" to our audited consolidated financial statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (our "Audited Financial Statements") for additional information on debt, derivative and purchase commitment activity.
LIBOR Transition - As of January 3, 2021, we had $780.0 million in variable rate indebtedness, up from $650.6 million at December 29, 2019, all or a portion of which uses London Inter Bank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") as a benchmark for establishing applicable rates. As announced in July 2017, LIBOR is expected to be phased out by the end of 2021. On November 30, 2020, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Office of the Comptroller of Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation issued a public statement that the administrator of LIBOR announced it will consult on an extension of publication of certain U.S. Dollar LIBOR tenors until June 30, 2023, which would allow additional legacy USD LIBOR contracts to mature before the succession of LIBOR. The administrator has not yet announced the results of its consultation. Although many of our LIBOR-based obligations provide for alternative methods of calculating the interest rate payable if LIBOR is not reported, the extent and manner of any future changes with respect to methods of calculating LIBOR or replacing LIBOR with another benchmark are unknown and impossible to predict at this time and, as such, may result in interest rates that are materially higher than current interest rates. If interest rates applicable to our variable interest indebtedness increase, our interest expense will also increase, which could make it difficult for us to make interest payments and fund other fixed costs and, in turn, adversely impact our cash flow available for general corporate purposes.
COVID-19 - In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared that COVID-19 constituted a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern” and later characterized it as a “pandemic”. In response, we have taken necessary preventive actions and continue to implement safety measures to protect our employees who are working on and off site. The same time period, March 2020, also marked the beginning of COVID-19’s impact on the consumption, distribution and production of our products. Demand for product increased significantly for several weeks in late March and into April 2020 as customers “pantry-loaded” in response to “shelter-in-place” measures that were enacted in many markets. Following that initial spike, in the weeks that followed, demand for product has continued to out-pace prior year rates as families have favored “at-home” dining at a greater rate than pre-pandemic levels. We have serviced that demand by increasing production and distribution activities. Our strategic manufacturing capabilities and DSD distribution network have allowed us to effectively service the increased demand and be responsive to evolving market dynamics driven by changes in consumer behavior. We will continue to monitor customer and consumer activity and adapt our plans as necessary to best service the business.
Recent Developments and Significant Items Affecting Comparability
Acquisitions
On November 19, 2019, we entered into a stock purchase agreement to acquire all outstanding shares of common stock and certain real estate assets of Kitchen Cooked Inc., an Illinois corporation (“Kitchen Cooked”). We acquired Kitchen Cooked to expand our distribution and production capacity in Illinois and the surrounding area. The acquisition closed on December 30, 2019 when we made a cash payment of $6.9 million and recorded $2.0 million in deferred payment obligations for the acquisition of the outstanding shares of Kitchen Cooked as well as certain real estate supporting its operations.
On October 21, 2019, we closed on our acquisition of Kennedy Endeavors, LLC (“Kennedy”) from Conagra Brands Inc. Kennedy consists of Tim’s Cascade Snacks and Snyder of Berlin, which are snack food manufacturers. We acquired this business to expand our national footprint and our DSD snacks business as well as capture significant synergies. The acquisition provided us with the second largest DSD network for branded salty snacks in the Pacific Northwest, a leased, regional production facility outside of Seattle, Washington, and increased scale with retailers in the Western United States. We also acquired regional DSD routes and a production facility in Berlin, PA, which are highly complementary with our existing business in that region. Our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income include the operations of this business from October 21, 2019 through December 29 in 2019 and for all of fiscal year 2020.
On November 2, 2020, we completed the acquisition of certain assets from Conagra Brands, Inc. related to the H.K. Anderson business, a leading brand of peanut butter-filled pretzels for approximately $8 million. The transaction enables us to jump-start our entry into the growing filled pretzel segment, leveraging the synergies of our salty snack platform.
On November 11, 2020 the Company caused its subsidiaries, UQF and Heron, to enter into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the "Truco Acquisition") among UQF, Heron, Truco Holdco Inc. (“Truco”) and Truco Holdings LLC ("Truco Seller"). On December 14, 2020, pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company caused its subsidiary, Heron, to purchase and acquire from Truco Holdings LLC all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Truco (the “Truco Acquisition”). Upon completion of the Truco Acquisition, Truco became a wholly owned subsidiary of Heron. At the closing of the Truco Acquisition, the Company paid the aggregate cash purchase price of approximately $404.0 million to Truco Holdings LLC, including payments of approximately $5.8 million for cash on hand at Truco at the closing of the Truco Acquisition, less estimated working capital adjustments, subject to customary post-closing adjustments.
In addition, on December 14, 2020, UQF purchased and acquired from OTB Acquisition, LLC certain intellectual property (“OTB IP”) assets (“IP Purchase”) pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement, dated November 11, 2020, among UQF, Truco Seller and OTB Acquisition, LLC. The IP Purchase was determined to be an asset acquisition under the provisions of ASC Subtopic 805-50. The IP Purchase is accounted for separately from the Truco Acquisition, as Truco and the OTB IP were acquired from two different selling parties that were not under common control and are two separate transactions. The OTB IP was initially recognized and measured by the Company based on its purchase price of $79.0 million since it was acquired in asset purchase and is treated as an indefinite lived intangible assets.
Commodity Trends
We regularly monitor worldwide supply and commodity costs so we can cost-effectively secure ingredients, packaging and fuel required for production. A number of external factors such as weather conditions, commodity market conditions, and the effects of governmental, agricultural or other programs affect the cost and availability of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products. We address commodity costs primarily through the use of buying-forward, which locks in pricing for key materials between three and 18 months in advance. Other methods include hedging, net pricing adjustments to cover longer term cost inflation, and manufacturing and overhead cost control. Our hedging techniques, such as forward contracts, limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials; however, we may not be able to fully hedge against commodity cost changes, where there is a limited ability to hedge, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. Toward the end of 2020, we began to experience an increase in pricing in certain commodities that we expect to continue into 2021. Due to competitive or market conditions, planned trade or promotional incentives, or other factors, our pricing actions may also lag commodity cost changes.
While the costs of our principal raw materials fluctuate, we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available from numerous sources.
Independent Operator Conversions
Our DSD distribution is executed via company-owned routes operated by RSPs, and third-party routes managed by IOs. We have used the IO and RSP models for more than a decade. In fiscal year 2017, we embarked on a multi-year strategy to convert all company owned RSP routes to the IO model. The mix between IOs and RSP was approximately 79% and 21%, respectively as of January 3, 2021 versus a 77% and 23% ratio for IOs and RSPs respectively as of December 30, 2019. We took a brief pause in 2020 due to COVID-19 and our ERP implementation. We anticipate completing substantially all remaining conversions by the second quarter of fiscal year 2022. The conversion process involves selling distribution rights to a defined route to an IO. As we convert a large number of routes in a year, there is a meaningful decrease in the selling and administrative costs that we previously incurred on RSPs and a corresponding increase in discounts paid to IOs to cover their costs to distribute our product. The net impact is a reduction in Selling expenses and a decrease in Net Sales and Gross Profit. Conversions also impact our balance sheet resulting in cash proceeds to us as a result of selling the route to an IO, or by creating notes receivable related to the sale of the routes.
Controls and Procedures
Prior to the consummation of the Business Combination, we were not currently required to comply with the SEC’s rules implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and are therefore not required in connection with periods ended prior to the consummation of the Business Combination to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for that purpose. Since the consummation of the Business Combination, we are required to comply with the SEC’s rules implementing Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which require our management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports. We are required to provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting beginning with our annual report for the fiscal year ending January 3, 2021. We are not required to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 until our first annual report subsequent to our ceasing to be an “emerging growth company” within the meaning of Section 2(a) of the Securities Act.
Results of Operations
Overview
The following tables present selected financial data for the Successor period from August 29, 2020 through January 3, 2021, the Predecessor period from December 30, 2019 through August 28, 2020, as combined for the year ended January 3, 2021 and the years ended December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018.
We have prepared our discussion of the results of operations by comparing the results of the combined Successor period from August 29, 2020 through January 3, 2021 and the Predecessor period from December 30, 2019 through August 28, 2020 and the years ended December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018.
We believe this approach provides the most meaningful basis of comparison and is more useful in identifying current business trends for the periods presented. The combined results of operations included in our discussion below are not considered to be prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and have not been prepared as pro forma results under applicable regulations, may not reflect the actual results we would have achieved had the Business Combination occurred at the beginning of fiscal 2019, and should not be viewed as a substitute for the results of operations of the Predecessor and Successor periods presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
53 week Year Ended January 3, 2021 (Successor and Predecessor) versus 52 week Year Ended December 29, 2019 (Predecessor)
Net sales
Net sales was $325.6 million for the Successor period, $638.7 million from December 30, 2019 through August 28, 2020, and $768.2 million for the year ended December 29, 2019. Net sales for the combined year ended January 3, 2021 increased $196.1 million or 25.5% over the comparable period in 2019. The increase in net sales for the 53 weeks ended January 3, 2021 was related to the acquisitions of Kennedy, Kitchen Cooked, H.K. Anderson and Truco, increased sales across customers and geographies that were heightened by increased in-home consumption of salty snacks due to COVID-19, as well as a 53rd week. The 53rd week represents an increase of approximately $15.9 million.
IO discounts increased from $77.2 million for the for the year ended December 29, 2019 to $96.7 million for the corresponding combined year ended January 3, 2021. Excluding the impacts of acquisitions and changes to IO discounts, total net sales grew 16.7% for the combined year ended January 3, 2021 versus the corresponding period in 2019.
Net sales are evaluated based on classification as Power and Foundation brands. Power brands include our iconic heritage Utz brand; craft brands such as ON THE BORDER®, Zapp’s®, Golden Flake® Pork Skins, and Hawaiian®; “better for you” brands such as Good Health® and Boulder Canyon®; and selected licensed brands such as TGI Fridays® and Herdez®. Our Foundation brands are comprised of several regional brands, including Bachman®, Golden Flake® Chips and Cheese, Tim’s Cascade® Snacks, Snyder of Berlin®, and “Dirty” Potato Chips® as well as partner and private label brands.
For the combined year ended January 3, 2021, excluding the impact of higher IO discounts and brands acquired through our Kennedy, Kitchen Cooked, H.K. Anderson and Truco acquisitions, Power Brand sales increased by approximately 14%, while Foundation Brand sales decreased approximately 1% from 2019. Growth in Power Brands was led by Utz®, Zapp’s®, TORTIYAHS!® and Golden Flake Pork® Skins brands, with strong increases across Core, Expansion and Emerging Geographies. The decline in Foundation Brands reflects our strategy to focus on our Power Brands and continued softness in foodservice, up-and-down-the-street customers, and the convenience channel due to COVID-19. Conversely, our Power Brands have a stronger presence in large format channels, which have performed well during this time period.
Cost of goods sold and Gross profit
Gross profit was $105.7 million for the Successor period, $227.1 million from December 30, 2019 through August 28, 2020, and $253.8 million for the year ended December 29, 2019. Gross profit for the combined year ended January 3, 2021 increased $78.9 million or 31.1% over the comparable period in 2019. The increase in gross profit for fiscal year 2020 was driven by higher sales, contributions from the acquisition of Kennedy, Kitchen Cooked, H.K. Anderson and Truco, leveraging our existing infrastructure and available capacity, as well as lower per unit costs for materials and overhead driven by productivity initiatives, and lower commodity costs, which were partially offset by the amortization of acquired inventory of $5.8 million.
Our gross profit margin was 34.5% for the combined fiscal year 2020 versus 33.0% for the fiscal year ended 2019. Excluding the amortization of acquired inventory, the improvement in gross profit margin was primarily driven by the sales volume leverage on controllable overhead costs and productivity savings. IO discounts increased from $77.2 million in fiscal 2019 to $96.5 million in fiscal 2020, reducing gross profit by $19.3 million.
Selling and administrative expense
Selling and administrative expenses were $107.5 million for the Successor period, $195.6 million from December 30, 2019 through August 28, 2020, and $228.3 million for the year ended December 29, 2019. Selling and administrative expenses for the combined year ended January 3, 2021 increased $74.8 million or 33% over fiscal 2019. The increased expenses in fiscal 2020 were driven by higher transaction-related service provider fees, higher operational costs related to incremental sales volume, operating expense of the acquired Kennedy, Kitchen Cooked, H.K. Anderson and Truco businesses, higher incentive compensation expense and an additional 53rd week.
Gain (loss) on sale of assets
Gain on sale of assets was $0.9 million for the Successor period, $1.3 million from December 30, 2019 through August 28, 2020, and $13.3 million for the year ended December 29, 2019. Gain on sale of assets was primarily driven by a reduction in the number of conversions of RSP routes to IO routes, which resulted in lower proceeds from the sale of routes in fiscal year 2020 compared to the same time period in fiscal year 2019. Additionally, Company owned routes were recorded at fair value as a result of the Business Combination, which resulted in increasing the IO route asset by $10.5 million.
Other (expense) income, net
Other expense, net was $15.4 million for the Successor period, $25.4 million from December 30, 2019 through August 28, 2020, and $49.0 million for the year ended December 29, 2019. The Company incurred $2.5 million of expenses in connection with the repayment of the Senior Secured First Lien Note and incremental interest of $1.1 million and deferred financing fees that were expensed of $4.7 million related to the bridge loan in connection with the acquisition of Truco during the Successor period. Interest expense decreased $8.4 million for the combined year ended January 3, 2021, versus the fiscal year 2019. The lower interest expense was driven by a reduction in the comparative average LIBOR rate and payoff of the existing second lien term loan and subsequent origination of a new term loan with a lower fixed rate component in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2019, which favorably impacted the fiscal year 2020.
Income taxes
Income taxes were a benefit of $0.3 million for the Successor period, expense of $4.0 million for December 30, 2019 through August 28, 2020, and expense of $3.1 million for the year ended December 29, 2019.
Year Ended December 29, 2019 (Predecessor) versus Year Ended December 30, 2018 (Predecessor)
Net sales
Net sales for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 remained relatively flat, with a $3.8 million and 0.5% decrease year over year. The decrease in net sales was related to the conversion of RSP operated routes to IOs which resulted in additional discounts and commissions offered to IOs. IO discounts increased from $58.0 million in fiscal 2018 to $77.2 million in fiscal 2019, reducing net sales by $19.2 million for the period. This conversion was mostly offset by the fourth quarter results associated with the acquisition of Kennedy, which closed on October 21, 2019.
Excluding the offsetting impact of the Kennedy Acquisition and changes in IO discounts, Power brands, which accounted for approximately 78% of the overall sales, increased by approximately 2%. This was partially offset by a decrease in sales of approximately 5% within the Foundation brands, which accounted for the remaining 22%. Growth in Power brands was led by the Utz, Zapp’s and Golden Flake Pork Skins brands, partially offset by the negative impact of a strategic realignment of the Boulder Canyon and TGI Fridays brands as part of the Inventure Foods integration process. The decrease in sales of Foundation brands primarily resulted from our strategic decision to exit certain low-margin, non-core private label businesses acquired through previous acquisitions.
Cost of goods sold and Gross profit
Our gross profit for fiscal 2019 was $253.8 million, a $12.9 million and 4.8% decrease compared to gross profit of $266.7 million for fiscal 2018. The decrease in gross profit in fiscal year 2019 was made up of a net $16.8 million reduction due to conversion of RSP routes to IOs which increased IO discounts and decreased cost of stale and damaged product, $5.4 million increase due to the Kennedy Acquisition, and $1.5 million reduction primarily due to higher input costs. Our gross profit margin was 33.0% and 34.5% for fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily driven by the conversion of RSP routes to IOs as well as lower overall gross profit margins of Kennedy and higher input costs. IO discounts increased from $58.0 million in fiscal 2018 to $77.2 million in fiscal 2019, reducing gross profit by $19.2 million for the period. Excluding the impact of increased IO discounts due to DSD route conversions, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have increased by 0.2% from 34.5% to 34.7%.
Selling and administrative expense
Our selling and administrative expenses for fiscal 2019 were $228.3 million, a $23.1 million and 9.2% decrease, compared to selling and administrative expenses of $251.4 million for fiscal 2018. The decrease in selling and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2019 was primarily made up of an $18.0 million reduction driven by conversion of RSP operated routes to IOs over the course of fiscal years 2018 and 2019. IO conversions resulted in decreased RSP compensation and benefit costs, fleet expenses, and sales management costs in fiscal year 2019. Selling and administrative expenses also decreased by $6.7 million primarily due to a full year of benefit from integration-related cost savings realized from the acquisition of Inventure Foods. These decreases were partially offset by $1.6 million of increased marketing investments for sponsorships in fiscal year 2019.
Gain (loss) on sale of assets
Our gain on sale of assets for fiscal 2019 was $13.3 million, a $9.2 million and 225.8% increase, compared to our gain on sale of assets of $4.1 million for fiscal 2018. The increase in gain on sale of assets for fiscal year 2019 was primarily driven by the sale of one of our plants for a $4.6 million gain, compared to a net loss realized on the disposal of computer hardware and software and other certain assets in 2018. In addition, gain on sale of routes to IOs contributed $0.9 million to the increase in gain on sale of assets for fiscal year 2019.
Other (expense) income, net
Other expense, net for fiscal 2019 was $49.0 million, $48.4 million of which was related to interest expense. Of the 2019 interest expense, $43.7 million was related to our credit facility and other long-term debt, $2.1 million was related to deferred financing fees, and $2.6 million was related to Notes Payable - IO loans. The interest expense on Notes Payable - IO loans is a pass-through expense that has an offsetting interest income within other income, net, which is paid by such IO. Other expense, net for fiscal 2018 was $45.1 million, $45.7 million of which was related to interest expense. Of the 2018 interest expense, $42.3 million was related to our credit facility and other long-term debt, $2.4 million was related to deferred financing fees, and $0.7 million was related to IO loans. The total interest expense increased by $2.7 million or 5.8%. This change was primarily driven by an increase in the average LIBOR rate on our variable rate debt and our pass-through interest expense on notes payable related to the financing of the sale of IO routes, which were partially offset by lower interest expense in connection with the repayment of our Second Lien Term Loan in fiscal year 2019.
Income taxes
Income taxes for the fiscal year 2019 was $3.1 million, a $1.2 million increase, compared to income taxes of $1.9 million for fiscal 2018, which was primarily due to the mix of income related to taxable entities and nontaxable partnerships. Under our predecessor structure, we were generally not subject to entity-level taxes for income generated through our limited liability companies that were taxed as operating partnerships; consequently, our income tax expense for the predecessor periods relates primarily to certain corporate subsidiaries that are subject to corporate income taxes.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We use non-GAAP financial information and believe it is useful to investors as it provides additional information to facilitate comparisons of historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and provides additional insight and transparency on how we evaluate the business. We use non-GAAP financial measures to budget, make operating and strategic decisions, and evaluate our performance. We have detailed the non-GAAP adjustments that we make in our non-GAAP definitions below. The adjustments generally fall within the categories of non-cash items, acquisition and integration costs, business transformation initiatives, and financing-related costs. We believe the non-GAAP measures should always be considered along with the related U.S. GAAP financial measures. We have provided the reconciliations between the U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures below, and we also discuss our underlying U.S. GAAP results throughout this MD&A section.
Our primary non-GAAP financial measures are listed below and reflect how we evaluate our current and prior-year operating results. As new events or circumstances arise, these definitions could change. When the definitions change, we will provide the updated definitions and present the related non-GAAP historical results on a comparable basis.
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Further Adjusted EBITDA
We define EBITDA as Net Income before Interest, Income Taxes, and Depreciation and Amortization.
We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA further adjusted to exclude certain non-cash items, such as accruals for long-term incentive programs, hedging and purchase commitments adjustments, and asset impairments; Acquisition and Integration Costs; Business Transformation Initiatives; and Financing-Related Costs.
We define Further Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA after giving effect to pre-acquisition EBITDA of Kennedy, pre-acquisition Adjusted EBITDA of Kitchen Cooked, and pre-acquisition EBITDA of Collier Creek Holdings. We also report Further Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Pro Forma Net Sales as an additional measure to evaluate our Further Adjusted EBITDA margins on Pro Forma Net Sales.
Adjusted EBITDA is one of the key performance indicators we use in evaluating our operating performance and in making financial, operating, and planning decisions. We believe EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Further Adjusted EBITDA are useful to investors in the evaluation of Utz’s operating performance compared to other companies in the salty snack industry, as similar measures are commonly used by companies in this industry. We have also historically reported an Adjusted EBITDA metric to investors and banks for covenant compliance. We also report Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Net Sales as an additional measure for investors to evaluate our Adjusted EBITDA margins on Net Sales.
The following tables provides a reconciliation from Net (Loss) Income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA the fiscal periods ended January 3, 2021 and August 28, 2020, and years ended December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018:
(1)Interest Income from IO Loans refers to Interest Income that we earn from IO notes receivable that have resulted from our initiatives to transition from RSP distribution to IO distribution. (“Business Transformation Initiatives”). There is a Notes Payable recorded that mirrors the IO notes receivable, and the interest expense associated with the Notes Payable is part of the Interest Expense, Net adjustment.
(2)Certain Non-Cash Adjustments are comprised primarily of the following:
Incentive programs - Utz Quality Foods, LLC, our wholly-owned subsidiary, established the 2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2018 LTIP”) for employees in February 2018. The Company recorded income of $3.0 million for the Predecessor period from December 30, 2019 to August 28, 2020. The income was the result of the conversion rate of the 2018 LTIP Phantom Units into the 2020 LTIP RSUs. The Company recorded expenses of $6.5 million and $7.9 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Expenses incurred for the 2018 LTIP are non-operational in nature and are expected to decline upon the vesting of the remaining phantom units from fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2019 at the end of fiscal year 2021. The phantom units under the 2018 LTIP were converted into the 2020 LTIP RSUs as part of the Business Combination. Additionally, in the Successor period, the Company incurred $6.8 million of share based compensation for the Successor period from August 29, 2020 to January 3, 2021
Purchase Commitments and Other Adjustments - We have purchased commitments for specific quantities at fixed prices for certain of our products’ key ingredients. To facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating results, this adjustment was made to remove the volatility of purchase commitment related gains and losses. For the year ended January 3, 2021, we recorded a benefit of $0.2 million compared to a benefit of $0.9 million and expense of $1.1 million during 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Asset Impairments and Write-Offs - There were no adjustments for impairments recorded in 2020. However, we did record impairments on certain trade name intangible brand assets in fiscal years 2019 and 2018 totaling $3.8 million and $2.9 million, respectively. Impairments recorded in fiscal years 2019 and 2018 were for a brand acquired from Inventure and a brand acquired from Golden Flake, respectively. In 2018, we also wrote-off certain computer hardware and software acquired in recent acquisitions that we retired totaling $0.6 million.
(3)Adjustment for Acquisition and Integration Costs - This is comprised of consulting, transaction services, and legal fees incurred for acquisitions and certain potential acquisitions. In 2020, the majority of charges are related to costs incurred for the Business Combination, the HK Anderson acquisition, and the Truco acquisition, and related integration expenditures where we incurred costs of $40.0 million in 2020 compared to expenses of $3.3 million and $11.3 million for the same periods in 2019 and 2018 respectively. The fiscal 2018 adjustment included a $4.0 million write-off of certain plant assets to discontinue our manufacturing plant in Denver, Colorado, following a strategic review of manufacturing capacity related to the Inventure integration. Later, in fiscal 2019, we recorded $4.6 million in proceeds from the sale of the facility, included in the 2019 adjustment.
(4)Business Transformation Initiatives Adjustment - This adjustment is related to consultancy, professional, and legal fees incurred for specific initiatives and structural changes to the business that do not reflect the cost of normal business operations. In addition, certain Rice/Lissette family-related costs incurred but not part of normal business operations, and gains realized from the sale of distribution rights to IOs and the subsequent disposal of trucks, offset by severance costs associated with the elimination of RSP positions, fall into this category. In 2020, total net cost was $8.8 million compared to $5.1 million and $3.0 million net cost for the 2019 and 2018, respectively.
(5)Financing-Related Costs - These costs include adjustments for various items related to raising debt and preferred equity capital. In fiscal 2020, we incurred $2.5 million of expenses related to a prepayment penalty for the pay-down of debt and $0.2 million of other debt raising and preferred equity capital costs. In fiscal 2019, these costs include expenses related to the sale of preferred and common units by Series U, Series R, and SRS to an outside investor, the repayment of the Second Lien Term Loan, and the issuance of the Secured First Lien Note to finance the Kennedy Acquisition. Financing-Related Costs adjustments of $4.7 million, and $0.9 million, were made in fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. The amount in fiscal 2019 includes $4.3 million related to a loss recognized on extinguishment of debt related to the repayment of the Second Lien Term Loan as well as $0.4 million in professional fees related to the new capital raised, which were partially offset by deferred financing fees.
(6)Pre-Acquisition Adjusted EBITDA- This adjustment represents the adjusted EBITDA of acquired companies prior to the acquisition date.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The following table presents net cash provided by operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the fifty-three weeks ended January 3, 2021 and fifty-two weeks ended December 29, 2019.
For the period ended January 3, 2021, our consolidated cash balance, including cash equivalents, was $46.9 million or $31.8 million higher than at December 29, 2019. Net cash provided by operating activities for the combined fifty-three weeks ended January 3, 2021 was $29.7 million compared to $28.0 million for the fifty-two weeks ended December 29, 2019, with the difference largely driven by the increase in gross margin and lower interest expense partially offset by the increased cash expenses associated with transaction costs. Cash used in investing activities for the combined fifty-three weeks ended January 3, 2021 was $703.4 million mostly driven by the Business Combination and capital expenditures of $21.7 million, versus cash used in investing activity of $115.9 million for the fifty-two weeks ended December 29, 2019, which was driven by the acquisitions of Truco and the corresponding ON THE BORDER tradename, along with the acquisition of UBH, Kitchen Cooked and the H.K. Anderson business. Additionally, during fiscal year 2019, we sold certain IO notes, which resulted in cash proceeds of $33.2 million. Net cash provided by financing activities was $231.5 million for the combined fifty-three weeks ended January 3, 2021, which was primarily as a result of the bridge credit agreement for the acquisition of Truco and exercise of warrants, versus net cash provided by financing activities of $96.0 million for the fifty-two weeks ended December 29, 2019.
Financing Arrangements
The primary objective of our financing strategy is to maintain a prudent capital structure that provides us flexibility to pursue our growth objectives. We use short-term debt as management determines is reasonable, principally to finance ongoing operations, including our seasonal requirements for working capital (generally accounts receivable, inventory, and prepaid expenses and other current assets, less accounts payable, accrued payroll, and other accrued liabilities), and a combination of equity and long-term debt to finance both our base working capital needs and our non-current assets.
Revolving Credit Facility
On November 21, 2017, UBH entered into an asset based revolving credit facility (the “ABL facility”) in an initial aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million. The ABL facility was set to expire on the fifth anniversary of closing, or November 21, 2022. On April 1, 2020, the ABL facility was amended to increase the credit limit up to $116.0 million and to extend the maturity through August 22, 2024. On July 23, 2020 the ABL facility was amended to add language around the public structure. On December 18, 2020 the ABL facility was amended to increase the credit limit up to $161.0 million. No amounts were outstanding under this facility as of January 3, 2021 or December 29, 2019. Availability under the ABL facility is based on a monthly accounts receivable and inventory borrowing base certification, which is net of outstanding letters of credit. As of January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, $106.4 million and $83.0 million, respectively, was available for borrowing, net of letters of credit. The facility bears interest at an annual rate based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 1.50% (ranging from 1.50% to 2.00% based on availability) or the prime rate plus an applicable margin of 0.50% (ranging from 0.50% to 1.00%). Under the Prime rate, had there been outstanding balances, the interest rate on the facility as of January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019 would have been 3.75% and 5.25%, respectively. Had there been outstanding balances and the Company elected to use the LIBOR rate, the interest rate on the ABL facility as of January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019 would have been 1.64% and 3.30%, respectively. The ABL facility is also subject to unused line fees (0.5% at January 3, 2021) and other fees and expenses.
Standby letters of credit in the amount of $14.1 million have been issued as of January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019. The standby letters of credit are primarily issued for insurance purposes.
Term Loans
On November 21, 2017, the Company entered into a First Lien Term Loan Credit Agreement (the “First Lien Term Loan”) in a principal amount of $535.0 million and a Second Lien Term Loan Credit Agreement (the “Second Lien Term Loan”, and collectively with the First Lien Term Loan, the “Term Loans”) in a principal amount of $125.0 million. The proceeds of the Term Loans were used to refinance the Company’s January 2017 credit facility and fund the acquisition of Inventure Foods and the repurchase of the predecessor membership units held by a minority investor.
The First Lien Term Loan requires quarterly principal payments of $1.3 million beginning March 2018, with a balloon payment due for any remaining balance on the seventh anniversary of closing, or November 21, 2024. On August 28, 2020, as part of the Business Combination (as described in Note 1. "Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and Note 2. "Acquisitions") an advance payment of principal was made on the First Lien Term Loan of $111.6 million, as such no principal payments are due until November 21, 2024. The First Lien Term Loan bears interest at an annual rate based on either LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 3.50%, or prime rate plus an applicable margin of 2.50%. The interest rate on the First Lien Term Loan as of January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019 was 3.65% and 5.20%, respectively.
The Company incurred closing and other costs associated with the Term Loans, which were allocated to each loan on a specific identification basis based on original principal amounts. Finance fees allocated to the First Lien Term Loan and the Second Lien Term Loan were $10.7 million and $4.1 million, respectively, which are presented net within “non-current portion of debt” on the consolidated balance sheets for the predecessor periods. Deferred fees are amortized ratably over the respective lives of each term loan. Deferred fees associated with the term loans under the January 2017 credit agreement were fully expensed during 2017 and deferred financing fees were derecognized as a result of the Business Combination as described in the Note 1. "Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and Note 2. "Acquisitions".
On October 1, 2019, the Company repaid the Second Lien Term Loan with the proceeds of the sale of preferred and common units by Series U, Series R, and SRS. The Company accounted for the repayment of the Second Lien Term Loan as a debt extinguishment as the investors who purchased the preferred units and common units were not parties to the Second Lien Term Loan. The total repayment was $126.3 million, and resulted in a loss on early extinguishment of approximately $4.3 million. On January 20, 2021, the First Lien Term Loan was refinanced. See Note 23. "Subsequent Event" for further details.
Separately, on October 21, 2019, the Company entered into a Senior Secured First Lien Floating Rate Note (the “Secured First Lien Note”) in a principal amount of $125.0 million. Proceeds from the Secured First Lien Note were used primarily to finance the Kennedy acquisition. The Secured First Lien Note requires quarterly interest payments, with a repayment of principal on the maturity date of November 21, 2024. The Secured First Lien Note bears interest at an annual rate based on 3 month LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 5.25%. The interest rate on the Secured First Lien Note on August 28, 2020, prior to payoff was 6.7%. On August 28, 2020, as part of the Business Combination Agreement with CCH (as described in Note 1. "Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and Note 2. "Acquisitions"), the Senior Secured First Lien Floating Rate Note was paid off. The total repayment was $128.8 million, which includes a $2.5 million early termination fee included within other expense (income), net in the Successor period and $1.3 million of interest expense which had been accrued in the Predecessor period.
On December 14, 2020, the Company entered into a Bridge Credit Agreement with a syndicate of banks, led by Bank of America, N.A. The proceeds of the Bridge Credit Agreement were used to fund the Company’s acquisition of Truco and asset purchase of the OTB IP from Truco Seller and OTB Acquisition, LLC., see Note 2. "Acquisitions" for more details, in which the Company withdrew $490.0 million to finance the acquisition. The Bridge Credit Agreement bears interest at an annual rate based on 4.25% Base plus 1 month LIBOR with scheduled incremental increases to the base rate, as defined in the Bridge Credit Agreement. The loan will be converted into an Extended Term Loan if the Loan remains open 365 days after the closing date. As of January 3, 2021, the outstanding balance of the Bridge Credit Agreement was $370.0 million, with $120.0 million being repaid from the redemption of the Company's warrants. On January 20, 2021, the bridge loan was repaid in full by the refinancing of term debt. See Note 23. "Subsequent Event" for further details.
The First Lien Term Loan, the Secured First Lien Note and the ABL facility are collateralized by substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the Company. The credit agreements contain certain affirmative and negative covenants as to operations and the financial condition of the Company. The Company was in compliance with its financial covenant as of January 3, 2021.
Derivative Financial Instruments
To reduce the effect of interest rate fluctuations, the Company entered into an interest rate swap contract on September 6, 2019, with an effective date of September 30, 2019, with a counter party to make a series of payments based on a fixed interest rate of 1.339% and receive a series of payments based on the greater of LIBOR or 0.00%. Both the fixed and floating payment streams are based on a notional amount of $250 million. The Company entered into this transaction to reduce its exposure to changes in cash flows associated with its variable rate debt and has designated this derivative as a cash flow hedge. At January 3, 2021, the effective fixed interest rate on the long-term debt hedged by this contract was 4.4%. For further treatment of the Company’s interest rate swap, refer to “Note 10. Fair Value Measurements” and “Note 13. Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income.”
IO Loan Purchase Commitments
The Company sold notes receivable on its books to Bank of America during 2019, which the Company partially guarantees. The outstanding balance of notes purchased by Bank of America at January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019 was $16.5 million and $25.1 million, respectively. Due to the structure of the transaction, the sale did not qualify for sale accounting treatment, as such the Company records the notes payable obligation owed by the IOs to the financial institution on its books; the corresponding note receivable also remained on the Company’s books. The maximum amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these guarantees equates to 25% of the outstanding loan balance on the first day of each calendar year plus 25% of the amount of any new loans issued during such calendar year. These loans are collateralized by the routes for which the loans are made. Accordingly, the Company has the ability to recover substantially all of the outstanding loan value upon default.
The Company guarantees loans made to IOs by M&T Bank for the purchase of routes. The agreement with M&T Bank was amended in January 2020 so that the Company guaranteed up to 25% of the greater of the aggregate principal amount of loans outstanding on the payment date or January 1st of the subject year. The outstanding balance of loans guaranteed was $6.6 million and $8.6 million at January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, respectively, all of which was on balance sheet. These loans are collateralized by the routes for which the loans are made. Accordingly, the Company has the ability to recover substantially all of the outstanding loan value upon default.
Other Notes Payable and Capital Leases
During the first fiscal quarter of 2020, the Company closed on the acquisition of Kitchen Cooked, as described in Note 2. "Acquisitions" and the acquisition included a deferred purchase price of $2.0 million. Additionally, during the first fiscal quarter of 2020, the Company purchased intellectual property that included a deferred purchase price of $0.5 million.
During fiscal 2019, the Company sold $33.2 million of notes receivable from IOs on its books for $34.1 million in a series of transactions to a financial institution. Due to the structure of the transaction, the sale did not qualify for sale accounting treatment and the Company has recorded the notes payable obligation owed by the IOs to the financial institution on its books; the corresponding notes receivable also remained on the Company’s books. The Company services the loans for the financial institution by collecting principal and interest from the IOs and passing it through to the institution. The underlying notes have various maturity dates through December 2028. The Company partially guarantees the outstanding loans, as discussed in further detail within “Note 12. Contingencies”. These loans are collateralized by the routes for which the loans are made. Accordingly, the Company has the ability to recover substantially all of the outstanding loan value upon default.
Interest expense for the Successor period from August 29, 2020 to January 3, 2021 was $13.3 million, $7.9 million of which was related to the Company’s credit facility and other long-term debt and $4.7 million of which was related to amortization of deferred financing fees, and $0.7 million of which was related to IO loans. Interest expense for the Predecessor period from December 30, 2019 to August 28, 2020 was $26.7 million, $23.3 million of which was related to the Company’s credit facility and other long-term debt, $1.7 million of which was related to amortization of deferred financing fees, and $1.7 million of which was related to IO loans. Interest expense for the year ended December 29, 2019 was $48.4 million, $43.7 million of which was related to the Company’s credit facility and other long-term debt, $2.1 million of which was related to amortization of deferred financing fees, and $2.6 million of which was related to IO loans. Interest expense for the year ended December 30, 2018 was $45.7 million, $42.3 million of which was related to the Company’s credit facility and other long-term debt, $2.4 million of which was related to amortization of deferred financing fees, and $0.7 million of which was related to IO loans. The interest expense on IO loans is a pass-through expense that has an offsetting interest income within Other Income (Expense).
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Purchase Commitments
Additionally, the Company has outstanding purchase commitments for specific quantities at fixed prices for certain key ingredients to economically hedge commodity input prices. These purchase commitments totaled $33.2 million as of January 3, 2021. The Company has recorded purchase commitment gain (losses) totaling $0.9 million and $(0.7) million for the Successor period from August 29, 2020 to January 3, 2021 and for the Predecessor period from December 30, 2019 to August 28, 2020, respectively. The Company has recorded purchase commitment gain (losses) totaling $0.9 million and $(1.1) million for the years ended December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018, respectively.
IO Guarantees-Off-Balance Sheet
The Company partially guarantees loans made to IOs by Cadence Bank for the purchase of routes. The outstanding balance of loans guaranteed was $4.1 million and $5.1 million at January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, respectively, all of which was recorded by the Company as an off balance sheet arrangement. The maximum amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under the guarantees equates to 25% of the outstanding loan balance up to $2.0 million. These loans are collateralized by the routes for which the loans are made. Accordingly, the Company has the ability to recover substantially all of the outstanding loan value upon default.
The Company partially guarantees loans made to IOs by Bank of America for the purchase of routes. The outstanding balance of loans guaranteed that were issued by Bank of America was $7.1 million and $0.7 million at January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, respectively, which are off balance sheet. As discussed in “Note 8. Long-Term Debt”, the Company also sold notes receivable on its books to Bank of America during fiscal 2019, which the Company partially guarantees. The outstanding balance of notes purchased by Bank of America at January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019 was $16.5 million and $25.1 million, respectively. Due to the structure of the transaction, the sale did not qualify for sale accounting treatment, as such the Company records the notes payable obligation owed by the IOs to the financial institution on its books; the corresponding note receivable also remained on the Company’s books. The maximum amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these guarantees equates to 25% of the outstanding loan balance on the first day of each calendar year plus 25% of the amount of any new loans issued during such calendar year. These loans are collateralized by the routes for which the loans are made. Accordingly, the Company has the ability to recover substantially all of the outstanding loan value upon default.
New Accounting Pronouncements
See Note 1. "Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," to the audited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
General
Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. While the majority of our revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities are not based on estimates, there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change. Critical accounting policies are defined as those policies that are reflective of significant judgments, estimates and uncertainties, which could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1. Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K; however, the following discussion pertains to accounting policies we believe are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant, difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Other companies in similar businesses may use different estimation policies and methodologies, which may affect the comparability of our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows to those of other companies.
Revenue Recognition
Our revenues primarily consist of the sale of salty snack items that are sold through DSD and Direct-To-Warehouse distribution methods, either directly to retailers or via distributors. We sell to supermarkets, mass merchandisers, club warehouses, convenience stores and other large-scale retailers, merchants, distributors, brokers, wholesalers, and IOs (which are third party businesses). These revenue contracts generally have a single performance obligation. Revenue, which includes shipping and handling charges billed to the customer, is reported net of variable consideration and consideration payable to customers, including applicable discounts, returns, allowances, trade promotion, consumer coupon redemption, unsaleable product, and other costs. Amounts billed and due from customers are classified as receivables and require payment on a short-term basis and, therefore, we do not have any significant financing components.
We recognize revenue when (or as) performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the goods to customers. Control is transferred upon delivery of the goods to the customer. Shipping and/or handling costs that occur before the customer obtains control of the goods are deemed to be fulfillment activities and are accounted for as fulfillment costs. Applicable shipping and handling are included in customer billing and are recorded as revenue as products’ control is transferred to customers. We assess the goods promised in customers’ purchase orders and identify a performance obligation for each promise to transfer a good that is distinct.
We offer various forms of trade promotions and the methodologies for determining these provisions are dependent on local customer pricing and promotional practices, which range from contractually fixed percentage price reductions to provisions based on actual occurrence or performance. Our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and include activities such as in store displays and events, feature price discounts, consumer coupons, and loyalty programs. The costs of these activities are recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded, which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure. The recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer. These estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs. In 2019, we implemented a system that improves our ability to analyze and estimate the reserve for unpaid costs relating to our promotional activities. Differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are recognized as a change in management estimate as the actual redemption incurred.
Distribution Route Purchase and Sale Transactions
We purchase and sell distribution routes as a part of our maintenance of our DSD network. As new IOs are identified, we either sell our existing routes to the IOs or sell routes that were previously purchased by us to the IOs. Gain/loss from the sale of a distribution route is recorded upon the completion of the sale transaction and signing of the relevant documents and is calculated based on the difference between the sale price of the distribution route and the asset carrying value of the distribution route as of the date of sale. We record intangible assets for distribution routes that we purchase based on the payment that we make to acquire the route and record the purchased distribution routes as indefinite-lived intangible assets under Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. The indefinite lived intangible assets are subject to annual impairment testing.
Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangibles
We allocate the cost of acquired companies to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the remaining amount classified as goodwill. The identification and valuation of these intangible assets and the determination of the estimated useful lives at the time of acquisition, as well as the completion of impairment tests, require significant management judgments and estimates. These estimates are made based on, among other factors, review of projected future operating results and business plans, economic projections, anticipated highest and best use of future cash flows and the cost of capital. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets, and potentially result in a different impact to our results of operations. Further, changes in business strategy and/or market conditions may significantly impact these judgments and thereby impact the fair value of these assets, which could result in an impairment of the goodwill or intangible assets.
Finite-lived intangible assets consist of distribution/customer relationships, technology, trademarks and non-compete agreements. These assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives. Finite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment only when management has determined that potential impairment indicators are present.
Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets (including trade names, master distribution rights and Company owned routes) are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances change that indicate impairment may have occurred. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level.
As we have early adopted Accounting Standards Update 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, we will record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over our fair value.
ASC 350, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets also permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform quantitative impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. If an entity believes, as a result of each qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that goodwill or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is not impaired, a quantitative impairment test is not required.
We have identified the existing snack food operations as our sole reporting unit. For the qualitative analysis performed, which took place on the first day of the fourth quarter, we have taken into consideration all the events and circumstances listed in FASB ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, in addition to other entity-specific factors that have taken place from the period of the business combination which assessed goodwill on August 28, 2020. We have determined that there was no significant impact that affected the fair value of the reporting unit.
Income Taxes
We account for income taxes pursuant to the asset and liability method of ASC 740, Income Taxes, which require us to recognize current tax liabilities or receivables for the amount of taxes we estimate are payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases of assets and liabilities and the expected benefits of net operating loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period enacted. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that a portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income and the reversal of deferred tax liabilities during the period in which related temporary differences become deductible.
We follow the provisions of ASC 740-10 related to the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements. ASC 740-10 prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns.
The benefit of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our income tax returns is recognized in the financial statements if such positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. Differences between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit recognized and measured pursuant to the interpretation are referred to as “unrecognized benefits”. A liability is recognized (or amount of net operating loss carryover or amount of tax refundable is reduced) for an unrecognized tax benefit because it represents an enterprise’s potential future obligation to the taxing authority for a tax position that was not recognized as a result of applying the provisions of ASC 740-10. Interest costs and related penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are required to be calculated, if applicable. Our policy is to classify assessments, if any, for tax related interest as interest expense and penalties as selling and administrative expenses. As of January 3, 2021, and December 29, 2019, no liability for unrecognized tax benefits was required to be reported. We do not expect any significant changes in our unrecognized tax benefits in the next year.
Business Combinations
We evaluate acquisitions of assets and other similar transactions to assess whether or not the transaction should be accounted for as a business combination or asset acquisition by first applying a screen test to determine if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. If the screen is met, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition. If the screen is not met, further determination is required as to whether or not we have acquired inputs and processes that have the ability to create outputs which would meet the definition of a business. Significant judgment is required in the application of the screen test to determine whether an acquisition is a business combination or an acquisition of assets.
We use the acquisition method in accounting for acquired businesses. Under the acquisition method, our financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Self-Insurance
We are primarily self-insured, up to certain limits, for employee group health claims. We purchase stop-loss insurance, which will reimburse us for individual and aggregate claims in excess of certain annual established limits. Operations are charged with the cost of claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported.
We are primarily self-insured through large deductible insurance plans for automobile, general liability and workers’ compensation. We have utilized a number of different insurance vehicles and programs for these insurable risks and recognizes expenses and reserves in accordance with the provisions of each insurance vehicle/program.
