Recent Developments
New Product Launch
In November 2020, we launched Marchex Marketing Edge, a new solution that enables brand marketers and agencies to tie revenue-generating conversations back to the specific marketing campaigns that generated them. This new product captures conversational data across multiple communication channels, including calls, text, and chat - as well as web form completions - and uses AI-powered conversation intelligence to identify and classify the conversations that can drive sales. It helps enable businesses to complete and enrich the picture of their digital marketing performance and power automated actions by flowing conversational data into a growing list of third party Martech, Adtech, CRM and chat systems, and makes it simpler to create custom integrations.
Divestiture
In October 2020, we sold certain assets related to the Local Leads Platform, Call Marketplace and other assets not related to core conversational analytics (the “Divestiture”). The purchaser is a related party controlled by a shareholder and officers of the Company. At closing, we received cash consideration of approximately $2.3 million. The sale also includes (i) contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue and thresholds from the Call Marketplace, Local Leads Platform and the purchaser’s total business; (ii) certain contingent sale transaction consideration; (iii) shares of Class B common stock in the purchaser equal to the issuance of a 10% equity interest; and (iv) the cancellation of Company stock options for 1.5 million shares held by two executive officers of our Company who were involved in the transaction.
In connection with the closing, we also entered into an administrative support services agreement with the purchaser pursuant to which we will provide administrative services to the purchaser for a support services fee, with certain guaranteed payments to us in the first year and contingently in the second year following closing.
This Divestiture has been classified as discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. See Note 12. Discontinued Operations of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Tender Offer
In October 2020, we completed a joint and equal tender offer with Edenbrook Capital, LLC for the purchase of 10 million shares of Class B common stock at $2.15 per share, of which our share of the repurchase totaled approximately $10.8 million for 5 million shares.
COVID-19
In late 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 emerged and by early March 2020 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. Across the United States and the world, governments and municipalities instituted measures in an effort to control the spread of COVID-19, including quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, school closings, travel restrictions and the closure of non-essential businesses. By the end of March 2020, the macroeconomic impacts became significant, exhibited by, among other things, a rise in unemployment and market volatility.
The rapid spread of COVID-19 globally has resulted in increased travel restrictions and disruption and shutdown of businesses. We have experienced adverse impacts from quarantines, market downturns and changes in customer behavior related to pandemic fears and impacts on our workforce due to COVID-19. In addition, many of our customers, reseller partners and agencies, service providers and suppliers have experienced financial distress, and may file for bankruptcy protection, go out of business, or suffer further disruptions in their business due to the coronavirus outbreak. The extent to which the coronavirus impacts our continuing results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, but has resulted in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition at least for the near term.
For most of the quarter ended March 31, 2020, our results reflect historical trends and seasonality. However, beginning in March 2020 and through December 31, 2020, we experienced a decline in revenues due to the impact of COVID-19 and the related reductions in global economic activity and reduced spending by our customers in response to the macroeconomic impact. We also assessed the realized and potential credit deterioration of our customers due to changes in the macroeconomic environment, which has been reflected in an increase in our allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable as of the year ended December 31, 2020. Additionally, we determined that indicators of impairment had occurred during the first quarter of 2020, which resulted in us performing an interim impairment analysis during the first quarter of 2020. As a result of this interim impairment test, we recognized an impairment of our intangible long-lived assets and goodwill during the first quarter of 2020. See the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. For additional information for the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions on our business and operations, refer to “Results of Operations” within this discussion and analysis and Item 1.A of Part I, “Risk Factors”.
Acquisition
In December 2019, we acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Sonar Technologies, Inc. (“Sonar”) for consideration of approximately $8.5 million in cash at closing and approximately 1.0 million shares of Class B common stock to be issued over the three-year period following the acquisition date, with the timing of issuance subject to certain conditions and with any shares not previously issued to be issued on the fifth anniversary of the acquisition date. We also agreed to issue up to approximately 389,000 shares of Class B common stock based upon the achievement of certain financial target goals by Sonar in 2020. These financial targets were not met in 2020.
The Company accounted for the Sonar acquisition as a business combination. See Note 9. Acquisition of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Factors Affecting our Performance
We utilize phone numbers as part of a number of analytics services to our customers such as our call and text analytics and communications. If we are not able to secure or retain sufficient phone numbers needed for our services or we are limited in the number of available telecommunication carriers or vendors to provide such phone numbers to us in the event of any industry consolidation or if telecommunication carriers or vendors were to experience system disruptions, our revenue and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. We anticipate that these variables will fluctuate in the future, affecting our ability to grow and our financial results. In particular, it is difficult to project call and text usage, the number of calls or texts or other actions performed by users of our services.
Our quarterly results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future due to seasonality. Our experience has shown that during the spring and summer months, call volumes in certain verticals such as home services are generally higher than during other times of the year and during the latter part of the fourth quarter of the calendar year we generally experience lower call volumes. The extent to which call volumes may decrease during these off-peak periods is difficult to predict. Prolonged or severe decreases in call volumes during these periods may adversely affect our growth rate and results and in turn the market price of our securities. However, there can be no assurances such seasonal trends will consistently repeat each year. Historically, we have seen this trend generally reversing in the first quarter of the calendar year with increased call volumes and often new budgets at the beginning of the year for many of our customers with fiscal years ending December 31. However, there can be no assurances such seasonal trends will consistently repeat each year.
In addition, as discussed elsewhere in this report, we have and may continue to experience impacts from quarantines, market downturns and changes in customer behavior related to the pandemic. We believe that our future revenue growth will depend on, among other factors, our ability to attract new customers, compete effectively, maximize our sales efforts, successfully improve existing analytics products and sales engagement solutions, and develop successful new products and solutions. If we are unable to generate adequate revenue growth and to manage our expenses, we may continue to incur significant losses in the future and may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability.
Components of the Results of our Operations
Revenue
We generate the majority of our revenues from core analytics and solutions services. Our call analytics technology platform provides data and insights that can measure the performance of calls and texts for our customers. We generate revenue from our call analytics technology platform when customers pay us a fee for each call/text or call/text related data element they receive from calls or texts including call-based ads we distribute through our sources of call distribution or for each phone number tracked based on a pre-negotiated rate. Customers typically receive the benefit of our services as they are performed and substantially all of our revenue is recognized over time as services are performed.
In certain cases, we record revenue based on available and reported preliminary information from third parties. Collection on the related receivables may vary from reported information based upon third party refinement of the estimated and reported amounts owed that occurs subsequent to period ends.
Service Costs
Our service costs represent the cost of providing our services to our customers. These costs primarily consist of telecommunication costs, including the use of phone numbers relating to our services; colocation service charges of our network equipment; bandwidth and software license fees; network operations; and payroll and related expenses of personnel, including stock based compensation.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and sales functions; advertising and promotional expenditures including online and outside marketing activities; cost of systems used to sell to and serve customers; and stock-based compensation of related personnel.
Product Development
Product development costs consist primarily of expenses incurred in the research and development, creation and enhancement of our products and services.
Our research and development expenses include payroll and related expenses for personnel; costs of computer hardware and software; costs incurred in developing features and functionality of the services we offer; and stock-based compensation of related personnel.
For the periods presented, substantially all of our product development expenses are research and development. Product development costs are expensed as incurred or capitalized into property and equipment in accordance U.S. GAAP.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses for executive and administrative personnel; professional services, including accounting, legal and insurance; bad debt provisions; facilities costs; other general corporate expenses; and stock-based compensation of related personnel.
Stock-Based Compensation
We measure stock-based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize it as expense over the vesting or service period, as applicable, of the stock-based award using the straight-line method. We account for forfeitures as they occur. Stock-based compensation expense is included in the same lines as compensation paid to the same employees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Amortization of Intangibles from Acquisitions
Amortization of intangible assets excluding goodwill relates to intangible assets identified in connection with our acquisitions. The intangible assets have been identified as customer relationships; acquired technology; non-competition agreements; tradenames. These assets are amortized over useful lives ranging from 12 to 60 months.
Provision for Income Taxes
We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax law is recognized in results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.
Results of Operations
The following table presents revenue from continuing operations and certain of our operating results from continuing operations as a percentage of revenue (in thousands):
Stock-based compensation expense was included in the following operating expense categories as follows (in thousands):
See Note 5(b). Stock Option Plan of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as our Critical Accounting Policies for additional information about stock-based compensation.
Revenue
Revenue decreased 6% from $54.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $51.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was due primarily to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on customer usage, rate discounts provided as a result of customer distress, and to a lesser extent, fewer customer accounts. These decreases were offset in part due to a full year of revenue contribution from Sonar, which we acquired in December 2019.
In the immediate term, we expect our revenues to be modestly lower or similar to levels of our most recent quarter as a result of the business disruption caused by the continuing coronavirus pandemic. While we saw some recovery in the latter part of 2020, we expect the disruption to our customers and our prospective customers will cause further delays in the sales process, delays in signing new customers, a decrease in business and rates from existing customers, and also delays in launching pilots and tests and new customer programs that were previously planned, resulting in lower near term revenues from our customers as well as lower than anticipated future new revenues from our prospective customers. We also expect that financial difficulties and business interruptions caused by the coronavirus impact has and will further result in some cases in payment delays, and an impairment of our customers’ ability to make payments, which we expect will further reduce our revenues from recent quarterly results.
In the longer term, we believe that our new product releases and growth initiatives may enable the Company to progress, resulting in an opportunity for potential revenue growth. A preliminary indicator of this potential growth is that several customers and prospective customers have indicated that they plan to initiate trials and are considering the adoption of new products, which would result in new revenue opportunities.
Expenses
Service Costs. Service costs increased 16% from $18.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $20.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. As a percentage of revenues, service costs were 33% and 41% for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The increase in dollars was primarily due to an increase in communication and network costs totaling $3.0 million resulting from our infrastructure initiatives, which include cloud migration initiatives, certain platform integrations and other initiatives. The increase as a percentage of revenue was primarily the result of these initiatives in conjunction with lower corresponding revenues in 2020.
We expect in the near and intermediate term that service costs in absolute dollars will be similar in relation to the most recent periods. Upon completion of various 2021 infrastructure efficiency initiatives, there may also be a positive impact on service costs as a percentage of revenue and further benefit in the event we generate contribution from new launches of analytics products and sales engagement solutions.
Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses increased 21% from $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing expenses were 25% and 33% for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The net increase in dollars and as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to an aggregate net increase in personnel and outside service provider costs and stock-based compensation costs totaling $3.6 million, offset in part by an aggregate net decrease in travel related costs largely due to pandemic influenced restrictions and outside marketing costs totaling $700,000. The increase in personnel costs was primarily the result of an increase in the
number of personnel to enhance our sales and marketing activities, and to a lesser extent, as a result of the acquisition of Sonar in 2019. The percentage of revenue increase was also attributable to lower revenues in 2020.
We expect some volatility in sales and marketing expenses based on the timing of marketing initiatives but expect sales and marketing expenses in the near term to increase in connection with any revenue increase. We also expect, to the extent that we increase our marketing activities, this could correspondingly also cause an increase as a percentage of revenue. We also believe that if pandemic related restrictions ease, travel related costs will increase as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.
Product Development. Product development expenses increased 17% from $17.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. As a percentage of revenue, product development expenses were 33% and 41% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The net increase in dollars and as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to an aggregate increase in personnel and outside service provider costs totaling $3.2 million, which was primarily the result an increased investment in our product and infrastructure initiatives, as well as the acquisition of Sonar in December 2019. The percentage of revenue increase was also attributable to lower revenues in 2020.
In the immediate and longer term, to the extent our revenues increase, we expect that product development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we increase the number of personnel and consultants to enhance our service offerings.
General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased 2% from $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative expenses were 24% and 25% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The slight decrease in dollars was primarily comprised of a decrease in personnel and outside service provider costs and stock-based compensation costs totaling $600,000 and a decrease in travel related costs of $200,000, offset by an aggregate increase in professional fees, and bad debt expenses of approximately $600,000 that were largely a result of pandemic influences on customers.
We also expect our general and administrative expenses to increase to the extent that we expand our operations and incur additional costs in connection with being a public company, including expenses related to professional fees and insurance, and as a result of stock-based compensation expense. We also expect fluctuations in our general and administrative expenses to the extent the recognition timing of stock compensation is impacted by market conditions relating to our stock price. In addition, we anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will be adversely impacted by the continuing COVID-19 pandemic at least for the near term.
Amortization of Intangible Assets from Acquisitions. Intangible amortization expenses was $6.3 million and $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively, The expense was associated with amortization of intangible assets acquired in the Telmetrics and Callcap acquisitions in November 2018 for the 2019 period, and with amortization of intangible assets acquired in the Telmetrics and Callcap acquisitions and the Sonar acquisition in 2019 for the 2020 period. During 2019 and 2020, the amortization of intangibles related to service costs, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded an impairment charge totaling $5.0 million relating to our intangible assets from acquisitions. For additional information, see the discussion in “Impairment of Goodwill and Impairment of Intangible Assets from Acquisitions” below.
Acquisition and Disposition-related Benefits. The change in the acquisition and disposition-related benefits from $400,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to a $1.5 million adjustment in 2020 to the estimated fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities related to our acquisition of Telmetrics in November 2018 and our acquisition of Sonar in December 2019, offset by accretion of interest expense and professional and related fees primarily associated with acquisition and disposition related matters during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Impairment of Goodwill and Impairment of Intangible Assets from Acquisitions. For the three months ended March 31, 2020, our stock price was impacted by volatility in the U.S. financial markets as a result of the rapid spread of the coronavirus globally which has resulted in increased travel restrictions and disruption and shutdown of businesses, and traded below the then book value for an extended period of time. Accordingly, we tested our goodwill for impairment and concluded that the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value of our single reporting unit and recognized an estimated impairment loss during the first quarter of 2020 of $14.7 million. The estimated fair value of our single reporting unit was based on estimates of future operating results, discounted cash flows and other market-based factors, including our stock price. The goodwill impairment loss resulted primarily from a sustained decline in our common stock share price and market capitalization as well as lower projected revenue growth rates and profitability levels compared to historical results. The lower projected operating results
reflect changes in assumptions related to organic revenue growth rates, market trends, business mix, cost structure, and other expectations about the anticipated short-term and long-term operating results. As of December 31, 2020, we have $17.6 million of goodwill remaining on our balance sheet.
In addition, we performed an interim impairment test of our long-lived intangible assets using an undiscounted cash flow analysis to determine if the cash flows expected to be generated by the asset groups over the estimated remaining useful life of the primary assets were sufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset groups, which were determined to be at the acquisition level (Telmetrics, Callcap and Sonar). Based on this analysis, which included evaluating various cash flow scenarios, the undiscounted cash flows were not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the groups. As a result, we were required to determine the fair value of each asset group. To estimate the fair value, we utilized both the cost recovery and income approach, which is based on a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and calculates the fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to the asset group and then discounting the after-tax cash flows to present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. Assumptions used in the DCF require significant judgment, including judgment about appropriate discount rates and terminal values, growth rates, and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The forecasted cash flows are based on our most recent strategic plan and for periods beyond the strategic plan, our estimates were based on assumed growth rates expected as of the measurement date. We believe our assumptions were consistent with the plans and estimates that a market participant would use to manage the business. Based on the results of this testing, we recorded a pretax non-cash impairment totaling $5.0 million in the first quarter of 2020 relating to customer relationships, technologies, non-compete agreements and tradenames. This charge is reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ending December 31, 2020. The identified intangible assets acquired in the Telmetrics, Callcap and Sonar acquisitions, after this charge, are $9.2 million in aggregate as of December 31, 2020 and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a range of useful lives of 12 to 60 months.
The current business environment is subject to evolving market conditions and requires significant management judgment to interpret the potential impact to our assumptions. To the extent that changes in the current business environment impact our ability to achieve levels of forecasted operating results and cash flows, or should other events occur indicating the remaining carrying value of our assets might be impaired, we would test our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment and may recognize an additional impairment loss to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds such assets’ fair values. No additional impairment of our intangible assets has been discovered since the first quarter of 2020. We will continue to monitor our financial performance, stock price and other factors in order to determine if there are any additional indicators of impairment. As a result, we may record an additional impairment loss in the near or intermediate term, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Income Tax (Benefit). The income tax (benefit) from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 was ($3.5 million) and ($1.9 million), respectively. The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted primarily of deferred tax benefits related to one of our foreign jurisdictions, tax benefits from the release of a portion of our valuation allowance resulting from the acquisition of Sonar, and an allocation of profits to discontinued operations. The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted primarily of deferred tax benefits related to one of our foreign jurisdictions and an allocation of profits to discontinued operations, offset in part by U.S. state income tax expense. The effective tax rate differed from the expected tax rate of 21% for 2019 and 2020 due to a full valuation allowance and to a lesser extent due to state income taxes, non-deductible stock-based compensation related to incentive stock options recorded under the fair-value method, federal research and development credits, and other non-deductible amounts. We recognized approximately $290,000 of federal research and experimental credits for 2020.
At December 31, 2020, based on all the available evidence, both positive and negative, we determined that it is not more likely than not that our deferred tax assets (excluding certain insignificant Canadian deferred tax assets) will be realized and accordingly, we have recorded a 100% valuation allowance of $43.3 million against our net deferred tax assets ($44.6 million of deferred tax assets that are partially offset by $1.3 million in reversing deferred tax liabilities). This compares to a 100% valuation allowance of $19.1 million at December 31, 2019. The 2019 valuation allowance includes a partial release of $1.0 million as a result of newly recognized deferred tax liabilities related to the acquisition of Sonar in December 2019, as well as a reclassification of $18.4 million of the valuation allowance to discontinued operations. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, based on all the available evidence, both positive and negative, we considered whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. We considered the future reversal of deferred tax liabilities, carryback potential, projected taxable income, and tax planning strategies as well as the Company’s history of taxable income or losses in the relevant jurisdictions in making this assessment. We have incurred federal taxable losses in 2019 and 2020.
Discontinued Operations, net of tax. In October 2020, we sold certain assets related to the Local Leads Platform, Call Marketplace and other assets note related to core conversational analytics. The operating results related to these dispositions are shown as discontinued operations, net of tax.
Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $5.7 million and $3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. In the October 2020 sale, we received net cash proceeds at closing of $2.3 million and the sale includes contingent earn-out payments that depend on the achievement of certain sales thresholds. No gain or loss on the sale of discontinued operations was recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations as it was sold to a related party. See Note 12. Discontinued Operations of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Net Loss. Net loss from continuing operations was $9.7 million in 2019 compared to net loss of $42.0 million in 2020. The increase in loss during the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily attributable to a long-lived intangible assets and an estimated goodwill impairment charge with no corresponding amounts in the 2019 period, and to a lesser extent, higher amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions costs in 2020 as a result of the Sonar acquisition in December 2019 and due to higher operating costs in the 2020 period. These increases in costs were partially offset by a $1.5 million adjustment in the 2020 period to the estimated fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities related to our acquisition of Telmetrics in November 2018 and to our acquisition of Sonar in December 2019.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $41.7 million and $33.9 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had current debt of $5.1 million and current and long-term contractual obligations of $7.5 million, of which $5.3 million is for rent under our facility operating leases.
Cash used in operating activities was $3.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, of which approximately $7.0 million was used by continuing operations and $3.6 was provided by discontinued operations. The cash used in continuing operations was primarily a result of a net loss of $42.0 million, adjusted for non-cash items of $29.6 million, which primarily included the aggregate estimated impairment of goodwill and intangible assets from acquisitions of $19.6 million, in addition to depreciation and amortization, stock based compensation, the allowance for doubtful accounts and other changes in working capital, offset by an adjustment to the estimated fair value of our contingent consideration liability related to our acquisition of Telmetrics in November 2018 and Sonar in December 2019.
Cash provided by operating activities was $5.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, of which approximately $800,000 was used by continuing operations and $5.9 million was provided by discontinued operations. The cash used in continuing operating activities was primarily a result of a net loss of $9.7 million adjusted for non-cash items of $8.7 million, which included depreciation and amortization, stock based compensation, allowance for doubtful accounts, offset by a change in deferred taxes and the change in the estimated fair value of our contingent consideration liability related to our acquisition of Telmetrics in November 2018.
We expect that, at least for the near term, our revenues will be lower than in recent periods as a result of business disruption to our customers and prospects caused by the continuing pandemic. We do believe the disruption will impact our business in the intermediate and long term as well in part because several customers have had their operations permanently impacted or shut down. Further, we expect in 2021, that in some cases financial difficulties and business interruptions caused by the COVID-19 outbreak have and will result in further payment delays and an impairment of our customers to make payments. In turn, this will also cause our revenues to be lower than current levels if customers are unable to procure our services at the same volumes as previously, which we expect will be the case for several of our customers. It will also adversely impact our collectability associated with our accounts receivable balances and result in higher bad debt expenses. In addition, we expect it will reduce our cash flows from the levels we have experienced in recent periods. This expected adverse impact on our operating cash flows will correspondingly reduce our liquidity
Additionally, the Seattle, WA City Council recently implemented a new employee payroll tax which imposed a quarterly tax on businesses with rates ranging from 0.7% to 2.4% on certain employee and independent contractor earnings and will be effective January 1, 2021. We expect that this new employee payroll tax expense will result in an increase in our operating expenses since a number of our employees are based in Seattle. In addition, we expect it will reduce our cash flows to some extent from the levels we have experienced in recent periods. This expected impact on our operating cash flows will correspondingly reduce our liquidity.
Cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $981,000 was all attributable to continuing operations and was primarily attributable to cash received from the sale of certain assets related to the Local Leads Platform, Call Marketplace and other assets note related to core conversational analytics in October 2020, partially offset by cash paid for purchases of property and equipment. Consideration received at closing consisted of cash proceeds of $2.3 million. Our liquidity and results of operations will be significantly affected by divesting these operations as the associated revenue and expenses and any potential contribution will no longer be included in our results of operations.
Cash used in investing activities was $9.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, of which approximately $9.6 million was used by continuing operations and $100,000 was used in discontinued operations. The cash used in continuing investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily attributable to cash paid for our acquisition of Sonar in 2019, net of cash acquired, and purchases of property and equipment.
We expect property and equipment purchases in the near and intermediate term to be relatively similar compared to our most recent periods. We expect any increase to our operations to have a corresponding increase in expenditures for our systems and personnel. We plan to make a strategic expense investment in 2021 to address various infrastructure initiatives, including consolidating infrastructure and data centers. In consideration of the strategic expense initiative, we expect our expenditures for product development initiatives will be relatively stable to modestly higher in the near and intermediate term and increase in the longer term in absolute dollars with any acceleration in development activities and as we increase the number of personnel and consultants to enhance our service offerings. In the intermediate to long term, we also expect to increase the number of personnel supporting our sales, marketing and related growth initiatives.
Cash used in financing activities was $5.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, of which approximately $5.7 million was used by continuing operations and $200,000 was provided by discontinued operations. The cash used in continuing financing activities was primarily attributable to repurchases of common stock, offset by proceeds received as part of the CARES Act funding. During the second quarter of 2020, we secured promissory notes to bank lenders pursuant to government loan programs (“the Loans”). The balance at December 31, 2020 is $5.1 million. The Loans were made under, and are subject to the terms and conditions of, the CARES Act and are administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”). The Loans bear an interest rate of 1% per annum, have a two-year maturity, and allows for early repayment and a deferment period in excess of six months. Amounts under the loans will be repayable to the lenders in monthly installments following the six-month deferment period. We expect this repayment commencement period to be in the third quarter of 2021. The loans or portions thereof may be eligible for forgiveness if certain requirements of the government program are met, however, in the event we assess and determine all or a portion may be eligible for forgiveness, the amount, if any, that ultimately may be forgiven is uncertain. Due to the uncertainties concerning the anticipated timing of repayment that are not within our control as well as the evolving parameters and interpretations of requirements, these loans are presented as a current liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, under a foreign wage subsidy program in response to the pandemic, a subsidiary received approximately $415,000 in funding, that was treated as a reduction of payroll expenses during year ended December 31, 2020.
The repurchases of common stock were a result of a joint and equal tender with Edenbrook Capital LLC for 10 million shares of the Company's Class B common stock at $2.15 per share, of which the Company's share of the repurchase totaled approximately $10.8 million for 5 million shares. In November 2014, our board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program (the “2014 Repurchase Program”) which supersedes and replaces any prior repurchase programs. Under the 2014 Repurchase Program, we are authorized to repurchase up to 3 million shares of our Class B common stock in the aggregate through open market and privately negotiated transactions, at such times and in such amounts as we deem appropriate. Repurchases may also be made under a Rule 10b5-1 plan, which would permit shares to be repurchased when we might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, capital availability, and other market conditions. The 2014 Repurchase Program does not have an expiration date and may be expanded, limited or terminated at any time without prior notice. We have made no repurchases under the 2014 Repurchase Program for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020.
Cash provided by continuing financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 of approximately $1.9 million was primarily attributable to proceeds from option exercises.
Based on our operating plans we believe that our resources will be sufficient to fund our operations, including any investments in strategic initiatives, for at least twelve months, however the length and severity of the pandemic could influence our operating plans and resources significantly. Additional equity and debt financing may be needed
to support our acquisition strategy, our long-term obligations and our company’s needs. There can be no assurance that, if we needed additional funds, financing arrangements would be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Failure to generate sufficient revenue or raise additional capital could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern and to achieve our intended business objectives.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). Our critical accounting policies are those that we believe have the most significant impact to reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities and that require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgements.
The policies below are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. In the ordinary course of business, we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of our results. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Practices, we believe the following topics reflect our critical accounting policies and our more significant judgement and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.
Principles of Consolidation
Our Company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest. Additionally, there are situations in which U.S. GAAP requires consolidation even though the usual condition of consolidation (ownership of a majority voting interest) does not apply. Generally, this occurs when an entity holds an interest in another business enterprise that was achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests, which results in a disproportionate relationship between such entity's voting interests in, and its exposure to the economic risks and potential rewards of, the other business enterprise. This disproportionate relationship results in what is known as a variable interest, and the entity in which we have the variable interest is referred to as a "VIE." An enterprise must consolidate a VIE if it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
Our Company holds a remaining interest in the related party purchaser of our divested operations, for which we determined we were not the primary beneficiary. Our variable interests in this VIE primarily relate to the issuance of a 10% equity interest in the related party purchaser; contingent consideration related to the transaction; and an administrative support services arrangement. Refer to Note 12, Discontinued Operations. Although this financial arrangement resulted in our holding variable interests in this related party entity, it did not empower us to direct the strategic and operational activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance.
All inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain reclassifications have been made to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the prior periods to conform to the current period presentation.
Revenue
We generate the majority of our revenues from core analytics and solutions services. Our call analytics technology platform provides data and insights that can measure the performance of calls and texts for our customers. We generate revenue from our call analytics technology platform when customers pay us a fee for each call/text or call/text related data element they receive from calls or texts including call-based ads we distribute through our sources of call distribution or for each phone number tracked based on a pre-negotiated rate. As such, the majority of total revenue is derived from contracts that include consideration that is variable in nature. The
variable elements of these contracts primarily include the number of transactions (for example, the number qualified phone calls).
Customers typically receive the benefit of our services as they are performed and substantially all of our revenue is recognized over time as services are performed. The majority of the Company’s customers are invoiced on a monthly basis following the month of the delivery of services and are required to make payments under standard credit terms.
For arrangements that include multiple performance obligations, the transaction price from the arrangement is allocated to each respective performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price and recognized when revenue recognition criteria for each performance obligation are met. The standalone selling price for each performance obligation is established based on the sales price at which we would sell a promised good or service separately to a customer or the estimated standalone selling price.
In certain cases, we record revenue based on available and reported preliminary information from third parties. Collection on the related receivables may vary from reported information based upon third-party refinement of the estimated and reported amounts owed that occurs subsequent to period ends.
Stock-Based Compensation
FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation (ASC 718) requires the measurement and recognition of compensation for all stock-based awards made to employees, non-employees and directors including stock options, restricted stock issuances, and restricted stock units be based on estimated fair values. We account for forfeitures as they occur. We measure stock-based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize it as expense over the vesting or service period, as applicable, of the stock-based award using the straight-line method.
We generally use the Black-Scholes option pricing model as our method of valuation for stock-based awards with time-based vesting. Our determination of the fair value of stock-based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected life of the award, our expected stock price, volatility over the term of the award and actual and projected exercise behaviors.
Although the fair value of stock-based awards is determined in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation the assumptions used in calculating fair value of stock-based awards and the use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model is highly subjective, and other reasonable assumptions could provide differing results. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. See Note 6(b). Stock Option Plan in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Advertiser Credits
Accounts receivable balances are presented net of allowance for doubtful accounts and advertiser credits. The allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our accounts receivable. We determine our allowance based on analysis of historical bad debts, advertiser concentrations, advertiser creditworthiness and current economic trends. We review the allowance for collectability on a quarterly basis. Account balances are written off against the allowance after all reasonable means of collection have been exhausted and the potential recovery is considered remote. If the financial condition of our advertisers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, or if we underestimated the allowances required, additional allowances may be required which would result in increased general and administrative expenses in the period such determination was made.
We determine our allowance for advertiser credits and adjustments based upon our analysis of historical credits. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments and estimates.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations accounted for under the purchase method. Intangible assets from acquisitions represent customer relationships, technologies, non-compete agreements, and tradenames related to previous acquisitions. These assets are determined to have definite lives and are amortized on a straight-line basis
over the estimated period over which we expect to realize economic value related to the intangible asset. The amortization periods range from one year to 5 years.
We apply the provisions of the FASB ASC Topic 350, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other” (ASC 350) whereby assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but instead test for impairment at least annually. ASC 350 also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over the respective estimated lives to their estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC 360, “Property Plant and Equipment” (ASC 360). Intangible assets are "grouped" and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows.
Goodwill is tested annually on November 30 for impairment. Goodwill and intangible assets are also tested more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. The provisions of the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets allow us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. Events and circumstances considered in determining whether the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets may not be recoverable include but are not limited to: significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results; significant changes in the use of the assets; and significant changes in competition and market dynamics. These estimates are inherently uncertain and can be affected by numerous factors, including changes in economic, industry or market conditions, changes in business operations, a loss of a significant customer, changes in competition or changes in the share price of common stock and market capitalization. If our stock price were to trade below book value per share for an extended period of time and/or we experience adverse effects of a continued downward trend in the overall economic environment, changes in the business itself, including changes in projected earnings and cash flows, we may have to recognize an impairment of all or some portion of our goodwill and intangible assets. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset or asset group’s fair value. If the fair value is lower than the carrying value, a material impairment charge may be reported in our financial results. We exercise judgment in the assessment of the related useful lives of intangible assets, the fair values, and the recoverability. In certain instances, the fair value is determined in part based on cash flow forecasts and discount rate estimates. We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of goodwill or intangible assets. Should the value of goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we would record the appropriate charge, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Any future impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
Provision for Income Taxes
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and certain international jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax law is recognized in results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.
We determined that it is not more likely than not that our deferred tax assets (excluding certain insignificant Canadian deferred tax assets) will be realized and accordingly recorded 100% valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. In assessing whether it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized, factors considered included: historical taxable income, historical trends related to advertiser usage rates, projected revenues and expenses, macroeconomic conditions, issues facing the industry, existing contracts, our ability to project future results and any appreciation of its other assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. We considered the future reversal of deferred tax liabilities, carryback potential, projected taxable income, and tax planning strategies as well as its history of taxable income or losses in the relevant jurisdictions in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical taxable losses and the uncertainty of projections for future taxable income over the periods for which the deferred tax assets are deductible, we concluded that it is not more likely than not that the gross deferred tax assets will be realized.
From time to time, various state, federal, and other jurisdictional tax authorities undertake reviews of us and our filings. We believe any adjustments that may ultimately be required as a result of any of these reviews will not be material to the financial statements.
Leases
We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. This determination generally depends on whether the arrangement conveys to us the right to control the use of an explicitly or implicitly identified fixed asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Control of an underlying asset is conveyed to us if we obtain the rights to direct the use of and to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from using the underlying asset. We have lease agreements which include lease components. We do not have lease agreements which include non-lease components or variable lease components.
Operating leases are included in right of use assets (“ROU”) and lease liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Operating lease payments are recognized as lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We primarily leases office facilities which are classified as operating leases. We do not have finance leases. ASC 842 requires a lessee to discount its unpaid lease payments using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, its incremental borrowing rate. As an implicit interest rate is not readily determinable in our leases, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The lease term for all of our leases includes the non-cancellable period of the lease. Options for lease renewals have been excluded from the lease term (and lease liability) for our leases as the reasonably certain threshold is not met. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability are comprised of fixed payments.
The new standard also provides practical expedients for an entity’s ongoing accounting. We elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify. This means, for those leases that qualify, we did not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities, and this included not recognizing ROU assets or lease liabilities for existing short-term leases of those assets in transition. We also elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for all of its leases.
