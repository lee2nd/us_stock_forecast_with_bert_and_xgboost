Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Our Management’s Discussion and Analysis contains not only statements that are historical facts, but also statements that are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are, by their very nature, uncertain and risky. These risks and uncertainties include international, national and local general economic and market conditions; demographic changes and pandemics; our ability to sustain, manage, or forecast growth; our ability to successfully make and integrate acquisitions; raw material costs and availability; new product development and introduction; existing government regulations and changes in, or the failure to comply with, government regulations; adverse publicity; competition; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; changes in business strategy or development plans; business disruptions; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the ability to protect technology; and other risks that might be detailed from time to time in our filings with the SEC.
Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements. The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the Company is based upon, and should be read in conjunction with, the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Plan of Operation
Cool Technologies, Inc. and subsidiary, (“the Company” or “Cool Technologies” or “CoolTech”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada in July 2002. In April 2014, CoolTech formed Ultimate Power Truck, LLC (“Ultimate Power Truck” or “UPT”), of which the Company owns 95% and a shareholder of Cool Technologies owns 5%. Cool Technologies was formerly known as Bibb Corporation, as Z3 Enterprises, and as HPEV, Inc. On August 20, 2015, the Company changed its name to Cool Technologies, Inc.
The Company’s technologies are divided into two distinct but complementary categories: mobile power generation and heat dispersion technology.
The Company has developed a mobile power generation system (MG) that enables work trucks to generate electric power by running an in-chassis generator. The MG system can be retrofit onto new and existing American trucks. CoolTech intends to sell the mobile electric power system to government, commercial and fleet vehicle owners. Sales are expected to occur through the direct efforts of the Company, its sales agents and its joint venture partners. CoolTech may also license the MG system as well.
The markets targeted include consumer, agricultural, industrial, military and emergency responders, both in the U.S. and worldwide.
CoolTech has also developed heat dispersion technologies based on proprietary composite heat structures and heat pipe architecture in various product platforms such as electric motors, pumps, turbines, bearings and vehicle components. In preparation, Cool Technologies filed for and received a trademark for Totally Enclosed Heat Pipe Cooled: TEHPC.
When a generator is enhanced by CoolTech’s patented thermal technologies, it should be able to output more power than any other generator of its size on the market. That’s because third party testing has demonstrated that the cooling provided by the thermal technologies can help increase the efficiency of electric motors.
Furthermore, management believes that the technologies will increase the lifespan as well as help meet regulatory emissions standards for electric motors and other heat producing equipment and components. The simplicity of the heat pipe architecture as well as the fact that it provides effective new applications for existing manufacturing processes should enhance the cost structure in several large industries including motor/generator and engine manufacturing.
As of December 31, 2020, we have seven US patents, one Canadian patent, two granted patents (1 Mexican, 1 Canadian) and two pending applications (1 in the US, 1 in Brazil) covering composite heat structures, motors, and related structures, heat pipe architecture, and applications (commonly referred to as “thermal” or “heat dispersion technology”). We also have one Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) application pending that covers integrated electrical power generation methods and systems.
The Company intends to commercialize its patents by integrating the thermal technologies and applications with Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) partners and by licensing them to electric motor, generator, pump and vehicle component (brake, resistor, caliper) manufacturers.
We believe the benefits of our mobile power generation systems are quickly realized once potential customers see it in operation. Public demonstrations of the MG systems began in April 2017. An inspection and performance demonstration for Mexican government officials and business leaders occurred in May 2018. Feedback from initial viewers resulted in more government officials and fruit growers coming to see the MG power equipment and to learn about the water purification options in March 2019. Even more officials and growers followed -- flying to St. Louis for a review in May 2019.
We generated our first Mobile Generation order during the quarter ended June 30, 2014 and received a partial deposit in advance of completing the sale. On June 9, 2017, the Company received a purchase order for 10 MG systems from Craftsmen Industries. As Craftsmen builds custom vehicles designed to the individual specifications of their customers whose businesses and technical requirements vary widely, it is impossible to estimate when the order will be fulfilled.
In November 2017, the Company received a purchase commitment for 234 MG systems from a Mexican Producers’ Union. That was followed by a purchase commitment for 24 to 50 MG units from a second Mexican Producers’ Union in December 2017. On April 9, 2018, the first Mexican Producers’ Union executed a purchase order with the Company for 10 Fords with MG80 kVA systems installed. On May 7, 2019, Turkish technology company Belirti Teknoloji, A.S. delivered a purchase order for six hundred MG80, MG125 and MG200 Mobile Generation systems. As of the December 31, 2020, the Company does not have the funds available to fulfill the orders.
Craftsmen Industries was selected to produce the first systems due to its engineering capabilities and extensive facilities. In January 2019, it began production on the initial vehicles and completed an initial production run vehicle two months later.
We have not generated any revenues to date. Consequently, there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to generate new orders nor fulfill the existing ones nor address all the requirements of all the interested parties.
Management is pursuing various financing alternatives, based upon a third-party assessment of the historically demonstrated or contractually committed profit-earning capacities of our IP. We see this as the best path forward for non-dilutive funding.
If funding is received, it will be used to support completion of the initial phases of our business plan, which is to license our thermal technologies and applications; to license or sell a mobile electric power system; and to license our submersible motor dry pit technologies and/or to bring to market our technologies and applications through key distribution and joint venture partners. As of the filing date, it is uncertain whether COVID-19 will continue to have a significant impact on production and distribution of Company products.
The occurrence of an uncontrollable event such as the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected our operations over the past year. A pandemic typically results in social distancing, travel bans, lockdowns and quarantines. This has limited access to our facilities, customers, management, support staff and professional advisors. These, in turn, have impacted our operations and financial condition. It may also impact demand for our products and may continue to hamper our efforts to provide our investors with timely information and comply with our filing obligations with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Significant Developments
Amendment of Series B Preferred Stock
On October 31, 2016, the Company filed an amended and restated Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation (which was originally filed with the Secretary of State of Nevada on April 19, 2016 and amended on August 12, 2016) to designate 3,636,360 shares as Series B Preferred Stock and to provide for supermajority 66 2/3% voting rights for the Series B Preferred Stock. The Series B Preferred Stock will not bear dividends, will not be entitled to receive any distributions in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, and will have no other preferences, rights, restrictions, or qualifications, except as otherwise provided by law or the articles of incorporation of the Company. The holders of Class B Stock shall have the right, at such holder’s option, at any time to convert such shares into common stock, in a conversion ratio of one share of common stock for each share of Class B Stock. If the common stock trades or is quoted at a price per share in excess of $2.25 for any twenty consecutive day trading period, (subject to appropriate adjustment for forward or reverse stock splits, recapitalizations, stock dividends and the like), the Series B Stock will automatically be convertible into the common stock in a conversion ratio of one share of common stock for each share of Series B Stock. The Series B Stock may not be sold, hypothecated, transferred, assigned or disposed without the prior written consent of the Company and the holders of the outstanding Series B Preferred Stock.
Amendment of Articles of Incorporation
We filed an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada increasing our authorized shares of common stock, from 140,000,000 shares to 350,000,000 shares, effective March 22, 2017. We filed a second amendment to our Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada increasing our authorized shares of common stock, from 350,000,000 shares to 500,000,000 shares, effective October 28,
2019.
On February 13, 2020, stockholders holding shares that entitled them to exercise at least a majority of the voting power, voted in favor of increasing the number of authorized shares of common stock, from 500,000,000 shares to 1,000,000,000 shares. The vote marked the first step in the process to amend the articles again.
Craftsmen Industries, Inc.
As a consequence of the first public demonstration of the MG 30 kilovolt amp (“kVA”) system at the North America International Auto Show in Detroit in January 2017, the Company entered into an agreement in principle, dated February 21, 2017, with Craftsmen Industries, Inc.(“Craftsmen’), a company engaged in the design, engineering and production of mobile marketing vehicles, experiential marketing platforms and industrial mobile solutions.
On April 25, 2017, we delivered to Craftsmen Industries, a Class III Vehicle (Ford dually) up-fitted with a production-ready MG 30 kVA (single phase/three phase) system.
Subsequently, Craftsmen invited the Company to demonstrate its mobile generation technology and the potential benefits for Craftsmen products at Craftsmen’s 35th Anniversary Party on April 27, 2017. Over 100 current and prospective Craftsmen customers were in the audience for the demonstrations.
On June 9, 2017, the Company received a purchase order for 10 MG systems from Craftsmen, each in the amount of $29,500 with 50% paid as a down payment at the time of customer acceptance.
Furthermore, Craftsmen has agreed to produce the MG systems for the Company’s initial orders from Jatropha and Veracruz (See below). Since October 2018 we have been ordering components for the initial pilot production run which was completed in the first quarter of 2019 and showcased on March 27, 2019. In parallel, purchase orders will be placed for components to support increased production in the months that follow.
Veteran Technology Group
On May 26, 2017, the Company entered into a five-year strategic alliance agreement with Veteran Technology Group LLC (“Vet Tech”), a developer of artificial intelligence (“AI”) software for advanced troubleshooting of complex systems. The agreement automatically renews for successive one-year terms unless terminated by either party 30 days prior to its expiration. The agreement may be terminated earlier by either party upon 60 days prior notice. The parties agreed not to solicit the other parties’ employees or contractors for six months after the expiration or termination of the agreement.
The agreement provides that the Company market and provide its MG product and services to customers referred by Vet Tech and Vet Tech will market and provide GAIT software and other AI services for clients referred by the Company.
National Union of Jatropha Producers
In November 2017, the Company received a purchase commitment for 234 MG systems from the National Union of Producers of Jatropha in Mexico (Jatropha).
Jatropha has established a center for processing oil from Jatropha seeds for biofuel production. Through their union of producers, Jatropha plans to introduce the MG and promote the product to their supplier network.
The purchase commitment stipulates that CoolTech will furnish Jatropha with an MG80 retro-fitted onto a Ford truck within 60 business days. To ensure the system is optimized to meet Jatropha’s needs, CoolTech set the terms of the agreement to allow both teams to gather data and provide performance feedback another 30 to 60 days. Upon completion of this period, Jatropha will release the balance of the order for 233 units. Payment terms require 50% down and 50% at time of shipment, FOB (Freight on Board) from Cool Technologies’ dock.
On February 6, 2019, Jatropha signed an agreement to amend their previous purchase agreement. It eliminates the 60 business day deadline for the truck to be shipped to Mexico. Under the new agreement, representatives from Jatropha will come to Colorado for an inspection and live performance demonstration. If approved, the generator-equipped trucks will go into production as specified in the original purchase agreement.
A representative of the National Union of Jatropha Producers approved the generator-equipped truck. It will go into production as the Company secures final funding.
The value of the purchase commitment is expected to be between $17,000,000 and $22,000,000. On April 9, 2018, Jatropha executed a purchase order with the Company for 10 Fords with MG80 kVA systems installed. The value of the initial order is in excess of one million dollars.
National Union of Producers in Mexico for the state of Veracruz
In December 2017, the Company received a purchase commitment for 24 to 50 MG units from the National Union of Producers in Mexico for the state of Veracruz. Depending on the respective numbers of MG55 and MG80 kVA systems ordered, the Company expects the value of the commitment to range between $1,200,000 and $3,750,000.
The union represents farmers who grow labor and energy intensive crops such as sugar cane, tobacco, bananas, coffee, rice and vanilla. It expects that the MG systems will increase yields, exports and income for its members and their communities.
According to the contract, the Company will deliver an MG 80 retro-fitted onto a Ford truck within 60 business days. Then, to ensure the system fully addresses the application requirements, CoolTech, as a best practice of Six Sigma quality, will gather data and performance feedback. When CoolTech is satisfied that optimal performance has been achieved, the union will release the balance of the order and production begins.
On February 23, 2018, Veracruz signed an agreement to amend their previous purchase agreement. It eliminates the 60 business day deadline for the truck to be shipped to Mexico. Under the new agreement, representatives from Veracruz will come to Colorado for an inspection and live performance demonstration. If approved, the generator-equipped trucks will go into production as specified in the original purchase agreement.
A representative of the National Union of Jatropha Producers approved the generator-equipped truck. It will go into production as the Company secures final funding.
Payment terms require 50% down and 50% at time of shipment, each payable with a bank letter of credit. Product delivery will be considered FOB (Freight on Board) from Cool Technologies’ shipping dock.
The value of the purchase commitment is expected to commitment to range between $1.2M and $3.9M.
Panasonic System Communications Company of North America.
In January 2018, the Company announced that its Mobile Generation systems will incorporate Panasonic Toughpad tablets to run CoolTech’s software.
The association between the two companies dates back to April 2017 when Cool Technologies demonstrated its Mobile Generation (MG) system at Craftsman Industries in St. Louis. In attendance was the Executive Director of Product Planning Strategy and Innovation at the Silicon Valley Center of Panasonic Corporation of North America. He received a demonstration of the MG technology as well as an overview of CoolTech’s thermal dispersion technologies. That led to several conversations and meetings regarding the ways in which the two companies could pursue joint initiatives and opportunities.
The first initiative resulted in CoolTech’s use of the Panasonic Toughpad tablet to provide a rugged touchscreen interface for field technicians to control and calibrate the Mobile Generation systems. The Toughpad will be deployed in the trucks’ cabs.
Aon Risk Services Central, Inc and Lee and Hayes, PLLC
On January 18, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement with Aon Risk Services Central, Inc. and Lee and Hayes, PLLC, through its operating unit, 601West, which provides intellectual property (“IP”) analytics, to assess the value of the Company’s IP. As set forth in the agreement, the assessment will be founded on historically demonstrated or contractually committed profit-earning capacities of our IP and may be used to obtain financing, including but not limited to, non-dilutive financing. Since then significant progress has been achieved, although at a pace much slower than anticipated.
Live MG80 Demonstration in Fort Collins, Colorado
On May 4, 2018, nine representatives from Mexico’s farming, banking, and government sectors flew to Fort Collins, Colorado for a live demonstration of CoolTech’s generator-equipped truck. The demonstration showcased the capabilities and ease of operation of the system. The Company demonstrated how an operator is able to control the generator from the comfort and safety of the truck’s cab using a Panasonic Toughpad. The Company also used the electricity from the truck to power a screw compressor, an industrial fan, and an industrial load bank. Additional capabilities, such as purifying water and using batteries and solar power to make operations more sustainable and environmentally friendly were discussed with the attendees.
A representative of the National Union of Jatropha Producers approved the generator-equipped truck. CoolTech plans to put this into production as soon as final funding is secured.
Purchase and Delivery of Truck to Craftsman Industries
On July 15, 2018, the Company purchased a Ford Chassis Cab Truck. Subsequently, a metal flatbed was manufactured and installed. The truck was delivered to Craftsmen on September 15th. It will be used for the installation and refinement of the MG 80 kVA system. A second will be used for the MG 125 kVA system.
Order of Parts and Components
During the week of October 7, 2018, the Company placed orders for System Controllers, 80 and 125 kVA Generators, Voltage Regulators, Panasonic Toughpads, Power Take-Offs (PTO) and Split Shaft PTOs.
CALSTART, Inc.
CoolTech joined CALSTART, Inc. (“CALSTART”) a non-profit, clean transportation technology coalition in November 2018. The coalition works with member companies and agencies to foster a high-tech clean-transportation industry by accelerating the adoption of emerging technologies and helping build markets.
Since then, the Company has been in contact with 4 utilities, 3 telecoms, 2 truck upfitters and 3 hybrid truck manufacturers. Proposals have been made for 3 MG systems of differing power to be installed on California Air Resources Board (CARB) certified vehicles, an MG No-idle system and an MG truck with a hydrogen-infused fuel system.
On Thursday, January 17, 2019, a representative of the Company attended a meeting of the CALSTART Leadership Circle at Porsche Cars North American Headquarters, in Atlanta. Among the topics covered were the infrastructure pathway for electric vehicles and electric vehicle market growth. At the event, the Company met with representatives from Southern Company, Duke Energy and Altec, Inc.
Creation and Delivery of Business Proposals
The Company has been active in putting forth new business proposals in line with our strategy to target specific industry markets. We regularly review relevant press releases, major media articles and trade publications from various industries to keep up with trends and uncover opportunities. We also attend seminars and conferences to meet and network with prospective clients, however, COVID-19 has put a damper on such activities.
TARDEC
On February 26, 2019, a representative of the Company attended a Collaboration Day with the U.S. Army’s Tank Automotive Research Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) at Marine Corps Air Station, Miramar. TARDEC is the U.S. Army’s Research, Development and Engineering Center for all Ground Vehicles and Ground Vehicle Systems technology and integration, as well as Fuels and Lubricants, Water Supply and Wastewater Treatment, Tactical Military Bridging, Construction Equipment, Material Handling Equipment, and Army Watercraft. The Company participated in one-on-one sessions with members from the Ground Vehicle Power and Mobility team which pursues advanced technologies to increase fleet energy flexibility and efficiency with the goal of providing more power output without adding weight that degrades system performance.
On February 27, 2019, the Company participated in TARDEC’s Vehicle Electrification Forum which serves to advance electrification of Army combat and tactical systems by enabling industry to innovate products that meet Army needs and requirements. The Forum is a mechanism for industry to contribute to the formation of TARDEC’s Vehicle Electrification Strategy. A representative from the Company participated in a session covering electric recharging and issues related to future powertrain configurations including improved system efficiency; requirements for hybrid, electric, and fuel cell configurations; energy storage; vehicle-to-grid and vehicle-to-vehicle capabilities; and engine/transmission improvements.
Unveiling of Initial Production Run Vehicle
On March 27, 2019, the Company unveiled the initial production run of its Mobile Generation (MG) work trucks for inspection by an audience of agricultural and community leaders from Latin America at Craftsmen Industries.
The itinerary for the showcase event included a tour of the St. Louis manufacturing facility and inspection of the first production run MG vehicle in operation as it powered a variety of equipment.
The purpose of the viewing was not only to show the truck’s capabilities, but to get feedback from the attendees.
Mexican Government
On May 13, 2019, government officials and fruit growers were at Craftsmen Industries in St. Louis for a review of a first run MG80 production vehicle and water purification/desalination options.
Among the politicians in attendance was Congressman Efraín Rocha Vega who is Secretary of the Commission of Development and Rural, Agricultural and Food Self-sufficiency Conservation, a member of the commission of Livestock and the commission of Environment, Sustainability, Climate Change and Natural Resources. Subsequent to the event, in an official Congressional Letter of Support, dated May 20, 2019, Congressman Rocha wrote: “The successful demonstration of these technologies further strengthens the Mexican Government’s support of Mexican entities that desire to purchase CoolTech products, as well as affirms our position to provide financial assistance to such entities.” The letter can be viewed in its entirety at: http://www.cooltechnologiesinc.com/content/pdf/MexicanLegislationandFinancialAssistanceLetter.pdf.
Introduction of new options
During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company has introduced new options, which include an MG System that generates up to 200 kVA of electric power, water purification and desalination systems.
The truck mounted water purification and desalination units can produce from 2,800 to 14,000 gallons of fresh water every day. Assuming the average person needs 2 liters per day, 10,000 gallons is enough for 26,498 people.
A 30 kVA MG system could power any size unit as well as the pumps to deliver the water or five units at once which would conceivably be enough to keep the population of Santa Barbara hydrated. It could even tow a 1,250 gallon water tanker, if needed.
The purification and desalinization units feature fully automated controls and monitoring. When combined with the optional telematics offered in the vehicles, each unit could be remotely controlled and monitored from distant locations.
Belirti Teknoloji
On May 7, 2019, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement (“JV”) with Turkish technology company Belirti Teknoloji, A.S. (“BelirtiTech”). To launch the business, BelirtiTech awarded Cool Technologies a purchase order for up to $42 million USD for the purchase of several different models of its Mobile Generation kits. The purchase order will supply the JV with its initial inventory for resale into the Middle East and some African nations. The Company is actively working with the customer’s bank in addition to insurance companies and other financial entities to facilitate the financing of the orders. As of the date of this filing, the funds to fulfill the orders are not in place.
The initial purchase order is for six hundred MG80, MG125 and MG200 Mobile Generation systems. The MG systems will be integrated into the end customer’s choice of vehicles.
The order also includes an additional MG80 installed in a Ford with the 2,500 gallon per day mobile water desalinization option included.
KeyOptions
On May 30, 2019, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement (“JV”) with KeyOptions Pty Ltd., a privately held technology and security provider based in Victoria, Australia.
KeyOptions develops and markets products for governments, defense contractors and other commercial applications to counter security and cyber threats. The Company will provide a license for the JV to market and sell CoolTech’s entire product platform in Australia and neighboring countries in Southeast Asia.
New Strategic Alliance
On December 16, 2019, the Company signed a cross marketing and licensing agreement with VerdeWatts, LLC., an energy generation and storage company encompassing everything from mobile solar power generation systems to large scale biogas turbine installations. Pursuant to the agreement VerdeWatts and the Company each granted the other a royalty free non-exclusive license to certain patents which license is subject to certain future negotiation.
Like CoolTech’s Mobile Generation systems (“MG”), VerdeWatts’ products are scalable and offer the ability to bring power nearly anywhere it is needed. Their proprietary Smart Solar Power Generation Units and energy storage systems combine to deliver sustainable power long after the sun has set.
The agreement with VerdeWatts also included a cross marketing and royalty free non-exclusive licensing agreement with FirmGreen, Inc., a water treatment facilities developer that works closely with VerdeWatts to create a suite of synergistic products that address significant needs in the global marketplace. FirmGreen specializes in water purification and desalination technologies. Their mobile, solar and container applications feature 6 levels of water purification for unrivaled drinkability. Pursuant to the agreement FirmGreen and the Company each granted the other a royalty free non-exclusive license to certain patents which license is subject to certain future negotiation.
CoolTech’s MG platform makes the companies’ product offering complete with mobile power generation. It provides the capability to power everything from irrigation for farms and water purification for rural areas to electric vehicle charging and fast charging in the urban ones.
Consider the solar-powered generator system with a built-in water purification unit that makes seawater desalination sustainable. The system pumps and purifies up to 3,000 gallons per day and interfaces with CoolTech’s MG system for 24-hour operation. The solar panels collapse and fold together, so the entire system fits easily in the bed of a work truck. It can be set up and operate anywhere a four-wheel drive vehicle can reach. All of these systems are patent protected and cross licensed to each of the three companies.
FirmGreen and VerdeWatts have a global presence with projects on 3 continents. The largest encompasses the installation of 14 natural gas generators to produce over 60 megawatts (MW) of power. The generators will be integrated with 50 megawatt hours of battery storage and another 6 MW of solar to ensure a consistent flow of power. VerdeWatts intend to replace most of the legacy on-site generators with CoolTech’s MG systems, however the Company has not received any orders and there cannot be any assurance that any orders will be placed.
Together the companies can create an energy or utility ecosystem that can enable less developed countries to leapfrog non-existent, inadequate or failing infrastructure to deliver reliable power and water quickly, sustainably and cost effectively to their citizens, agriculture and other businesses. The scale and impact can reach from the individual farms and villages to cities and regions.
In fact, by combining their respective technologies: energy generation, energy storage and load management controls into a single suite of products, the companies create what is called a “microgrid”. Varying combinations of energy sources such as solar, wind, biogas and MG systems both backup and supplement one another to provide consistent, uninterrupted primary power even during severe weather or other emergency situations.
The synergies between the companies extend beyond water purification and power generation. VerdeWatts’ wind and gas turbines and generators which produce electric power can all be improved by CoolTech’s thermal reduction technologies.
Request for Collaboration Sent to US Government Officials
On December 11, 2019, letters signed by 13 government officials and Congressmen in Mexico were mailed to their counterparts in the US, specifically Governor Gavin Newsom, Secretary Rick Perry, Secretary Wilbur Ross, Senator Mitch McConnell and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.
The letters were a request for collaborative support between the two countries to accelerate CoolTech’s product deployment into Mexico to help solve urgent rural power and water purification problems that are hurting rural communities. Those problems include irregular and faulty power in rural areas which hinders crop irrigation and water pollution which affects crops farmed for sale to the US.
The letters also detail the Mexican officials’ satisfaction with CoolTech’s solutions and management team and that they have met with the Company on several occasions for product demonstrations as well as strategic and technical advice. They highlight the benefits of CoolTech products, how they could quickly and efficiently address the problems noted, and how they expect them to become a viable part of the country’s infrastructure.
Export Import Bank of the United States
With the help of VerdeWatts and FirmGreen, CoolTech has initiated a relationship with the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM), a U.S. government agency whose sole mission is to support U.S. exports. The bank fulfills its mission by offering very cost-effective financing for international customers and project developers to purchase U.S.-made services and purchase or lease U.S.-made goods.
To that end, the two companies applied to finance the Mexican projects referenced above. CoolTech also sent product information for due diligence review by the technical team at EXIM bank. Subsequently, CoolTech has received a Letter of Interest from EXIM, however, there cannot be any assurance that EXIM will provide any funding to the Company.
Increase in Number of Authorized Shares
On August 10, 2020, the Nevada Secretary of State accepted and filed the Company’s Certificate of Amendment to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation. The filing amends Article II of the Articles of Incorporation by increasing the number of authorized shares of common stock from 500,000,000 to 1,000,000,000.
New Sales Agent
In January 2021, the Company terminated its independent agent agreement with Gaia Energy of Gdansk, Poland.
On January 26, 2021, the Company signed an independent agent agreement with H&K Ventures, LLC of Morganhill, California. H&K will act as the Company’s independent agent.
The principals of H&K were also part of Gaia Energy. Consequently, the agreement and the expertise provide by H&K are essentially the same. H&K will concentrate on developing markets in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The agreement describes the agent’s duties as “generating revenue, and investment funding, for the Company from various organizations including investment funds, end-users, channel partners, integrators, and OEMs.”
Team members of H&K Ventures include executives with more than twenty-five years’ experience with Panasonic, Ford Motor Company, Electronic Data Systems and the US Air Force in the fields of advanced technologies and an African diplomat with a thirty-year background working with and for diplomatic missions, non-governmental organizations and international disasters and aid management services.
The diplomat introduced CoolTech products at a recent African technical summit attended by representatives from 54 countries.
Going Concern
As a result of our financial condition, we have received a report from our independent registered public accounting firm for our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 that includes an explanatory paragraph describing the uncertainty as to our ability to continue as a going concern. As of December 31, 2020, we have not commenced full operations, raising substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to generate revenue, achieve profitable operations and repay our obligations when they come due. As of December 31, 2020, we have $33 in cash and we owe $319,000 and $2,639,500 for convertible and promissory notes, respectively. We are pursuing various financing alternatives to address the payment of outstanding debt and to support the sales, component acquisition and assembly of our mobile power generation systems as well as the completion of the secondary elements of our business plan: to license its thermal technologies and applications, including submersible dry-pit applications. There can be no assurance, however, that we will obtain adequate funding or that we will be successful in accomplishing any of our objectives. Consequently, we may not be able to continue as an operating company.
Results of Operations
The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, consolidated statements of operations data. The table and the discussion below should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this report.
Revenues
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, and since inception, we have not generated any revenues. We generated our first Mobile Generation order during the quarter ended June 30, 2014 and received a partial deposit in advance of completing the sale with companies controlled by the individual who is a 5% owner of UPT and a shareholder of our Company. The order is in the production queue along with other existing orders.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses decreased during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, due to reductions in payroll and related expenses, consulting costs, professional fees, research and development as well as general and administrative.
The decrease in professional fees was due primarily to the reduced requirements for accounting and legal. The decrease in research and development was due to the focus on commercialization of the Company’s MG system. The decrease in general and administrative costs was due to limited funds.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, payroll and related expenses decreased by $299,294 due to the elimination of Mark Hodowanec’s salary after he resigned in July 2019 and due to the fact that the remaining officers received no salary during the first quarter and only one month’s salary in the second quarter.
Consulting expenses decreased from $331,107 in 2019 to $316,068 in 2020. This was due primarily to the reduced workload and payments for related-party consultants and general consultants as well as a reflection of the Company’s need to conserve cash
Professional fees decreased from $226,859 in 2019 to $224,453 in 2020. The decrease was negligible, as before professional fees consisted primarily of fees to retain legal representation to defend the Company against the eviction complaint.
Research and development expenses decreased from $296,800 in 2019 to $19,069 in 2020 due to the completion of the design of the MG system and the Company’s focus on its commercialization.
General and administrative expenses decreased from $242,994 in 2019 to $68,309 in 2020 due to limited funds.
Other Income and Expense
Interest expenses during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 related primarily to our debt. The change in fair value of derivative liability reflects the change in fair value of the conversion features embedded in the convertible debt agreements entered into in September 2020, October 2020, and November 2020, and also includes the change in fair value of common share equivalents that were previously reclassified to derivative liability as a result of insufficient authorized but unissued shares.
Interest expense decreased during the year ended December 31 from $2,027,030 in 2019 to $1,472,104 in 2020 due to a number of vendors adding previously unrecognized interest to their bills. Interest expense decreased in 2020 primarily due to our debt.
Net Loss and Noncontrolling Interest
Since we have incurred losses since inception, we have not recorded any income tax expense or benefit. Accordingly, our net loss is driven by our operating and other expenses. Noncontrolling interest represents the 5% third-party ownership in UPT, which is subtracted to calculate net loss to shareholders.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We have historically met our liquidity requirements primarily through the public sale and private placement of equity securities, debt financing, and exchanging common stock warrants and options for professional and consulting services. On December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $33.
Working capital is the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities. We had negative working capital of $7,042,484 and $6,821,643 on December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in negative working capital was due to decreases in accounts payable, current debt and derivative liability. To that end, we owe approximately $319,000 for convertible notes that mature in the next eleven months and we owe another $2,639,500 in notes payable. Based on its current forecast and budget, management believes that its cash resources will not be sufficient to fund its operations through the end of the second quarter. Unless the Company can generate sufficient revenue from the execution of the Company’s business plan, it will need to obtain additional capital to continue to fund the Company’s operations. There is no assurance that capital in any form would be available to us, and if available, on terms and conditions that are acceptable. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds, we may be forced to curtail and/or cease operations.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
We currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
Cash Flows
Our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities were as follows:
Net cash from operating activities decreased due to reductions in net loss. Our investing activity decreased due to an elimination in the purchases of equipment which overwhelmed an increase in expenditure for intangible assets, which relates to the development of patents. Net cash provided by financing activities decreased primarily due to a reduction in proceeds of debt or debt borrowings.
The Company’s capital requirements for the next 12 months will consist of $3.4 million with anticipated expenses of $1.4 million for salaries, public company filings, and consultants and professional fees. An additional $2.0 million in working capital is expected to be needed for inventory and related costs for production of our mobile power generation systems as well as development and commercialization of our thermal dispersion technology applications.
Management believes the Company’s funds are insufficient to provide for its projected needs for operations for the next 12 months. The Company is currently negotiating additional non-dilutive funding to support product development or for other purposes. In the event that the negotiations fail, the Company may have to rely on equity or debt financing that may involve substantial dilution to our then existing stockholders. If it is unable to close additional equity financing, the Company may have to cease operations.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the amounts of revenues and expenses. Critical accounting policies are those that require the application of management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. In applying these critical accounting policies, our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in making certain estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
We define critical accounting policies as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and which may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. In applying these critical accounting policies, our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in making certain estimates. These estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty.
Impairment of long-lived assets
When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable, management assesses the recoverability of the carrying value by preparing estimates of revenues and the resulting gross profit and cash flows. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment loss. The impairment loss recognized, if any, is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset (or asset group) exceeds the fair value. We may use a variety of methods to determine the fair value of these assets, including discounted cash flow models, which are consistent with the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use.
If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, or our assumptions and estimates change due to new information, we may be exposed to an impairment charge in the future.
Derivative financial instruments
When we issue debt that contains a conversion feature, we first evaluate whether the conversion feature meets the requirements to be treated as a derivative: a) one or more underlying, typically the price of the Company’s stock; b) one or more notional amounts or payment provisions or both, generally the number of shares upon conversion; c) no initial net investment, which typically excludes the amount borrowed; and d) net settlement provisions, which in the case of convertible debt generally means the stock received upon conversion can be readily sold for cash. There are certain scope exceptions from derivative treatment, but these typically exclude conversion features that provide for a variable number of shares.
When we issue warrants to purchase our common stock, we must evaluate whether they meet the requirements to be treated as a derivative. Generally, warrants would be treated as a derivative if the provisions of the warrant agreement create uncertainty as to a) the number of shares to be issued upon exercise; or b) whether shares may be issued upon exercise.
If the conversion feature within convertible debt or warrants meets the requirements to be treated as a derivative, we estimate the fair value of the derivative liability using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model upon the date of issuance. If the fair value of the derivative liability is higher than the face value of the convertible debt, the excess is immediately recognized as interest expense. Otherwise, the fair value of the derivative liability is recorded as a liability with an offsetting amount recorded as a debt discount, which offsets the carrying amount of the debt. The derivative liability is revalued at the end of each reporting period and any change in fair value is recorded as a change in fair value in the consolidated statement of operations. The debt discount is amortized through interest expense over the life of the debt. Derivative instrument liabilities and the host debt agreement are classified on the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within twelve months of the balance sheet date.
The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires that the Company record the embedded conversion option and warrants at their fair values as of the inception date of the agreement and at fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date. Any change in fair value is recorded as non-operating, non-cash income or expense for each reporting period at each balance sheet date. The Company reassesses the classification of its derivative instruments at each balance sheet date. If the classification changes as a result of events during the period, the contract is reclassified as of the date of the event that caused the reclassification. As a result of entering into warrant agreements, for which such instruments contained a variable conversion feature with no floor, the Company has adopted a sequencing policy in accordance with ASC 815-40-35-12 whereby all future instruments may be classified as a derivative liability with the exception of instruments related to share-based compensation issued to employees or directors.
Contingent liabilities
We accrue a loss for contingencies if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred, and when the amount of loss can be reasonably estimable. When no accrual is made because one or both conditions do not exist, we disclose the contingency if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred. We estimate contingent liabilities based on the best information we have available at the time. If we have a range of possible outcomes, we accrue the low end of the range.
Share-based Payments
All our share-based awards are classified as equity, as they may only be settled in shares of our common stock.
We recognize expense for fully-vested warrants at the time they are granted. For awards with service or performance conditions, we generally recognize expense when the service is complete; however, there may be circumstances in which we determine that the performance condition is probable before the actual performance condition is achieved. In such circumstances, the amount recognized as expense is the pro rata amount, depending on the estimated progress towards completion of the performance condition. Nonemployee share-based payments are measured at fair value, based on either the fair value of the equity instrument issued or on the fair value of the services received. Typically, it is not practical to value the services received, so we determine the fair value of common stock grants based on the price of the common stock on the measurement date, and the fair value of common stock warrants using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model (“Black-Scholes”). We use historical data to estimate the expected price volatility, the expected stock option life and expected forfeiture rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the United States Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the stock option. For awards that are recognized when a performance condition is probable, the fair value is estimated at each reporting date. The cost ultimately recognized is the fair value of the equity award on the date the performance condition is achieved. Accordingly, the expense recognized may change between interim reporting dates and the date the performance condition is achieved.
We issue two types of common stock options to employees: 1) fully-vested at the time of grant and 2) market price-based vesting. We recognize expense for fully-vested stock options on the date of grant at the estimated fair value of the options using Black-Scholes. We recognize expense for market price-based options at the estimated fair value of the options using the lattice-based option valuation model (“Lattice Model”) over the estimated life of the options used in the Lattice Model. We use historical data to estimate the expected price volatility, the expected stock option life and expected forfeiture rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the United States Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the stock option. In the event, we modify the terms of a non-vested share-based payment award, we would incur additional expense for the excess of the fair value of the modified share-based payment award over the fair value of the original share-based payment award. The incremental expense would be recognized ratably over the remaining vesting period.
Income taxes
We recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the income tax and financial reporting carrying amount of our assets and liabilities. We monitor our deferred tax assets and evaluate the need for a valuation allowance based on the estimate of the amount of such deferred tax assets that we believe do not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition criteria. We also evaluate whether we have any uncertain tax positions and would record a reserve if we believe it is more-likely-than-not our position would not prevail with the applicable tax authorities. We have significant net operating loss carryforwards, for which we have established a valuation allowance. If our estimate of the amount of such deferred tax assets change, we may recognize a benefit in the future. UPT is a limited liability company (“LLC”), which is treated as a partnership for income tax purposes, where all tax obligations flow through to the owners of the LLC during the period in which income taxes were incurred.
