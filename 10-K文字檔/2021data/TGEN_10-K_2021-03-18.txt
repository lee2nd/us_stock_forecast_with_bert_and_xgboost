TECOGEN INC.
Overview
Tecogen designs, manufactures and sells industrial and commercial cogeneration systems that produce combinations of electricity, hot water, and air conditioning using automotive engines that have been specially adapted to run on natural gas. Cogeneration systems are efficient because in addition to supplying mechanical energy to power electric generators or compressors - displacing utility supplied electricity - they provide an opportunity for the facility to incorporate the engine’s waste heat into onsite processes such as space and potable water heating. We produce standardized, modular, small-scale products, with a limited number of product configurations that are adaptable to multiple applications. We refer to these combined heat and power products as CHP (electricity plus heat) and MCHP (mechanical power plus heat).
Our products are sold directly to end-users by our in-house marketing team and by established sales agents and representatives. We have agreements in place with distributors and sales representatives. Our existing customers include hospitals and nursing homes, colleges and universities, health clubs and spas, hotels and motels, office and retail buildings, food and beverage processors, multi-unit residential buildings, laundries, ice rinks, swimming pools, factories, municipal buildings, military installations and indoor growing facilities. To date we have shipped over 3,000 units, some of which have been operating for almost 35 years.
As a result of our acquisition of American DG Energy ("ADGE") in May 2017, we added an additional source of revenue. Through ADGE, we install, own, operate and maintain complete distributed generation electricity systems, or DG systems or energy systems, and other complementary systems at customer sites, and sell electricity, hot water, heat and cooling energy under long-term contracts at prices guaranteed to the customer to be below conventional utility rates. Each month we obtain readings from our energy meters to determine the amount of energy produced for each customer. We use a contractually defined formula to multiply these readings by the appropriate published price of energy (electricity, natural gas or oil) from each customer's local energy utility, to derive the value of our monthly energy sale, which includes a negotiated discount. Our revenues per customer on a monthly basis vary based on the amount of energy produced by our energy systems and the published price of energy (electricity, natural gas or oil) from our customers' local energy utility that month.
Although we may, from time to time, have one or a few customers who may represent more than 10% of our product revenue for a given year, we are not dependent on the recurrence of revenue from those customers. Our product revenue is such that customers may make a large purchase once and may not ever make a purchase again. Our equipment is built to last 30 or more years. Therefore, our product revenue model is not dependent on recurring sales transactions from the same customer. Our service revenue does lend itself to recurring revenue from particular customers, although we currently do not have any service revenue customers who make up more than 10% of our total revenues on an annual basis.
For the last two fiscal years, more than half of our revenue was generated from long-term maintenance and energy production contracts, which provides us with a predictable revenue stream, especially during the summer months. We have a slight surge of activity from May through September as our “chiller season” is in full swing. Our service revenue which had grown from year to year since 2005, with our New York City/New Jersey and New England systems experiencing the majority of the growth, was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, especially with the decreased installation service related revenue we achieved in the the year ended December 31, 2020. Our service margins are generally predictable as we service hundreds of long-term contracts with relatively low dollar, high volume sales.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, our revenues were negatively impacted due to customer order delays or deferrals; service delays due to customer facility closures, in some cases for extended periods; and a reduction in our energy production distribution due to business closures and increased remote work and learning environments. The extent to which the coronavirus will continue to impact our business and our financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.
Our product revenue is derived from the sale of the various cogeneration modules, such as the InVerde, InVerde e+, the CM-75, the CM-60, Ilios heat pumps, and the three TECOCHILL chiller models, such as the smaller ST, the larger DT and the RT (roof-top) units. In 2019, we also reintroduced our TecoFrost line to the mix. The sales cycle for each module varies widely and can range from as short as a month to as long as a year or more. Furthermore, since our products and their installation are costly, they are considered a major capital improvement and customers may be slow in making their buying decisions. Our product sales are high dollar value, low volume transactions. Therefore, our product revenue can be difficult to predict and the expected margin can vary.
Our cogeneration, heat pump, and chiller modules are built to order and revenue is recognized upon shipment. The lead time to build and deliver a unit depends on its customized configuration and is approximately 12 to 14 weeks for a chiller and 6 to 8 weeks for a cogeneration or heat pump from time of purchase order. As revenue is recognized upon shipment, our work-in-process is an important factor in understanding our financial condition in any given quarter.
Our operations are comprised of two business segments, as follows:
TECOGEN INC.
•Products and Services segment - designs, manufactures and sells industrial and commercial cogeneration systems
•Energy Production segment - sells energy in the form of electricity, heat, hot water, and cooling to our customers under long-term sales agreements
Recent Developments
On April 17, 2020, we obtained an unsecured loan in the amount of $1,874,200 under the first Paycheck Protection Program (“First Draw PPP Loan”) pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, as amended (“CARES Act”), through Webster Bank, N.A. (“Webster Bank”). The loan was guaranteed by the United States Small Business Administration (“SBA”) and, subject to certain limitations, to the extent that the loan is used for payroll, rent, or utilities during the applicable covered period following the disbursement of the loan, the loan may be forgiven by the SBA. In January 2021, we were notified by Webster Bank that all of the original principal amount of $1,874,200 together with all accrued interest thereon was forgiven in full as of January 11, 2021.
On February 5, 2021, we obtained a Second Draw Paycheck Protection Program unsecured loan through Webster Bank in the amount of $1,874,269 under the CARES Act that is also guaranteed by the SBA. We intend to use the loan proceeds for payroll, rent, utilities and other operating expenses, and expect to apply for forgiveness of the loan balance as permitted under the CARES Act. See Note 10. "Note Payable and Revolving Line of Credit, Bank.”
On May 4, 2018, we entered into a Credit Agreement with Webster Business Credit Corporation ("Webster") that provided us with a line of credit of up to $10 million on a revolving and secured basis, with availability based on our accounts receivable, raw materials, and finished goods, during the period until May 4, 2021. The line of credit was used to repay the amounts due to Mr. John Hatsopoulos under a promissory note assumed by us in connection with our merger with American DG Energy Inc. and for working capital purposes. On May 11, 2020, we agreed with Webster to terminate our Credit Agreement, together with related agreements, including a Revolving Note, Security Agreement, Blocked Account Agreement, and Master Letter of Credit Agreement. We paid an early termination fee in the amount of $25,000 in connection with the termination of the Credit Agreement and continue to use depository and cash management services provided by Webster Bank. The $145,011 of costs incurred in connection with the issuance of the revolving credit facility were capitalized and were being amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis over three years based on the contractual term of the agreement. Upon termination of the Credit Agreement, the unamortized balance of debt issuance cost of $37,861 was expensed during the year ended December 31, 2020.
On March 5, 2019, we transferred ownership of certain of our energy systems assets and related energy production contracts in a sale transaction in consideration for approximately $5 million. In connection with the sale, we entered into two separate agreements to provide operational and maintenance services for the purchaser. Concurrently, we amended the terms of an agreement related to certain energy systems related assets and related energy production contracts, the ownership of which were transferred to the same purchaser in December 2018 in consideration of approximately $2 million, in order to conform and finalize the terms of the agreement to the March 2019 agreement. See Note 5. "Sale of Energy Producing Assets and Goodwill Impairment" in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These judgments, assumptions and estimates are made or applied within the context of accounting policies related to the nature of the transaction. Note 2. "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
Certain aspects of certain accounting policies require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. These aspects of these accounting policies are considered critical accounting policies. These policies may require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate or employ an estimate where alternative estimates could have also been employed, and may involve estimates that are reasonably likely to change with the passage of time. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates may change as new events occur, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. These changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known. In
TECOGEN INC.
addition, management is periodically faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time. These uncertainties are discussed in "Item 1A," “Risk Factors" above.
Management believes that the following are critical accounting policies:
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with our customer are satisfied. This generally occurs with the transfer of control of our products, services and energy production. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services or energy to customers.
Determination of contract consideration allocable to multiple performance obligations within a single contract requires employing stand-alone selling prices which may be based on observable selling prices, estimated selling prices or as a residual. We use an observable selling price to determine standalone selling prices where available and either a combination of an adjusted market assessment approach, an expected cost plus a margin approach, and/or a residual approach to determine the standalone selling prices for separate performance obligations as a basis for allocating contract consideration when an observable selling price is not available.
Under complete turnkey installation service contracts our performance obligation under such contracts is satisfied progressively over time as enhancements are made to customer owned and controlled properties. We measure progress towards satisfaction of the performance obligation based on an input method based on cost and revenue is recognized over time using the percentage-of-completion method determined on a cost to cost basis. This method requires management to estimate future cost to complete based on conditions and information available at the time the estimate is made. Events or changes in circumstances can cause these estimates to be revised which may result in significant adjustments to revenue amounts previously recognized.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances. An allowance for doubtful accounts is provided for those accounts receivable considered to be uncollectible based upon historical experience and management’s evaluation of outstanding accounts receivable at the end of the year.
Inventory
Raw materials, work in process, and finished goods inventories are stated at the lower of cost, as determined by the average cost method, or net realizable value. We periodically review inventory quantities on hand for excess and/or obsolete inventory based primarily on historical usage, as well as based on estimated forecast of product demand. Any reserves that result from this review are charged to cost of sales.
ADGE's Property and Equipment and Depreciation
Upon acquisition, property and equipment employed in energy production are recorded at fair value using a cost approach whereby replacement cost new ("RCN") is utilized as the starting point, with factors for inflation, physical obsolescence, functional obsolescence and economic obsolescence being considered and applied as required to arrive at an estimated fair value.
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method at rates sufficient to write off the cost of the applicable assets over their estimated useful lives. Repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.
We review our energy systems for potential impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of the assets are no longer appropriate. We evaluate the recoverability of its long-lived assets when impairment is indicated by comparing the net book value of the asset group to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets. The useful life of the Company's energy systems is the lesser of the economic life of the asset or the term of the underlying contract with the customer, typically 12 to 15 years. If impairment is indicated, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value.
Contract Assets and Liabilities
The favorable contract asset and unfavorable contract liability included in the intangible assets and liabilities of the consolidated balance sheets represent the fair value of customer energy production contracts (both positive for favorable contracts and negative for unfavorable contracts) which were acquired by us.
The determination of fair value required development of an estimate of the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset or to transfer the liability would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. Contracts are considered to be assets or liabilities by virtue of the rights and obligations inherent in the contract terms. Typically, contracts with terms considered to be at market are considered to have no fair value as, in order to be entitled to the rights under the contract, performance must occur for which a market rate of return is earned due to the at market terms.
TECOGEN INC.
The fair value of a contract is primarily a measurement of its off-market terms. The obligation to perform under a contract with terms that are unfavorable to market results in a liability to the extent its terms are off market. The resulting liability is an estimate of the price that would need to be paid to a willing market participant to assume the obligations under the contract in order for them to receive a market rate of return for their remaining performance obligation under the contract. The exact opposite holds true in instances where the terms of a contract are considered to be favorable to market. In that case an asset would exist as an estimate of the price that would be received from a willing market participant in order to be entitled to the rights under the contract.
In determining the estimate of fair value of customer energy production contracts, the measure of market, and thus the baseline to measure the amount related to any of the off market terms or conditions with respect to the contracts, was considered best determined, given the nature of the services provided under the contracts, by utilizing a benchmark level of margin, in this case 35% of revenue which is consistent with the average return on revenue of US investor owned public utilities.
Goodwill
Goodwill is not amortized, however, it is reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and/or when circumstances or other events indicate that impairment may have occurred. ASC 350 “Intangibles-Goodwill and Other” (ASC 350) permits entities to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two-step goodwill impairment test. Circumstances that are considered as part of the qualitative assessment and could trigger the two-step impairment test include, but are not limited to: a significant adverse change in the business climate; a significant adverse legal judgment; adverse cash flow trends; an adverse action or assessment by a government agency; unanticipated competition; decline in our stock price; and a significant restructuring charge within a reporting unit. We define reporting units at the business segment level. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to our reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit.
During 2018, we early-adopted the provisions of ASU 2017-04 which simplified goodwill impairment testing by eliminating the requirement to determine the implied value of goodwill where a quantitative analysis indicates that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value.
It is our practice, at a minimum, to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of the year following an acquisition involving a significant amount of goodwill. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test for our energy production reporting unit acquired in 2017. We used a discounted cash flow approach to develop the estimated fair value of that reporting unit. Management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model. An impairment would be recorded if the carrying amount of a reporting unit including goodwill exceeded the estimated fair value. Based on the aforementioned analysis, the carrying amount of that reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeded the estimated fair value and an impairment charge of $2,875,711 was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020. See Note 5. "Sale of Energy Producing Assets and Goodwill Impairment".
The impairment recognizes the shortening of remaining contract terms with customers without replacement and without further growth, as well as less than expected cost savings and, offset by profitability from our initiatives to optimize the long-term profitability of its various site operations, and a price peak of the Company's stock on the date of the business combination to which the goodwill relates (see also Note 5."Sale of Energy Producing Assets and Goodwill Impairment").
The discount rate, profitability assumptions, and terminal growth rate of this reporting unit were the material assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow model used to estimate its fair value. The discount rate reflects an estimate of our weighted-average cost of capital.
The discounted cash flow analysis requires estimates, assumptions and judgments about future events. Our analysis uses our internally generated long-range plan. The long-range plan reflects management's judgment and assumptions about future events.
We believe the assumptions used in our goodwill impairment analysis are appropriate and result in a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit. However, given the economic environment and the uncertainties regarding the impact on our business, there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions, made for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing, will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. If our assumptions regarding future performance are not achieved, we may be required to record additional goodwill impairment charges in future periods.

Results of Operations
The following table sets forth for the periods indicated, the percentages of the net sales represented by certain items reflected in our statements of operations.
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019
Revenues
The following table presents revenue by segment and the change from the prior year for the years ended December 31:
Revenues in 2020 were $28,254,579 compared to $33,426,448 in 2019, a decrease of $5,171,869 or 15.5%. This decrease is the result of the decrease in energy production revenue due to the sale of several sites in Q4 2018 and Q1 2019 and decreases in Product and Service revenues. Product revenues in 2020 were $10,534,096 compared to $12,977,896 in 2019, a decrease of $2,443,800 or 18.8%. This decrease from the year ended December 31, 2019 to 2020 is due primarily to a decrease in chiller sales of $4,604,071, due to decreased unit volume, which is partially offset by an increase in cogeneration sales of $2,160,271, due to increased unit volume. Our product mix, as well as product revenue, can vary significantly from period to period as our products are high dollar, low volume sales in which revenue is recognized upon shipment and to some degree were impacted by COVID-19 as energy and other constructions projects were delayed.
Revenues derived from our service centers, including installation activities, in 2020 were $15,883,302 compared to $17,307,718 for the same period in 2019, a decrease of $1,424,416 or 8.2%. Our service operation grows with the sales of installed systems, since the majority of our product sales are accompanied by a service contract or time and materials
TECOGEN INC.
agreements. As a result our “fleet” of units being serviced by our service department grows with product sales. Certain installation projects, particularly those in New York City, were stopped due to COVID-19 in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 accounting for the decrease in installation revenues.
Energy Production revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $1,837,181 compared to $3,140,834 for 2019, a decrease of $1,303,653, or 41.5%. This reduction in Energy Production revenue is primarily due to the sale of several sites at the the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 as discussed in "Note 5. "Sale of Energy Producing Assets and Goodwill Impairment" and the impact of COVID-19 on several hotel, athletic and education customers, resulting in the temporary closure of these properties and a change to remote work and learning environments, resulting in decreased energy production revenues.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales in 2020 was $17,427,065 compared to $20,947,696 in 2019, a decrease of $3,520,631 or 16.8%. Our overall gross margin was 38.3% in 2020 compared to 37.3% in 2019, an increase of 1.0%. The decrease in cost of sales is due to the reduction of Products and Energy Production revenues and their related cost of sales, while the increase in gross margin percentage is due to an overall change in our revenue mix to increased higher margin service contract revenue.
Cost of sales for Energy Production for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1,169,645 compared to $1,753,980 in 2019, decreased due to the reduction in sites we serviced in 2020 compared to 2019. Included in Energy Production cost of sales is depreciation expense associated with the energy producing sites, net of amortization of favorable and unfavorable contract liability of $414,126.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses decreased in 2020 to $16,787,827 compared to $17,137,333 in 2019, a decrease of $349,506 or 2.0%. This decrease was mainly due to the reduction of general and administrative costs of $69,057 and the reduction of the goodwill impairment charge of $817,487 when comparing the year ended December 31, 2020 to 2019. See Note 9. "Goodwill" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the impairment charges. General and administrative expenses decreased due to management's effort to control overhead costs, resulting in decreased payroll and related costs, decreased travel and travel related expenses due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, decreased professional fees and lower bank fees, partially offset by an increase in bad debt expense of $608,397. In addition, selling expenses decreased in 2020 to $2,593,168 compared to $2,685,200 in 2019, a decrease of $92,032 or 3.4%, due to reduced travel related expenses. Research and development expenses decreased in 2020 to $767,323 compared to $1,460,096 in 2019, a decrease of $692,773 or 47.4%, as certain R&D projects were curtailed or stopped entirely as a consequence of COVID-19. There has not been a change in our focus with regards to research and development activities.
Gains on the sale of assets of $11,367 were recognized in 2020 in connection with the sale of certain assets, which compares to a gain on the sale of assets of $1,081,304 recognized in 2019 due to the sales of certain energy producing assets. See discussion in Note 5."Sale of Energy Producing Assets and Goodwill Impairment".
Goodwill impairment relating to American DG Energy of $2,875,711 and $3,693,198 were recognized in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Further, asset impairment of $251,906 was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2020, consisting of the impairment of American DG Energy long-lived assets of $524,972, partially offset by the reversal of $478,411 of unfavorable contract liability, and the derecognition of $205,345 of patent application legal costs, which were abandoned.
Loss from Operations
Loss from operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $5,960,313 compared to loss of $4,658,581 in 2019, an increase in the loss from operations of $1,301,732. The increase in the net loss from operations is primarily due to the decrease in revenues and gross margin experienced in the year ended December 31, 2020 and the $1,069,937 decrease in the gain on sales of assets recognized in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, partially offset by the decrease in operating expenses, due to the cost control instituted by management and a decrease in the goodwill impairment of $2,875,711 recognized in 2020 as compared to the impairment charge of $3,693,198 for the year ended December 31, 2019, as discussed in Note 9."Goodwill" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Other Expense, net
Other expense, net, for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $226,707 compared to $120,598 for the same period in 2019. Other income (expense) includes interest and other income of $2,479, net of interest expense on debt of $125,824 in 2020. For the same period in 2019, interest and other income was $933 and interest expense was $101,851. For the year ended December 31, 2020, other expense, net also includes the unrealized loss on securities of $98,404 compared to $19,680 for the same period in 2019, which represents the market value fluctuation of marketable equity securities as discussed in Note 15. "Fair value measurements".
TECOGEN INC.
Noncontrolling Interest
With the addition of American DG Energy, we have income and losses attributable to the noncontrolling interest we have in American DG Energy's 51% owned subsidiary, ADGNY, LLC. The noncontrolling interest share of ADGNY profits and losses was a $66,684 loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $85,354 in 2019. The noncontrolling interest recognized losses in the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, due to the goodwill impairment recognized in both years.
Net Loss Attributable to Tecogen Inc
Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $6,150,507 compared to a net loss of $4,709,019 for the comparable period in 2019. The increase in the net loss attributable to Tecogen, Inc. is primarily due the decrease in revenues and gross margin experienced in the year ended December 31, 2020 and a $1,069,937 decrease in gain on sales of assets recognized in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, partially offset by the decrease in operating expenses, due to the cost control instituted by management and a decrease in the goodwill impairment of $2,875,711 recognized in 2020 as compared to the impairment charge of $3,693,198 for the year ended December 31, 2019, as we discussed in Note 9. "Goodwill" of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Net Loss Per Share
Net loss per share for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $0.25 compared to a $0.19 loss per share for the same period in 2019. The increase in loss per share of $0.06 for the year ended December 31, 2020 was due to the decrease in revenues and gross margin experienced in 2020 and the decrease in the gain on sales of assets recognized in the year ended December 31, 2019, partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses and the decrease in the goodwill impairment, as discussed above. The basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 24,850,258 compared to 24,839,957 for the same period in 2019.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The following table presents a summary of our net cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities:
Consolidated working capital at December 31, 2020 was $13,379,263, compared to $14,463,579 at December 31, 2019, a decrease of $1,084,316 or 7.5%. Included in working capital were cash and cash equivalents of $1,490,219 at December 31, 2020, compared to $877,676 at December 31, 2019, an increase of $612,543 or 69.8%. The decrease in consolidated working capital is due to decreased revenue which resulted in decreased accounts receivable and unbilled receivables of $6,852,797, as well as increased inventories, offset by decreases in our accounts payable, accrued expenses and deferred revenue.
Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $1,407,237 and ($4,484,242), respectively, an increase of $5,891,479 in net cash provided by operating activities. Our accounts receivable balance decreased by $5,555,235 at December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019, due to decreased revenue and the timing of billing, shipments, and collections. Unbilled revenues also decreased by $1,154,562 in connection with turnkey projects as some revenues are recognized prior to contractual milestones for invoicing. Our inventory increased by $849,367 as of December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 and other non-current assets decreased by $825,817 as of December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019.
Accounts payable decreased by $1,088,651 from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. The decrease in accounts payable is related to timing and reduced volume of manufacturing and inventory purchase activities. Accrued expenses from operations decreased by $524,358 as of December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 due to lower operating expenses. Deferred revenues from decreased by $2,100,011 as of December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019.
During 2020, our cash flows used by investing activities were $217,765, and included purchases of property and equipment of $59,952, capital outlays related to intangible assets such as patents and product certifications of $123,252, distributions to non-controlling interest holders of ADGNY of $60,896 and, was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of certain long-lived assets of $26,335.
TECOGEN INC.
During 2020, our net cash flows used in financing activities were $576,929, which included the termination and repayment of the Webster Bank revolving line of credit of $2,452,329, the receipt of proceeds from the First Draw Paycheck Protection Program loan of $1,874,200 and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $1,200.
Our total product and installation backlog as of December 31, 2020 was $8.3 million compared to $22.4 million as of December 31, 2019. Backlog does not include maintenance contract service revenues or energy contract revenues.
As discussed above, on February 5, 2021, we obtained a Second Draw Paycheck Protection Program loan of $1,874,269 pursuant to the CARES Act that is guaranteed by the SBA. We intend to use the loan proceeds for payroll, rent, utilities and other operating expenses, and expect to apply for forgiveness of the loan balance as permitted under the CARES Act. See Note 10. "Note Payable and Revolving Line of Credit, Bank.”
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1,490,219 and $877,676 , an increase of $612,543 or 69.8%. During the year ended December 31, 2020, our revenues were negatively impacted due to customer order delays or deferrals; service delays due to customer facility closures, in some cases for extended periods and a reduction in our energy production revenues, due to business closures and increased remote work and learning environments. The extent to which the coronavirus will continue to impact our business, our financial results and our cash flows will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.
Based on our current operating plan, we believe existing resources, including cash and cash flows from operations, together with the $1,874,269 of proceeds from our Second Draw Paycheck Protection Program loan, will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for the next twelve months. However, if we seek to grow our business, we expect that our cash requirements will increase. As a result, we may need to raise additional capital through a debt financing or an equity offering to meet our operating and capital needs for future growth.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
We are obligated under operating leases for our Waltham, Massachusetts headquarters and our eleven leased service centers through August 2016. Future minimum lease commitments under non-cancellable operating leases as of December 31, 2020 were $1,946,456. See Note 13. "Leases.”
Seasonality
We expect that the majority of our heating systems sales will be operational for the winter and the majority of our chilling systems sales will be operational for the summer. Our cogeneration sales are not generally affected by the seasons. Our service team does experience higher demand in the warmer months when cooling is required. These chiller units are generally shut down in the winter and started up again in the spring. This chiller “busy season” for the service team generally runs from May through the end of September.
