Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Introduction
We are a publicly traded limited partnership principally engaged in the transportation, storage and distribution of refined petroleum products and crude oil. As of December 31, 2020, our asset portfolio consisted of:
•our refined products segment, comprised of our approximately 9,800-mile refined petroleum products pipeline system with 54 connected terminals as well as 25 independent terminals not connected to our pipeline system and two marine storage terminals (one of which is owned through a joint venture); and
•our crude oil segment, comprised of approximately 2,200 miles of crude oil pipelines, a condensate splitter and 37 million barrels of aggregate storage capacity, of which approximately 27 million barrels are used for contract storage. Approximately 1,000 miles of these pipelines, the condensate splitter and 30 million barrels of this storage capacity (including 24 million barrels used for contract storage) are wholly-owned, with the remainder owned through joint ventures.
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.
See Item 1. Business for a detailed description of our business.
Overview
Resilient Business Model. The year 2020 presented the most challenging industry and economic conditions experienced in our 20-year history as a public company. Despite the backdrop of a difficult year, we generated solid financial results while ensuring continuity of critical fuel supply for our nation. Companies like ours are extremely important to keep the United States’ economy moving and our employees worked diligently to ensure our business ran safely throughout the pandemic.
Our nation experienced unprecedented travel and economic restrictions related to COVID-19 and reduced drilling activity from the lower commodity price environment. As a result, our company was negatively impacted by significantly reduced demand for petroleum products, such as gasoline, diesel fuel and crude oil.
However, our resilient business model and financial strength positioned us well to respond not only to the near-term industry challenges but to successfully manage our company for the long term. Even during a pandemic, our company proved to be resilient, and we were able to pay consistent cash distributions to our investors, generate solid distribution coverage and maintain industry-leading leverage well within our long-standing limit.
Our conservative, disciplined approach provides us the confidence to manage our business through this business cycle. We remain optimistic that demand for our services will continue to increase as vaccines become more readily available, travel and economic activity recover and drilling returns due to an improved demand and commodity price environment.
Long-Term Value Creation. We remain focused on delivering long-term value for our investors through a disciplined combination of cash distributions, equity repurchases and capital investments. Construction projects have been a primary source of growth for our company over the years. Although the current environment for large-scale capital investments is challenging and likely to remain so for the foreseeable future, we continue to look for opportunities to invest in attractive, low-risk projects to benefit our future.
Focus on Optimization. Efficiency and discipline are key to our business strategy, and we kicked off an optimization initiative over a year ago to identify opportunities throughout the organization. Our employees have been actively engaged in the process to identify better ways to run our business, with significant progress to date on this effort.
Optimization of our asset portfolio is an important element of our company’s discipline as well. During 2020, we divested three marine terminal facilities outside our strategic footprint to maximize value and our strong financial position.
Sustainability Commitment. Moving What Moves America® represents who we are and our commitment to safely and reliably deliver petroleum products that are essential and beneficial to everyday life.
Sustainability is not new to us. We have focused on long-term, sustainable operations and disciplined management since our creation two decades ago. However, we recognize the growing stakeholder interest in how these principles are incorporated into our daily operations, and we published our inaugural sustainability report last fall.
Our most important social obligation is to safely and reliably provide the fuels that our nation relies on each day, while protecting the communities where we live and work. In addition, we continue to be an industry leader in governance, with an independent board elected by our investors and all-employee annual compensation aligned with key environmental and safety metrics. We remain committed to providing transparency around how we manage and measure our environmental, social and governance performance.
Important Future Role. Looking ahead, investors are understandably curious how potential changes in energy policy could impact the long-term viability of our business. Based on industry and government forecasts, the demand for petroleum products is expected to remain strong for many years to come.
The vast majority of cars, trucks, tractors, locomotives and airplanes today depend on petroleum products to operate, especially in the markets served by our assets. Realistically, energy transition will take decades to accomplish, with petroleum products and Magellan continuing to play important roles in our nation’s energy future.
Recent Developments
COVID-19 and Decline in Commodity Prices. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy. In response to the pandemic, governments around the world have implemented stringent measures to help reduce the spread of the virus, including stay-at-home orders, travel restrictions and other measures. Due to reductions in economic activity, the world is experiencing reduced demand for petroleum products and depressed commodity prices for petroleum products, which has adversely affected our business. Continuing uncertainty regarding the global impact of COVID-19 is likely to result in continued weakness in demand for the services we provide while the pandemic continues. The reduction in refined products demand and lower crude oil prices have combined to put significant downward pressure on domestic crude oil production, and a sustained reduction in crude oil production could cause delays in the timing of our recognition of revenue from take-or-pay pipeline transportation commitments. These events have and will continue to adversely affect our business. However, we do not believe these events will impact our ability to meet any of our financial obligations or result in any significant impairments to our assets.
Distribution. In January 2021, the board of directors of our general partner declared a quarterly distribution of $1.0275 per unit for the period of October 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020. This quarterly distribution was paid on February 12, 2021 to unitholders of record on February 5, 2021.
Results of Operations
We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures utilized by management. Operating margin, which is presented in the following table, is an important measure used by management to evaluate the economic performance of our core operations. Operating margin is not a generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) measure, but the components of operating margin are computed using amounts that are determined in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of operating margin to operating profit, which is its nearest comparable GAAP financial measure, is included in the following table. Operating profit includes expense items, such as depreciation, amortization and impairment expense and general and administrative (“G&A”) expense, which management does not focus on when evaluating the core profitability of our separate operating segments. Additionally, product margin, which management primarily uses to evaluate the profitability of our commodity-related activities, is provided in this table. Product margin is a non-GAAP measure but its components of product sales revenue and cost of product sales are determined in accordance with GAAP. Our gas liquids blending, fractionation and other commodity-related activities generate significant revenue. However, we believe the product margin from these activities, which takes into account the related cost of product sales, better represents its importance to our results of operations.

(a) Volume shipped includes shipments related to our crude oil marketing activities. Volume shipped in 2020 reflects a change in the way our customers contract for our services pursuant to which customers are able to utilize crude oil storage capacity at East Houston and dock access at Seabrook. Subsequent to this change, the services we provide no longer include a transportation element. Therefore, revenues related to these services are reflected entirely as terminalling revenues and the related volumes are no longer reflected in our calculation of transportation volumes.
(b) These volumes reflect total shipments for the BridgeTex pipeline, which is owned 30% by us.
(c) These volumes reflect the total shipments for the Saddlehorn pipeline, which was owned 40% by us through January 31, 2020 and 30% thereafter.
Transportation and terminals revenue decreased by $175.7 million, resulting from:
•a decrease in refined products revenue of $113.8 million. Transportation volumes decreased primarily due to lower demand during 2020 associated with the ongoing impact from COVID-19 and related restrictions as well as reduced drilling activity in response to the lower commodity price environment. Revenues also decreased due to the sale of three marine terminals in first quarter 2020 and discontinuation of the ammonia pipeline operations in late 2019. These declines were partially offset by contributions from the recently-constructed East Houston-to-Hearne pipeline segment that became operational in late 2019 and the West Texas pipeline expansion that began operations in the third quarter of 2020, as well as an increase in the average tariff rate in the current period as a result of the 2019 and 2020 mid-year adjustments; and
•a decrease in crude oil revenue of $60.8 million. Revenues from our Longhorn pipeline declined due to lower third-party spot shipments resulting from less favorable differentials between the Permian Basin and Houston and the 2020 expiration of several higher-priced contracts, partially offset by the activities of our marketing affiliate. Average tariff rates increased as a result of fewer shipments on our Houston distribution system, which move at a lower rate than longer-haul shipments. Lower transportation volume on our Houston distribution system resulted primarily from a change in the way customers now contract for services at our Seabrook export facility and was offset by incremental revenue from the related terminal transfer fee. Tender deduction revenues also decreased due to lower crude oil prices. These declines were partially offset by increased storage revenues as more contract storage was utilized at higher rates.
Operating expenses decreased $32.8 million, resulting from:
•a decrease in refined products expenses of $46.3 million primarily due to lower throughput activity, less integrity spending due to timing of work, reduced compensation expense and the absence of costs in the current period associated with the sold or discontinued assets, partially offset by less favorable product overages (which reduce operating expenses); and
•an increase in crude oil expenses of $15.8 million primarily due to higher integrity spending, less favorable product overages and additional fees we pay to Seabrook for contract storage and ancillary services that we utilize to provide services to our shippers, partially offset by lower power costs from reduced shipments and our recent optimization efforts.
Product margin decreased $18.8 million primarily due to reduced profitability and lower sales volumes from our gas liquids blending activities, partially offset by lower losses recognized in the current year on futures contracts. See Note 13 - Derivative Financial Instruments in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, as well as Other Items - Commodity Derivative Agreements below, for more information about our futures contracts.
Other operating income decreased $2.9 million in 2020 primarily due to insurance settlements received in 2019 mainly related to Hurricane Harvey, partially offset by lower losses recognized on a basis derivative agreement during the current period.
Earnings of non-controlled entities decreased $15.7 million primarily due to lower earnings from BridgeTex related to decreased uncommitted shipments based on unfavorable market conditions as well as lower earnings from Saddlehorn following the sale of a 10% interest in early 2020. These decreases were partially offset by additional earnings from MVP from the 2020 start-up of newly-constructed storage and dock assets.
Depreciation, amortization and impairment expense increased $12.6 million primarily due to the impairment of certain terminalling assets in 2020.
G&A expense decreased $23.2 million primarily due to lower incentive compensation accruals to reflect the impacts of COVID-19 related reductions in economic activity and the significant decline in commodity prices.
Interest expense, net of interest income and interest capitalized, increased $23.2 million in 2020 primarily due to higher outstanding debt and higher costs associated with early debt retirement, as well as lower capitalized interest (due to lower ongoing construction project spending in 2020). Our average outstanding debt increased from $4.6 billion in 2019 to $4.9 billion in 2020. Our weighted-average interest rate decreased from 4.6% in 2019 to 4.4% in 2020.
Gain on disposition of assets was $16.1 million unfavorable. In 2020, we recognized a gain on the sale of a portion of our interest in Saddlehorn of $12.9 million. In 2019, we recognized a deferred gain of $11.0 million related to the 2018 sale of a portion of our investment in BridgeTex, a gain of $12.7 million related to our discontinued Delaware Basin crude oil pipeline construction project that was sold to a third party and a gain of $5.3 million resulting from the sale of an inactive terminal along our refined products pipeline system.
Other expense was $6.6 million favorable primarily due to lower pension costs.
For a comparative discussion of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, see Part II, Item 7 - “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations” in Exhibit 99.1 to our Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 4, 2020, which reflects changes in our reporting segments since the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Distributable Cash Flow
Distributable cash flow (“DCF”) and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures. See Item 6. Selected Financial Data for a discussion of how management uses these non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of DCF and Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 to net income, which is the nearest comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows (in millions):
Year Ended December 31,
2019 2020

(186.9) (205.5)
Maintenance capital(7)
(96.7) (98.7)
DCF $ 1,297.5 $ 1,044.5
(1) Depreciation, amortization and impairment expense is excluded from DCF to the extent it represents a non-cash expense.
(2) Because we intend to satisfy vesting of unit awards under our equity-based long-term incentive compensation plan with the issuance of common units, expenses related to this plan generally are deemed non-cash and excluded for DCF purposes. The amounts above have been reduced by cash payments associated with the plan, which are primarily related to tax withholdings.
(3) Gains on disposition of assets are excluded from DCF to the extent they are not related to our ongoing operations.
(4) Certain derivatives have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes, and the mark-to-market changes of these derivatives are recognized currently in net income. We exclude the net impact of these derivatives from our determination of DCF until the transactions are settled and, where applicable, the related products are sold. In the period in which these transactions are settled and any related products are sold, the net impact of the derivatives is included in DCF.
(5) We adjust DCF for lower of average cost or net realizable value adjustments related to inventory and firm purchase commitments as well as market valuations of short positions recognized each period as these are non-cash items. In subsequent periods when we physically sell or purchase the related products, we adjust DCF for the valuation adjustments previously recognized.
(6) Interest expense includes $8.3 million of debt extinguishment costs in 2019 and $12.9 million in 2020 that are excluded from DCF as they are financing activities and are not related to our ongoing operations.
(7) Maintenance capital expenditures maintain our existing assets and do not generate incremental DCF (i.e. incremental returns to our unitholders). For this reason, we deduct maintenance capital expenditures to determine DCF.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash Flows and Capital Expenditures
Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,321.2 million and $1,107.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The $213.8 million decrease from 2019 to 2020 was due to lower net income as previously described and changes in our working capital, partially offset by adjustments for non-cash items and distributions in excess of earnings of our non-controlled entities.
Investing Activities. Net cash used by investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 was $1,007.3 million and $199.2 million, respectively. During 2020, we used $439.6 million for capital expenditures, which included $0.2 million for undivided joint interest projects for which cash was received from a third party. Also, during 2020, we sold three marine terminals for cash proceeds of $251.8 million and sold a portion of our interest in Saddlehorn for cash proceeds of $79.9 million. Additionally, we made net capital contributions of $94.6 million to our joint ventures, which we account for as investments in non-controlled entities. During 2019, we used $944.0 million for capital expenditures, which included $92.1 million for undivided joint interest projects for which cash was received from a third party. Additionally, we made net capital contributions of $203.9 million to our joint ventures, of which $198.9 million related to capital projects.
Financing Activities. Net cash used by financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 was $538.6 million and $970.3 million, respectively. During 2020, we paid distributions of $927.1 million to our unitholders and made common unit repurchases of $276.9 million. Additionally, we received net proceeds of $828.4 million from the issuance of long-term senior notes, which were used to repay our $550.0 million of 4.25% notes due 2021 and outstanding commercial paper borrowings at that time. Also, in January 2020, our equity-based incentive compensation awards that vested December 31, 2019 were settled by issuing 284,643 common units and distributing those units to the long-term incentive plan (“LTIP”) participants, resulting in payments primarily associated with tax withholdings of $14.7 million. During 2019, we paid distributions of $921.6 million to our unitholders. Additionally, we received net proceeds of $996.4 million from borrowings under long-term notes, which were used to repay our $550.0 million of 6.55% notes due 2019 and outstanding commercial paper borrowings at that time. Also, in January 2019, our equity-based long-term incentive compensation awards that vested December 31, 2018 were settled by issuing 208,268 common units and distributing those units to the LTIP participants, resulting in payments primarily associated with tax withholdings of $9.8 million.
The quarterly distribution amount related to fourth quarter 2020 earnings was $1.0275 per unit, which was paid in February 2021. If we were to continue paying distributions at this level on the number of common units currently outstanding, total distributions of approximately $918 million would be paid to our unitholders related to 2021 earnings. Management believes we will have sufficient DCF to fund these distributions.
For a discussion of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2018, see Part I, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Exhibit 99.1 to our Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 4, 2020, which reflects changes in our reporting segments since the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Capital Requirements
Capital spending for our business consists primarily of:
•Maintenance capital expenditures. These expenditures include costs required to maintain equipment reliability and safety and to address environmental and other regulatory requirements rather than to generate incremental DCF; and
•Expansion capital expenditures. These expenditures are undertaken primarily to generate incremental DCF and include costs to acquire or construct additional assets to grow our business and to expand or upgrade our existing facilities and to construct new assets, which we refer to collectively as organic growth projects. Organic growth projects include, for example, capital expenditures that increase storage or throughput volumes or develop pipeline connections to new supply sources.
During 2020, our maintenance capital spending was $98.7 million. For 2021, we expect to spend approximately $85 million on maintenance capital projects.
During 2020, we spent $259.8 million for our expansion capital projects and contributed $94.6 million for expansion capital projects in conjunction with our joint ventures. Based on the progress of projects already
underway, we expect to spend approximately $75 million in 2021 to complete our current slate of expansion capital projects.
Liquidity
Cash generated from operations is a key source of liquidity for funding debt service, maintenance capital expenditures, quarterly distributions and unit repurchases. Additional liquidity for purposes other than quarterly distributions, such as expansion capital expenditures and debt repayments, is available through borrowings under our commercial paper program and revolving credit facility, as well as from other borrowings or issuances of debt or common units (see Note 9 - Debt and Note 18 - Partners’ Capital and Distributions in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report for detail of our borrowings and changes in partners’ capital).
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

(1)At December 31, 2020, we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility or commercial paper program. For purposes of this table, we have reflected no assumed borrowings under our revolving credit facility or commercial paper program for any periods presented. We have included interest obligations based on the stated amounts of our fixed-rate obligations.
(2)Includes product storage we have contracted from third parties. The cost of storage services is recognized in cost of product sales on our consolidated statements of income.
(3)Includes pipeline capacity we have contracted from third parties. The cost of these commitments is recognized in operating expense on our consolidated statements of income.
(4)Represents right-of-way agreements with a contractual maturity date over one year. The cost of these obligations is recognized in operating expense on our consolidated statements of income.
(5)Represents the projected benefit obligation of our pension and postretirement medical plans less the fair value of plan assets.
(6)Includes product purchase commitments for which the price provisions are indexed based on the date of delivery. We have estimated the value of these commitments using the related index price curve as of December 31, 2020. Also, we have excluded certain product purchase agreements for which there is no specified or minimum quantity.
(7)As of December 31, 2020, we had entered into exchange-traded futures contracts representing 3.4 million barrels of petroleum products that we expect to sell in the future and 0.1 million barrels of gas liquids we expect to purchase in the future. At December 31, 2020, we had recorded a net liability of $21.3 million and made margin deposits of $34.2 million. We have excluded from this table the future net cash outflows, if any, under these futures contracts and the amounts of future margin deposit requirements because those amounts are uncertain.
(8)Settlements of our LTIP awards will differ from these reported amounts primarily due to differences between actual and current estimates of payout percentages and completion of the remaining portion of the requisite service periods.
Other Items
Executive Officer Retirements. Jeff R. Selvidge, Senior Vice President of Commercial - Refined Products, retired in November 2020 after 30 years of service with us and our predecessors.
Pipeline Tariff Changes. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) regulates the rates charged on interstate common carrier pipelines. Based on preliminary estimates, we expect to decrease rates in the 40% of our markets that are subject to the FERC’s index methodology by approximately 0.5% on July 1, 2021. While we continue to evaluate the remaining 60% of our markets, we generally intend to increase rates in those markets by 3% to 4% on July 1, 2021, similar to the 2020 rate increase for our competitive markets. Most of the tariffs on our long-
haul crude oil pipelines are established at negotiated rates that generally provide for annual adjustments in line with changes in the FERC index, subject to certain modifications. We expect to change the rates of our long-haul crude oil pipelines between 0% and 2% in July 2021.
Commodity Derivative Agreements. Certain of our business activities result in our owning various commodities, which exposes us to commodity price risk. We use forward physical commodity contracts and exchange-traded futures contracts to hedge against changes in prices of commodities that we expect to sell or purchase in future periods. We are a party to a basis derivative agreement for which settlements are determined based on the basis differential of crude oil prices at different market locations.
For further information regarding the quantities of refined products and crude oil hedged at December 31, 2020 and the fair value of open hedge and basis derivative contracts at that date, please see
