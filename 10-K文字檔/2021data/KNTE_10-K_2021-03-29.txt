Item 7.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Investors should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the section entitled “Selected Consolidated Financial Data” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including those described in the section titled “Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements.” Our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those set forth under the section titled “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this report.
Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of small molecule kinase inhibitors for difficult-to-treat, genomically defined cancers. Our mission is to expand the reach of targeted therapeutics by developing products for underserved populations. We utilize our deep expertise in structure-based drug discovery, translational research and patient-driven precision medicine, which we collectively refer to as our Kinnate Discovery Engine, to develop our targeted therapies. We focus our discovery and development efforts on three patient populations: (1) those with cancers that harbor known oncogenic drivers (gene mutations that cause cancers) with no currently available targeted therapies, (2) those with genomically well-characterized tumors that have intrinsic resistance to currently available treatments (non-responders), and (3) those whose tumors have acquired resistance over the course of therapy to currently available treatments. We believe our unique approach may enable us to develop drugs with an increased probability of clinical success while reducing the cost and risk of drug development. Our most advanced product candidate is KIN-2787, which is a RAF inhibitor we are developing for the treatment of patients with lung cancer, melanoma and other solid tumors. Unlike currently available treatments that target only Class I BRAF kinase mutations, we have designed KIN-2787 to target Class II and Class III BRAF mutations, where it would be a first-line targeted therapy, in addition to covering Class I BRAF mutations. We anticipate filing an IND for our RAF candidate with the FDA in the first half of 2021. Additionally, we are evaluating FGFR inhibitor candidates for the treatment of patients with ICC and UC. Our lead FGFR candidate, KIN-3248 is designed to address clinically observed genomic alterations in FGFR2 and FGFR3 that drive resistance to current therapies. We anticipate filing an IND for KIN-3248 with the FDA in the first half of 2022. Our RAF and FGFR candidates have demonstrated proof of concept in preclinical models and, subject to our planned IND submissions taking effect, we anticipate initiating a Phase 1 clinical trial for KIN-2787 in 2021 and an additional Phase 1 clinical trial for KIN-3248 program in the first half of 2022. We are also advancing a number of other small molecule research programs, including a CDK12 inhibitor in our KIN004 program to target the treatment of OC, TNBC and mCRPC.
Since our inception in 2018, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development activities, including with respect to our RAF and FGFR programs and other research programs, business planning, establishing and maintaining our intellectual property portfolio, hiring personnel, raising capital, and providing general and administrative support for these operations.
We do not have any products approved for commercial sale, and we have not generated any revenue from product sales or other sources since inception. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability, if ever, will depend on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates which we expect, if it ever occurs, will take a number of years. We also do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacturing if any of our product candidates obtain marketing approval. We believe that this strategy allows us to maintain a more efficient infrastructure by eliminating the need for us to invest in our own manufacturing facilities, equipment and personnel while also enabling us to focus our expertise and resources on the development of our product candidates.
To date, we have financed our operations primarily through proceeds from the issuance of common stock and private placements of our convertible preferred stock. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $396.9 million. Based on our current operating plan, we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our planned operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months.
We have incurred significant losses since the commencement of our operations. Our net losses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $35.8 million and $12.0 million, respectively, and we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing losses for the foreseeable future as we continue to advance our product candidates and any future product candidates from discovery through preclinical development and into clinical trials as we seek regulatory approval for these product candidates. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from period to period, depending on the timing of expenditures on our research and development activities. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $53.3 million.
We expect our expenses and capital requirements will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities as we:
●
advance our RAF and FGFR programs from discovery and preclinical development into and through clinical development;
●
advance the development of our other small molecule research programs, including our CDK12 inhibitor;
●
expand our pipeline of product candidates through our own product discovery and development efforts;
●
seek to discover and develop additional product candidates;
●
seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;
●
establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any approved product candidates and related additional commercial manufacturing costs;
●
implement operational, financial and management systems;
●
attract, hire and retain additional clinical, scientific, management and administrative personnel;
●
maintain, expand, protect and enforce our intellectual property portfolio, including patents, trade secrets and know how; and
●
operate as a public company.
We will require substantial additional funding to develop our product candidates and support our continuing operations. Until such time that we can generate significant revenue from product sales or other sources, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through the sale of equity, debt financings or other capital sources, which could include income from collaborations, strategic partnerships or marketing, distribution, licensing or other strategic arrangements with third parties, or from grants. We may be unable to raise additional funds or to enter into such agreements or arrangements on favorable terms, or at all. Our ability to raise additional funds may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and the recent disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and otherwise. Our failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, including requiring us to have to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development or future commercialization efforts. Insufficient liquidity may also require us to relinquish rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose. The amount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including the pace and results of our development efforts. We cannot provide assurance that we will ever be profitable or generate positive cash flow from operating activities.
The global COVID-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 on our business, operations and development timelines and plans remains uncertain, and will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak and its impact on our development activities, planned clinical trial enrollment, future trial sites, CROs, third-party manufacturers, and other third parties with whom we do business, as well as its impact on regulatory authorities and our key scientific and management personnel. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. To the extent possible, we are conducting business as usual, with necessary or advisable modifications to employee travel and with our employees working remotely. We will continue to actively monitor the rapidly evolving situation related to COVID-19 and may take further actions that alter our operations, including those that may be required by federal, state or local authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees and other third parties with whom we do business. At this point, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may affect our business, operations and development timelines and plans, including the resulting impact on our expenditures and capital needs, remains uncertain.
We were incorporated in the State of Delaware in January 2018, and are headquartered in San Diego, California. In April 2019, we merged with Immanate Therapeutics Inc. (Immanate) with Kinnate Biopharma Inc. being the surviving entity. Both companies were previously under the common control of Fount Therapeutics, LLC (FTL). As the merged entities were under common control, the financial statements report the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the companies as though the transfer of net assets and equity interests had occurred at inception on January 4, 2018. Fount Service Corp. (FSC), a subsidiary of FTL, historically provided management services and other services to us, either directly or via arrangements with third parties. These services included research and development and general and administrative functions, such as finance, audit, accounting, human resources, technology, facilities, and other management services necessary for our operations. Employees of FSC were subsequently hired by us, and the material agreements of FSC with third parties relating to the continuing services to be provided to us have been assigned to us or we have entered into new, direct agreements with such third parties and we no longer rely on FTL or FSC for such services and, in November 2020, we terminated our agreement with FTL and FSC. Our research and development team is primarily based in San Diego, California, with a portion of our management team based in the San Francisco Bay Area.
Components of Our Results of Operations
Revenue
To date, we have not generated any revenue and we do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products or from other sources in the foreseeable future.
Operating Expenses
Research and Development
Research and development expenses account for a significant portion of our operating expenses and consist primarily of external and internal expenses incurred in connection with the discovery and development of our product candidates.
External expenses include:
●
expenses incurred in connection with the discovery and preclinical development of our product candidates, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants and CROs;
●
the cost of manufacturing compounds for use in our preclinical studies, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants and CMOs; and
●
costs associated with consultants for chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC) development, regulatory, statistics and other services.
Internal expenses include:
●
for 2020, employee-related expenses, including salaries and benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development functions; and
●
for 2019, research and development services provided by FSC and stock-based compensation expense.
We expense research and development expenses in the periods in which they are incurred. External expenses are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information provided to us by our service providers or our estimate of the level of service that has been performed at each reporting date. We track external expenses on a lead program and other program basis. However, we do not track internal costs on a program specific basis because these costs are deployed across multiple programs and, as such, are not separately classified. We utilize third party contractors for our research and development activities and CMOs for our manufacturing activities and we do not have our own laboratory or manufacturing facilities. Therefore, we have no material facilities expenses attributed to research and development.
Product candidates in later stages of development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages. As a result, we expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially over the next several years as we advance our product candidates through preclinical studies into and through clinical trials, continue to discover and develop additional product candidates and expand our pipeline, maintain, expand, protect and enforce our intellectual property portfolio, and hire additional personnel.
The successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain, and we do not believe it is possible at this time to accurately project the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of, and obtain regulatory approval for, any of our product candidates. To the extent our product candidates continue to advance into clinical trials, as well as advance into larger and later-stage clinical trials, our expenses will increase substantially and may become more variable. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, we will generate revenue from our product candidates to offset these expenses. Our expenditures on current and future preclinical and clinical programs are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion. The duration, costs and timing of preclinical studies and clinical trials and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, including:
●
the timing and progress of preclinical and clinical development activities;
●
the number and scope of preclinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue;
●
our ability to maintain our current research and development programs and to establish new ones;
●
establishing an appropriate safety profile with IND-enabling toxicology studies;
●
successful patient enrollment in, and the initiation and completion of, clinical trials;
●
per subject trial costs;
●
the number of trials required for regulatory approval;
●
the countries in which the trials are conducted;
●
the length of time required to enroll eligible subjects and initial clinical trials;
●
the number of subjects that participate in the trials;
●
the drop-out and discontinuation rate of subjects;
●
potential additional safety monitoring requested by regulatory authorities;
●
the duration of subject participation in the trials and follow-up;
●
the successful completion of clinical trials with safety, tolerability and efficacy profiles that are satisfactory to applicable regulatory authorities;
●
the receipt of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;
●
the timing, receipt and terms of any marketing approvals and post-marketing approval commitments from applicable regulatory authorities;
●
the extent to which we establish collaborations, strategic partnerships or other strategic arrangements with third parties, if any, and the performance of any such third party;
●
obtaining and retaining research and development personnel;
●
establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with CMOs;
●
development and timely delivery of commercial-grade drug formulations that can be used in our planned clinical trials and for commercial launch; and
●
obtaining, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights.
Any changes in the outcome of any of these factors could significantly impact the costs, timing and viability associated with the development of our product candidates.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses in 2019 consisted of fees paid to FTL and FSC for various services such as finance, audit, accounting, human resources, technology, facilities, and other management services necessary for our operations, as well as for legal expenses. General and administrative expenses in 2020 consisted of salaries and benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense for personnel in executive, human resources, finance and administrative functions; professional fees for legal, patent, consulting, accounting and audit services; and expenses for technology and facilities. We expense general and administrative expenses in the periods in which they are incurred.
We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase substantially over the next several years as we hire additional personnel to support the continued research and development of our programs and growth of our business. We also anticipate that we will incur substantially higher expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses related to accounting, audit, legal, regulatory, compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC, Sarbanes-Oxley Act and those of any national securities exchange on which our securities are traded, director and officer insurance, investor and public relations, and other administrative and professional services.
Other Income
Interest Income
Interest income primarily consists of interest income generated from our cash equivalents in interest-bearing money market accounts and short-term investments.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods indicated:
Research and Development Expenses
The following table summarizes our research and development expenses incurred during the periods indicated:
Research and development expenses were $29.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $20.2 million. The increase was primarily driven by an increase of $14.3 million in external expenses for our RAF and FGFR programs. In addition, internal research and development expenses increased $3.8 million as a result of us hiring additional research and development personnel beyond those who were engaged through FTL and FSC in 2019, allowing us to increase our capabilities, and higher stock-based compensation. The remainder of the increase was external expenses for other non-lead programs and for unallocated costs reflecting increased spend in early-stage pipeline research.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses were $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $3.7 million. This increase was primarily driven by the hiring of additional senior management in 2020, higher stock-based compensation, an increase in accounting fees related to our IPO, and an expansion of our activity.
Interest Income
Interest income was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $43,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase reflected the interest earned on the proceeds of the Series B convertible preferred stock financing in December 2019, the Series C convertible preferred stock financing in July and August 2020, and the initial public offering in December 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources of Liquidity
On December 7, 2020, we completed our initial public offering. In connection with our initial public offering, we issued and sold 13,800,000 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $20.00 per share resulting in gross proceeds of $276.0 million before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. Prior to our initial public offering, we funded our operations primarily through private placements of our convertible preferred stock with aggregate gross proceeds of $191.6 million.
Our primary uses of cash to date have been to fund our research and development activities, including with respect to our RAF and FGFR programs and other research programs, business planning, establishing and maintaining our intellectual property portfolio, hiring personnel, raising capital, and providing general and administrative support for these operations.
Future Funding Requirements
To date, we have not generated any revenue. We do not expect to generate any meaningful revenue unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize any of our product candidates, and we do not know when, or if, that will occur. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we will continue to require substantial additional capital to develop our product candidates and fund operations for the foreseeable future. We expect our expenses to increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities as described in greater detail below. We are subject to all the risks incident in the development of new biopharmaceutical products, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may harm our business. We expect our expenses to increase significantly, as we:
●
advance our RAF and FGFR programs from discovery and preclinical development into and through clinical development;
●
advance the development of our other small molecule research programs, including our CDK12 inhibitor;
●
expand our pipeline of product candidates through our own product discovery and development efforts;
●
seek to discover and develop additional product candidates;
●
seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;
●
establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any approved product candidates and related additional commercial manufacturing costs;
●
implement operational, financial and management systems;
●
attract, hire and retain additional clinical, scientific, management and administrative personnel;
●
maintain, expand, protect and enforce our intellectual property portfolio, including patents, trade secrets and know how; and
●
operate as a public company.
In order to complete the development of our product candidates and to build the sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure that we believe will be necessary to commercialize our product candidates, if approved, we will require substantial additional funding. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue from the commercialization of our product candidates, we may seek to raise any necessary additional capital through the sale of equity, debt financings or other capital sources, which could include income from collaborations, strategic partnerships or marketing, distribution, licensing or other strategic arrangements with third parties, or from grants. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be or could be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, including restricting our operations and limiting our ability to incur liens, issue additional debt, pay dividends, repurchase our common stock, make certain investments or engage in merger, consolidation, licensing or asset sale transactions. If we raise funds through collaborations, strategic partnerships and other similar arrangements with third parties, we may be required to grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. We may be unable to raise additional funds or to enter into such agreements or arrangements on favorable terms, or at all. Our ability to raise additional funds may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and the recent disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and otherwise. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development or future commercialization efforts.
Based on our current operating plan, we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our planned operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 24 months. We have based our projections of operating capital requirements on our current operating plan, which includes several assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we may use all of our available capital resources sooner than we expect.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of product candidates, we are unable to estimate the exact amount and timing of our working capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:
●
the scope, timing, progress, results and costs of researching and developing our product candidates, and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials;
●
the scope, timing, progress, results and costs of researching and developing other product candidates that we may pursue;
●
the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;
●
the costs of future activities, including product sales, medical affairs, marketing, manufacturing and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;
●
the costs of manufacturing commercial-grade products and sufficient inventory to support commercial launch;
●
the revenue, if any, received from commercial sale of our products, should any of our product candidates receive marketing approval;
●
the cost and timing of attracting, hiring and retaining skilled personnel to support our operations and continued growth;
●
the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims;
●
our ability to establish and maintain collaborations, strategic partnerships or marketing, distribution, licensing or other strategic arrangements with third parties on favorable terms, if at all;
●
the extent to which we acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies, if any;
●
the timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or milestone payments related to or royalties on, our current or future product candidates, if any; and
●
the costs associated with operating as a public company.
A change in the outcome of any of these or other factors with respect to the development of any of our product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. Furthermore, our operating plans may change in the future, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements associated with such operating plans.
Cash Flows
The following tables summarizes our cash flow for the periods indicated:
Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $30.2 million. This consisted of our net loss of $35.8 million offset by a net increase in working capital of $3.1 million, primarily due to increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses for research and development activities, increases in prepaid expenses and other assets and a decrease in intercompany receivables, net of stock compensation expense of $2.5 million.
Net cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 was $10.5 million. This consisted of our net loss of $12.0 million offset by a net increase in working capital of $1.4 million, primarily due to increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses for research and development activities.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $31.7 million and related to purchases of short-term investments of $31.4 million and purchases of property and equipment of $0.3 million.
There was no cash used in or provided by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $350.9 million. This consisted primarily of proceeds of $97.7 million from the sale of shares of Series C convertible preferred stock, net of issuance costs, and proceeds of $253.3 million from our initial public offering, net of issuance costs, in December 2020.
Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 was $80.0 million. This primarily consisted of proceeds of $5.8 million resulting from the sale of shares of Series A convertible preferred stock, net of issuance costs, and proceeds of $74.2 million resulting from the sale of shares of Series B convertible preferred stock, net of issuance costs.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
We lease certain office space in San Diego, California under a short-term lease with base monthly rent payments of $13,000 that expires March 31, 2021 with an option (exercisable on or before February 28, 2021) to extend to June 30, 2021. We have elected not to renew this lease, and we are in the process of seeking alternative office space for our future needs (including a temporary virtual office until our employees, who have worked nearly exclusively from home since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, return to working at least in part on a regular basis from our office). We believe that suitable alternative space will be available on commercially reasonable terms.
In addition, we have entered into agreements in the normal course of business with certain vendors for the provision of goods and services, which includes manufacturing services with CMOs and development services with CROs. These agreements may include certain provisions for purchase obligations and termination obligations that could require payments for the cancellation of committed purchase obligations or for early termination of the agreements. The amount of the cancellation or termination payments vary and are based on the timing of the cancellation or termination and the specific terms of the agreement. These obligations and commitments are not separately presented.
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
In connection with the audit of our financial statements as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to proper recognition of accrued liabilities related to research and development expenses, the proper classification of research and development expense versus general and administrative expense, and a lack of appropriately designed and implemented controls over the review and approval of manual journal entries which led to our inability to maintain segregation of duties between the creation and posting of journal entries. The material weaknesses resulted in an audit adjustment to decrease operating expenses and accrued expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, and an audit adjustment to the presentation of operating expenses on the Statement of Operations. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We have taken and are taking steps to remediate these material weaknesses through implementation of additional procedures to ensure appropriate review of accrued expenses, appropriate classification of operating expenses, and the implementation of appropriate segregation of duties and related systems and procedures. However, we are still in the process of implementing these steps and we cannot assure investors that these measures will significantly improve or remediate the material weaknesses. If remediation of these material weaknesses is not effective, or if we fail to develop and maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate consolidated financial statements or comply with applicable laws and regulations could be impaired.
See the section titled “Risk Factors- Risks Related to the Securities Markets and Ownership of Our Common Stock-We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. If our remediation of the material weaknesses is not effective, or if we experience additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls in the future, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.”
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We currently do not have, and did not have during the periods presented, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, costs and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a periodic basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as the policies relate to the more significant areas involving management’s judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.
Research and Development Expenses
As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses as of each balance sheet date. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, based on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met, but some require advance payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in the financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. If timelines or contracts are modified based upon changes in the protocol or scope of work to be performed, we modify our estimates and accruals accordingly on a prospective basis.
We base our expenses related to external research and development services on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with vendors that conduct research and development on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we adjust the accrual or the amount of prepaid expenses accordingly.
Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have not been any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation expense represents the cost of the grant date fair value of employee, officer, director and non-employee stock option grants, estimated in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The vesting period generally approximates the expected service period of the awards. We recognize forfeitures as they occur.
The fair value of stock options is estimated using a Black-Scholes valuation model on the date of grant. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs based on certain subjective assumptions. Changes to these assumptions can materially affect the fair value of stock options and ultimately the amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized in our financial statements. These assumptions include:
●
Fair Value of Common Stock-Prior to our initial public offering, the estimated fair value of our common stock was determined by our board of directors as of the date of each option grant, with input from management, considering our most recently available third-party valuation of our common stock as well as our board of directors’ assessment of additional objective and subjective factors that it believed were relevant and which may have changed from the date of the most recent third-party valuation to the date of the grant. Since the completion of our initial public offering, the fair value of each share of common stock underlying stock option grants is based on the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market as reported on the date of grant.
●
Expected Term-We have opted to use the “simplified method” for estimating the expected term of options, whereby the expected term equals the arithmetic average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option, which is generally 10 years.
●
Expected Volatility-Due to our limited operating history and a lack of company-specific historical and implied volatility data, we have based our estimate of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a group of similar companies that are publicly traded. The historical volatility data was computed using the daily closing prices for the selected companies’ shares during the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of the stock-based awards. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available.
●
Risk-Free Interest Rate-The risk-free interest rates used are based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for zero-coupon U.S. treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the expected term of the stock options.
●
Expected Dividend-To date, we have not issued any dividends and do not expect to issue dividends over the life of the options and therefore have estimated the dividend yield to be zero.
The assumptions underlying these valuations represent our board’s and management’s best estimates, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of significant judgment. As a result, if factors or expected outcomes change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
A description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results of operations is disclosed in Note 2 to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status
We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended (JOBS Act). We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue; (ii) the date we qualify as a “large accelerated filer,” with at least $700 million of equity securities held by non-affiliates; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period; and (iv) December 31, 2025. As a result of this status, we have taken advantage of reduced reporting requirements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and may elect to take advantage of other reduced reporting requirements in our future filings with the SEC. In particular, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have provided only two years of audited financial statements and have not included all of the executive compensation related information that would be required if we were not an emerging growth company.
In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards, delaying the adoption of these accounting standards until they would apply to private companies. We have elected to use the extended transition period to enable us to comply with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date on which we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company and (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.
We are also a “smaller reporting company” meaning that the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million and our annual revenue was less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $250 million or (ii) our annual revenue was less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million. If we are a smaller reporting company at the time we cease to be an emerging growth company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company we may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and other matters.
