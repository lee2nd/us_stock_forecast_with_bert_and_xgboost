ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes thereto that are included in this Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, the following discussion and analysis includes forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this prospectus, particularly in the section entitled “Risk Factors.” See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
Overview
We are a medical technology company that is commercializing our PURE EP™ System which is an advanced signal acquisition and processing platform designed to provide essential diagnostic signals with high clinical value in all types of cardiac catheter ablations.
PURE EP™ is designed to address long-standing limitations that slow and disrupt cardiac catheter ablation procedures, such as environmental lab noise, signal saturation, slow signal recovery, and inaccurate display of fractionated potentials.
Cardiac catheter ablation is a procedure that involves delivery of energy through the tip of a catheter that scars or destroys heart tissue to correct heart rhythm disturbances. In August 2018, we received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) to market our PURE (Precise Uninterrupted Real-time evaluation of Electrograms) EP™ System.
PURE EP™ is a signal processing platform that combines advanced hardware and software to address known challenges associated to signal acquisition, to enable electrophysiologists to see more signals and analyze them in real-time. The device aims to minimize noise and artifacts from cardiac recordings and acquire high-fidelity cardiac signals. Improving fidelity of acquired cardiac signals may potentially increase the diagnostic value of these signals, thereby possibly improving accuracy and efficiency of the EP studies and ablation procedures.
Our initial focus is on improving intracardiac signal acquisition and enhancing diagnostic information for catheter ablation procedures for complex arrhythmias like ventricular tachycardia (“VT”), a potentially life-threatening arrhythmia, and atrial fibrillation (“AF”), the most common cardiac arrhythmia associated with a fivefold risk of stroke.
During 2019, we began conducting our first clinical observational patient cases using the PURE EP System at Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute at St. David’s Medical Center in Austin, Texas; Prisma Health at Greenville Health System in South Carolina; Indiana University; and Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital in California. The initial experience across these early evaluation centers showed that the PURE EP™ System functions as designed: we received positive feedback from the EP users about the improved signal detection and fidelity during ablation procedures on patients with various arrhythmias, such as ischemic ventricular tachycardia, AF, atypical flutter, atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT), supraventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions (PVC), and a rare case of dual septal pathway.
In November 2019, we commenced our first clinical study for the PURE EP™ System titled, “Novel Cardiac Signal Processing System for Electrophysiology Procedures (PURE EP 2.0 Study).” Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Research Foundation (TCARF) in Austin, Texas, was the first institution to conduct patient cases under the clinical study; Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida was the second institution; and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) was the third to conduct patient cases under the same clinical study. As of March 8, 2021, 81 patients have been enrolled in the study. Initial results of evaluated data from the PURE EP 2.0 Study found that a cumulative total of 29 PURE EP signals out of 34 (85.3%) were rated as statistically equivalent or better for the dataset (identical electrocardiographic and intracardiac signal data recorded during 15 AF ablation procedures from the PURE EP System, the signal recording system, and the 3D mapping system). In 35.5% of samples, the reviewers selected PURE EP because "more signal components were visible."
We continue to install PURE EP Systems at centers of excellence for clinical evaluation under our market development plan. The PURE EP System has been utilized at several institutions, including University of Pennsylvania Hospital; Overland Park Regional Medical System in Overland Park, Kansas; Deborah Heart and Lung Center in Browns Mills, New Jersey; and Memorial Hospital of South Bend, part of Beacon Health System, in South Bend, Indiana; and Houston Methodist in Texas.
To date, more than 575 patient procedures have been conducted with the PURE EP System by more than 38 electrophysiologists across eight different clinical sites in the United States.
In addition to clinical evaluation, we have conducted a total of twenty-seven pre-clinical studies with the PURE EP™ System, twenty-two of which were performed at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. We also conducted a pre-clinical study at the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, New York, with an emphasis on the VT model; and four pre-clinical studies at the University of Pennsylvania. We intend to continue additional research and development studies with our technology at Mayo Clinic and the University of Pennsylvania. We also intend to continue additional clinical external evaluation at a select number of other centers.
We have made progress towards obtaining a European CE marking certificate for medical devices. We intend to commence audit preparation for the International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) 13485 with the expectation to proceed with the audit to obtain the ISO 13485 Certification and CE Mark in the first half of 2021 and subsequently file for CE Mark in the second half of 2021 or early in 2022, subject to the guidance from the European notified body.
In December 2020, we announced that three units were contracted for purchase by St David’s Healthcare of Austin, Texas and subsequently sold in February 2021. These units were our first commercial sale. Additionally, we are in active discussions with numerous accounts about the acquisition of the PURE EP™ System. We anticipate our initial customers will be medical centers of excellence and other healthcare facilities that operate EP labs.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements include estimates based on currently available information and our judgment as to the outcome of future conditions and circumstances.
Among the significant judgments made by management in the preparation of our financial statements are the following:
Research and Development
We account for research and development costs in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 730-10, Research and Development (“ASC 730-10”). Under ASC 730-10, all research and development costs must be charged to expense as incurred. Accordingly, internal research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Third-party research and developments costs are expensed when the contracted work has been performed or as milestone results have been achieved. Company-sponsored research and development costs related to both present and future products are expensed in the period incurred.
Stock-Based Compensation
All stock-based payments to employees and to nonemployee directors for their services as directors consisted of grants of restricted stock and stock options, which are measured at fair value on the grant date and recognized in the statements of operations as compensation expense over the relevant vesting period. Restricted stock payments and stock-based payments to nonemployees are recognized as an expense over the period of performance. Such payments are measured at fair value at the earlier of the date a performance commitment is reached, or the date performance is completed. In addition, for awards that vest immediately and are non-forfeitable, the measurement date is the date the award is issued.
Use of estimates
The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include the recoverability and useful lives of long-lived assets, the fair value of long-term operating leases, patent capitalization, fair value of acquired assets, the fair value of the Company’s stock, stock-based compensation, fair values relating to derivative liabilities and the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Derivative Instrument Liability
We account for derivative instruments in accordance with ASC 815, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other financial instruments or contracts and requires recognition of all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value, regardless of hedging relationship designation. Accounting for changes in fair value of the derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives qualify as hedge relationships and the types of relationships designated are based on the exposures hedged. On December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company did not have any derivative instruments that were designated as hedges.
On December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had outstanding preferred stock that contained embedded derivatives. These embedded derivatives include certain conversion features and reset provisions.
Income Taxes
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of net operating loss and credit carryforwards and temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their respective financial reporting amounts measured at the current enacted tax rates. We record an estimated valuation allowance on our deferred income tax assets if it is not more likely than not that these deferred income tax assets will be realized. We recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
Results of Operations
We anticipate that our results of operations will fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors, such as the progress of our research and development efforts and the timing and outcome of regulatory submissions. Due to these uncertainties, accurate predictions of future operations are difficult or impossible to make.
Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2019
Revenues and Cost of Goods Sold. We had no revenues or cost of goods sold during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 were $18,135,862, an increase of $8,397,043 or 86.2%, from $9,738,819 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. This increase is primarily due 2020 increases in Data /AI development in BioSig segment along with product development and consulting work in the ViralClear segment. In addition, in 2020 ViralClear issued: (i) its common stock with a fair value of $3,174,550; (ii) 259,959 warrants with a fair value of $1,299,795 and (iii) cash in aggregate of $408,545 to acquire research and development as compared to 2019 where BioSig issued warrants with a fair value of $3,162,342 and cash of $175,000 to acquire research and development (see discussion below).
Research and development expenses were comprised of the following:
Stock-based compensation for research and development personnel was $1,253,156 and $1,920,060 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we and ViralClear entered into patent and know how agreements pursuant to which we paid Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (“Mayo”) whereby we and NeuroClear paid Mayo an aggregate of $175,000 and warrants with an estimated fair value of $3,162,342.
On March 24, 2020, ViralClear entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with Trek Therapeutics, PBC (“Trek”). Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, Trek sold to ViralClear all right, title and interest of Trek and its affiliates to certain assets (the “Purchased Assets”). As consideration for the Purchased Assets, ViralClear agreed to pay Trek in upfront and milestone payments a combination of cash, shares of ViralClear’s common stock, which common stock may equal up to 10% of ViralClear’s outstanding equity, and sublicense fees in the event ViralClear sublicenses the Purchased Assets. On March 30, 2020, pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, ViralClear paid $350,000 in cash and issued 634,910 shares of ViralClear’s common stock to Trek at a fair of $3,174,550. The Purchased Assets were recorded as acquired research and development.
On April 8, 2020, ViralClear entered into a know-how license agreement (the “Agreement”) with Mayo. The Agreement grants to ViralClear (i) an exclusive worldwide license, with the right to sublicense, within the field of anti-viral agents to target COVID-19 (the “Field”) to certain patent rights for the development and commercialization of products, methods, and processes for public use and benefit (the “Licensed Products”) and (ii) a non-exclusive worldwide license, with the right to sublicense, within the Field, to use the know-how of Mayo that is necessary to develop the Licensed Products.
The Agreement will expire upon the later of either (a) the expiration of the licensed patent rights or (b) the 7th anniversary of the date of the first commercial sale of a Licensed Product, unless earlier terminated by Mayo for ViralClear’s failure to cure a material breach of the Agreement, ViralClear’s or a sublicensee’s commencement of any action or proceedings against Mayo or its affiliates other than for an uncured material breach of the Agreement by Mayo, or insolvency ViralClear.
In connection with the Agreement, ViralClear issued to Mayo 259,959 shares of ViralClear’s common stock. ViralClear also agreed to make earned royalty payments to Mayo in connection with ViralClear’s sales of the Licensed Products along with certain milestone payments.
General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 were $40,953,253, an increase of $16,142,541, or 65%, from $24,810,712 incurred in the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. This increase is primarily due to increase in equity-based and other compensation, increases in professional services, consulting fees and travel, meals and entertainment costs.
Payroll related expenses (including equity compensation) increased to $31,080,261 in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 from $17,882,004 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $13,198,257, or 74%. This increase is due to the value of the stock-based compensation increasing to $23,911,391 in 2020, as a result of the vesting of stock and stock options issued to board members, officers and employees, as compared to $13,923,678 of stock-based compensation in 2019, along with added additional personnel in 2020.
Professional services for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 totaled $1,948,437, an increase of $944,298, or 94%, over the $1,004,139 recognized for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. Of professional services, legal fees totaled $1,503,487 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $601,348, or 67%, from $902,139 incurred for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The significant increase in legal fees in 2020 is due to legal work in asset acquisitions, financing and in developing and registering patents. Accounting fees incurred in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 amounted to $257,956, an increase of $155,956 or 153%, from $102,000 incurred for the same period in 2019. The significant increase is due to additional work relating to internal control audit, design and monitoring, audit work relating to ViralClear segment.
Consulting fees totaled $6,868,943 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $3,527,175 or 106%, from $3,341,768 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The increase primarily relates to our fund raising and investor relations to support our increased efforts in market research and potential investor identification and key consultants in connection with our commercialization efforts.
Travel, meals and entertainment costs for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 were $372,568, a decrease of $331,997, or 47%, from $704,565 incurred during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in 2020 was due to various restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic-related measures as compared to 2019.
Rent for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 totaled $483,859, an increase of $70,096, or 17%, from $413,763 incurred during the same period in 2019. In 2020, our significant increase was the result of our full year lease payments with our sublease of our corporate headquarters in Connecticut and lease of facilities in Minnesota along with escalation increases of our existing leases in 2020.
Depreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense for the twelve months ended 2020 totaled $93,533 as compared to $54,349 incurred during the same period in 2019. The increase is due primarily to additional equipment purchased and amortization of our patent development costs in 2020.
Interest Income. Interest income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 totaled $45,496 as compared to $132,751 earned during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in 2020 was due reduction of interest rates earned with cash balances in our interest-bearing accounts.
Preferred Stock Dividend. Preferred stock dividend for the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $14,080, a decrease of $11,083, or 44% from $25,163 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2019. Preferred stock dividends are related to the issuance of our Series C Preferred Stock from 2013 through 2015. The significant decrease in 2020 as compared to 2019 is the result of 2020 conversions of the Series C Preferred Stock.
Noncontrolling Interest. In 2019 and 2020, ViralClear sold shares of its common stock to fund its initial and ongoing operations. As of December 31, 2020, we had a majority interest in ViralClear of 70.2%. The proportionate loss attributed to noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $6,921,709 as compared to $415,849 for 2019.
Net Loss Available to BioSig Technologies, Inc. Net loss available to common stockholders for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was $52,231,684, compared to a net loss of $34,079,991 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $18,151,693 or 53%. The primary reasons for the increase, as described above, are the increases in research and development costs and general and administrative expenses from 2019 to 2020.
Segment Results
The Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s reportable segments.
Summary Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 are detailed in Note 12 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
COVID-19
The full public-health impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is currently indeterminable and rapidly evolving, and the related health crisis has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the global economy, resulting in possibly delaying our commercialization objectives of the PURE EP Systems.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We had an accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2020 of approximately $157 million, as well as a net loss of approximately $52 million and negative operating cash flows. We expect to continue incurring losses and negative cash flows from operations until our products (primarily PURE EP System) reach commercial profitability. We believe that our existing cash on hand and access to existing financing will be sufficient to enable us to fund our projected operating requirements for approximately 14 months. However, we may need to raise additional funds more quickly if one or more of our assumptions prove to be incorrect or if we choose to expand our product development efforts more rapidly than we presently anticipate. We also may decide to raise additional funds before we require them if we are presented with favorable terms for raising capital.
Our plans include the continued commercialization of PURE EP System and raising capital through the sale of additional equity securities, debt or capital inflows from strategic partnerships. There are no assurances, however, that we will be successful in obtaining the level of financing needed for our operations. If we are unsuccessful in commercializing our products and raising capital, we may need to reduce activities, curtail or cease operations.
Equity Financing
On February 21, 2020, we entered into an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with Laidlaw & Company (UK) Ltd. (the “Underwriter”), relating to an underwritten public offering of 2,500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, at the public offering price of $4.00 per share. At closing on February 25, 2020, the Company received net proceeds of approximately $9,100,000, after deducting the underwriting discount and other offering expenses of approximately $100,000.
Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, we issued to the Underwriter or its designees warrants to purchase up to an aggregate 125,000 shares of common stock. The underwriter warrants are exercisable immediately and on or prior to February 21, 2025, at a price per share equal to $4.80 and are exercisable on a “cashless” basis.
On May 20, 2020, ViralClear and the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with certain accredited investors, pursuant to which ViralClear agreed to sell an aggregate of 1,068,550 shares of ViralClear’s common stock, at $10.00 per share, for an aggregate consideration of $10,592,075, net of expenses of $93,425. This private placement closed on May 20, 2020.
On June 24, 2020, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with several institutional and accredited investors, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell in a registered direct offering an aggregate of 2,187,500 shares of common stock of the Company at an offering price of $8.00 per share, for gross proceeds of approximately $17.5 million before the deduction of fees and offering expenses. The net proceeds to the Company from the offering, after deducting fees and expenses, were approximately $16.16 million. The offering closed on June 26, 2020.
At-the-Market Offering
On August 28, 2020, we entered into an Open Market Sale Agreement (the “Sales Agreement”) with Jefferies LLC to act as our sales agent and/or principal (“Jefferies” or the “Agent”), with respect to the issuance and sale of up to $45,000,000 of our shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Shares”), from time to time in an at-the-market offering (the “Offering”).
Upon delivery of a placement notice, Jefferies may sell the Shares by any method permitted by law deemed to be an “at the market offering” as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We may sell the Shares in amounts and at times to be determined by us from time to time subject to the terms and conditions of the Sales Agreement, but we have no obligation to sell any of the Shares under the Sales Agreement. We or Jefferies may suspend or terminate the offering of Shares upon notice to the other party and subject to other conditions. Jefferies will act as sales agent on a commercially reasonable efforts basis consistent with its normal trading and sales practices and applicable state and federal law, rules and regulations and the rules of Nasdaq.
We will pay Agent a commission equal to 3.0% of the gross proceeds from the sale of the Shares pursuant to the Sales Agreement. The Company has also agreed to provide Jefferies with customary indemnification and contribution rights.
The offering of Shares pursuant to the Sales Agreement will terminate upon the earlier of (i) the sale of all Shares subject to the Sales Agreement or (ii) termination of the Sales Agreement in accordance with its terms.
From August 24, 2020 through December 28, 2020, we sold an aggregate of 424,357 shares of our common stock under the Sales Agreement for proceeds of $2,228,000, net of expenses of $222,397 inclusive of initial offering expenses of $146,704.
From January 1, 2021 to March 12, 2021 we sold an aggregate of 251,720 shares of our common stock under the Sales Agreement for proceeds of $1,300,285, net of expenses of $40,215. As of March, 12, 2021, we had capacity to issue up to $41,191,020 million of common stock under the Sales Agreement.
The Shares are sold and issued pursuant the Company’s shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-230448), which was previously declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and a related prospectus.
Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2019
As of December 31, 2020, we had a working capital of $24,229,382, comprised of cash of $28,268,029, inventory of $768,319 and prepaid expenses of $300,080, which was offset by $4,722,138 of accounts payable and accrued expenses, accrued dividends on preferred stock issuances of $72,217 and short term lease liabilities of $312,691. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by financing activities totaled $42,845,395, comprised of proceeds from the sale of our common stock of $25,214,311, sale of subsidiary stock to non-controlling interests of $10,592,075, proceeds from At-the-market sale of our common stock of $2,228,000 and proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants of $4,811,009. In the comparable period in 2019, $10,007,188 was raised through the sale of our common stock, sale of subsidiary stock to non-controlling interests of $5,011,309 and proceeds of $8,408,841 from the exercise of options and warrants. At December 31, 2020, we had cash of $28,268,029 compared to $12,108,582 at December 31, 2019. Our cash is held in bank deposit accounts. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had no convertible debentures outstanding.
Cash used in operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $26,599,228 and $15,482,982, respectively, which represent cash outlays for research and development and general and administrative expenses in such periods. Increase in cash outlays principally resulted from increased research and development and general and administrative expenses due to the continued development of our operations.
Cash used in investing activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was $86,720, compared to $285,934 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we purchased office furniture and computer equipment. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, we incurred $111,591 in patent and trademark costs and $177,092 purchases of office furniture and computer equipment, net with proceeds from disposal of equipment of $2,749.
Our Series C Preferred Stock contains triggering events which would, among other things, require redemption (i) in cash, at the greater of (a) 120% of the stated value of $1,000 or (b) the product of (I) the variable weighted average price of our common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the date of the triggering event and (II) the stated value divided by the then conversion price or (ii) in shares of our common stock, equal to a number of shares equal to the amount set forth in (i) above divided by 75%. As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate stated value of our Series C Preferred Stock was $105,000. The triggering events include our being subject to a judgment of greater than $100,000 or our initiation of bankruptcy proceedings. If any of the triggering events contained in our Series C Preferred Stock occur, the holders of our Series C Preferred Stock may demand redemption, an obligation we may not have the ability to meet at the time of such demand. We will be required to pay interest on any amounts remaining unpaid after the required redemption of our Series C Preferred Stock, at a rate equal to the lesser of 18% per annum or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.
We expect to incur losses from operations for the near future. We expect to incur increasing marketing and commercialization expenses related to our PURE EP system in addition to additional research and development costs, including expenses related to clinical trials. We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we expand our business development, add infrastructure and incur additional costs related to be a public company, including incremental audit fees, investor relations programs and increased professional services.
Our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors, including the progress of our research and development of product candidates, the timing and outcome of regulatory approvals, the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights, the status of competitive products, the availability of financing and our success in developing markets for our product candidates. We believe our existing cash will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital equipment requirements for the 14 months.
Future financing may include the issuance of equity or debt securities, obtaining credit facilities, or other financing mechanisms. Even if we are able to raise the funds required, it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and expenses or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek alternative financing. Furthermore, if we issue additional equity or debt securities, existing holders of our securities may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our securities.
If additional financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs, reduce our commercialization efforts or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
There were various updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to a have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
