The Company's financial statements have been presented on the basis that it will continue as a going concern. The Company has not generated revenues from construction related operations to date. The Company has an Accumulated deficit of $10,045,978 as of December 31, 2020 which raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
To the extent that the Company's capital resources are not adequate to meet current and planned operating requirements, the Company will use additional funds through equity and debt financing, collaborative or other arrangements with corporate partners, licensees or others, and from other sources, which may have the effect of diluting the holdings of existing shareholders. The Company has subsequent current arrangements with respect to, or sources of, such additional financing and the Company does not anticipate that existing shareholders will be required to provide any portion of the Company's future financing requirements.
No assurance can be given that additional financing will be available when needed or that such financing will be available on terms Acceptable to the Company. If adequate funds are not available, the Company may be required to delay or terminate expenditures for certain of its programs that it would otherwise seek to develop and commercialize. This would have a material adverse effect on the Company and raise doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Financing
Auscrete Corporation, a Wyoming public company was incorporated on December 31, 2009 and first became effective for an IPO with the SEC on August 16, 2012. It was established to finance an expansion of a current pilot facility operated by the founders in Rufus, OR. The IPO was not commenced and expired in February 2014. The company became Effective with a Registration Statement in December 2014 registering shareholder held shares for sale enabling re-application to FINRA for listing on the
OTCPink. The company engaged the services of a registered broker-dealer and market maker, Glendale Securities, LLC, who subsequently applied with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).
Use of Funds Raised Through Financing
Initial Stage One targeted funding was $1.2 million and the company, during 2018, had purchased 5 acres of land on the Goldendale Industrial Estate. Initially it cost $102,000, including fees, to purchase the land.
In 2019 a change in Company strategy brought Management to make the decision to sell back its land investment and utilize the funds to establish an operational plant within a newly leased facility also in the Goldendale Washington area.
During the fiscal year both land sale funds and additional capital raised were used for major production equipment purchases and to fabricate startup provisions within a newly plant facility.
This Corporate profit orientated decision has provided greater advantageous results in assuring faster revenue generation.
The balance was used for working capital and expenses including wages, marketing and other working capital and reserves.
Marketing
Principal marketing efforts are initially aimed at leveraging specific contacts and relationships that have developed over the last 12 years since the inception of the founders’ pilot plant. The company has interviewed and chosen an experienced sales person who will have the luxury of dealing with existing contacts as well as the multitude of inquiries received every week.
Auscrete's product is also extremely suitable for the construction of commercial and industrial structures. Company marketing will also explore the commercial world for applications and it is believed that such construction will become a large part of the company's future direction.
Financial Projections
The typical structure will be a home in the 1,100 - 3,000 sq. ft. range that will sell to the contractor or developer for around $80K-$200K with the average being over $150,000. Obviously, the company will look to increase output to meet future demands and expects to do this through internal financing.
Off-balance Sheet Arrangement
We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.
