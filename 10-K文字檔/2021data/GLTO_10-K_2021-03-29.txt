Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing therapeutics that are designed to target the biological processes that lie at the heart of fibrosis and impact a broad range of fibrotic and related diseases, including cancer. Our initial focus is on the development of small-molecule inhibitors of galectin-3 and lysyl oxidase-like 2, or LOXL2, which play key roles in regulating fibrosis. We believe our product candidates are distinct from the current generation of antifibrotic agents and have the potential to significantly improve patients’ clinical outcomes and enhance their quality of life.
Our lead product candidate is in Phase 2b clinical development and our other product candidates and research initiatives are in early stages of clinical and preclinical development. Our ability to generate revenue from product sales sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. Our operations to date have been financed primarily from our initial public offering, or IPO, the issuance of convertible preferred shares and convertible notes. Since inception, we have had significant operating losses. Our net loss was $34.8million and $36.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $104.4 million and $163.6 million in cash and cash equivalents.
Galecto, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in October 2019. Shares in Galecto Biotech AB, a Swedish operating company, were exchanged at a one-to-one ratio for shares in Galecto, Inc. in a common control/tax-free reorganization. On December 31, 2019, Galecto, Inc. and PharmAkea Inc., or PharmAkea, consummated the purchase agreement, whereby Galecto, Inc. acquired PharmAkea in principally an all-stock transaction. As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries were PharmAkea, Galecto Securities Corporation and Galecto Biotech AB. Galecto ApS, a Danish operating company, was Galecto Biotech AB’s wholly owned subsidiary. The consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, convertible preferred shares and stockholders’ deficit and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020 are that of Galecto, Inc. and for the year ended December 31, 2019 are that of Galecto Biotech AB.
Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay these expenses, as reflected in the change in our accounts payable and accrued expenses. We expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect our research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, and capital expenditures will continue to increase. In particular, we expect our expenses to increase as we continue our development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates, as well as hire additional personnel, pay fees to outside consultants, lawyers and accountants, and incur other increased costs associated with being a public company. In addition, if and when we seek and obtain regulatory approval to commercialize any product candidate, we will also incur increased expenses in connection with commercialization and marketing of any such product. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on the timing of our clinical trials and our expenditures on other research and development activities.
Based upon our current operating plan, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents of $163.6 million as of December 31, 2020, will be sufficient to continue funding our development activities into 2024. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect. To finance our operations beyond that point we will need to raise additional capital, which cannot be assured.
To date, we have not had any products approved for sale and, therefore, have not generated any product revenue. We do not expect to generate any revenues from product sales unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our product candidates. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. As a result, until such time, if ever, that we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through equity offerings, debt financings or other capital sources, including collaborations, licenses or similar arrangements. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed or on favorable terms, if at all. Any failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and on our ability to pursue our business plans and strategies, including our research and development activities. If we are unable to raise capital, we will need to delay, reduce or terminate planned activities to reduce costs.
The COVID-19 pandemic, which began in December 2019 and has spread worldwide, has caused many governments to implement measures to slow the spread of the outbreak through quarantines, travel restrictions, heightened border scrutiny and other measures. The outbreak and government measures taken in response have also had a significant impact, both directly and indirectly, on businesses and commerce, as worker shortages have occurred; supply chains have been disrupted; facilities and production have been suspended; and demand for certain goods and services, such as medical services and supplies, has spiked, while demand for other goods and services, such as travel, has fallen. The future progression of the outbreak and its effects on our business and operations are uncertain.
In response to the impact of COVID-19, we have implemented certain measures intended to help us manage its impact and position ourselves to resume operations quickly and efficiently once these restrictions are lifted, such as executing a work-from-home strategy for administrative functions and operations.
Despite our implementation of such measures, the actual and perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is changing daily, and its ultimate effect on us cannot be predicted. To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused delays in certain of our studies, including (i) recruitment of our ongoing Phase 2b trial of GB0139 in IPF patients, which has resulted in certain trial protocol amendments and increased costs and (ii) initiation of our planned clinical trials of GB1211 and GB2064. We cannot assure you that we will not experience additional negative impacts associated with COVID-19, which could be significant. The COVID-19 pandemic may negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations by decreasing or delaying the enrollment of patients in our clinical trials or otherwise causing interruptions or delays in our programs and services. See “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Managing Our Business and Operations-The global pandemic of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, has, and may continue to, adversely impact our business, including our preclinical studies and clinical trials” for more information regarding the potential impact of COVID-19 on our business and operations.
Components of Operating Results
Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses since inception have consisted primarily of research and development expenses and general and administrative costs.
Research and Development
Our research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates and our drug discovery efforts, which include:
•
personnel costs, which include salaries, benefits and equity-based compensation expense;
•
expenses incurred under agreements with consultants, and third-party contract organizations that conduct research and development activities on our behalf;
•
costs related to sponsored research service agreements;
•
costs related to production of preclinical and clinical materials, including fees paid to contract manufacturers;
•
laboratory and vendor expenses related to the execution of preclinical studies and planned clinical trials;
•
laboratory supplies and equipment used for internal research and development activities; and
•
acquired in-process research and development programs.
We expense all research and development costs in the periods in which they are incurred, including for acquired in-process research and development. Costs for certain research and development activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information and data provided to us by our vendors and third-party service providers.
From time to time, we obtain grants from public and private funds for our research and development projects. The grant income for a given period is recognized as a cost reimbursement and is typically based on the time and the costs that we have spent on the specific project during that period.
We have historically met the requirements to receive a tax credit in Denmark of up to $0.9 million and $0.8 million per year in both years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, for losses resulting from research and development costs of up to $4.1 million and $3.8 million per year in the year-ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The tax credit is reported as a reduction to research and development expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
Our direct research and development expenses are not currently tracked on a program-by-program basis. We use our personnel and infrastructure resources across multiple research and development programs directed toward identifying and developing product candidates. The majority of our clinical spending in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was on GB0139. In the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we advanced our GB1211 program from pre-clinical through early clinical development. We acquired our GB2064 program from PharmAkea on December 31, 2019.
We expect our research and development expenses to increase substantially for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in research and development activities related to developing our product candidates, including investments in conducting clinical trials, manufacturing and otherwise advancing our programs. The process of conducting the necessary clinical research to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming, and the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and the current stage of development of our product candidates and programs, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated costs necessary to complete the remainder of the development of our product candidates or programs. We are also unable to predict if, when, or to what extent we will obtain approval and generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of our product candidates. The duration, costs and timing of preclinical studies and clinical trials and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, including:
•
successful completion of preclinical studies and initiation of clinical trials for GB0139, our other current product candidates and any future product candidates;
•
successful enrollment and completion of our Phase 2b clinical trial for GB0139, our planned clinical trials for GB2064 and GB1211, and any clinical trials for future product candidates;
•
data from our clinical programs that support an acceptable risk-benefit profile of our product candidates in the intended patient populations;
•
acceptance by the FDA, regulatory authorities in Europe, Health Canada or other regulatory agencies of the IND applications, clinical trial applications and/or other regulatory filings for GB0139, our other current product candidates and any future product candidates;
•
expansion and maintenance of a workforce of experienced scientists and others to continue to develop our product candidates;
•
successful application for and receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;
•
obtainment and maintenance of intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates;
•
arrangements with third-party manufacturers for, or establishment of, commercial manufacturing capabilities;
•
establishment of sales, marketing and distribution capabilities and successful launch of commercial sales of our products, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;
•
acceptance of our products, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;
•
effective competition with other therapies;
•
obtainment and maintenance of coverage, adequate pricing and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, including government payors;
•
maintenance, enforcement, defense and protection of our rights in our intellectual property portfolio;
•
avoidance of infringement, misappropriation or other violations with respect to others’ intellectual property or proprietary rights; and
•
maintenance of a continued acceptable safety profile of our products following receipt of any marketing approvals.
We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. We may obtain unexpected results from our preclinical studies and clinical trials. We may elect to discontinue, delay or modify clinical trials of some product candidates or focus on others. A change in the outcome of any of these factors could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of our current and future preclinical and clinical product candidates. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate will be
required for the completion of clinical development, or if we experience significant delays in execution of or enrollment in any of our preclinical studies or clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of preclinical and clinical development.
Research and development activities account for a significant portion of our operating expenses. We expect our research and development expenses to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue to implement our business strategy, which includes advancing GB0139 through clinical development and other product candidates further into clinical development, expanding our research and development efforts, including hiring additional personnel to support our research and development efforts, and seeking regulatory approvals for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials. In addition, product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally incur higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. As a result, we expect our research and development expenses to increase as our product candidates advance into later stages of clinical development. However, we do not believe that it is possible at this time to accurately project total program-specific expenses through commercialization. There are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any of our product candidates, including future trial design and various regulatory requirements, many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time based on our stage of development.
General and Administrative Expenses
Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, depreciation expense and other expenses for outside professional services, including legal, human resources, audit and accounting services and facility-related fees not otherwise included in research and development expenses. Personnel costs consist of salaries, benefits and equity-based compensation expense, for our personnel in executive, finance and accounting, business operations and other administrative functions. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase over the next several years to support our continued research and development activities, manufacturing activities, increased costs of expanding our operations and operating as a public company. These increases will likely include increases related to the hiring of additional personnel and legal, regulatory and other fees and services associated with maintaining compliance with Nasdaq listing rules and SEC requirements, director and officer insurance premiums and investor relations costs associated with being a public company.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Our other income (expense), net is comprised of:
•
Foreign exchange: The functional currency of our subsidiaries in Denmark and Sweden is the Euro. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the Euro result in exchange gains and losses that are recorded in our statements of operations.
•
Fair value adjustment on derivative and tranche obligations: We have recorded tranche obligations with respect to
milestone closings of our sale and issuance of Series C-2 preferred stock in October 2018. The milestone closings of the Series C preferred stock were committed to in December 2019 with the Series C preferred stock and proceeds received in January 2020.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
The following sets forth our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Research and development expenses
Research and development expenses were comprised of:
Research and development expenses were $24.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $19.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $4.9 million was primarily related to an increase in chemistry, manufacturing and control, or CMC activities of $5.0 million and clinical consulting expenses of $2.0 million related to our Phase 2b study of GB0139 and preparations for a Phase 2a study of GB1211, as well as an increase in personnel costs of $1.6 million. The increase was partially offset by lower clinical expenses of $3.7 million primarily due to fewer pre-clinical activities in 2020 as compared to 2019, as well as clinical trial start-up costs incurred in 2019 that were not present in 2020.
Purchased in-process research and development expense
Purchased in-process research and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 relates to our GB2064 program, which we acquired from PharmAkea on December 31, 2019. There were no purchased in-process research and development expenses incurred for the year-ended December 31, 2020.
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses were $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $6.6 million was primarily related to an increase in costs indirectly related to our IPO such as consultant costs of $1.6 million and accounting fees of $2.0 million and an increase in personnel costs of $1.5 million as we build our in-house staff, public company costs of $0.6 million and legal and other fees of $0.9 million.
Other income (expense), net
Other income (expense), net for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were a net expense of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a net income of $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease of $3.7 million was due to the following:
•
Net foreign exchange loss of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to a net foreign exchange gain of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
•
We had no fair value adjustments on our tranche obligations in the year ended December 31, 2020. Fair value adjustments on our tranche obligations relating to the sale of our Series C-2 preferred stock in October 2018 were a $1.9 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources of Liquidity
Our operations to date have been financed primarily through our recent IPO, the issuance of convertible preferred shares and convertible notes. On November 2, 2020, we completed an IPO of our common stock and issued and sold 6,342,207 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $15.00 per share, including 675,540 shares of common stock sold pursuant to the underwriters’ exercise of their option to purchase additional shares of common stock, resulting in net proceeds of $86.3 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. Since inception, we have had significant operating losses. Our net loss was $34.8 million and $36.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $104.4 million and $163.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. Our primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses, which consist primarily of research and development expenditures, and to a lesser extent, general and administrative expenditures. Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay these expenses, as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses.
Cash Flows
The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:
Net Cash Used in Operating Activities
Cash used in operating activities of $38.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 was attributable to our net loss of $34.8 million together with a net decrease of $4.6 million in our working capital, offset by an increase of $0.2 million in non-cash amortization of right of use lease asset and accretion of the lease liability and $1.0 million in non-cash stock-based compensation.
Cash used in operating activities of $19.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 was attributable to our net loss of $36.5 million together with non-cash items of $1.8 million principally with respect to fair value adjustments on our tranche obligations, offset by purchased in-process research and development of $16.8 million and a net increase of $2.2 million in our working capital.
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities
We had no cash used in or provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2019 are comprised of transaction costs with respect to our acquisition of PharmAkea less PharmAkea’s book balance of cash on the date of acquisition.
Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities
Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $187.4 million comprised of net proceeds of $39.7 million from the issuance of our Series C convertible preferred shares in January 2020, net proceeds $61.4 million from the issuance of Series D convertible preferred stock in September 2020 and net proceeds of $86.3 million from our IPO in November 2020.
We had no cash used in or provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Funding Requirements
Any product candidates we may develop may never achieve commercialization and we anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We expect that our research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, and capital expenditures will continue to increase. As a result, until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings or other capital sources, including potentially collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements. Our primary uses of capital are, and we expect will continue to be, compensation and related expenses; costs related to third-party clinical research, manufacturing and development services; costs relating to the build-out of our headquarters and other offices, our laboratories and our manufacturing facility; license payments or milestone obligations that may arise; laboratory expenses and costs for related supplies; clinical costs; manufacturing costs; legal and other regulatory expenses and general overhead costs.
Based upon our current operating plan, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents of $163.6 million as of December 31, 2020 will be sufficient to continue funding our development activities into 2024. To finance our operations beyond that point we will need to raise additional capital, which cannot be assured. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. We will continue to require additional financing to advance our current product candidates through clinical development, to develop, acquire or in-license other potential product candidates and to fund operations for the foreseeable future. We will continue to seek funds through equity offerings, debt financings or other capital sources, including potentially collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. If we do raise additional capital through public or private equity offerings, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders, will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our stockholders’ rights. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Any failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and on our ability to pursue our business plans and strategies. If we are unable to raise capital, we will need to delay, reduce or terminate planned activities to reduce costs.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our operating capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:
•
the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic;
•
the progress, costs and results of our ongoing Phase 2b clinical trial of GB0139 and our planned trials for our other product candidates;
•
the scope, progress, results and costs of discovery research, preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for our product candidates, including our ongoing Phase 2b clinical trial of GB0139;
•
the number of, and development requirements for, other product candidates that we pursue;
•
the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;
•
our ability to enter into contract manufacturing arrangements for supply of active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and manufacture of our product candidates and the terms of such arrangements;
•
our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such arrangements;
•
the payment or receipt of milestones and receipt of other collaboration-based revenues, if any;
•
the costs and timing of any future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we may receive marketing approval;
•
the amount and timing of revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;
•
the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property and proprietary rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims;
•
the extent to which we acquire or in-license other products, product candidates, technologies or data referencing rights;
•
the ability to receive additional non-dilutive funding, including grants from organizations and foundations; and
•
the costs of operating as a public company.
Further, our operating plans may change, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements for clinical trials and other research and development activities. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated product development programs.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the related disclosures of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management’s judgments and estimates.
Research and Development Costs
We incur substantial expenses associated with clinical trials. Accounting for clinical trials relating to activities performed by CROs, CMOs and other external vendors requires management to exercise significant estimates in regard to the timing and accounting for these expenses. We estimate costs of research and development activities conducted by service providers, which include, the conduct of sponsored research, preclinical studies and contract manufacturing activities. The diverse nature of services being provided under CRO and other arrangements, the different compensation arrangements that exist for each type of service and the lack of timely information related to certain clinical activities complicates the estimation of accruals for services rendered by CROs, CMOs and other vendors in connection with clinical trials. We record the estimated costs of research and development activities based upon the estimated amount of services provided but not yet invoiced and include these costs in the accrued and other current liabilities or prepaid expenses on the balance sheets and within research and development expense on the consolidated statements of operations. In estimating the duration of a clinical study, we evaluate the start-up, treatment and wrap-up periods, compensation arrangements and services rendered attributable to each clinical trial and fluctuations are regularly tested against payment plans and trial completion assumptions.
We estimate these costs based on factors such as estimates of the work completed and budget provided and in accordance with agreements established with our collaboration partners and third-party service providers. We make significant judgments and estimates in determining the accrued liabilities and prepaid expense balances in each reporting period. As actual costs become known, we adjust our accrued liabilities or prepaid expenses. We have not experienced any material differences between accrued costs and actual costs incurred since our inception.
Our expenses related to clinical trials are based on estimates of patient enrollment and related expenses at clinical investigator sites as well as estimates for the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and CROs that may be used to conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf. We generally accrue expenses related to clinical trials based on contracted amounts applied to the level of patient enrollment and activity. If timelines or contracts are
modified based upon changes in the clinical trial protocol or scope of work to be performed, we modify our estimates of accrued expenses accordingly on a prospective basis.
We acquired the right to develop and commercialize PharmAkea’s product candidate PAT-1251, which we now refer to as GB2064. GB2064 is in clinical development and has not achieved regulatory approval for marketing and absent obtaining such approval, has no alternative future use. As such the costs of acquiring GB2064 are immediately expensed as purchased in-process research and development costs in our consolidated statements of operations.
Equity-based Compensation
We have issued equity-based compensation awards through the granting of stock options, which generally vest over a four-year period. We account for equity-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, or ASC 718. In accordance with ASC 718, compensation cost is measured at estimated fair value and is included as compensation expense over the vesting period during which service is provided in exchange for the award.
We use a Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine fair value of our stock options. The Black-Scholes option pricing model includes various assumptions, including the fair value of common shares, expected life of stock options, the expected volatility and the expected risk-free interest rate. These assumptions reflect our best estimates, but they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside our control. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, equity-based compensation cost could have been materially impacted. Furthermore, if we use different assumptions for future grants, share-based compensation cost could be materially impacted in future periods.
The fair value of our awards in the year ended December 31, 2020 has been estimated using Black-Scholes based on the following assumptions: term of 5.8 years; volatility of 90.1%; risk-free rate of 0.4%; and no expectation of dividends. We did not grant any stock options in the year ended December 31, 2019.
We will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions utilized for our equity-based compensation expense calculations on a prospective basis. In addition to the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model, the amount of equity-based compensation expense we recognize in our consolidated financial statements includes stock option forfeitures as they occurred. We recognize forfeitures as they occur, and the compensation expense is reversed in the period that the forfeiture occurs.
Prior to our IPO, our board of directors, with input from management, determined the estimated fair value of our common shares as of the date of each incentive share grant considering our then-most recently available third-party valuation of common shares. Valuations are updated when facts and circumstances indicate that the most recent valuation is no longer valid, such as changes in the stage of our development efforts, various exit strategies and their timing, and other scientific developments that could be related to our valuation, or, at a minimum, annually. Third-party valuations were performed in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Accounting and Valuation Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation.
For grants of options we made in June 2020, we employed a market approach and utilized the market-adjusted back-solve method for inferring the equity value predicated on the closing of the final tranche of our Series C convertible preferred shares in January 2020, and we allocated value among different classes of equity securities under a Black-Scholes option pricing methodology, or OPM. This method was selected as we concluded that the recent financing transaction was an arm’s-length transaction. We then applied an adjustment for market performance of the composite of multiple biotechnology indexes which was 0.4% from the period of January 1, 2020 through April 30, 2020. Furthermore, as of the valuation date the development timelines were long (the current Phase 2b clinical trial was expected to last up to 18 additional months) and future liquidity events were difficult to forecast. Application of the OPM back-solve method involves making assumptions for the expected time to liquidity, volatility and risk-free rate and then solving for the value of equity such that the value for the most recent financing equals the amount paid. We assumed a 1.7-year estimated term, 80% volatility rate and a risk-free rate of 0.19%. We then reflected a discount for lack of marketability of 33% derived from our then-current estimates of the time to a liquidity event. With the aid of the April 30, 2020 third-party valuation and after consideration of macroeconomic and company-specific developments during the first half of 2020, our board of directors, with input from management, determined the fair market value of our common shares to be $1.95 per share for the options granted on June 24, 2020.
For grants of options we made in October 2020, we employed a hybrid approach as of September 25, 2020 estimating the probability-weighted value across multiple scenarios including with the back-solve method for inferring the equity value predicated on the closing of the Company’s Series D preferred share transaction (recent transaction method) being weighted at 30% and the initial public offering, or IPO, scenario being weighted at 70%. In the recent transaction method, the Company’s total enterprise value was estimated using the OPM back-solve method as the Company had closed its Series D preferred share financing in September 2020 for gross proceeds of $64.2 million. We assumed a 1.5-year expected term, 89% volatility rate and a
risk-free rate of 0.1 %. We then reflected a discount for lack of marketability of 30% derived from our then-current estimates of the time to a liquidity event. For the IPO scenario, the future enterprise value at an expected IPO date was discounted to present value and allocated to each outstanding share class, on a fully diluted basis assuming all existing shareholders convert into common shares. The enterprise value was estimated using the guideline IPO transactions method and used an enterprise value between the 25th percentile and median of the 24 recent IPO transactions completed by issuers in a similar stage of development as the Company. The valuation estimated the time to a liquidity event at 0.27 years based on the Company’s plans and progress in pursuing an IPO, including the fact that it had confidentially submitted a draft registration statement on Form S-1. A discount rate of 25% was applied to present value the future IPO share price and a discount for lack of marketability of 5% was also applied. With the aid of a September 25, 2020 third-party valuation and consideration of the progress towards and IPO, our board of directors, with input from management, determined the fair market value of our common shares to be $7.70 per share for the options granted on October 7, 2020.
The estimates of fair value of our common shares are highly complex and subjective. There are significant judgments and estimates inherent in the determination of the fair value of our common shares. These judgments and estimates include assumptions regarding our future operating performance, the time to completing a liquidity event, the related valuations associated with these events, and the determinations of the appropriate valuation methods at each valuation date. The assumptions underlying these valuations represent our best estimates, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. If we had made different assumptions, our equity-based compensation expense, net loss and net loss per share applicable to common shareholders could have been materially different.
Income Taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating losses and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted statutory tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the jurisdictions and years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
Based on the level of historical operating results and projections for the taxable income for the future, we have determined that it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets will not be realized. Accordingly, we have recorded a full valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets.
We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if (based on the technical merits of the position) it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on examination by the tax authority. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We have not recorded any uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2020 or 2019. We do not believe there will be any material changes in its unrecognized tax positions over the next 12 months. We have not incurred any interest or penalties. In the event we are assessed interest or penalties at some point in the future, they will be classified in the financial statements as a component of income tax expense.
We operate in multiple jurisdictions, both within and outside the United States, and may be subject to audits from various tax authorities. Management’s judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, liabilities for uncertain tax positions, and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. We will monitor the extent to which our deferred tax assets may be realized and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
Refer to Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020:
We enter into contracts in the normal course of business with third-party service providers for clinical trials, preclinical research studies and testing, manufacturing and other services and products for operating purposes. We have not included our payment obligations under these contracts in the table, as these contracts generally provide for termination upon notice, and therefore, we believe that our non-cancelable obligations under these agreements are not material and we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of if and when they will occur. We could also enter into additional research, manufacturing, supplier and other agreements in the future, which may require up-front payments and even long-term commitments of cash.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
During the periods presented, we did not have, nor do we currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined under SEC rules.
Emerging Growth Company Status
As an EGC under the JOBS Act, we may delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. Other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements under the JOBS Act for EGCs include presentation of only two years of audited consolidated financial statements in a registration statement for an IPO, an exemption from the requirement to provide an auditor’s report on internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, an exemption from any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation, and less extensive disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements.
In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an EGC can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This provision allows an EGC to delay the adoption of some accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, our consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.
We may remain classified as an EGC until the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, although if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of June 30 of any year before that time, or if we have annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more in any fiscal year, we would cease to be an EGC as of December 31 of the applicable year. We also would cease to be an EGC if we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.
