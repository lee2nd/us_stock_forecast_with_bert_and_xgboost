Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto presented elsewhere herein. The discussion of results should not be construed to imply any conclusion that such results will necessarily continue in the future.
Critical Accounting Policies
The Company’s significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements that were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In preparing the Company’s financial statements, the Company made estimates and judgments that affect the results of its operations and the value of assets and liabilities the Company reports. The Company’s actual results may differ from these estimates.
Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the related disclosure. The Company believes that the following summarizes critical accounting policies that require significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements:
Revenue Recognition
Revenue from the Company’s sales continue to generally be recognized either when products are shipped (i.e., point in time) or under certain long-term government contracts, as the Company transfers control of the product or service to its customers (i.e., over time), which approximates the previously used percentage-of-completion method of accounting.
Inventory
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. Cost of manufactured goods includes material, labor and overhead.
The Company records a reserve for slow moving inventory as a charge against earnings for all products identified as surplus, slow moving, or discontinued. Excess work-in-process costs are charged against earnings whenever estimated costs-of-completion exceed unbilled revenues.
Stock-based compensation
Stock based compensation expense is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of restricted stock units granted is estimated based on the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant. The fair value of these awards, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, is amortized over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting period.
Income Taxes
Deferred income taxes are provided on the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities recorded for income tax and financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.
The Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of an uncertain tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position. For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority.
The Company classifies interest and penalties related to income taxes as income tax expense in its Consolidated Financial Statements.
Leases
The Company entered into an amendment and extension of its building lease on July 8, 2019, retroactive to June 1, 2019. Under the guidance of ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), the Company must determine if such an arrangement contains a lease and whether that lease meets the classification criteria of a finance or operating lease at inception of the arrangement. The Company determined that this lease is an operating lease and presented as a right-of-use lease asset, short term lease liability and long-term lease liability on the consolidated balance sheet. These assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate.
Results of Operations
The following table sets forth, for the past two years, the percentage relationship of statement of operations categories to total revenues.
Revenues
Sales were $9.0 million in 2020, a decrease of 10.0% or $1.0 million, compared to $10.0 million in 2019. Lower bookings in 2019 combined with the effects of mandatory shutdowns, customer pushouts, and reduced demand led to the decrease in sales in 2020.
Sales to the defense and aerospace market in 2020 increased 5.6%, or $0.2 million to $3.9 million from $3.7 million in 2019. Sales in the defense and aerospace market represented 43.5% and 37.0% of total sales in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in military and defense spending resulted in stronger demand for our products in 2020.
Sales in the process control and metrology market decreased $0.9 million, or 20.6% to $3.3 million in 2020 from $4.2 million in 2019. Sales in the process control and metrology represented 36.9% and 41.9% of total sales in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Decreased demand for critical components in the semiconductor capital equipment market negatively impacted sales in 2020 and 2019.
The Company serves as an OEM supplier of standard and custom optical components and laser accessories within the non-military laser industry. Sales to this and related markets were $0.7 million and $1.2 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Overall, sales of laser devices and related products represented 7.4% and 12.1% of revenues in 2020 and 2019, respectively, a decrease of $0.5 million or 45.0%. The decrease in 2020 was due to the cancelation of orders from one international customer.
Sales to customers within the Scientific / R&D market increased in 2020 to $1.1 million from $0.9 million in 2019. The 22.3% increase is mainly due to increased orders from a national lab and billings from an SBIR contract awarded in the second quarter of 2020. As a percentage of total sales, this market represented 12.2% and 9.0% of sales in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Bookings
The Company booked new orders totaling approximately $9.8 million in 2020. The Company’s backlog as of December 31, 2020, was $5.9 million, compared to $5.1 million as of December 31, 2019.
Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit Margin
Cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales was 80.1% for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
The cost of goods sold in 2020 was $7.2 million, compared to $8.0 million in 2019, a decrease of $0.8 million, mainly attributable to the decrease in sales, coupled with a change in sales mix.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) were $2.5 million in 2020, compared to $2.6 million in 2019, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 2.9%. The decrease is attributable a significant reduction in sales and marketing related expenses, coupled with reduced recruiting and temporary employee costs, offset by an increase in the reserve for doubtful accounts and an increase in insurance costs. The reduction in sales and marketing related expenses is directly related to the protocols and restrictions on travel implemented by the Company as a result of government mandates.
As a percentage of sales, SG&A was 28.2% of sales in 2020 compared to 26.1% of sales in 2019, primarily due to lower sales in 2020.
Operating Income (Loss)
The Company had an operating loss of $0.7 million in 2020, compared to a net operating loss of $0.6 million in 2019.
Other Income and Expenses
Net interest expense was $0.2 million in each of 2020 and 2019.
Income Taxes
In 2020 and 2019, the Company did not record a current provision for either state tax or federal alternative minimum tax due to carry forward losses incurred in prior years for both income tax and financial reporting purposes.
Net Income (Loss)
As a result of the foregoing, the Company recorded a net loss of $0.9 million in 2020, compared to a net operating loss of $0.8 million in 2019.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company’s primary source of liquidity is cash and cash equivalents and on-going collection of our accounts receivable. The Company’s major uses of cash in the past three years have been for operating expenses, capital expenditures, and for repayment and servicing of outstanding debt and accrued interest.
As of December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, cash and cash equivalents were $1.1 million and $1.0 million, respectively.
On July 22, 2020, the maturity dates of a $1,500,000 Subordinated Convertible Promissory Note to Clarex Limited (“Clarex”) and a $1,000,000 Subordinated Convertible Promissory Note to an affiliate of Clarex were each extended to April 1, 2024, from April 1, 2021. The notes bear interest at 6%. Interest accrues yearly and is payable on maturity. Unpaid interest, along with principal, may be converted into securities of the Company as follows: the notes are convertible in the aggregate into 1,500,000 units and 1,000,000 units, respectively, with each unit consisting of one share of common stock and one warrant. Each warrant allows the holder to acquire 0.75 shares of common stock at a price of $1.35 per share. As part of the agreement to extend the maturity date of the notes, the expiration dates of the warrants were extended from April 1, 2022 to April 1, 2027.
The Company paid $0.2 million and $0.1 million for interest on the subordinated convertible promissory notes in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Accrued interest of $37,500 and $112,500 is included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
In total, the Company paid $0.2 million of interest in each of 2020 and 2019, on its outstanding debt, including interest paid on the subordinated convertible promissory notes.
In 2020 and 2019, the Company had capital expenditures of $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively. Capital spending in 2020 reflects the Company’s investment in information and technology system upgrades to address cybersecurity requirements and manufacturing equipment upgrades. The 2019 capital expenditures reflected our investments in our large diamond turning center, our in-process metrology capabilities, and the installation of a new redundant power system to support our crystal growth and IT infrastructure.
The Company had a net increase in cash of $0.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, compared to a net decrease in cash of $0.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019.
On May 6, 2020, the Company received loan proceeds of approximately $973,000, under the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”). The PPP was established as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) which was enacted March 27, 2020. The PPP Loan, which is in the form of a promissory note dated May 4, 2020, issued by the Company, matures on May 4, 2022, and bears interest at a rate of 1.0% per annum, payable monthly commencing on December 4, 2020. Subject to the other requirements and limitations on loan forgiveness, only loan proceeds spent on payroll and other eligible costs during the covered 24-week period will qualify for forgiveness. Forgiveness of the PPP Loan is subject to approval by the Small Business Administration.
On January 19, 2021, the Company received notification from the Small Business Association that the Company’s Forgiveness Application of the PPP Loan and accrued interest, totaling $980,000, was approved in full, and the Company had no further obligations related to the PPP Loan.

Impact of COVID-19 to Operations
We are conducting business to ensure the safety of our employees and associates actively and earnestly, following all best practice CDC guidelines for prevention in the workplace. We have applied social distancing in our operations and implemented a connected, remote workforce where practicable. Our operations are considered essential business under the Executive Orders of New Jersey’s Governor, and we cannot predict what further actions may be required by federal, state, or local authorities in the future. Nor can we predict what actions these mandates may have on our customers and suppliers. We continue to actively monitor the situation and may be required to take further actions that alter our business operations or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers and shareholders. It is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, including the effects on our financial results.
While the Company’s bookings were stronger in 2020 and sales in our aerospace and defense and scientific markets improved over last year, total sales overall were negatively impacted by business factors resulting from COVID-19 and governmental restrictions, including disruptions to our customers’ and suppliers’ operations. Our sales and marketing efforts were negatively impacted due to travel and other operational restrictions. The total impact of the global emergence of COVID-19 on our business and financial results are not completely known, and we cannot predict what impact it may have on our continuing operations and the effect to our financial results.
