Overview
Creative Medical Technologies Holdings, Inc. is a commercial stage biotechnology company focused on immunology, urology, orthopedics and neurology using adult stem cell treatments. We were incorporated on December 3, 1998, in the State of Nevada under the name Jolley Marketing, Inc. On May 18, 2016, we completed a reverse merger transaction under which Creative Medical Technologies, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“CMT”) became our wholly-owned subsidiary, and Creative Medical Health, Inc. (“CMH”), which was CMT’s sole stockholder prior to the merger, became our principal stockholder. In connection with this merger, we changed our name to Creative Medical Technologies Holdings, Inc. to reflect our current business.
CMT was originally created as the urological arm of CMH to monetize a patent and related intellectual property related to the treatment of erectile dysfunction (“ED”), which it acquired from CMH in February 2016. Subsequently, we have expanded our development and acquisition of intellectual property beyond urology to include therapeutic treatments utilizing amniotic stem cells, and the treatment of neurologic disorders and lower back pain using various types of stem cells through our AmnioStem LLC, StemSpine, LLC and ImmCelz, Inc. subsidiaries. However, AmnioStem LLC, StemSpine LLC, and ImmCelz, Inc. have not commenced commercial activities.
In 2020 we formed a new subsidiary, ImmCelz, Inc. This enables the advancement of our stem cell-based immunotherapy technology platform. We are in the process of developing treatments on multiple indications including, but not limited to patent filings for stroke, heart failure and liver failure In January of 2021 we filed an Innovative New Drug (IND) application with the FDA to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our ImmCelz™ technology in treating stroke.
We currently conduct substantially all of our commercial operations through CMT, which markets and sells our CaverStem® and FemCelz® disposable kits utilized by physicians to perform autologous procedures that treat erectile dysfunction and female sexual dysfunction, respectively. Our CaverStem® and FemCelz® kits are currently available through physicians in the United States and Europe.
During 2019, we continued commercializing the CaverStem® procedure, expanding the number of markets from 7 to 12. Following the successful roll-out of the CaverStem® procedure, in March 2019, we launched the FemCelz® procedure for Female Sexual Dysfunction. The procedure is similar to CaverStem® and is performed by the same physicians. We also completed a pilot study on the StemSpine® procedure which validated both safety and efficacy. Based on the study results, in November 2019, management elected to proceed with commercialization of the StemSpine® procedure.
During 2019, we issued $1,572,400 in convertible notes to accredited investors with net proceeds of $1,302,795. The notes matured from February through October of 2020 and bore interest rates ranging from 2% to 11%. In February 2019, we entered into three separate exchange agreements with holders of common stock purchase warrants issued by the Company in September 2018 and November 2018. Under each exchange agreement, the Company issued a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $100,000 to the warrant holder party to such exchange agreement in exchange for the cancellation of common stock purchase warrants held by such warrant holder, initially exercisable for an aggregate of 21,553 shares of the Company’s common stock.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred interest expense of $93,067 arising from the third-party notes.
During 2020, we continued commercializing the CaverStem® and FemCelz® procedures, expanding the number of markets from 12 to 14. We also formed a new subsidiary, ImmCelz, Inc. This enables the advancement of our stem cell-based immunotherapy technology platform. We are in the process of developing treatments on multiple indications including, but not limited to patent filings for stroke, heart failure, and liver failure.
During 2020, we issued $831,140 in convertible notes for which $710,920 of proceeds were received. The notes mature from February through December of 2021 and bear an interest rate of 8%.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred interest expense of $121,864 arising from the third-party notes.
Plan of Operations
We commenced marketing disposable stem cell concentration kits for the CaverStem® erectile dysfunction treatment in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the FemCelz® female sexual dysfunction treatment in March of 2019. The Company also announced the commercialization of the StemSpine procedure for lower back pain in the fourth quarter of 2019. In January 2021, we filed an Innovative New Drug (IND) application for the ImmCelz™ stem cell to treat stroke and neurodegenerative conditions. For the next 12 months our plan of operations is to continue to expand the market for the CaverStem®, FemCelz® and StemSpine® procedures, receive approval from the FDA for our IND application on ImmCelz™ and partner with leading researchers to initiate the ImmCelz™ stroke trial. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $98,000 cash on hand. With an estimated monthly cash burn rate of approximately $100,000 based on historic trends and anticipated future revenues and expenses, management anticipates sufficient cash on hand and committed funds to meet operating expenses and costs of the current operations through at least February 2021. Historically, we have met our cash flow requirements through the sale of equity securities or borrowed funds. We intend to fund our business through sales of disposable stem cell concentration kits along with continuing to seek investments to meet our cash flow requirements, including both operating expenses and the balance of funding required to fund our sales efforts. The securities offered by us to potential investors have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”), and may not be offered or sold in the U.S. absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. If we are unable to obtain further financing, we may seek alternative sources of funding or revise our business plan. We currently have no alternative sources for funding.
Results of Operations - For the Year Ended December 31, 2020, and for the Year Ended December 31, 2019
Gross Revenue. We generated $164,500 in gross revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 in comparison with $165,500 for the comparable period a year ago. The decrease of $1,000 or 0.6% is primarily due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, we were experiencing an upward trend is sales. However, from March through June 2020 and then September through December 2020, nearly all elective procedures were halted in the U.S. This resulted in a near cessation of Caverstem® and FemCelz® procedures in those time frames. Also, there were a number of incentives offered to new physicians that reduced the average per-unit price.
Cost of Goods Sold. We generated $50,596 in cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2020 in comparison with $45,499 for the comparable period a year ago. The increase of $5,097 or 11.2% was consistent with the per-unit cost. The nearly flat cost of goods sold was primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic. From March through June 2020 and then September through December 2020, nearly all elective procedures were halted in the U.S. This resulted in a near cessation of Caverstem® and FemCelz® procedures in those time frames.
Gross Profit/(Loss). We generated 113,904 in gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2020 in comparison with $120,001 in gross profit for the comparable period a year ago. The decrease of $6,097 or 5.1% is due to the lower sales associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and lower per-unit revenue from new physician promotions.
General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, totaled $1,228,739, in comparison with $1,250,169 for the comparable period a year ago. The decrease of $21,430, or 1.7% is primarily due to reduced marketing and travel expenses due to the COVID-19 pandemic offset by increased amortization expenses associated with the StemSpine® patent acquisition.
Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, totaled $0.
Operating Loss. For the reasons stated above, our operating losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $1,114,835 in comparison with $1,130,168 for the comparable period a year ago.
Other Expense. Other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $35,210,395 in comparison with $7,353,505 for the comparable period a year ago. The increase of $27,856,890, or 378.8% is due to an increase of $28,888,870 in the change in fair value of derivative liabilities offset by a decrease of $665,938 in interest expense and $0 in losses of extinguishment of convertible notes compared to a $366,042 loss for the comparable period a year ago. We incurred interest expense calculated on our promissory notes. We recorded the amortization of various debt discounts associated with our convertible promissory notes. The discounts are the result of derivative liabilities in which are recorded due to the variability of the notes conversion price. The derivative liabilities have to be re-measured as of each reporting date
Net Loss. For the reasons stated above, our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $36,325,230 in comparison with $8,483,673 for the comparable period a year ago.
Amortization Expense. We acquired a patent (U.S. Patent No. 8,372,797) from CMH on February 2, 2016, in exchange for 64,666,667 shares of our restricted common stock valued at $100,000. The patent expires in 2026 and we have elected to amortize the patent over a ten-year period on a straight-line basis. On August 25, 2016, CMT entered into a License Agreement which grants it the exclusive right to all products derived from US Patent No. 7,569,385 for multipotent amniotic fetal stem cells. Under the terms of the license agreement, CMT paid an initial license fee within 30 days of entering into the agreement. The patent expires in 2026 and we have elected to amortize the patent over a ten-year period on a straight-line basis. On May 17, 2017, CMT purchased U.S. Patent No. 9,598,673 covering use of various stem cells for treatment of lower back pain from “CMH”. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company is required to pay CMH $100,000. The agreement was modified in November 2017 to waive payment of the initial license fee, modify the fee structure and add the ability to convert the outstanding payable balance into common shares. In November 2019, the Company announced the commercialization of the lower back procedure using a patient’s own cells (“autologous”). This milestone triggered a milestone payment due from the Company to CMH in the amount of $300,000. The patent expires in 2027, and we have elected to amortize the patent over a ten-year period on a straight-line basis. In December 2020, we entered into a Patent License Agreement with Jadi Cells, Inc. Execution of the contract triggered a milestone payment due from the Company to Jadi Cells, Inc. in the amount of $250,000. Given the contract execution date of December 28, 2020 no amortization expense was recognized.
Amortization expense of $66,792 was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020, representing the amortization of the ED, multipotent amniotic fetal stem cell and lower back pain patents based upon the remaining life of the patents. There was $26,950 of amortization expense recorded for the period ended December 31, 2019.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our principal source of liquidity to date has been funds received from the sale of our common stock to CMH in the amount of $79,500, $125,000 in loans from CMH, a $50,000 loan from our CEO, Tim Warbington, $5,381,540 in loans from third parties and $600,000 in private sales of our common stock to third parties. To-date, $3,953,434 of outstanding principal, interest and fees have been converted into equity. $512,240 of the $1,198,350 in loans from third parties matures in 2021. $686,110 of the outstanding debt matured in 2020. Our experience to-date indicates the lenders are most likely convert the debt into equity prior to or in lieu of full payment at maturity. Going forward, our short-term funding needs are expected to be satisfied by funds to be loaned to us by third parties and revenues generated from our CaverStem® erectile dysfunction and FemCelz® female sexual dysfunction procedures. Our long-term liquidity needs are expected to be satisfied from future offerings of our equity securities. It is possible that CMH may provide future financing for us. We do not have any arrangements, agreements, or sources for long-term funding.
Our only commitments for expenditures relate to general and administrative costs, including reimbursements to CMH for services performed by their executive officers on our behalf. During the next 12 months we also anticipate incurring expenses related to marketing activities for our CaverStem® and FemCelz® procedures and the commercialization of our StemSpine® procedure.
For the next 12 months our plan of operations is to market the disposable stem cell kits associated with the CaverStem® erectile dysfunction and FemCelz® female sexual dysfunction procedures, commercialize StemSpine® and file an IND application for ImmCelz™ to treat stroke. We believe that our current cash on hand would meet our cash flow requirements for only a few more months. If we are unable to obtain further financing, we may seek alternative sources of funding or revise our business plan. We currently have no alternative sources for funding.
Our financial statements included with this report have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have incurred substantial expenses and generated minimal revenues from operations during the periods covered by these financial statements. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. There is no assurance that we will be successful in meeting the continuing financial obligations of the company. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles accepted in the United States. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.
Emerging Growth Company
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. Certain specified reduced reporting and other regulatory requirements that are available to public companies that are emerging growth companies. These provisions include:
1.
an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;
2.
an exemption from the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards until they would apply to private companies;
3.
an exemption from compliance with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB, requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about our audit and our financial statements; and
4.
reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements.
We have elected to take advantage of the exemption from the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards until they would apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to public companies required to adopt these new requirements.
