For purposes of the following discussion, the words “Seacoast,” or the “Company,” refer to the combined entities of Seacoast Banking Corporation of Florida and its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries.
Overview - Strategy and Results
Seacoast Banking Corporation of Florida (“Seacoast” or the “Company”), a financial holding company, registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”), is one of the largest community banks in Florida, with $8.3 billion in assets and $6.9 billion in deposits as of December 31, 2020. Its principal subsidiary is Seacoast National Bank (“Seacoast Bank”), a wholly owned national banking association. The Company provides integrated financial services including commercial and retail banking, wealth management, and mortgage services to customers through advanced banking solutions, and Seacoast Bank's network of 51 traditional branches and commercial banking centers. Seacoast operates primarily in Florida, with concentrations in the state's fastest growing markets, each with unique characteristics and opportunities. The Company's offices stretch from the southeast, including Fort Lauderdale, Boca Raton and Palm Beach, north along the east coast to the Daytona area, into Orlando and Central Florida and the adjacent Tampa market, and west to Okeechobee and surrounding counties.
The Company delivers integrated banking services, combining traditional retail locations with online and mobile technology and a convenient telephone banking center. Seacoast has built a fully integrated distribution platform across all channels to provide customers with the ability to choose their path of convenience to satisfy their banking needs, allowing the Company an opportunity to reach customers through a variety of sales channels. The Company believes its digital delivery and products are contributing to the franchise's growth.
Seacoast is executing a balanced growth strategy, combining organic growth with strategic acquisitions in Florida's most attractive growing markets. In Orlando, Seacoast is now the largest Florida-based bank and a top-10 bank in the Orlando market overall. In other key markets, including Palm Beach County, Fort Lauderdale, and Tampa, the Company has enhanced its footprint with ten acquisitions since 2014, generating continued expansion and strengthening market share, increasing the customer base and lowering operating costs through economies of scale.
The Company's acquisition strategy has not only increased customer households and been accretive to earnings, but has also opened markets and Seacoast's customer base. The table below summarizes acquisition activity in recent years:
2020 Acquisitions
In March 2020, Seacoast acquired First Bank of the Palm Beaches (“FBPB”), which increased the Company’s market share in the attractive Palm Beach market. FBPB operated two branches, which were converted to Seacoast branches, with deposits of $174 million and loans of $147 million at the time of acquisition.
In August 2020, Seacoast completed the acquisition of Fourth Street Banking Company (“Fourth Street”) and its wholly-owned subsidiary Freedom Bank, which added $303 million in loans and $330 million in deposits. The acquisition supports Seacoast’s growing presence in the attractive St. Petersburg, Florida market. Freedom Bank operated two branches in St. Petersburg, which were converted to Seacoast branches.
Impact of COVID-19, the CARES Act and the Paycheck Protection Program on Comparability Among Periods
Early in 2020, the global economy began experiencing a downturn resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Seacoast reacted quickly at the onset to make adjustments to operations intended to protect the health and welfare of our associates and customers. The Company's range of digital banking products combined with continued access to branches through drive-thrus and lobby appointments has allowed the Company to continue to meet customer needs. A robust and well-tested business continuity program has allowed the Company to maintain productivity levels with a majority of associates working remotely.
The spread of COVID-19 has created a global public health crisis that has resulted in unprecedented uncertainty, volatility and disruption in financial markets and in governmental, commercial and consumer activity in the United States and globally, including the markets that we serve. Governmental responses to the pandemic have included orders to close businesses not deemed essential and directing individuals to restrict their movements, observe social distancing and shelter in place. These actions, together with responses to the pandemic by businesses and individuals, have resulted in rapid decreases in commercial and consumer activity, temporary, and some permanent, closures of many businesses that have led to a loss of revenues and a rapid increase in unemployment, material decreases in business valuations, disrupted global supply chains, market downturns and volatility, changes in consumer behavior related to pandemic fears (including a decline in demand for banking products or services, including loans and deposits which could impact our future financial condition, results of operations and liquidity), related emergency response legislation and an expectation that Federal Reserve policy will maintain a low interest rate environment for the foreseeable future. Although financial markets have rebounded from significant declines that occurred
earlier in the pandemic and global economic conditions showed signs of improvement beginning during the second quarter of 2020, many of the effects that arose or became more pronounced after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic have persisted through the end of the year. These changes have had and are likely to continue to have a significant adverse effect on the markets in which we conduct our business and the demand for our products and services.
Our business and consumer customers are experiencing varying degrees of financial distress, which is expected to continue into the first quarter of 2021 and beyond, especially if COVID-19 infections increase and new economic restrictions are mandated. Our borrowing base includes customers in industries such as hotel/lodging, restaurants, and retail, all of which have been and are likely to continue to be significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We recognize that these industries may take longer to recover as consumers may be hesitant to return to full social interaction or may change their spending habits on a more permanent basis as a result of the pandemic. We continue to monitor these customers closely.
Future economic conditions are subject to significant uncertainty. We have taken deliberate actions to ensure that we have the balance sheet strength to serve our clients and communities, including increases in liquidity and managing our assets and liabilities in order to maintain a strong capital position. Current economic pressures and their effects on our customers, coupled with the implementation of the CECL expected loss methodology for determining our allowance for credit losses, have contributed to a substantially increased provision for credit losses in 2020.
We continue to monitor closely the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers, as well as the effects of the CARES Act. Uncertainties associated with the pandemic include the duration of the outbreak (including the impact of new variants of the virus that may be resistant to the various vaccines available), the impact to our customers, employees and vendors and the impact to the economy as a whole. COVID-19 has had, and is expected to continue to have, a significant adverse impact on our business, financial position and operating results. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our operations and financial results in 2021 cannot be fully estimated at this time.
In March 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act was signed into law. The CARES Act includes provisions for the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) offered through the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”). Loans originated under this program have a contractual rate of interest of 1% with principal and interest that may be forgiven provided that the borrower uses the funds in a manner consistent with PPP guidelines. Seacoast assisted borrowers in 2020 with more than 5,500 loans originated through the PPP and, when combined with PPP loans acquired from Freedom Bank, outstanding balances totaled $567.0 million at December 31, 2020. The SBA established a fee structure based on loan size. Fees received by Seacoast, net of related costs, totaled $17.2 million, and are deferred and recognized as an adjustment to yield over time.
Seacoast recognized net fees of $7.8 million and contractual interest of $4.2 million on PPP loans in 2020. The remaining $9.5 million in deferred PPP loan fees at December 31, 2020 will be recognized over the loans' remaining contractual maturity or sooner, as loans are forgiven.
In January 2021, the Company began accepting applications for the re-opening of the PPP lending program on our fully digital origination platform. As of February 18, 2021, the Company had originated approximately 1,800 loans totaling $180 million under the latest round of PPP.
Loan Modifications
The CARES Act, as amended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act on December 27, 2020, provides financial institutions the option to exclude from troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”) consideration certain loan modifications that might otherwise be categorized as TDRs under ASC 310-40 in order to assist borrowers financially impacted by COVID-19. This option is available for modifications that are deemed to be COVID-related, where the borrower was not more than 30 days past due on December 31, 2019, and the modification is executed between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of (i) January 1, 2022 or (ii) 60 days after the end of the COVID-19 national emergency. Federal banking regulators issued similar guidance that also allows lenders to conclude that short-term modifications for borrowers financially affected by the pandemic should not be considered TDRs if the borrower was current at the time of modification. Seacoast began offering payment accommodations to eligible borrowers in March 2020 and, at December 31, 2020, $74.1 million of loans, or 1% of total loans, had active payment accommodations, down 93% from a peak of $1.1 billion in the second quarter of 2020. None of these loans have been classified as TDRs. During the payment accommodation period, Seacoast typically continues to recognize interest income.
Adoption of New Accounting for Credit Losses
On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASC Topic 326 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, which replaced the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred to as the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) methodology. The adoption resulted in an increase to the allowance for credit losses on loans of $21.2 million and an addition to the reserve for unfunded lending-related commitments of $1.8 million.
2020 Financial Performance Highlights
•Steady build of shareholder value through consistent growth in tangible book value per share, which ended the period at $16.16, an increase of 15% during the fourth quarter on an annualized basis.
•The tangible common equity ratio of 11% supports Seacoast's ability to deploy capital for organic growth and opportunistic acquisitions.
•Record net income of $29.3 million in the fourth quarter, increasing 30% quarter-over-quarter.
•Record levels of mortgage banking fees and wealth management income in 2020, reflecting increases of 126% and 18%, respectively, from 2019.
•The successful acquisitions of First Bank of the Palm Beaches and Freedom Bank added experienced bankers while expanding the Company's presence in attractive growth markets, which we believe will further support sustainable, profitable growth.
•Total deposits per banking center were $135.9 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of 17% from $116.3 million one year earlier.
•Continued discipline around expenses, primarily achieved through focus on reducing overhead and streamlining business and cost savings processes, achieving a fourth quarter 2020 efficiency ratio below 50%.
Results of Operations
Earnings Summary
For the year ended December 31, 2020, net income totaled $77.8 million, or $1.44 per diluted share, compared to $98.7 million, or $1.90 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2019. Return on average assets (“ROA”) was 0.99% and return on average equity (“ROE”) was 7.44% in 2020 compared to 1.45% and 10.63%, respectively, in 2019.
Adjusted net income1 for the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $89.0 million, or $1.65 per diluted share, compared to $104.6 million, or $2.01 per diluted share, in 2019.
On both a GAAP and adjusted basis, return on average tangible assets and return on average tangible shareholders' equity decreased in 2020 when compared to the prior year. The change reflects the impact on net income of increased provisioning for credit losses in 2020 attributed to the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, and the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as growth in the balance sheet resulting from PPP loans, acquisitions, and higher deposit balances.
In 2020, the Company's efficiency ratio, defined as noninterest expense less foreclosed property expense and amortization of intangibles divided by net operating revenue (net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis plus noninterest income excluding securities gains and losses), was 54.84%, compared to 51.71% for 2019. Changes from the prior year reflect higher 2020 expenses, including acquisition-related costs, partially offset by lower funding costs and increases in noninterest income. The adjusted efficiency ratio1 in 2020 was 51.63% compared to 50.90% in 2019. The Company expects to maintain an adjusted efficiency ratio in the low 50s for the full year 2021.
Net Interest Income and Margin
Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $262.7 million, increasing $19.1 million, or 8%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Net interest income (on a fully taxable equivalent basis)1 for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $263.2 million, increasing $19.3 million, or 8%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. In 2020 and 2019, net interest margin was 3.65% and 3.92%, respectively.
In 2020, net interest income and the net interest margin reflect the impact of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in the first quarter of 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Loans and security yields contracted by 59 and 67 basis points, respectively, offset by a decline in the cost of deposits by 37 basis points. The impact on net interest margin from accretion of purchase discounts on acquired loans was 21 basis points in 2020, compared to 25 basis points in 2019. PPP loans decreased net interest margin by three basis points in 2020.
Table 2 presents the Company’s average balance sheets, interest income and expenses, and yields and rates, for the past three years.
The following table details the trend for net interest income and margin results (on a fully taxable equivalent basis)1, yield on earning assets and rate on interest bearing liabilities.
Total average loans increased $745.3 million, or 15%, during 2020 compared to 2019 with growth attributed primarily to loans originated in the PPP, and the two bank acquisitions completed in 2020. Average investment securities balances increased $99.6 million, or 8%, during 2020 compared to 2019.
Average loans (the highest yielding component of earning assets) as a percentage of average earning assets totaled 79% in 2020 and 2019. The mix of loans has remained stable, with volumes related to commercial real estate representing 52% of total loans, excluding PPP loans, at December 31, 2020, compared to 49% at December 31, 2019. Residential loan balances with individuals (including home equity loans and lines and personal construction loans) represented 28% of total loans, excluding PPP loans, at December 31, 2020 compared to 32% at December 31, 2019. (see “Loan Portfolio”).

Loan production is detailed in the following table for the periods specified:
Commercial and commercial real estate loan production in 2020 totaled $655.8 million, compared to $1.1 billion in 2019. During 2019, the Company acquired $72.4 million in fixed-rate commercial real estate loans from the wholesale market. No purchases were made in the wholesale market during 2020.
Residential loan production totaled $638.6 million in 2020 compared to $523.6 million in 2019. 2019 includes purchases of residential loans from the wholesale market totaling $134.7 million. No purchases were made in the wholesale market during 2020.
Consumer originations totaled $219.3 million during 2020 compared to $214.5 million during 2019.
Seacoast originated more than 5,500 loans to borrowers through the PPP program for $599.0 million in 2020, and acquired $55.0 million in PPP loans from Freedom Bank. Under the terms of the SBA's program, principal and interest on PPP loans may be forgiven provided the borrower uses the funds in a manner consistent with the program's guidelines. As of December 31, 2020, $71.8 million in PPP loans had been forgiven.
Average debt securities increased $99.6 million, or 8%, from 2019. Securities comprised 18% and 19% of average earning assets in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Yields on securities decreased from 3.00% in 2019 to 2.33% in 2020.
In 2020, the cost of average interest-bearing liabilities decreased 57 basis points to 0.53% from 2019, reflecting the impact of interest rate reductions in 2019 and 2020. The low overall cost of our funding reflects the Company’s successful core deposit focus that produced strong growth in customer relationships over the past several years. Noninterest bearing demand deposits at December 31, 2020 represent 33% of total deposits, compared to 28% at December 31, 2019. The cost of average total deposits (including noninterest bearing demand deposits) in 2020 was 0.32%, compared to 0.69% in 2019.
The following table details the Company's customer relationship funding as of:
The Company’s focus on convenience, with high-quality customer service, expanded digital offerings and distribution channels provides stable, low-cost core deposit funding. Over the past several years, the Company has strengthened its retail deposit franchise using new strategies and product offerings, while maintaining a focus on growing customer relationships. Seacoast believes that digital product offerings are central to core deposit growth and have proved to be of meaningful value to its customers in this environment. Seacoast's call center and retail associates continue to lead the market in availability and customer service standards, with the call center out-performing large bank call center wait times and service level standards. The impact of PPP originations and individual stimulus payments, as well as the acquisition of FBPB in the first quarter of 2020 and Freedom Bank in the third quarter of 2020, have all contributed to higher deposit balances. The Company has also seen a continued shift toward mobile banking use as customers recognize the ease of access and security features of such engagement. At December 31, 2020, registered mobile devices had increased 16% compared to December 31, 2019, while online users increased 13% in the same time period. Growth in mobile banking use represents both consumer and business customers utilizing the convenience of mobile and online channels. During 2020, average transaction deposits (noninterest and interest bearing demand) increased $676.3 million, or 25%, compared to 2019. Along with new relationships, deposit programs and digital sales have improved the Company's market share and deepened relationships with existing customers.
Growth in core deposits has also provided low funding costs. The Company’s deposit mix remains favorable, with 83% of average deposit balances comprised of savings, money market, and demand deposits in 2020.
Sweep repurchase agreements with customers increased $33.5 million, or 39%, to $119.6 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $86.1 million at December 31, 2019. The average rate on customer repurchase accounts was 0.33% in 2020 compared to 1.35% in 2019. No federal funds purchased were utilized at December 31, 2020 or 2019.
The Company had no FHLB borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2020 compared to $315.0 million at December 31, 2019. FHLB borrowings averaged $139.4 million at an average rate of 1.10% for the full year 2020, compared to $131.9 million at an average rate of 2.28% for the full year 2019 (see “Note J - Borrowings” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements).
In 2020, average subordinated debt of $71.2 million related to trust preferred securities issued by subsidiary trusts of the Company carried an average cost of 3.07%, down from 4.75% in 2019, reflecting the impact of lower interest rates as the subordinated debt cost is based on LIBOR plus a spread (see “Note J - Borrowings”).
Provision for Credit Losses
The provision for credit losses was $38.2 million for the full year 2020 compared to $11.0 million for the full year 2019. On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASC Topic 326 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. Under the CECL approach, the Company reserves for the full amount of expected credit losses over the life of the loans. The estimate is based on current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This use of CECL requires earlier recognition, when compared with the previous accounting guidance, of credit losses that are deemed expected but not yet probable. The expectation of higher future losses due to the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on the current and forecasted economic environment resulted in the increase in provisioning during 2020.
Noninterest Income
Noninterest income (excluding securities gains and losses) totaled $60.3 million in 2020, an increase of $4.8 million, or 9%, compared to 2019. Noninterest income accounted for 19% of total revenue in 2020 and 2019 (net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding securities gains and losses).
Service charges on deposits for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $2.1 million, or 18%, to $9.4 million. This decrease reflects the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on service charges, including the waiver of certain account charges during the second quarter of 2020, as well as higher average deposit balances resulting in lower overdraft fees in 2020. Overdraft fees represented 44% of total service charges on deposits in 2020 compared to 55% in 2019.
Interchange revenue totaled $13.7 million in 2020, an increase of 2% from $13.4 million in 2019. Growth in business customers and marketing targeted at increasing debit card utilization across all customers resulted in record interchange revenue for the year.
Wealth management revenues, including brokerage commissions and fees and trust income, increased $1.2 million, or 18%, to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. A determined and consistent focus on building new relationships and providing exceptional services resulted in considerable growth during 2020, with assets under management (“AUM”) increasing 33% year-over-year to $870 million as of December 31, 2020.
Mortgage banking fees increased by $8.2 million, or 126%, to $14.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019. In 2020, Seacoast continued to capitalize on the robust residential refinance market and a vibrant Florida housing market, resulting in record results for the year.
Marine finance fees were $0.7 million in 2020, a decrease of $0.4 million, or 34%, compared to fees of $1.1 million in 2019.
Gains on sale of the guaranteed portion of SBA loans totaled $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $1.8 million compared to 2019. A shift toward PPP production beginning in the second quarter of 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in lower production of saleable SBA loans for 2020.
Bank owned life insurance (“BOLI”) income totaled $3.6 million in 2020, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 3%, compared to the prior year.
Other income decreased $0.5 million, or 5%, year-over-year. 2020 results reflect higher swap fees, which are more than offset by a $1.0 million BOLI death benefit recognized in 2019.
Securities gains in 2020 totaled $1.2 million, resulting from the sale of $96.7 million of debt securities, and a $0.1 million increase in the value of the CRA-qualified mutual fund investment. Securities gains in 2019 totaled $1.2 million, resulting from the sale of $202.7 million of debt securities, and a $0.2 million increase in the value of the CRA-qualified mutual fund investment.
Noninterest Expense
The Company has demonstrated its commitment to efficiency through disciplined, proactive management of its cost structure. Noninterest expenses in 2020 totaled $185.6 million and included acquisition-related expenses of $9.1 million, expenses related to branch consolidation of $0.8 million, and $0.3 million in bonuses to retail associates for keeping critical functions operating at full capacity through the initial stages of the Company's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2019, noninterest expenses totaled $160.7 million, including $1.0 million in acquisition-related expenses, $1.8 million in expenses related to branch consolidation, and $0.1 million in business continuity expenses relating to a hurricane event. Adjusted noninterest expense1 in 2020 totaled $169.5 million, an increase of 12% from 2019, reflecting overall growth of the organization. Changes in the categories of noninterest expense for the year ended 2020 compared to 2019 are further described below.
Seacoast has expanded its footprint while decreasing its reliance on branches through successful bank acquisitions and the repositioning of the banking center network in strategic growth markets to meet the evolving needs of its customers. At December 31, 2020, deposits per banking center were $135.9 million, up 17% from $116.3 million at December 31, 2019. The Company consolidated one banking center location in 2020 and three in 2019. The Company plans to further consolidate three banking center locations in the first quarter of 2021.
Salaries and wages totaled $88.5 million in 2020, an increase of $14.7 million, or 20%, compared to 2019. Results in 2020 include $2.8 million in bank acquisition-related charges. Record levels of saleable mortgage production resulted in higher
commissions, and bonuses were paid to retail associates for keeping critical functions operating at full capacity through the initial stages of the Company's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher headcount is attributed to the recruitment of seasoned bankers in key markets, to the FBPB and Freedom Bank acquisitions, and the addition of staff to support the PPP. Higher loan originations in 2020 relating to the PPP resulted in higher deferrals of related salary costs.
During 2020, employee benefit costs, which include group health insurance, 401(k) plan contributions, payroll taxes, and unemployment compensation, increased $1.8 million, or 13%, compared to 2019. The increase is attributed to higher headcount and higher health insurance costs.
The Company utilizes third parties for core data processing systems. The data processing costs associated with these third parties fluctuate based on the number of transactions processed and the negotiated rates associated with those transactions. Outsourced data processing costs totaled $19.1 million and $15.1 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Of the $4.0 million, or 26%, increase in 2020, $2.7 million is the result of acquisition-related costs incurred in 2020. The Company continues to improve and enhance mobile and other digital products and services through key third parties. Outsourced data processing costs may increase in the future as customers adopt improved products and as business volumes grow.
Telephone and data line expenses, including electronic communications with customers, between branch locations and personnel, and with third party data processors, remained flat year-over-year at $3.0 million. The Company continues to manage expenses for this category, which has benefited from branch consolidation, while continuing to grow alternative service channels including the Customer Support Center and digital applications.
Total occupancy, furniture and equipment expenses in 2020 totaled $20.0 million, a decrease of $0.5 million, or 2%, compared to 2019. The decrease reflects the benefit of recent branch consolidations. The Company continues to strategically manage its branch footprint to balance customer needs for access to physical branches with the ability to provide services through telephone-based and digital channels. Branch consolidations will continue for the Company and the banking industry in general as the customer service dynamic continues to evolve.
In 2020 and 2019, marketing expenses totaled $4.8 million and $4.2 million, respectively. The Company continues to carefully manage the use of marketing campaigns to target potential high value customers in a cost effective manner through a mix of digital communications, direct mail, event sponsorships and donations.
Legal and professional fees increased by $0.6 million in 2020, or 7%, to $9.2 million, which includes $2.7 million in merger-related expenses in 2020, compared to $0.4 million in 2019.
FDIC assessments were $1.3 million in 2020, compared to $0.9 million in 2019. In the third quarter of 2019, the FDIC announced the achievement of the target deposit insurance reserve ratio, resulting in the Company's ability to apply previously awarded credits to its deposit insurance assessment. The Company used these credits to offset $0.9 million of expenses during 2019 and $0.7 million during 2020. The credits were fully utilized by the second quarter of 2020.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, foreclosed property expense and net loss on sale was $2.3 million, compared to $0.1 million in 2019. Results in 2020 primarily reflect the write-downs of two properties in the fourth quarter upon the receipt of updated valuations.
Other expense totaled $15.8 million and $15.2 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase of $0.6 million, or 4%, includes higher recruiting fees and higher mortgage production-related expenses.
Income Taxes
In 2020, the provision for income taxes totaled $22.8 million, compared to $29.9 million in 2019. In 2019, a reduction in the State of Florida corporate income tax rate resulted in the write-down of certain deferred tax assets, resulting in additional income tax expense of $1.1 million. In 2020, changes under the CARES Act provided for the carryback of net operating losses that resulted in an income tax benefit of $0.4 million. Discrete tax benefits related to share-based compensation were $0.1 million and $0.8 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Fourth Quarter Review
Net income totaled $29.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of $6.7 million, or 30%, from the third quarter of 2020, and an increase of $2.2 million, or 8%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Adjusted net income1 totaled $30.7 million, an increase of $3.4 million, or 12%, from the third quarter of 2020, and an increase of $3.9 million, or 14%, compared
to the fourth quarter of 2019. Diluted earnings per common share (“EPS”) was $0.53 and adjusted diluted EPS12was $0.55 in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to diluted EPS of $0.42 and adjusted diluted EPS1 of $0.50 in the third quarter of 2020 and compared to diluted EPS of $0.52 and adjusted diluted EPS1 of $0.52 in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Revenues increased $3.3 million, or 4%, from the third quarter of 2020 and increased $5.6 million, or 7%, from the fourth quarter of 2019. Net interest income increased $5.3 million, or 8%, compared to the third quarter of 2020 and increased $7.0 million, or 11%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.
Net interest income (on a tax-equivalent basis), for the fourth quarter of 2020 totaled $68.9 million, an increase of $5.3 million, or 8%, from the third quarter of 2020, and an increase of $7.1 million, or 11%, from the fourth quarter 2019. Net interest margin (on a tax-equivalent basis), increased 19 basis points to 3.59% from the third quarter of 2020, and contracted 25 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2019. During the fourth quarter of 2020, net interest income included $5.2 million in interest and fees earned on PPP loans compared to $1.7 million in the third quarter of 2020. Lower PPP loan fees in the third quarter resulted from a calculation change to align fee recognition with the contractual maturity of the loans. Loan forgiveness began in the fourth quarter of 2020, resulting in accelerated recognition of $1.5 million in PPP loan fees.
Noninterest income, excluding securities gains and losses, totaled $14.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, a decrease of $2.0 million, or 12%, from the third quarter of 2020 and an increase of $1.1 million, or 8%, from the fourth quarter of 2019. Mortgage banking gains decreased by $1.6 million to $3.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to record results in the prior quarter. The low interest rate environment continued to result in heightened refinance demand, though at lower levels than in the third quarter.
Noninterest expenses for the fourth quarter of 2020 totaled $43.7 million, a decrease of $8.0 million, or 15% from the prior quarter and an increase of $5.6 million, or 15%, from the fourth quarter of 2019. Compared to the third quarter of 2020, salaries and wages decreased by $1.6 million to $21.5 million, primarily reflecting the effect of higher expense deferrals associated with accelerated commercial loan originations in the fourth quarter. Other decreases compared to the third quarter of 2020 are primarily attributed to merger-related expenses.
A provision for loan losses of $1.9 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to a reversal of $0.8 million in the previous quarter. The ratio of allowance for credit losses to total loans was 1.62% at December 31, 2020, compared to 1.60% at September 30, 2020. Excluding PPP loans, the ratio was 1.79% at December 31, 2020, compared to 1.80% at September 30, 2020.

Explanation of Certain Unaudited Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This report contains financial information determined by methods other than Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). The financial highlights provide reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted financial measures including net income, fully taxable equivalent net interest income, noninterest income, noninterest expense, tax adjustments, net interest margin and other financial ratios. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in its analysis of the Company’s performance and believes these presentations provide useful supplemental information, and a clearer understanding of the Company’s performance. The Company believes the non-GAAP measures enhance investors’ understanding of the Company’s business and performance and if not provided would be requested by the investor community. These measures are also useful in understanding performance trends and facilitate comparisons with the performance of other financial institutions. The limitations associated with operating measures are the risk that persons might disagree as to the appropriateness of items comprising these measures and that different companies might define or calculate these measures differently. The Company provides reconciliations between GAAP and these non-GAAP measures. These disclosures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP.
The following tables provide reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted (non-GAAP) financial measures.
Financial Condition
Total assets increased $1.2 billion, or 17% year-over-year to $8.3 billion at December 31, 2020, reflecting the impact of PPP loan originations and the completion of two acquisitions during the year.
Securities
Information related to yields, maturities, carrying values and fair value of the Company’s securities is set forth in Tables 13-16 and “Note D - Securities” of the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
At December 31, 2020, the Company had $1.4 billion in securities available-for-sale, and $184.5 million in securities held-to-maturity. The Company's total debt securities portfolio increased $374.4 million, or 31% from December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, there were $830.3 million of debt security purchases and $379.9 million in paydowns and maturities over the same period. For the year ended December 31, 2020, proceeds from the sale of securities totaled $96.7 million, with net gains of $1.1 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, there were $309.5 million of debt security purchases and $144.2 million in paydowns and maturities over the same period. For the year ended December 31, 2019, proceeds from the sale of securities totaled $202.7 million, with net losses of $1.0 million.
Debt securities generally return principal and interest monthly. The modified duration of the investment portfolio at December 31, 2020 was 3.8 years, compared to 3.5 years at December 31, 2019.
At December 31, 2020, available-for-sale securities had gross unrealized losses of $2.1 million and gross unrealized gains of $28.7 million, compared to gross unrealized losses of $2.7 million and gross unrealized gains of $8.8 million at December 31, 2019. The Company assesses securities in an unrealized loss position on a quarterly basis. As of December 31, 2020, the Company expected to recover the entire amortized cost basis of these securities and therefore no allowance for credit losses was recorded.
The credit quality of the Company’s securities holdings are primarily investment grade. As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s investment securities, except for $35.3 million of securities issued by states and their political subdivisions, generally are traded in liquid markets. U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agencies and obligations of U.S. government-sponsored entities totaled $1.3 billion, or 79%, of the total portfolio. The portfolio also includes $91.2 million in private label securities, most secured by residential real estate collateral, with low loan to values and average credit support of 22%. The Company also has invested $202.2 million in uncapped 3-month LIBOR floating rate collateralized loan obligations. Collateralized loan obligations are special purpose vehicles that purchase first lien broadly syndicated corporate loans while providing support to senior tranche investors. As of December 31, 2020, all of the Company's collateralized loan obligations were in AAA/AA tranches with average credit support of 30%. The Company performs routine stress testing on these securities to assess both structure and collateral.
Loan Portfolio
Loans, net of unearned income and excluding the allowance for credit losses, were $5.6 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $479.4 million, or 9%, compared to December 31, 2019. In the second quarter of 2020, the Company began originating Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loans established by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act. At December 31, 2020, the Company had $567 million in PPP loans outstanding. Excluding PPP loans, loans outstanding decreased year-over-year by $30 million to $5.2 billion. The Company adhered to its conservative underwriting guidelines through 2020 in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economic environment. For the year ended December 31, 2020, non-PPP commercial loan originations, including small business and SBA loans, were $655.8 million, compared to $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of 38%. The loan pipeline for commercial loans totaled $166.7 million at December 31, 2020.
Residential loans originated for sale in the secondary market were $509.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $236.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. A vibrant refinance market and a strong Florida housing market, combined with the residential lending team's focus on high-quality service levels to homebuyers, refinance customers and local real estate professionals, resulted in record originations for the year. Originations of residential loans retained were $129.2 million in 2020, compared to $287.0 million in December 31, 2019. The saleable residential mortgage pipeline at December 31, 2020 totaled $92.0 million while the retained pipeline was $25.1 million.
During 2020, the Company successfully completed two bank acquisitions, resulting in loans acquired of $146.8 million in the FBPB acquisition and $303.4 million in the Freedom Bank acquisition.
During 2019, the Company purchased $201.1 million in loans, with an average loan size of $297 thousand and an average yield of 3.92%. The Company made no loan purchases during 2020.
The Company has maintained a conservative approach to underwriting and has intentionally slowed loan growth since the onset of the pandemic in light of increased economic uncertainty. Assuming the economic recovery commences in the second half of 2021, the resumption of growth will be accompanied by defined risk management procedures. Lending policies contain guardrails that pertain to lending by type of collateral and purpose, along with limits regarding loan concentrations and the principal amount of loans. The Company's exposure to commercial real estate lending remains below regulatory limits (see “Loan Concentrations”).
The following table details loan portfolio composition at December 31, 2020 for portfolio loans, purchased credit deteriorated loans (“PCD”) and loans purchased which are not considered credit deteriorated (“Non-PCD”) as defined in “Note E - Loans”; and at December 31, 2019 for portfolio loans, purchased unimpaired loans (“PUL”) and purchased credit impaired loans (“PCI”). With the adoption of ASC Topic 326 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses on January 1, 2020, the Company re-evaluated the aggregation of loans into segments, and separated Commercial Real Estate - Owner Occupied from Commercial Real Estate - Non Owner Occupied. In prior years, all Commercial Real Estate loans were considered a single segment.
Commercial real estate loans, inclusive of owner-occupied commercial real estate, increased $158.2 million, or 7%, totaling $2.5 billion at December 31, 2020, compared to December 31, 2019. Owner-occupied loans represent $1.1 billion, or 45%, of the commercial real estate portfolio. Office building loans of $761.1 million, or 27%, of commercial real estate mortgages, comprise our largest concentration with a substantial portion owner-occupied.
Fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans secured by commercial real estate, excluding construction loans, totaled approximately $2.1 billion and $453.7 million, respectively, at December 31, 2020, compared to $2.0 billion and $418.8 million, respectively, at December 31, 2019.
At December 31, 2020, Seacoast had $74.1 million of loans with payment accommodations to borrowers financially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, none of which have been classified as a TDR. If economic conditions deteriorate further, these borrowers may be unable to resume scheduled payments, which may result in reversal of accrued interest, further modification of terms and additional necessary provisions for credit losses. At December 31, 2020, of loans that were provided with payment assistance during 2020, 94% are in current status or have paid off the balance entirely, less than 1% are 30 or more days past due, and 5% have been provided with an additional accommodation, including additional payment deferrals or interest only payment arrangements. Interest and fees have typically continued to accrue on these loans throughout their accommodation period.
The following table presents loans with accommodations, excluding PPP loans, at December 31, 2020:
The following table details commercial real estate and construction and land development loans outstanding by collateral type at December 31, 2020:
The largest collateral type in the CRE and construction portfolios, when aggregated, is office buildings, representing 13% of the portfolio. The average loan size in the office building category is $600 thousand, the average loan to value (“LTV”) is 57%, and 56% of this category is classified as owner-occupied. This primarily includes medical, accounting, engineering, health care, veterinarians and other similar professionals.
The second-largest category is retail, representing 8% of total loans. The average loan size in the retail category is $1.3 million and the average LTV is 58%. Loans collateralized by hotels/motels represent $130.7 million with an average loan size of $2.9 million and an average LTV of 54%. Restaurant exposure is limited at $49.6 million in loans, and is distributed among quick serve and full-service restaurants, with an average loan size of $788 thousand and LTV of 57%.
The following table details the commercial and financial loans outstanding by industry type at December 31, 2020:
Commercial and financial loans outstanding increased $76.5 million, or 10%, year-over year to $854.8 million as of December 31, 2020. The Company's primary customers for commercial and financial loans are small- to medium-sized professional firms, retail and wholesale outlets, and light industrial and manufacturing companies. Such businesses are smaller and subject to the risks of lending to small- to medium-sized businesses, including, but not limited to, the effects of a downturn in the local economy, possible business failure, and insufficient cash flows.
Residential mortgage loans decreased $165.2 million, or 11%, year-over-year to $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2020. Substantially all residential originations have been underwritten to conventional loan agency standards, including loans having balances that exceed agency value limitations. At December 31, 2020, approximately $436.3 million, or 32%, of the Company’s residential mortgage balances were adjustable 1-4 family mortgage loans (including hybrid adjustable rate mortgages). Fixed rate mortgages totaled $499.0 million, or 37%, of the residential mortgage portfolio at December 31, 2020, of which 15- and 30-year mortgages totaled $38.4 million and $362.9 million, respectively. Remaining fixed rate balances were comprised of home improvement loans totaling $163.5 million, most with maturities of 10 years or less. Home equity lines of credit, primarily floating rates, totaled $341.6 million at December 31, 2020. In comparison, fixed-rate loans secured by residential properties totaled $590.0 million at December 31, 2019, with 15- and 30-year fixed-rate residential mortgages totaling $43.5 million and $372.0 million, respectively, and home equity mortgages and lines of credit totaled $243.8 million and $292.1 million, respectively.
The Company also provides consumer loans, which includes installment loans, auto loans, marine loans and other consumer loans, which decreased $19.5 million, or 9%, year-over-year to a total of $188.7 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $208.2 million at December 31, 2019. Of the $19.5 million decrease, automobile loans and other consumer loans decreased $20.6 million and $5.3 million, respectively, while marine loans increased $6.4 million.
At December 31, 2020, the Company had unfunded commitments to make loans of $1.5 billion, compared to $1.0 billion at December 31, 2019 (see “Note Q - Contingent Liabilities and Commitments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements).
Loan Concentrations
The Company has developed guardrails to manage loan types that are most impacted by stressed market conditions in order to achieve lower levels of credit loss volatility in the future. Outstanding balances for commercial and commercial real estate (“CRE”) loan relationships greater than $10 million totaled $753.7 million, representing 13% of the total portfolio, at December 31, 2020, compared to $680.2 million, or 13%, at December 31, 2019.
The Company’s ten largest commercial and commercial real estate funded and unfunded loan relationships at December 31, 2020 aggregated to $254.3 million, of which $188.0 million was funded, compared to $268.9 million at December 31, 2019, of which $179.0 million was funded. The Company had 135 commercial and commercial real estate relationships in excess of $5 million totaling $1.3 billion, of which $1.2 billion was funded at December 31, 2020, compared to 120 relationships totaling $1.2 billion at December 31, 2019, of which $1.0 billion was funded.
Concentrations in total construction and land development loans and total CRE loans are maintained well below regulatory limits. Construction and land development and CRE loan concentrations as a percentage of total risk based capital, declined to 26% and 169%, respectively, at December 31, 2020, compared to 40% and 204% as of December 31, 2019. Regulatory guidance suggests limits of 100% and 300%, respectively. On a consolidated basis, construction and land development and commercial real estate loans represent 24% and 157%, respectively, of total consolidated risk based capital. To determine these ratios, the Company defines CRE in accordance with the guidance on “Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending” issued by the federal bank regulatory agencies in 2006 (and reinforced in 2015), which defines CRE loans as exposures secured by land development and construction, including 1-4 family residential construction, multifamily property, and non-farm nonresidential property where the primary or a significant source of repayment is derived from rental income associated with the property (i.e. loans for which 50 percent or more of the source of repayment comes from third party, non-affiliated, rental income) or the proceeds of the sale, refinancing, or permanent financing of the property. Loans on owner occupied CRE are generally excluded.
Nonperforming Loans, Troubled Debt Restructurings, Other Real Estate Owned, and Credit Quality
Table 12 provides certain information concerning nonperforming assets for the years indicated.
Nonperforming assets (“NPAs”) at December 31, 2020 totaled $48.9 million, an increase of $9.5 million, or 24%, compared to 2019, and were comprised of $36.1 million of nonaccrual loans, $10.2 million of other real estate owned (“OREO”) and $2.6 million of branches taken out of service. Compared to December 31, 2019, nonaccrual loans increased by $9.2 million, or 34%, and non-branch OREO decreased $4.3 million, or 62%, the result of property sales. Approximately 80% of nonaccrual loans were secured with real estate at December 31, 2020. Nonaccrual loans have been written down by approximately $8.4 million, or 12%, of the original loan balance (including specific impairment reserves). See the tables below for details about nonaccrual loans.
Nonperforming loans to total loans outstanding at December 31, 2020 increased to 0.63% from 0.52% at December 31, 2019. Nonperforming assets to total assets at December 31, 2020 increased to 0.59% from 0.55% at December 31, 2019.
The Company’s asset mitigation staff handles all foreclosure actions together with outside legal counsel.
Beginning in March 2020, in response to the economic downturn resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has offered payment accommodations to affected borrowers. As of December 31, 2020, pandemic-related accommodations totaled $74.1 million and are not considered troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”). If economic conditions deteriorate further, these borrowers may be unable to resume scheduled payments, which may result in further modification of terms and the potential for classification as a TDR in future periods.
In addition to pandemic-related accommodations, the Company pursues loan restructurings in selected cases where it expects to realize better values than may be expected through traditional collection activities. The Company has worked with retail mortgage customers, when possible, to achieve lower payment structures in an effort to avoid foreclosure. TDRs have been a part of the Company’s loss mitigation activities and can include rate reductions, payment extensions and principal deferrals. Company policy requires TDRs that are classified as nonaccrual loans after restructuring remain on nonaccrual until performance can be verified, which usually requires six months of performance under the restructured loan terms. Accruing restructured loans totaled $4.2 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $11.1 million at December 31, 2019. Accruing TDRs are excluded from nonperforming asset ratios. The tables below set forth details related to nonaccrual and accruing restructured loans.
At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, total TDRs (performing and nonperforming) were comprised of the following loans by type of modification:
During the year ended December 31, 2020, ten loans totaling $0.7 million were modified to a TDR, compared to nine loans totaling $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Loan modifications are not reported in calendar years after modification if the loans were modified at an interest rate equal to the yields of new loan originations with comparable risk and the loans are performing based on the terms of the restructuring agreements. There were no defaults on loans that had been
modified in TDRs within the twelve months preceding December 31, 2020 and four defaults totaling $3.2 million within the twelve months preceding December 31, 2019. A restructured loan is considered in default when it becomes 90 days or more past due under the modified terms, has been transferred to nonaccrual status, or has been transferred to OREO.
In accordance with regulatory reporting requirements, loans are placed on nonaccrual following the Retail Classification of Loan interagency guidance. The accrual of interest is generally discontinued on loans, except consumer loans, that become 90 days past due as to principal or interest unless collection of both principal and interest is assured by way of collateralization, guarantees or other security. Consumer loans that become 120 days past due are generally charged off. The loan carrying value is analyzed and any changes are appropriately made as described above quarterly.
Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans
On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASC Topic 326 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. The new guidance replaced the incurred loss model with an expected loss model, which is referred to as the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) model. The CECL model is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loan receivables and held-to-maturity debt securities. It also applies to off-balance sheet credit exposure such as loan commitments, standby letters of credit, financial guarantees and other similar instruments.
Management estimates the allowance using relevant available information, from both internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit losses provide the basis for estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level, loan to value ratios, borrower credit characteristics, loan seasoning or term as well as for changes in environmental conditions, such as changes in unemployment rates, property values, occupancy rates, and other macroeconomic metrics.
Upon adoption of the new model, the initial adjustment to the allowance for credit losses was an increase of $21.2 million, bringing the ratio of allowance to total loans from 0.68% at December 31, 2019 to 1.08% at January 1, 2020. The increase was attributed to the new requirement to estimate losses over the full remaining expected life of the loans and to the impact of the new guidance on the Company's acquired loan portfolio. The economic forecast scenario as of January 1, 2020 projected a stable macroeconomic environment over the three year forecast period. In addition to the $21.2 million impact of the initial adoption of ASC Topic 326, increases in the allowance during 2020 reflected the deterioration of the current and forecasted macroeconomic environment with the onset and continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic.
No allowance has been assigned to PPP loans, which are guaranteed by the U.S. government. Net charge-offs for 2020 were $7.6 million, or 0.14% of average loans, excluding PPP loans, compared to $8.1 million, or 0.16%, for 2019. Excluding PPP loans, the ratio of allowance to total loans increased to 1.79% at December 31, 2020 from 0.68% at December 31, 2019 and 1.08% at January 1, 2020. Uncertainty related to market conditions and the economic outlook will likely continue as the ongoing effects of the pandemic and the impact of additional government assistance programs remain unknown.
Activity in the allowance for credit losses is summarized as follows:
Concentrations of credit risk, discussed under the caption “Loan Portfolio” of this discussion and analysis, can affect the level of the allowance and may involve loans to one borrower, an affiliated group of borrowers, borrowers engaged in or dependent upon the same industry, or a group of borrowers whose loans are predicated on the same type of collateral. At December 31, 2020, the Company's largest concentrations of credit risk were $2.5 billion in loans secured by commercial real estate and $1.3 billion in loans secured by residential real estate, representing 45% and 23% of total loans outstanding, respectively. In addition, the Company is subject to a geographic concentration of credit because it primarily operates in Florida.
With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 leading to significant market changes, high levels of unemployment and increasing degrees of uncertainty in the U.S. economy, the impact on expected losses on loans is difficult to estimate with precision, and it is possible that additional provisions for credit losses could be needed in future periods.
LIBOR Transition
The Company, along with the entire financial services industry, is preparing for the expected phase-out of the benchmark London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). In preparing for the transition from LIBOR, the Company has formed a LIBOR transition steering committee which is responsible for overseeing the execution of the Company's enterprise-wide LIBOR transition program, and for evaluating and mitigating the risks associated with the transition from LIBOR. The LIBOR transition program includes a comprehensive review of the financial products, agreements, contracts and business processes that may use LIBOR as a reference rate, and the development and execution of a strategy to transition away from LIBOR, with appropriate consideration of the potential financial, customer, counterparty, regulatory and legal impacts.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company has identified approximately $400 million in loans for which the repricing index is tied to LIBOR. The Company also invests in securities and has issued subordinated debt tied to LIBOR. The Company’s back-to-back swap agreements with customers and other derivatives are governed by the International Swap Dealers Association (“ISDA”). ISDA has developed fallback language for swap agreements and has established a protocol to allow counterparties to modify legacy trades to include the new fallback language. The Company continues to monitor regulatory and legislative activity with regard to LIBOR-based products to identify all necessary actions and facilitate the transition to alternative reference rates.
The Company has adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform: Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, and the subsequent amendment, which provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform (e.g., discontinuation of LIBOR) if certain criteria are met. The Company will apply the accounting relief as relevant contract and hedge accounting relationship modifications are made during the reference rate reform transition period, and does not expect the standard to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
Cash and Cash Equivalents, Liquidity Risk Management and Contractual Commitments
Liquidity risk involves the risk of being unable to fund assets with the appropriate duration and rate-based liability, as well as the risk of not being able to meet unexpected cash needs. Liquidity planning and management are necessary to ensure the ability to fund operations cost effectively and to meet current and future potential obligations such as loan commitments and unexpected deposit outflows.
Funding sources include primarily customer-based deposits, collateral-backed borrowings, brokered deposits, cash flows from operations, cash flows from our loan and investment portfolios and asset sales, primarily secondary marketing for residential real estate mortgages and marine loans. Cash flows from operations are a significant component of liquidity risk management and the Company considers both deposit maturities and the scheduled cash flows from loan and investment maturities and payments when managing risk.
The Company does not rely on and is not dependent on off-balance sheet financing or significant amounts of wholesale funding. Brokered certificates of deposit (“CDs”) at December 31, 2020 totaled $233.8 million, compared to $472.9 million at December 31, 2019. All of the brokered CDs outstanding at December 31, 2020 have maturities of 12 months or less.
Deposits are a primary source of liquidity. The stability of this funding source is affected by numerous factors, including returns available to customers on alternative investments, the quality of customer service levels, perception of safety and competitive forces. The Company routinely uses debt securities and loans as collateral for secured borrowings. In the event of severe market disruptions, the Company has access to secured borrowings through the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta under its borrower-in-custody program.
Cash and cash equivalents, including interest bearing deposits, totaled $404.1 million on a consolidated basis at December 31, 2020, compared to $124.5 million at December 31, 2019. Higher cash and cash equivalent balances at December 31, 2020
reflect the Company's decision to maintain prudent higher levels of liquidity in the current economic environment, as well as higher customer deposit balances.
Contractual maturities for assets and liabilities are reviewed to meet current and expected future liquidity requirements. Sources of liquidity, both anticipated and unanticipated, are maintained through a portfolio of high-quality marketable assets, such as residential mortgage loans, available-for-sale debt securities and interest-bearing deposits. The Company is also able to provide short-term financing of its activities by selling, under an agreement to repurchase, United States Treasury and government agency debt securities not pledged to secure public deposits or trust funds. At December 31, 2020, the Company had available unsecured lines of $135.0 million and lines of credit under current lendable collateral value, which are subject to change, of $1.8 billion. In addition, the Company had $1.2 billion of debt securities and $733.3 million in residential and commercial real estate loans available as collateral. In comparison, at December 31, 2019, the Company had available unsecured lines of $130.0 million and lines of credit of $1.1 billion, and $924.2 million of debt securities and $830.0 million in residential and commercial real estate loans available as collateral.
The Company has traditionally relied upon dividends from Seacoast Bank and securities offerings to provide funds to pay the Company’s expenses and to service the Company’s debt. During 2020, Seacoast Bank distributed $20.2 million to the Company and, at December 31, 2020, is eligible to distribute dividends to the Company of approximately $213.4 million without prior approval. Seacoast Bank distributed $18.1 million to the Company during 2019. At December 31, 2020, the Company had cash and cash equivalents at the parent of approximately $70.1 million compared to $53.0 million at December 31, 2019.
The following table presents contractual obligations. All deposits presented in the table with indeterminate maturities such as interest bearing and noninterest bearing demand deposits, savings accounts and money market accounts are presented as having a maturity of one year or less. The Company considers these low cost deposits to be its largest, most stable funding source, despite no contracted maturity.
Deposits and Borrowings
The Company’s balance sheet continues to be primarily funded by core deposits.
Total deposits increased $1.3 billion, or 24%, to $6.9 billion at December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019. The FBPB and Freedom Bank acquisitions added deposits of $173.7 million and $329.7 million, respectively, in 2020.
Since December 31, 2019, interest bearing deposits, which includes interest bearing demand, savings and money markets deposits, increased $1.0 billion, or 36%, to $3.8 billion at December 31, 2020, noninterest bearing demand deposits increased $699.3 million, or 44%, to $2.3 billion, and CDs decreased $353.9 million, or 30%, to $831.2 million. Noninterest demand deposits represented 33% of deposits at December 31, 2020 and 28% at December 31, 2019. Overall, customer balances increased on a year-over-year basis
Customer repurchase agreements totaled $119.6 million at December 31, 2020, increasing $33.5 million, or 39%, from December 31, 2019. Repurchase agreements are offered by Seacoast to select customers who wish to sweep excess balances on a daily basis for investment purposes. The increase reflects a shift in customer balances from interest bearing deposits in 2020 as rates declined in 2020. Public funds comprise a significant amount of the outstanding balance.
The Company participates in programs with third party deposit networks as part of its cash management strategy. Through these programs, the Company can offer its customers access to FDIC insurance on large balances, and the Company can retain or sell, on an overnight basis, the underlying deposits. At December 31, 2020, the Company had sold, on an overnight basis, $112.7 million in deposits. These deposits are not included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
No unsecured federal funds purchased were outstanding at December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019.
Borrowings were comprised of subordinated debt related to trust preferred securities issued by trusts organized or acquired by the Company of $71.4 million and $71.1 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, and borrowings from the FHLB of zero and $315.0 million, respectively. Secured FHLB borrowings are an integral tool in liquidity management for the Company.
The Company issued subordinated debt in conjunction with its wholly owned trust subsidiaries in connection with bank acquisitions in previous years. The acquired junior subordinated debentures (in accordance with ASC Topic 805 Business Combinations) were recorded at fair value, which collectively is $3.9 million lower than face value at December 31, 2020. This amount is being amortized into interest expense over the acquired subordinated debts’ remaining term to maturity. All trust preferred securities are guaranteed by the Company on a junior subordinated basis.
Under Basel III and Federal Reserve rules, qualified trust preferred securities and other restricted capital elements can be included as Tier 1 capital, within limitations. The Company believes that its trust preferred securities qualify under these capital rules. The weighted average interest rate of our outstanding subordinated debt related to trust preferred securities was 3.07% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 4.75% in 2019.
Go to “Note J - Borrowings” to the Company's consolidated financial statements for more detailed information pertaining to borrowings.
Off-Balance Sheet Transactions
In the normal course of business, the Company may engage in a variety of financial transactions that, under generally accepted accounting principles, either are not recorded on the balance sheet or are recorded on the balance sheet in amounts that differ from the full contract or notional amounts. These transactions involve varying elements of market, credit and liquidity risk.
Lending commitments include unfunded loan commitments and standby and commercial letters of credit. For loan commitments, the contractual amount of a commitment represents the maximum potential credit risk that could result if the entire commitment had been funded, the borrower had not performed according to the terms of the contract, and no collateral had been provided. A large majority of loan commitments and standby letters of credit expire without being funded, and accordingly, total contractual amounts are not representative of our actual future credit exposure or liquidity requirements. Loan commitments and letters of credit expose the Company to credit risk in the event that the customer draws on the commitment and subsequently fails to perform under the terms of the lending agreement.
For commercial customers, loan commitments generally take the form of revolving credit arrangements. For retail customers, loan commitments are generally lines of credit secured by residential property. These instruments are not recorded on the balance sheet until funds are advanced under the commitment. Loan commitments were $1.5 billion at December 31, 2020, and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2019 (see “Note Q - Contingent Liabilities and Commitments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements).
Capital Resources and Management
Table 6 summarizes the Company’s capital position and selected ratios.
The Company's equity capital at December 31, 2020 increased $144.8 million, or 15%, from December 31, 2019, to $1.1 billion.
The ratio of shareholders’ equity to period end total assets was 13.55% and 13.87% at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The ratio of tangible shareholders’ equity to tangible assets was 11.01% and 11.05% at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Equity has increased as a result of earnings retained by the Company, the issuance of common stock in conjunction with bank acquisitions, and as a result of increases in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) during the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily reflecting the impact of lower interest rates on available-for-sale securities.
Activity in shareholders’ equity for the year ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 follows:
Capital ratios are well above regulatory requirements for well-capitalized institutions. Management’s use of risk-based capital ratios in its analysis of the Company’s capital adequacy are not GAAP financial measures. Seacoast’s management uses these measures to assess the quality of capital and believes that investors may find it useful in their analysis of the Company. The capital measures are not necessarily comparable to similar capital measures that may be presented by other companies and Seacoast does not nor should investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for GAAP financial information (see “Table 6 - Capital Resources” and “Note O - Shareholders’ Equity”).
The Company’s total risk-based capital ratio was 18.51% at December 31, 2020, an increase from 15.71% at December 31, 2019. Higher earnings have been a primary contributor to this increase. As of December 31, 2020, the Bank’s leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to adjusted total assets) was 11.03%, compared to 11.38% at December 31, 2019.
The Company and Seacoast Bank are subject to various general regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain adequate capital above regulatory minimums. The appropriate federal bank regulatory authority may prohibit the payment of dividends where it has determined that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice. The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from Seacoast Bank and its other subsidiaries, and the Company’s primary source of cash and liquidity, other than securities offerings and borrowings, is dividends from its bank subsidiary. Without Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) approval, Seacoast Bank can pay up to $213.4 million of dividends to the Company (see “Part I. Item 1. Business”).
The OCC and the Federal Reserve have policies that encourage banks and bank holding companies to pay dividends from current earnings, and have the general authority to limit the dividends paid by national banks and bank holding companies, respectively, if such payment may be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. If, in the particular circumstances, either of these federal regulators determined that the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice, either the OCC or the Federal Reserve may, among other things, issue a cease and desist order prohibiting the payment of dividends by Seacoast Bank or the Company, respectively. Under a recently adopted Federal Reserve policy, the board of directors of a bank holding company must consider different factors to ensure that its dividend level is prudent relative to the organization’s financial position and is not based on overly optimistic earnings scenarios such as any potential events that may occur before the payment date that could affect its ability to pay, while still maintaining a strong financial position. As a general matter, the Federal Reserve has indicated that the board of directors of a bank holding company, such as Seacoast, should consult with the Federal Reserve and eliminate, defer, or significantly reduce the bank holding company’s dividends if: (i) its net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (ii) its prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with its capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or (iii) it will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.
The Company has seven wholly owned trust subsidiaries that issued trust preferred securities, all of which are guaranteed by the Company on a junior subordinated basis. The Federal Reserve’s rules permit qualified trust preferred securities and other
restricted capital elements to be included under Basel III capital guidelines, with limitations, and net of goodwill and intangibles. The Company believes that its trust preferred securities qualify under these revised regulatory capital rules and believes that it will be able to treat all $71.4 million of trust preferred securities as Tier 1 capital. For regulatory purposes, the trust preferred securities are added to the Company’s tangible common shareholders’ equity to calculate Tier 1 capital.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, (“GAAP”), including prevailing practices within the financial services industry. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments in the application of certain of its accounting policies that involve significant estimates and assumptions. The Company has established policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period. These estimates and assumptions, which may materially affect the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements, and changes in this information over time and the use of revised estimates and assumptions could materially affect amounts reported in subsequent financial statements. Management, after consultation with the Company’s Audit Committee, believes the most critical accounting estimates and assumptions that involve the most difficult, subjective and complex assessments are:
•the allowance and the provision for credit losses;
•acquisition accounting and purchased loans;
•intangible assets and impairment testing;
•other fair value measurements;
•impairment of debt securities, and;
•contingent liabilities.
The following is a discussion of the critical accounting policies intended to facilitate a reader’s understanding of the judgments, estimates and assumptions underlying these accounting policies and the possible or likely events or uncertainties known to the Company that could have a material effect on reported financial information. For more information regarding management’s judgments relating to significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements, see “Note A-Significant Accounting Policies” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Allowance for Credit Losses - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASC Topic 326 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, which replaced the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred to as the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) methodology.
For loans, management estimates the allowance for credit losses using relevant available information, from both internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit losses provide the basis for estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level, loan to value ratios, borrower credit characteristics, loan seasoning or term as well as for changes in environmental conditions, such as changes in unemployment rates, property values, occupancy rates, and other macroeconomic metrics.
The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective basis when similar risk characteristics exist. The Company has developed an allowance model based on an analysis of probability of default (“PD”) and loss given default (“LGD”) to determine an expected loss by loan segment. PDs and LGDs are developed by analyzing the average historical loss migration of loans to default.
The allowance estimation process also applies an economic forecast scenario over a three year forecast period. The forecast may utilize one scenario or a composite of scenarios based on management's judgment and expectations around the current and future macroeconomic outlook. Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. For portfolio segments with a weighted average life longer than three years, the Company reverts to longer-term historical loss experience, adjusted for prepayments, to estimate losses over the remaining life of the loans within each segment.
Adjustments may be made to baseline reserves for some of the loan pools based on an assessment of internal and external influences on credit quality not fully reflected in the quantitative components of the allowance model. These influences may include elements such as changes in concentration, macroeconomic conditions, recent observable asset quality trends, staff turnover, regional market conditions, employment levels and loan growth. Based upon management's assessments of these factors, the Company may apply qualitative adjustments to the allowance.
Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Loans evaluated individually are not also included in the collective evaluation. When management determines that foreclosure is probable, expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date, adjusted for selling costs as appropriate.
The contractual term of a loan excludes expected extensions, renewals, and modification unless either of the following applies: management has a reasonable expectation at the reporting date that a troubled debt restructuring will be executed with an individual borrower or the extension or renewal options are included in the original or modified contract at the reporting date and not unconditionally cancellable by the Company.
The allowance for credit losses on troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) is measured using the same method as all other loans held for investment, except when the value of a concession cannot be measured using a method other than the discounted cash flow method. When the value of a concession is measured using the discounted cash flow method, the allowance for credit losses is determining by discounting the expected future cash flows at the original interest rate of the loan.
It is the Company's practice to ensure that the charge-off policy meets or exceeds regulatory requirements. Losses on unsecured consumer loans are recognized at 90 days past due, compared to the regulatory loss criteria of 120 days. In compliance with Federal Financial Institution Examination Council guidelines, secured consumer loans, including residential real estate, are typically charged off or charged down between 120 and 180 days past due, depending on the collateral type. Commercial loans and real estate loans are typically placed on nonaccrual status when principal or interest is past due for 90 days or more, unless the loan is both secured by collateral having realizable value sufficient to discharge the debt in-full and the loan is in process of collection. Loans provided with short-term payment deferrals under the CARES Act or interagency guidance are not considered past due if in compliance with the terms of their deferral. Secured loans may be charged down to the estimated value of the collateral with previously accrued unpaid interest reversed against interest income. Subsequent charge-offs may be required as a result of changes in the market value of collateral or other repayment prospects. Initial charge-off amounts are based on valuation estimates derived from appraisals, broker price opinions, or other market information. Generally, new appraisals are not received until the foreclosure process is completed; however, collateral values are evaluated periodically based on market information and incremental charge-offs are recorded if it is determined that collateral values have declined from their initial estimates.
Note F to the financial statements (titled “Allowance for Credit Losses”) summarizes the Company’s allocation of the allowance for credit losses on loans by loan segment and provides detail regarding charge-offs and recoveries for each loan segment and the composition of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Acquisition Accounting and Purchased Loans - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The Company accounts for acquisitions under ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, which requires the use of the acquisition method of accounting. All identifiable assets acquired, including loans, are recorded at fair value. All loans acquired are recorded at fair value in accordance with the fair value methodology prescribed in ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement. The fair value estimates associated with the loans include estimates related to expected prepayments and the amount and timing of expected principal, interest and other cash flows. Loans are identified as purchased credit deteriorated (“PCD”) when they have experienced more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination. An allowance for expected credit losses on PCD loans is recorded at the date of acquisition through an adjustment to the loans’ amortized cost basis. In contrast, expected credit losses on loans not considered PCD are recognized in net income at the date of acquisition.
Fair value estimates for acquired assets and assumed liabilities are based on the information available, and are subject to change
for up to one year after the closing date of the acquisition as additional information relative to closing date fair values becomes
available.
Intangible Assets and Impairment Testing - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Intangible assets consist of goodwill, core deposit intangibles and loan servicing rights. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business acquisitions. The core deposit intangible represents the excess intangible value of acquired deposit customer relationships as determined by valuation specialists. Core deposit intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis, and are evaluated for indications of potential impairment at least annually.
Goodwill is not amortized but rather is evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis. We performed an annual impairment test of goodwill as required by ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, in the fourth quarter of 2020 with the assistance of third-party valuation specialists, and concluded that no impairment existed.
Fair value estimates for acquired assets and assumed liabilities are based on the information available, and are subject to change for up to one year after the closing date of the acquisition as additional information relative to closing date fair values becomes available.
Other Fair Value Measurements - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The fair value of collateral-dependent loans, OREO and repossessed assets is typically based on current appraisals, which are reviewed quarterly to determine if fair value adjustments are necessary based on known changes in the market and/or the project assumptions. When necessary, the appraised value may be adjusted based on more recent appraisal assumptions received by the Company on other similar properties, the tax assessed market value, comparative sales and/or an internal valuation. Collateral-dependent loans are loans where repayment is solely dependent on the liquidation of the collateral or operation of the collateral for repayment.
The Company also holds 11,330 shares of Visa Class B stock which, following resolution of Visa’s litigation, will be converted to Visa Class A shares. Under the current conversion rate that became effective September 27, 2019, the Company expects to receive 1.6228 shares of Class A stock for each share of Class B stock, for a total of 18,386 shares of Visa Class A stock. The Company's ownership is related to prior ownership in Visa’s network while Visa operated as a cooperative. This ownership is recorded on the Company's financial records at a zero basis.
Impairment of Debt Securities - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASC Topic 326 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, which requires expected credit losses on both held-to-maturity (“HTM”) and available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities to be recognized through a valuation allowance instead of as a direct write-down to the amortized cost basis of the security. For HTM securities, the guidance requires management to estimate expected credit losses over the remaining expected life and recognize this estimate as an allowance for credit losses. An AFS security is considered impaired if the fair value is less than amortized cost basis. For AFS securities, if any portion of the decline in fair value is related to credit, the amount of allowance is determined as the portion related to credit, limited to the difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value of the security. If the fair value of the security increases in subsequent periods, or changes in factors used within the credit loss assessment result in a change in the estimated credit loss, the Company would reflect the change by decreasing the allowance. If the Company has the intent to sell or believes it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell an impaired AFS security before recovery of the amortized cost basis, the credit loss is recorded as a direct write-down of the amortized cost basis. Declines in the fair value of AFS securities that are not considered credit related are recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Seacoast analyzes AFS debt securities quarterly for credit losses. The analysis is performed on an individual security basis for all securities where fair value has declined below amortized cost. Fair value is based upon pricing obtained from third party pricing services. Based on internal review procedures and the fair values provided by the pricing services, the Company believes that the fair values provided by the pricing services are consistent with the principles of ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement. However, on occasion pricing provided by the pricing services may not be consistent with other observed prices in the market for similar securities. Using observable market factors, including interest rate and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities and default rates, the Company may at times validate the observed prices using a discounted cash flow model and using the observed prices for similar securities to determine the fair value of its securities.
The Company utilizes both quantitative and qualitative assessments to determine if a security has a credit loss. Quantitative assessments are based on a discounted cash flow method. Qualitative assessments consider a range of factors including: percent decline in fair value, rating downgrades, subordination, duration, amortized loan-to-value, and the ability of the issuers to pay all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms.
Contingent Liabilities - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Seacoast is subject to contingent liabilities, including judicial, regulatory and arbitration proceedings, and tax and other claims arising from the conduct of the Company's business activities. These proceedings include actions brought against the Company and/or its subsidiaries with respect to transactions in which the Company and/or its subsidiaries acted as a lender, a financial adviser, a broker or acted in a related activity. Accruals are established for legal and other claims when it becomes probable that the Company will incur an expense and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Company management, together with attorneys, consultants and other professionals, assesses the probability and estimated amounts involved in a contingency. Throughout the life of a contingency, the Company or its advisers may learn of additional information that can affect the assessments about probability or about the estimates of amounts involved. Changes in these assessments can lead to changes in recorded reserves. In addition, the actual costs of resolving these claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts reserved for the claims. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had no significant accruals for contingent liabilities and had no known pending matters that could potentially be significant.
