The following includes a comparison of our consolidated results of operations, our segment results and financial position for fiscal years 2021 and 2020. For a comparison of our consolidated results of operations, segment results and financial position for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, see Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2020, filed with the SEC on August 18, 2020.
Our Company
We market and distribute over 250,000 food and food-related products to customers across the United States from approximately 107 distribution facilities to over 250,000 customer locations in the “food-away-from-home” industry. We offer our customers a broad assortment of products including our proprietary-branded products, nationally branded products, and products bearing our customers’ brands. Our product assortment ranges from “center-of-the-plate” items (such as beef, pork, poultry, and seafood), frozen foods, and groceries to candy, snacks, beverages, cigarettes, and other tobacco products. We also sell disposables, cleaning and kitchen supplies, and related products used by our customers. In addition to the products we offer to our customers, we provide value-added services by allowing our customers to benefit from our industry knowledge, scale, and expertise in the areas of product selection and procurement, menu development, and operational strategy.
The Company has two reportable segments: Foodservice and Vistar. Our Foodservice segment distributes a broad line of national brands, customer brands, and our proprietary-branded food and food-related products, or “Performance Brands.” Foodservice sells to independent and multi-unit “Chain” restaurants and other institutions such as schools, healthcare facilities, business and industry locations, and retail establishments. Our Chain customers are multi-unit restaurants with five or more locations and include some of the most recognizable family and casual dining restaurant chains. Our Vistar segment specializes in distributing candy, snacks, beverages, cigarettes, other tobacco products, and other items nationally to the vending, office coffee service, theater, retail, hospitality, convenience, and other channels. We believe that there are substantial synergies across our segments. Cross-segment synergies include procurement, operational best practices such as the use of new productivity technologies, and supply chain and network optimization, as well as shared corporate functions such as accounting, treasury, tax, legal, information systems, and human resources.
The Company’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to June 30th. This resulted in a 53-week year for fiscal 2021 and a 52-week year for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019. References to “fiscal 2021” are to the 53-week period ended July 3, 2021, references to “fiscal 2020” are to the 52-week period ended June 27, 2020, and references to “fiscal 2019” are to the 52-week period ended June 29, 2019.
Key Factors Affecting Our Business
We believe that our short-term performance has been, and is expected to continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
In response to the rapid spread of COVID-19 across the country, federal, state, and local governments implemented measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, shutdowns, and social distancing requirements. These measures adversely affected workforces, suppliers, customers, consumer sentiment, economies, and financial markets, and, along with decreased consumer spending, led to an economic downturn in many of our markets.
As an essential element of the country’s food supply chain, the Company has continued to operate all of it distribution centers. Despite the Company’s continued operations, mandatory and voluntary containment measures in response to COVID-19 had a significant impact on the food-away-from-home industry. Many restaurants have closed, are restricting the number of patrons they will serve at one time, or are only providing carry-out or delivery options. These restrictions also impacted businesses throughout the economy, including theaters, retail operations, schools, and other businesses to whom we provide products and services, which collectively have adversely affected our results of operations.
During fiscal 2021, we continued to experience the adverse impact of COVID-19 on our operations, including significant decreases in sales. Despite these difficulties, we have taken steps to ensure a strong financial position, including steps to maintain financial liquidity, forging new customer relationships, supporting restaurant customers with the transition to higher volumes of take-out and delivery, and other means.
Even as governmental restrictions are eased and economies gradually, partially, or fully reopen in certain states and markets, the ongoing economic impacts and health concerns associated with the pandemic, as well as the potential for restrictions being re-implemented as COVID-19 cases rise, may continue to adversely affect consumer behavior and spending in the channels we serve. The extent to which these changes will affect our future financial position, liquidity, and results of operations remains uncertain. For further discussion of this matter, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in Part I of this Form 10-K.
Despite the near-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that our long-term performance is principally affected by the following key factors:
•
Changing demographic and macroeconomic trends. Until recently, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the share of consumer spending captured by the food-away-from-home industry has increased steadily for several decades. The share increases in periods of increasing employment, rising disposable income, increases in the number of restaurants, and favorable demographic trends, such as smaller household sizes, an increasing number of dual income households, and an aging population base that spends more per capita at foodservice establishments. The foodservice distribution industry is also sensitive to national and regional economic conditions, such as changes in consumer spending, changes in consumer confidence, and changes in the prices of certain goods.
•
Food distribution market structure. The food distribution market consists of a wide spectrum of companies ranging from businesses selling a single category of product (e.g., produce) to large national and regional broadline distributors with many distribution centers and thousands of products across all categories. We believe our scale enables us to invest in our Performance Brands, to benefit from economies of scale in purchasing and procurement, and to drive supply chain efficiencies that enhance our customers’ satisfaction and profitability. We believe that the relative growth of larger foodservice distributors will continue to outpace that of smaller, independent players in our industry.
•
Our ability to successfully execute our segment strategies and implement our initiatives. Our performance will continue to depend on our ability to successfully execute our segment strategies and to implement our current and future initiatives. The key strategies include focusing on independent sales and Performance Brands, pursuing new customers for both of our reportable segments, expansion of geographies, utilizing our infrastructure to gain further operating and purchasing efficiencies, and making strategic acquisitions.
How We Assess the Performance of Our Business
In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. The key measures used by our management are discussed below. The percentages on the results presented below are calculated based on rounded numbers.
Net Sales
Net sales is equal to gross sales, plus excise taxes, minus sales returns; minus sales incentives that we offer to our customers, such as rebates and discounts that are offsets to gross sales; and certain other adjustments. Our net sales are driven by changes in case volumes, product inflation that is reflected in the pricing of our products, and mix of products sold.
Gross Profit
Gross profit is equal to our net sales minus our cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold primarily includes inventory costs (net of supplier consideration) and inbound freight. Cost of goods sold generally changes as we incur higher or lower costs from our suppliers and as our customer and product mix changes.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
Management measures operating performance based on our EBITDA, defined as net income before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and is not a measure of operating income, operating performance, or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP and is subject to important limitations. Our definition of EBITDA may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.
We believe that the presentation of EBITDA enhances an investor’s understanding of our performance. We use this measure to evaluate the performance of our segments and for business planning purposes. We present EBITDA in order to provide supplemental information that we consider relevant for the readers of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report, and such information is not meant to replace or supersede GAAP measures.
In addition, our management uses Adjusted EBITDA, defined as net income before interest expense, interest income, income and franchise taxes, and depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude certain items that we do not consider part of our core operating results. Such adjustments include certain unusual, non-cash, non-recurring, cost reduction, and other adjustment items permitted in calculating covenant compliance under our ABL Facility and indentures (other than certain pro forma adjustments permitted under our ABL Facility and indentures governing the Notes due 2024, Notes due 2025, Notes due 2027, and Notes due 2029 relating to the Adjusted EBITDA contribution of acquired entities or businesses prior to the acquisition date). Under our ABL Facility and indentures, our ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring certain additional indebtedness, making certain investments, and making restricted payments is tied to ratios based on Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in our ABL Facility and indentures). Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.
Adjusted EBITDA is not defined under GAAP and is subject to important limitations. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties, including our lenders under the ABL Facility and holders of our Notes due 2024, Notes due 2025, Notes due 2027, and Notes due 2029, in their evaluation of the operating performance of companies in industries similar to ours. In addition, targets based on Adjusted EBITDA are among the measures we use to evaluate our management’s performance for purposes of determining their compensation under our incentive plans.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have important limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. For example, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:
•
exclude certain tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us;
•
do not reflect any cash capital expenditure requirements for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may have to be replaced in the future;
•
do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; and
•
do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements, necessary to service our debt.
In calculating Adjusted EBITDA, we add back certain non-cash, non-recurring, and other items as permitted or required by our ABL Facility and indentures. Adjusted EBITDA among other things:
•
does not include non-cash stock-based employee compensation expense and certain other non-cash charges; and
•
does not include acquisition, restructuring, and other costs incurred to realize future cost savings and enhance our operations.
We have included the calculations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented.
Results of Operations, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA
The following table sets forth a summary of our results of operations, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated (dollars in millions, except per share data):
We believe that the most directly comparable GAAP measure to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is net income. The following table reconciles EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net income for the periods presented:
(1)
Includes adjustments for non-cash charges arising from stock-based compensation and gain/loss on disposal of assets. Stock-based compensation cost was $25.4 million, $17.9 million and $15.7 million for fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively. In addition, this includes increases in the last-in-first-out (“LIFO”) reserve of $11.8 million for Foodservice and $24.6 million for Vistar for fiscal 2021 compared to increases of $0.8 million for Foodservice and $3.1 million for Vistar for fiscal 2020 and an increase of $3.4 million for Foodservice and no change for Vistar for fiscal 2019.
(2)
Includes professional fees and other costs related to completed and abandoned acquisitions, costs of integrating certain of our facilities, facility closing costs, advisory fees and offering fees. Fiscal 2020 includes $108.6 million of contingent consideration
accretion expense related to the acquisition of Eby-Brown and $9.3 million of costs related to information technology projects the Company is no longer pursuing as a result of the acquisition of Reinhart Foodservice L.L.C. (“Reinhart”).
(3)
Consists primarily of amounts related to fuel collar derivatives, certain financing transactions, lease amendments, legal settlements and franchise tax expense, and other adjustments permitted by our ABL Facility. This line item includes development costs of $5.8 million for fiscal 2020 related to certain productivity initiatives the Company is no longer pursuing as a result of the Reinhart acquisition.
Consolidated Results of Operations
Fiscal year ended July 3, 2021 compared to fiscal year ended June 27, 2020
Net Sales
Net sales growth is primarily a function of case growth, pricing (which is primarily based on product inflation/deflation), and a changing mix of customers, channels, and product categories sold. Net sales increased $5,312.6 million, or 21.2%, in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Reinhart on December 31, 2019, along with the 53rd week in fiscal year 2021. Net sales for the extra week in fiscal 2021 were approximately $664.6 million. The acquisition of Reinhart contributed $6,049.3 million of net sales in fiscal 2021, compared to $2,525.0 million in fiscal 2020.
Case volume increased 15.4% in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. Excluding the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2021, case volume increased 13.0% compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of the Reinhart acquisition for the first half of fiscal 2021, organic case volume increased 2.7% in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020.
Gross Profit
Gross profit increased $656.0 million, or 22.9%, for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. The increase in gross profit was primarily driven by the acquisition of Reinhart and the 53rd week in fiscal 2021. The acquisition of Reinhart contributed an increase in gross profit of $501.4 million for fiscal 2021, compared to the prior year. Also, gross profit increased due to an increase in the gross profit per case driven by case growth in Foodservice, particularly in the independent channel. Independent customers typically receive more services from us, cost more to serve, and pay a higher gross profit per case than other customers. The Company estimates the increase in gross profit for the extra week in fiscal 2021 was approximately $76.1 million.
Additionally, for fiscal 2021, the Company recorded a total of $36.9 million of inventory write-offs primarily as a result of the impact of COVID-19 on our operations, compared to $54.5 million for fiscal 2020. This decrease was primarily a result of the recent improvements in economic conditions. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 11.6% for fiscal 2021 compared to 11.4% for fiscal 2020.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses increased $356.3 million, or 12.0%, for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by the acquisition of Reinhart and the 53rd week in fiscal 2021. Reinhart contributed an additional $315.6 million of operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, for fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020. The Company estimates operating expenses for the 53rd week in fiscal 2021 was approximately $70.4 million.
Excluding the impact of Reinhart and the 53rd week in fiscal 2021, operating expenses decreased as a result of a decrease in contingent consideration accretion expense of $109.7 million, professional fees of $28.4 million, and insurance expense of $6.2 million. Additionally, in fiscal 2021, the Company recorded a benefit of $24.9 million related to reserves related to expected credit losses for customer receivables, as compared to bad debt expense of $78.0 million in the prior year. These decreases were partially offset by a $78.6 million increase in bonus expense for fiscal 2021, along with increases in other personnel expenses and the increase in case volume and the resulting impact on variable operational and selling expenses in fiscal 2021 compared to the prior year period.
Depreciation and amortization of intangible assets increased from $276.3 million in fiscal 2020 to $338.9 million in fiscal 2021, an increase of 22.7%. This increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of Reinhart. Total depreciation and amortization related to the 53rd week in fiscal 2021 was approximately $6.6 million.
Net Income (Loss)
Net income was $40.7 million for fiscal 2021, as compared to a net loss of $114.1 million for fiscal 2020. This increase in net income was attributable to the $299.7 million increase in operating profit, partially offset by increases in interest expense and income tax expense. The increase in interest expense was primarily the result of an increase in average borrowings outstanding along with a higher average interest rate during fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020.
The Company reported income tax expense of $14.0 million for fiscal 2021 compared to an income tax benefit of $108.1 million for fiscal 2020. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2021 was 25.6% compared to 48.6% in fiscal 2020. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 decreased from the prior year period primarily due to state taxes, stock compensation, and discrete items as a percentage of book income, which is significantly higher than the book income for fiscal 2020. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was impacted by the $46.3 million benefit from a federal net operating loss carryback to tax years with a statutory tax rate higher than the current statutory tax rate.
Segment Results
We have two reportable segments as described above - Foodservice and Vistar. Management evaluates the performance of these segments based various operating and financial metrics, including their respective sales growth and EBITDA.
Corporate & All Other is comprised of unallocated corporate overhead and certain operations that are not considered separate reportable segments based on their size. This includes the operations of our internal logistics unit responsible for managing and allocating inbound logistics revenue and expense.
The following tables set forth net sales and EBITDA by segment for the periods indicated (dollars in millions):
Net Sales
EBITDA
Segment Results-Foodservice
Fiscal year ended July 3, 2021 compared to fiscal year ended June 27, 2020
Net Sales
Net sales for Foodservice increased $5,149.5 million, or 30.8%, from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021. The increase in net sales was driven by the Reinhart acquisition and an increase in selling price per case as a result of inflation, as well as the 53rd week in fiscal 2021. Net sales for the extra week in fiscal 2021 were approximately $484.3 million. Reinhart contributed $6,049.3 million of net sales during fiscal 2021 compared to $2,525.0 million in fiscal 2020. The Reinhart acquisition also expanded business with independent customers, resulting in independent case growth of approximately 31.6% in fiscal 2021 compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of Reinhart, independent cases grew 12.6% in fiscal 2021 compared to the prior year, as a result of securing new and expanding business with independent customers. For fiscal 2021, independent sales as a percentage of total segment sales were 35.5%.
EBITDA
EBITDA for Foodservice increased $322.6 million, or 95.9%, from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021. This increase was the result of an increase in gross profit, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization. Gross profit increased 33.6% in fiscal 2021 compared to the prior fiscal year, driven by the Reinhart acquisition, which contributed an increase in
gross profit of $501.4 million for fiscal 2021. An increase in cases sold and an increase in gross profit per case also contributed to the increase in gross profit. The increase in gross profit per case was driven by a favorable shift in the mix of cases sold, including more Performance Brands products sold to independent customers. Cases sold to independent business result in higher gross margins within this segment. Additionally, for fiscal 2021, Foodservice recorded $29.8 million of inventory write-offs primarily driven by the economic impacts of COVID-19, which was a decrease of $9.1 million compared to the prior year. Gross profit for the 53rd week in fiscal 2021 was approximately $62.1 million.
Operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization for Foodservice increased by $391.0, or 21.8%, from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021. Operating expenses increased primarily as a result of the acquisition of Reinhart which contributed an additional $313.1 million of operating expenses for fiscal 2021. Excluding the impact of the additional Reinhart operating expenses, operating expense increased as a result of an increase in case volume and the resulting impact on variable operational and selling expenses, along with an increase in bonus expense of $40.6 million and an increase in other personnel expenses as compared to the prior year. These increases were partially offset by decreases in insurance expense of $14.4 million, fuel expense of $2.9 million, and the expense related to reserves for expected credit losses. In fiscal 2021, Foodservice recorded a benefit of $22.8 million related to reserves for expected credit losses as compared to bad debt expense of $63.1 million during fiscal 2020. The Company estimates that operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization for Foodservice were approximately $47.1 million in the 53rd week of fiscal 2021.
Depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets recorded in this segment increased from $197.7 million in fiscal 2020 to $248.3 million in fiscal 2021. Total depreciation and amortization related to the 53rd week in fiscal 2021 was approximately $4.7 million for Foodservice. Depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets increased as a result of the acquisition of Reinhart. Total additional incremental depreciation and amortization related to the acquisition of Reinhart was $48.9 million for fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior year.
Segment Results-Vistar
Fiscal year ended July 3, 2021 compared to fiscal year ended June 27, 2020
Net Sales
Net sales for Vistar increased $157.3 million, or 1.9%, from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021. The increase in net sales is driven by net sales of approximately $180.2 million in the 53rd week in fiscal 2021. Net sales for fiscal 2021 included $1.2 billion related to tobacco excise taxes, as compared to $1.1 billion for fiscal 2020. Due to the restrictions implemented by governments to slow the spread of COVID-19, there were significant declines in case volume in the theater, office coffee service, office supply, hospitality, and travel channels for fiscal 2021, however these declines have gradually improved, as certain states eased restrictions allowing many of our customers in these channels to resume operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.
EBITDA
EBITDA for Vistar increased $54.9 million, or 142.6%, from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021. This increase was the result of a decrease in operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization, partially offset by a decrease in gross profit. The gross profit dollar decrease of $58.7 million for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, was driven by the impact of COVID-19 on the channels we serve, partially offset by gross profit of approximately $13.7 million in the 53rd week in fiscal 2021. Additionally, for fiscal 2021, Vistar recorded $7.0 million of inventory write-offs primarily as result of the impact of COVID-19 on the channels we serve, which was a decrease of $8.6 million compared to the prior year. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales declined from 8.7% for fiscal 2020 to 7.8% for fiscal 2021 as a result of continued growth in the convenience store channel, which has lower margins.
Operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization decreased $113.8 million, or 16.6%, for fiscal 2021 compared to the prior year. Operating expenses decreased primarily as a result of decreased sales volume described above, decreases in personnel expenses, and a $109.8 million reduction in contingent consideration accretion expense for fiscal 2021 as compared to prior year period. Additionally, in fiscal 2021, Vistar recorded a benefit of $2.1 million related to reserves for expected credit losses for customer receivables as compared to bad debt expense of $14.7 million for the prior year. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in bonus expense of $21.0 million for fiscal 2021 compared to the prior year. The Company estimates that operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization for Vistar were approximately $11.8 million in the 53rd week of fiscal 2021.
Depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets recorded in this segment increased from $50.0 million in fiscal 2020 to $62.1 million in fiscal 2021. Total depreciation and amortization related to the 53rd week in fiscal 2021 was approximately $1.4 million for Vistar. Depreciation of fixed assets increased as a result of capital outlays to support the segment’s growth.
Segment Results-Corporate & All Other
Fiscal year ended July 3, 2021 compared to fiscal year ended June 27, 2020
Net Sales
Net sales for Corporate & All Other increased $72.5 million from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in logistics services provided to our other segments for increased case volume due to the acquisition of Reinhart as well as approximately $8.9 million of net sales for the 53rd week in fiscal 2021.
EBITDA
EBITDA for Corporate & All Other was a negative $206.3 million for fiscal 2021 compared to a negative $203.8 million for fiscal 2020. This decline in EBITDA was primarily driven by the additional corporate operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, of $2.5 million associated with the acquisition of Reinhart, as well as the additional week in fiscal 2021. Additionally, operating expenses increased as a result of an increase in annual bonus expense of $17.0 million and an increase in insurance expense of $7.9 million fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior year. These increases were partially offset by a decline of $29.0 million in fiscal 2021 for professional and legal fees related primarily to prior year acquisitions. The Company estimates that operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization were approximately $4.9 million in the 53rd week of fiscal 2021.
Depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets recorded in this segment was $28.5 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $28.6 million for fiscal 2020. Total depreciation and amortization related to the 53rd week in fiscal 2021 was approximately $0.5 million for Corporate & All Other.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We have historically financed our operations and growth primarily with cash flows from operations, borrowings under our credit facility, operating and finance leases, and normal trade credit terms. We have typically funded our acquisitions with additional borrowings under our credit facility. Our working capital and borrowing levels are subject to seasonal fluctuations, typically with the lowest borrowing levels in the third and fourth fiscal quarters and the highest borrowing levels occurring in the first and second fiscal quarters. We borrow under our credit facility or pay it down regularly based on our cash flows from operating and investing activities. Our practice is to minimize interest expense while maintaining reasonable liquidity.
As market conditions warrant, we may from time to time seek to repurchase our securities or loans in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Any such repurchases may be funded by incurring new debt, including additional borrowings under our credit facility. In addition, depending on conditions in the credit and capital markets and other factors, we will, from time to time, consider other financing transactions, the proceeds of which could be used to refinance our indebtedness, make investments or acquisitions or for other purposes. Any new debt may be secured debt.
In markets where governments have imposed restrictions on travel outside of the home, or where customers are practicing social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many of our customers, including restaurants, schools, hotels, movie theaters, and business and industry locations, have reduced or discontinued operations, which has adversely affected demand for our products and services. Even as governmental restrictions are eased and economies gradually, partially, or fully reopen in certain states and markets, the ongoing economic impacts and health concerns associated with the pandemic may continue to affect consumer behavior and spending in the channels we serve. The extent to which these changes will affect our future financial position, liquidity, and results of operations remains uncertain.
Our cash requirements over the next 12 months and beyond relate to our long-term debt and associated interest payments, operating and finance leases, and purchase obligations. For information regarding the Company’s expected cash requirements related to long-term debt and operating and finance leases, see Note 8. Debt and Note 12. Leases, respectively, of the consolidated financial statements. As of July 3, 2021, the Company had total purchase obligations of $93.5 million, which includes agreements for purchases related to capital projects and services in the normal course of business, for which all significant terms have been confirmed, as well as a minimum amount due for various Company meetings and conferences. Purchase obligations also include amounts committed to various capital projects in process or scheduled to be completed in the coming fiscal years. As of July 3, 2021, the Company had commitments of $68.8 million for capital projects related to warehouse expansion and improvements and warehouse equipment. The Company anticipates using cash flows from operations or borrowings under the ABL Facility to fulfill these commitments. Amounts due under these agreements were not included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of July 3, 2021.
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
We believe that our cash flows from operations and available borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements over at least the next 12 months, to maintain sufficient liquidity for normal operating purposes, and to fund capital expenditures.
On July 26, 2021, Performance Food Group, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of PFGC, Inc. (“PFGC”), issued and sold $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of its 4.250% Senior Notes due 2029 (the “Notes due 2029”), pursuant to an indenture dated as of July 26, 2021. The Notes due 2029 are jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by PFGC and all domestic direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of PFGC (other than captive insurance subsidiaries and other excluded subsidiaries). The Notes due 2029 are not guaranteed by the Company.
Initially, the Company expected to use the proceeds from the Notes due 2029 to finance the cash consideration payable in connection with the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition, to redeem the Notes due 2024, and to pay the fees, expenses, and other transaction costs incurred in connection with the Notes due 2029. However, since there is no requirement to hold the funds in escrow until the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition closes, a portion of the net proceeds from the Notes due 2029 were used to pay down the outstanding balance of the ABL Facility on July 26, 2021. The Notes due 2024 were redeemed in full on July 27, 2021. The Company now expects to fund the cash consideration for the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition with borrowings under the ABL Facility. If the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition is not consummated, Performance Food Group, Inc. will be required to redeem the Notes due 2029 at a price equal to 100% of the issue price plus accrued and unpaid interest.
In connection with the Core-Mark acquisition, the Company is seeking an amendment and restatement of the ABL Facility that would, among other things, provide an additional $1.0 billion of revolving and term loan commitments, for a total of up to $4.0 billion (the “ABL Amendment”). It is anticipated that the ABL Amendment will be consummated after closing of the Core-Mark acquisition.
At July 3, 2021, our cash balance totaled $22.2 million, including restricted cash of $11.1 million, as compared to a cash balance totaling $431.8 million, including restricted cash of $11.1 million, at June 27, 2020. The $409.6 million decrease in cash during fiscal 2021 was primarily due to the early pay off, in full, of the $110.0 million Additional Junior Term Loan (as defined below under “-Financing Activities”), $136.4 million in payments related to recent acquisitions, investments in working capital, and payments under our ABL Facility.
Operating Activities
Fiscal year ended July 3, 2021 compared to fiscal year ended June 27, 2020
During fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, our operating activities provided cash flow of $64.6 million and $623.6 million, respectively. The decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was largely driven by larger investments in net working capital and the payment of $117.3 million of contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Eby-Brown Company, LLC (“Eby-Brown”), partially offset by net income tax refunds of $117.4 million received during fiscal 2021.
Investing Activities
Cash used in investing activities totaled $199.8 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $2,146.0 million in fiscal 2020. These investments consisted primarily of capital purchases of property, plant, and equipment of $188.8 million and $158.0 million for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively, and payments for business acquisitions of $18.1 million and $1,989.0 million for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. In fiscal 2021, purchases of property, plant, and equipment primarily consisted of outlays for information technology, warehouse equipment, warehouse expansions and improvements, and transportation equipment.
The following table presents the capital purchases of property, plant, and equipment by segment:
Financing Activities
During fiscal 2021, our financing activities used cash flow of $274.4 million, which consisted primarily of $16.2 million in net payments under our ABL Facility, $136.4 million in payments related to recent acquisitions, $110.0 million in repayment of the Additional Junior Term Loan (as defined below), and $37.9 million in payments of finance lease obligations.
During fiscal 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $1,928.8 million, which consisted primarily of $1,060.0 million in cash received from the issuance and sale of the Notes due 2027, $275.0 million in cash received from the issuance and sale of the Notes due 2025, $828.1 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock, and $110.0 million in borrowings under the Additional Junior Term Loan, partially offset by $259.0 million in net payments under our ABL Facility.
The following describes our financing arrangements as of July 3, 2021:
ABL Facility: PFGC is a party to the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated December 30, 2019 (as amended by the First Amendment to Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of April 29, 2020, and the Second Amendment to Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of May 15, 2020, the “ABL Facility”). The ABL Facility has an aggregate principal amount of $3.0 billion, which matures on December 30, 2024. The incremental $110 million, 364-day maturity loan that is junior to the other obligations owed under the ABL Facility (“Additional Junior Term Loan”) was paid off early and in full on February 5, 2021. Performance Food Group, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of PFGC, is the lead borrower under the ABL Facility, which is jointly and severally guaranteed by, and secured by the majority of the assets of, PFGC and all material domestic direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of PFGC (other than captive insurance subsidiaries and other excluded subsidiaries). Availability for loans and letters of credit under the ABL Facility is governed by a borrowing base, determined by the application of specified advance rates against eligible assets, including trade accounts receivable, inventory, owned real properties, and owned transportation equipment. The borrowing base is reduced quarterly by a cumulative fraction of the real properties and transportation equipment values. Advances on accounts receivable and inventory are subject to change based on periodic commercial finance examinations and appraisals, and the real property and transportation equipment values included in the borrowing base are subject to change based on periodic appraisals. Audits and appraisals are conducted at the direction of the administrative agent for the benefit and on behalf of all lenders.
Borrowings under the ABL Facility bear interest, at Performance Food Group, Inc.’s option, at (a) the Base Rate (defined as the greater of (i) the Federal Funds Rate in effect on such date plus 0.5%, (ii) the Prime Rate on such day, or (iii) one month LIBOR plus 1.0%) plus a spread or (b) LIBOR plus a spread. The ABL Facility also provides for an unused commitment fee rate of 0.25% per annum. Borrowings under the Additional Junior Term Loan, which was paid off early and in full on February 5, 2021, bore interest at LIBOR plus 5.0% per annum with respect to any loan which was a LIBOR loan and Prime plus 4.0% per annum with respect to any loan which was a base rate loan.
The following table summarizes outstanding borrowings, availability, and the average interest rate under the ABL Facility:
The ABL Facility contains covenants requiring the maintenance of a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio if excess availability falls below the greater of (i) $200.0 million and (ii) 10% of the lesser of the borrowing base and the revolving credit facility amount for five consecutive business days. The ABL Facility also contains customary restrictive covenants that include, but are not limited to, restrictions on PFGC’s ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends, create liens, make investments or specified payments, and dispose of assets. The ABL Facility provides for customary events of default, including payment defaults and cross-defaults on other material indebtedness. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, amounts due under such agreement may be accelerated and the rights and remedies of the lenders under the ABL Facility may be exercised, including rights with respect to the collateral securing the obligations under such agreement.
Subsequent to July 3, 2021, the outstanding balance of the ABL Facility was paid down to zero using a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes due 2029.
Senior Notes due 2024: On May 17, 2016, Performance Food Group, Inc. issued and sold $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.500% Senior Notes due 2024 (“Notes due 2024”), pursuant to an indenture dated as of May 17, 2016.

Total Assets by Segment
Total assets by segment discussed below exclude intercompany receivables between segments.
Total assets for Foodservice increased $262.6 million from $5,529.1 million as of June 27, 2020 to $5,791.7 million as of July 3, 2021. During this time period, this segment increased its accounts receivable, inventory, and property, plant, and equipment, partially offset by decreases in intangible assets and operating lease right-of-use assets.
Total assets for Vistar increased $373.7 million from $1,385.4 million as of June 27, 2020 to $1,759.1 million as of July 3, 2021. During this period, Vistar increased its inventory, accounts receivable, property, plant and equipment, and operating lease right-of-use assets. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in intangible assets.
Total assets for Corporate & All Other decreased $510.3 million from $805.2 million as of June 27, 2020 to $294.9 million as of July 3, 2021. During this period, Corporate & All Other primarily decrease its cash as a result of repayments of borrowings.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are most important to portraying our financial position and results of operations. These policies require our most subjective or complex judgments, often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our most critical accounting policies and estimates include those that pertain to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, inventory valuation, insurance programs, income taxes, vendor rebates and promotional incentives, and goodwill and other intangible assets.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable are primarily comprised of trade receivables from customers in the ordinary course of business, are recorded at the invoiced amount, and primarily do not bear interest. Receivables are recorded net of the allowance for doubtful accounts on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. We regularly analyze our significant customer accounts, and when we become aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us, such as a bankruptcy filing or a deterioration in the customer’s operating results or financial position, we record a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount we reasonably believe is collectible. We also record reserves for bad debt for other customers based on a variety of factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due, macroeconomic considerations, and historical experience. If circumstances related to specific customers change, our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted.
Inventory Valuation
Our inventories consist primarily of food and non-food products. We primarily value inventories at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out method (“FIFO”). FIFO was used for approximately 87% of total inventories at July 3, 2021. The remainder of the inventory was valued using LIFO method using the link chain technique of the dollar value method. We adjust our inventory balances for slow-moving, excess, and obsolete inventories. These adjustments are based upon inventory category, inventory age, specifically identified items, and overall economic conditions.
Insurance Programs
We maintain high-deductible insurance programs covering portions of general and vehicle liability and workers’ compensation. The amounts in excess of the deductibles are insured by third-party insurance carriers, subject to certain limitations and exclusions. We also maintain self-funded group medical insurance. We accrue our estimated liability for these deductibles, including an estimate for incurred but not reported claims, based on known claims and past claims history. The estimated short-term portion of these accruals is included in Accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheets, while the estimated long-term portion of the accruals is included in Other long-term liabilities. The provisions for insurance claims include estimates of the frequency and timing of claims occurrence, as well as the ultimate amounts to be paid. These insurance programs are managed by a third party, and the deductibles for general and vehicle liability and workers compensation are primarily collateralized by letters of credit and restricted cash.
Income Taxes
We follow Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740-10, Income Taxes-Overall, which requires the use of the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Future tax benefits, including net operating loss carryforwards, are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law, and closing of statutes of limitations. Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate. Income tax calculations are based on the tax laws enacted as of the date of the financial statements.
Vendor Rebates and Other Promotional Incentives
We participate in various rebate and promotional incentives with our suppliers, either unilaterally or in combination with purchasing cooperatives and other procurement partners, that consist primarily of volume and growth rebates, annual and multi-year incentives, and promotional programs. Consideration received under these incentives is generally recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold. However, in certain limited circumstances the consideration is recorded as a reduction of costs incurred by us. Consideration received may be in the form of cash and/or invoice deductions. Changes in the estimated amount of incentives to be received are treated as changes in estimates and are recognized in the period of change.
Consideration received for volume and growth rebates, annual incentives, and multi-year incentives are recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold. We systematically and rationally allocate the consideration for these incentives to each of the underlying transactions that results in progress by the Company toward earning the incentives. If the incentives are not probable and reasonably estimable, we record the incentives as the underlying objectives or milestones are achieved. We record annual and multi-year incentives when earned, generally over the agreement period. We use current and historical purchasing data, forecasted purchasing volumes, and other factors in estimating whether the underlying objectives or milestones will be achieved. Consideration received to promote and sell the supplier’s products is typically a reimbursement of marketing costs incurred by the Company and is recorded as a reduction of our operating expenses. If the amount of consideration received from the suppliers exceeds our marketing costs, any excess is recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold.
Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Other Intangible Assets
We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting. Our financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition. Goodwill and other intangible assets represent the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts specifically assigned to those tangible net assets acquired in a business combination. Other identifiable intangible assets typically include customer relationships, trade names, technology, non-compete agreements, and favorable lease assets. Goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized. Intangibles with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, which generally range from two to eleven years. Annually, or when certain triggering events occur, the Company assesses the useful lives of its intangibles with definite lives. Certain assumptions, estimates, and judgments are used in determining the fair value of net assets acquired, including goodwill and other intangible assets, as well as determining the allocation of goodwill to the reporting units. Accordingly, we may obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant tangible and intangible assets. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain. Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability), economic barriers to entry, a brand’s relative market position, and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.
We are required to test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually or more often if circumstances indicate. Indicators of goodwill impairment include, but are not limited to, significant declines in the markets and industries that buy our products, changes in the estimated future cash flows of its reporting units, changes in capital markets, and changes in its market capitalization.
We apply the guidance in FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2011-08 “Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Testing Goodwill for Impairment,” which provides entities with an option to perform a qualitative assessment (commonly referred to as “step zero”) to determine whether further quantitative analysis for impairment of goodwill is necessary. In performing step zero for our goodwill impairment test, we are required to make assumptions and judgments, including but not limited to the following: the evaluation of macroeconomic conditions as related to our business, industry and market trends, and the overall future financial performance of our reporting units and future opportunities in the markets in which they operate. If impairment indicators are present after performing step zero, we would perform a quantitative impairment analysis to estimate the fair value of goodwill.
During fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, we performed the step zero analysis for our goodwill impairment test. As a result of our step zero analysis, no further quantitative impairment test was deemed necessary for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020. There were no impairments of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020.
