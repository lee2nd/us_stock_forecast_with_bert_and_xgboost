ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
OBJECTIVE
The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018. This section is intended to provide managements perspective of our results of operation. In addition, this section contains forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to the inherent uncertainties in predicting future results and conditions. Certain factors that could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements are described in the Risk Factors section on page 20. Additionally, more information about our business activities can be found in “Business.”
GENERAL
We are a finance company whose strategic focus and growth in recent years has been through Medallion Bank (a wholly-owned subsidiary), which originates consumer loans for the purchase of recreational vehicles, boats, motorcycles, and trailers, and to finance home improvements. Historically we have had a leading position in originating, acquiring, and servicing loans that finance taxi medallions and various types of commercial businesses.
Since Medallion Bank acquired a consumer loan portfolio and began originating consumer loans in 2004, it has increased its consumer loan portfolio at a compound annual growth rate of 16% (19% if there had been no loan sales during 2016, 2017, and 2018). We have transitioned away from medallion lending and have placed our strategic focus on our growing consumer finance portfolios. As a result of our change in strategy, as of December 31, 2020, our consumer loans represented 93% of our net loan portfolio, with commercial loans representing 6% and medallion loans representing 1%. Total assets under management, which includes assets serviced for third party investors, were $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2020, and $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2019, and have grown at a compound annual growth rate of 9% from $215,000,000 at the end of 1996.
Our loan-related earnings depend primarily on our level of net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the total yield on our loan portfolio and the average cost of borrowed funds. We fund our operations through a wide variety of interest-bearing sources, such as bank certificates of deposit issued to customers, debentures issued to and guaranteed by the SBA, privately placed notes, and bank term debt. Net interest income fluctuates with changes in the yield on our loan portfolio and changes in the cost of borrowed funds, as well as changes in the amount of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities held by us. Net interest income is also affected by economic, regulatory, and competitive factors that influence interest rates, loan demand, and the availability of funding to finance our lending activities. We, like other financial institutions, are subject to interest rate risk to the degree that our interest-earning assets reprice on a different basis than our interest-bearing liabilities.
We also provide debt, mezzanine, and equity investment capital to companies in a variety of industries, consistent with our investment objectives. These investments may be venture capital style investments which may not be fully collateralized. Our investments are typically in the form of secured debt instruments with fixed interest rates accompanied by an equity stake or warrants to purchase an equity interest for a nominal exercise price (such warrants are included in equity investments on the consolidated balance sheets). Interest income is earned on the debt instruments.
Beginning in 2019, Medallion Bank began the process to build-out a strategic partnership program with financial technology, or fintech, companies. Medallion Bank entered into an initial partnership in 2020 and began issuing its first loans, while continuing to explore opportunities with additional fintech companies.
In recent years, we have focused on growing our consumer lending segments and maintaining the profitability of our commercial lending segment. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we have taken various steps to pursue this strategy and improve our corporate governance, including:
•
carrying-out cost-cutting measures, such as reducing our employee headcount by 21% at our parent company Medallion Financial Corp. and closing satellite offices in Long Island City, New York, Chicago, Illinois, and Boston, Massachusetts;
•
exiting non-core investments, such as selling the assets of LAX Group, LLC on December 16, 2020, and expecting to sell, when practicable to maximize our proceeds, other non-core investments like our remaining art investments of less than $1,000,000 in Medallion Fine Art, Inc.;
•
strengthening our initiative to grow the Bank by partnering with two fintech companies in our strategic partnership program; and
•
electing Cynthia A. Hallenbeck as our independent director, resulting in a more independent and diverse board of directors.
On March 7, 2018, a majority of the Company’s shareholders authorized our board of directors to withdraw our election to be regulated as a business development company, or BDC, under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act, and we withdrew such election effective April 2, 2018. At that point, we were no longer a BDC or subject to the provisions of the 1940 Act applicable to BDCs. Historically, the composition of our assets caused it to meet the definition of an “investment company,” and we made a corresponding election to be treated as a BDC. Now that we have de-elected BDC status, it operates so as to fall outside the definition of an “investment company” or within an applicable exception.
As a result of this change in status, commencing with the three months ended June 30, 2018:
•
we consolidated the results of Medallion Bank and our other subsidiaries in our financial statements, which, as an investment company, we were previously precluded from doing; and
•
with the consolidation of Medallion Bank, given its significance to our overall financial results, we now report as a bank holding company for accounting purposes under Article 9 and Guide 3 of Regulation S-X (but we are not a bank holding company for regulatory purposes).
As we made this change to our financial reporting prospectively, in this report we refer to both accounting in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, applicable to bank holding companies, or Bank Holding Company Accounting, which applies commencing April 2, 2018, and to that applicable to investment companies under the 1940 Act, or Investment Company Accounting, which applies to prior periods.
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Medallion Bank, or the Bank, is a bank regulated by the FDIC and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions which originates consumer loans, raises deposits, and conducts other banking activities. The Bank generally provides us with our lowest cost of funds which it raises through bank certificates of deposit. To take advantage of this low cost of funds, historically we have referred a portion of our taxi medallion and commercial loans to the Bank, which originated these loans, and have been serviced by Medallion Servicing Corp., or MSC. However, at this time the Bank is not originating any new medallion loans and is working with MSC to service its existing portfolio. MSC earns referral and servicing fees for these activities.
COVID-19
The ongoing coronavirus, or COVID-19, pandemic, its broad impact and preventive measures taken to contain or mitigate the outbreak have had, and are likely to continue to have, significant negative effects on the US and global economy, employment levels, employee productivity, and financial market conditions. This has had, and may continue to have increasingly negative effects on the ability of our borrowers to repay outstanding loans, the value of collateral securing loans, the demand for loans and other financial services products and consumer discretionary spending. As a result of these or other consequences, the outbreak has adversely and materially affected our business, results of operations and financial condition. The effects of the outbreak on us could be exacerbated given that our business model is largely consumer and small business directed, which are more severely affected by COVID-19 and the preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate the outbreak, including its significant negative effects on consumer discretionary spending. The full extent to which the outbreak will continue to impact our operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time, and include the duration, severity and scope of the continued outbreak, the actions taken to contain or mitigate the outbreak and how long, and to what extent the economic recovery from its effects will take.
We have taken steps to operate through this crisis. For example, in late June our employees returned to work in our New York City offices on a part-time basis in accordance with guidelines issued by New York, while our employees outside New York largely continue to work remotely. While there are elevated risks with our workforce working remotely, we have implemented additional mitigating controls to help reduce such risks. In addition, to better align our structure with profitability and reduce expenses, effective May 11, 2020, we had furloughed approximately 28% of the employees at our parent company, Medallion Financial Corp. As of December 31, 2020, 21% of employees, all of whom were employees of our parent company, Medallion Financial Corp., and no employees of our consolidated subsidiaries remain on furlough. As part of our expense-cutting measures, effective March 2, 2021, we terminated such Medallion Financial Corp. employees on furlough. Additionally, we closed our satellite offices in Long Island City, New York, Chicago, Illinois, and Boston, Massachusetts.
The Bank temporarily increased its cash levels by increasing its deposits, and in order to take advantage of the current lower interest rates. MCI drew on its remaining unfunded commitments and received a commitment from the SBA for $25,000,000 in debenture financing with a ten-year term upon a capital infusion from Medallion Financial. RPAC received $747,000 under the Paycheck Protection Program in the second quarter, and has not yet applied for forgiveness, but expects to do so.
With our consumer business, in March 2020, we adjusted our payment policies and procedures, and created a program to support our borrowers during the pandemic. We have been negotiating payment terms with our borrowers, and allowed them to defer payments up to 180 days. As of December 31, 2020, there were minimal consumer loans on deferral and the level of potential loans 90 days or more past due would have likely resulted in increased charge-offs on the consumer loan portfolios had they not been granted. For our consumer loan portfolios, although we believe that our deferral programs have been effective to date in mitigating the effect of COVID-19, the ultimate effects of COVID-19 on the consumer portfolio remains to be seen. In addition, we increased our allowance for loan losses on consumer loans, and continued to monitor our loan portfolios as market conditions changed in both March and June of 2020. Overall, the effects of the pandemic on us could be exacerbated given that our business model is largely consumer-directed and the pandemic, and preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate the pandemic, had and may increasingly have significant negative effects on consumer discretionary spending.
With our medallion business, we also adjusted our payment policies and procedures and allowed borrowers to defer payments up to 180 days. As of December 31, 2020, there were no medallion loans on deferral and we determined that anticipated payment activity on our medallion portfolio was impossible to quantify upon exit of the deferral moratorium, and therefore deemed all such loans as impaired. As a result, all medallion loans were placed on nonaccrual and written down to a net collateral value of $90,300 for New York City medallions along with write downs in most other markets during the 2020 third quarter and we wrote down the New York City collateral an additional $10,800, to $79,500 net in the 2020 fourth quarter. These writedowns of the medallion assets led to an increase of provision of approximately $25,945,000 related to medallion loans and approximately an additional $20,142,000 related to collateral write down on other owned assets.
Substantially all our medallion loans and related assets are concentrated in New York City. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, the Governor of New York State declared states of emergency for both the State and City of New York, and, since March 2020, economic activity generally and taxi ridership in particular have decreased dramatically in New York City. Despite New York City’s phased reopening plan, there has not been a substantial increase in ridership and gross meter fares. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to adversely affect New York City taxi medallion owners and, by extension, our medallion loans and related assets will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, actions taken by governmental authorities, and the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on taxi medallion owners and the behaviors of people who have historically taken taxis.
Since March 31, 2020, payments on medallion loans have decreased significantly compared to the payments during the first quarter of 2020 and in prior periods. We are actively engaged with many borrowers about modifying their loan agreements, and as a result, we placed all medallion loans on TDR as we work with borrowers. We will continue to monitor our medallion loan portfolio and related assets, which may result in additional write-downs, charge-offs or impairments, the impact of which could be material to our results of operations and financial condition.
In regards to our commercial business, many of our mezzanine portfolio companies were able to access the Paycheck Protection Program, providing needed liquidity during a period of depressed market demands. For the mezzanine portfolio, performance is slowly recovering although lingering impacts of COVID-19 continues to weigh on performance. Refer to “Risk Factors -- The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and the related significant negative impact on the global economy and financial markets, have had and could further have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.”
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
We follow financial accounting and reporting policies that are in accordance with GAAP. Some of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments. The policies noted below, however, are deemed to be our “critical accounting policies” under the definition given to this term by the SEC. According to the SEC, “critical accounting policies” mean those policies that are most important to the presentation of a company’s financial condition and results of operations, and require management’s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
The judgments used by management in applying the critical accounting policies may be affected by deterioration in the economic environment, which may result in changes to future financial results. Specifically, subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes to the allowance for loan losses in future periods, and the inability to collect on outstanding loans could result in increased loan losses.
Allowance for Loan Losses
In analyzing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, the Company uses historical delinquency and actual loss rates with a three-year look-back period for medallion loans and a one-year look-back period for recreation and home improvement loans, and uses historical loss experience and other projections for commercial loans. The allowance is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management’s periodic review of the collectability of the loans in light of historical experience, the nature and size of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral, prevailing economic conditions, and excess concentration risks. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.
Our methodology to calculate the general reserve portion of the allowance includes the use of quantitative and qualitative factors. We initially determine an allowance based on quantitative loss factors for loans evaluated collectively for impairment. The quantitative loss factors are based primarily on historical loss rates, after considering loan type, historical loss and delinquency experience. The quantitative loss factors applied in the methodology are periodically re-evaluated and adjusted to reflect changes in historical loss levels or other risks. Qualitative loss factors are used to modify the reserve determined by the quantitative factors and are designed to account for losses that may not be included in the quantitative calculation according to management’s best judgment. Performing loans are recorded at book value and the general reserve maintained to absorb expected losses consistent with GAAP.
All medallion loans that reach 90 days or more delinquent require a specific allowance for those loans, which is determined on an individual basis. We deem a loan impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect the amounts due in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan agreement, including scheduled principal and interest payments. All impaired loans also require a specific allowance. We charge-off loans in the period that such loans are deemed uncollectible or when they reach 120 days delinquent regardless of whether the loan is a recreation, home improvement, or medallion loan.
The methodology used in the periodic review of reserve adequacy, which is performed at least quarterly, is designed to be responsive to changes in portfolio credit quality and inherent credit losses. The changes are reflected in both the pooled formula reserve and in specific reserves as the collectability of larger classified loans is regularly recalculated with new information as it becomes available. Management is primarily responsible for the overall adequacy of the allowance.
Medallion Loan Collateral Valuation
Due to the low volume of market transfer activity as medallion values declined in recent years, the determination of taxi medallion collateral fair value has been derived quarterly for each jurisdiction taking into consideration recent market transfer activity, to the extent it is available, as well as a discounted cash flow model when trading activity alone was deemed insufficient or unreliable. In general, recent market transfers published by each jurisdiction have been analyzed to derive the median transfer activity value. However, depending on the circumstances, when analyzing transfer activity, transactions which management determined from available information not to be arms-length have been excluded from the calculation of the median transfer value. When discounted cash flow models have been used, significant inputs typically include the discount rate, taxi fare/lease revenue, and associated expenses such as vehicle costs, fuel, credit card processing fees, repair costs, and insurance premiums. A higher discount rate, lower taxi fare/lease revenue and higher associated expenses would each produce a lower fair value. At period end, the transfer activity and, if applicable, discounted cash flow values, are taken into consideration to arrive at a fair value of the medallion collateral in each jurisdiction. For the current period, transfer activity was the primary consideration utilized in our valuation process.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill and intangible assets arose as a result of the excess of the fair value that was determined by an independent third party expert over the book value of several of our previously unconsolidated portfolio investment companies as of April 2, 2018. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment by a third party expert and is reviewed by management quarterly. For the annual goodwill testing, the assessment is based upon the Bank goodwill of $150,803,000 and the race organization intangible asset of $26,165,000, both of which utilized a step zero qualitative impairment analysis based on historical and projected financial data. The Bank-related intangible assets are amortized over their approximate useful life.
Deferred Taxes
Deferred taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their tax basis and are stated at tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management’s judgment that it is more like than not that it will be recognized. In addition, a valuation allowance is recorded when it is deemed that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized due to the temporary differences.
Average Balances and Rates
The following table shows the Company’s consolidated average balance sheets, interest income and expense, and the average interest earning/bearing assets and liabilities, and which reflect the average yield on assets and average costs on liabilities as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and the nine months ended December 31, 2018.
(1)
Includes financed sales of this collateral to third parties reported separately from the loan portfolio, and that are conducted by the Bank of $3,535, $8,163 and $3,134 as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
(2)
Includes deferred financing costs of $5,805 and $5,105 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, our net loans receivable yielded 12.33% (compared to 12.49% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019), mainly driven by the slight decline in the recreation loan average yield, which had been driven by the increase in the reserves as a result of COVID-19 as well as lower interest due to deferrals granted during the year. In addition, in 2020 there was a decline on the commercial loan yield as a result of the increase in non-accrual loans, and in the medallion
portfolio, also due to all loans being placed on non-accrual. The debt, mainly certificates of deposit, helps fund the growing consumer loan business and as market rates have decreased, so has the average cost of borrowing.
Rate/Volume Analysis
The following table presents the change in interest income and expense due to changes in the average balances (volume) and average rates, calculated for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and the nine months ended December 31, 2018.
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, interest income increased primarily due to the increased volume of our consumer loan portfolios, even as the average rate decreased on the recreation loan portfolio. Additionally, we continued to see a decline in our overall medallion portfolio as all loans had been placed on non-accrual, and they have continued to age 120 days or more past due and be charged-off to loan collateral in process of foreclosure. Interest expense decreased for 2020 primarily driven by the overall decrease in borrowing rates, mainly on the deposits.
Our interest expense is driven by the interest rates payable on our bank certificates of deposit, short-term credit facilities with banks, fixed-rate, long-term debentures issued to the SBA, and other short-term notes payable. The Bank issues brokered bank certificates of deposit, which are our lowest borrowing costs. The Bank is able to bid on these deposits at a wide variety of maturity levels which allows for improved interest rate management strategies.
Our cost of funds is primarily driven by the rates paid on our various debt instruments and their relative mix, and changes in the levels of average borrowings outstanding. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for details on the terms of our outstanding debt. Our debentures issued to the SBA typically have terms of ten years.
We measure our borrowing costs as our aggregate interest expense for all of our interest-bearing liabilities divided by the average amount of such liabilities outstanding during the period. The tables above as well as below show the average borrowings and related borrowing costs for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
(1)
Balance includes the nine months ended December 31, 2018 under Bank Holding Company Accounting and three months ended March 31, 2018 under Investment Company Accounting.
We continue to seek SBA funding through Medallion Capital to the extent it offers attractive rates. SBA financing subjects its recipients to limits on the amount of secured bank debt they may incur. We use SBA funding to fund loans that qualify under the Small Business Investment Act of 1985, as amended, or the SBIA, and SBA regulations. In July 2020, we obtained a $25,000,000 commitment from the SBA. We believe that financing operations primarily with short-term floating rate secured bank debt has generally decreased our interest expense, but has also increased our exposure to the risk of increases in market interest rates, which we mitigate with certain interest rate strategies. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, short-term adjustable rate debt constituted 4% of total debt.
Loans
The gross loans are reported at the principal amount outstanding, inclusive of deferred loan acquisition costs, which primarily includes deferred fees paid to loan originators, and which is amortized to interest income over the life of the loan. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, there was continued growth in the consumer lending segments, which was partially offset by the continued shrinkage of the medallion portfolio as loans have continued to age over 120 days and be transferred to loan collateral in the process of foreclosure and payments received from borrowers. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increase in charge-offs and loans transferred for the medallion segment.
The following table presents the approximate maturities and sensitivity to change in interest rates for our loans as of December 31, 2020.
(1)
Excludes strategic partnership loans.
(2)
As of December 31, 2020, there were no floating-rate loans.
Provision and Allowance for Loan Loss
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, New York taxi medallion values decreased to a net realizable value of $79,500, from $167,000 at December 31, 2019, and all medallions were deemed impaired due to the current COVID-19 pandemic. The impairment and decline in medallion values led to an increase in provision of approximately $25,945. For certain consumer loans, the reserve percentages were increased 25-100 basis points, also due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Both consumer and medallion loans were placed on deferral during the year, but as loans were no longer in deferral, there was continuing aging of recreation and medallion loans to 120 days or more, and charged-down to their collateral value. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, New York taxi medallion values decreased from $181,000 to $167,000.
(1)
As of December 31, 2020, net cumulative charge-offs of loans and loan collateral in process of foreclosure in the medallion portfolio were $279,188, some of which represents collection opportunities for the Company.
(2)
As of December 31, 2020, the general reserves previously recorded for the Company’s medallion loan portfolio had been reversed as all loans had been deemed impaired and written down to collateral value.
(3)
As of December 31, 2020, there was no allowance for loan loss and net charge-offs related to the strategic partnership loans.
The following tables set forth the allowance for loan losses by type as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
As of December 31, 2020, there was an increase in the allowance for loan losses as related to the recreation loan portfolio as compared to December 31, 2019. This change was due to the significant increase in loans originated during the year, along with the increased in reserve percentages as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. For the medallion loans, there was a significant increase in the reserve as a percentage of the total loans which had been driven by all medallion loans being deemed impaired, and also driven by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The following table sets forth the pre-tax changes in our unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 under Investment Company Accounting.
Under both Bank Holding Company Accounting and Investment Company Accounting, we generally follow a practice of discontinuing the accrual of interest income on our loans that are in arrears as to payments for a period of 90 days or more. We deliver a default notice and begin foreclosure and liquidation proceedings when management determines that pursuit of these remedies is the most appropriate course of action under the circumstances. A loan is considered to be delinquent if the borrower fails to make a payment on time; however, during the course of discussion on delinquent status, we may agree to modify the payment terms of the loan with a borrower that cannot make payments in accordance with the original loan agreement. For loan modifications, the loan will only be returned to accrual status if all past due interest and principal payments are brought fully current. For credit that is collateral based, we evaluate the anticipated net residual value we would receive upon foreclosure of such loans, if necessary. There can be no assurance, however, that the collateral securing these loans will be adequate in the event of foreclosure. For credit that is cash flow-based, we assess our collateral position, and evaluate most of these relationships as ongoing businesses, expecting to locate and install a new operator to run the business and reduce the debt. We cannot predict the ultimate impact that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic will have on the loan portfolios due to the greater than typical uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 and its related significant negative effects on the economy and financial markets.
For the consumer loan portfolio, the process to repossess the collateral is started at 60 days past due. If the collateral is not located and the account reaches 120 days delinquent, the account is charged-off to realized losses. If the collateral is repossessed, a realized loss is recorded to write the collateral down to its net realizable value, and the collateral is sent to auction. When the collateral is sold, the net auction proceeds are applied to the account, and any remaining balance is written off as a realized loss, and any excess proceeds are recorded as a recovery. Proceeds collected on charged-off accounts are recorded as recoveries. All collection, repossession, and recovery efforts are handled on behalf of the Bank by the servicer.
The following table shows the trend in loans 90 days or more past due as of the dates indicated.
(1)
Percentages are calculated against the total or managed loan portfolio, as appropriate.
We estimate that the weighted average loan-to-value ratio of our medallion loans was approximately 327%, 190%, and 220% as of December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.
Recreation and medallion loans that reach 120 days past due are charged down to collateral value and reclassified to loan collateral in process of foreclosure. The following table shows the activity of loan collateral in process of foreclosure for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
The following table presents the gain/loss experience on the investment portfolio for the three months ended March 31, 2018 under Investment Company Accounting.
The following table sets forth the pre-tax changes in our unrealized and realized gains and losses in the investment portfolio for the three months ended March 31, 2018 under Investment Company Accounting.
SEGMENT RESULTS
We manage our financial results under four operating segments; recreation lending, home improvement lending, commercial lending, and medallion lending. We also show results for two non-operating segments; RPAC and corporate and other investments. All results are for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and the nine months ended December 31, 2018.
Recreation Lending
The recreation lending segment is a high-growth prime and non-prime consumer finance business which is a significant source of income for us, accounting for 76% and 75% of our interest income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and 71% for the nine months ended December 31, 2018. The loans are secured primarily by RVs, boats, and trailers with RV loans making up 60% of the portfolio, boat loans making up 19% of the portfolio, and trailer loans making up 12% of the portfolio as of December 31, 2020, compared to 61%, 19%, and 12% as of December 31, 2019. Recreation loans are made to borrowers residing in all fifty states, with the highest concentrations in Texas, California, and Florida, at 17%, 10%, and 9% of loans outstanding at December 31, 2020 and 2019 and with no other states over 9%.
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the recreation portfolio continued to grow, leading to an increase in interest income and net income for the year, even as the allowance percentage increased. During the nine months ended December 31, 2018, the recreation segment grew and also included a third quarter sale of $55,979,000 of recreation loans for a gain of $3,093,000, included in non-interest income (expense).
The following table presents certain financial data and ratios as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and the nine months ended December 31, 2018.
(1)
Loans 90 days or more past due.
Home Improvement Lending
The home improvement lending segment works with contractors and financial service providers to finance residential home improvements and is concentrated in swimming pools, roofs, windows, and solar panels at 27%, 24%, 13%, and 8% at December 31, 2020, as compared to 23%, 21%, 14%, and 12% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2019, with no other collateral types over 8%. Home improvement loans are made to borrowers residing in all fifty states, with the highest concentrations in Florida, Texas, and Ohio at 11%, 11%, and 9% at December 31, 2020, as compared to 11%, 11%, and 10% of loans outstanding at December 31, 2019, and with no other states over 9%.
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the home improvement loan portfolio continued to grow, leading to an increase in interest income and overall net income. In September 2018, we sold $44,909,000 of home improvement loans for a gain of $2,079,000, which is included in other income (expense).
The following table presents certain financial data and ratios as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and the nine months ended December 31, 2018.
(1)
Loans 90 days or more past due.
Commercial Lending
We originate both senior and subordinated loans nationwide to businesses in a variety of industries, more than 53% of which are located in the Midwest region, with the rest scattered across the country. These mezzanine loans are primarily secured by a second position on all assets of the businesses and generally range in amount from $2,000,000 to $5,000,000 at origination, and typically include an equity component as part of the financing. The commercial lending business has concentrations in manufacturing and professional, scientific, and technical services making up 57% and 14% of loans outstanding at December 31, 2020, and 63% and 13% at December 31, 2019.
The following table presents certain financial data and ratios as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and the nine months ended December 31, 2018. The commercial segment encompasses the mezzanine lending business, and the other legacy commercial loans (immaterial to total) have been allocated to corporate and other investments.

Includes seven other states, which were all under 7% as of December 31, 2020, and nine other states, which were all under 8% as of December 31, 2019.
Medallion Lending
The medallion lending segment operates mainly in the New York City, Newark, and Chicago markets. We have a long history of owning, managing, and financing taxi fleets, taxi medallions, and corporate car services. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we saw a significant decline in the medallion collateral value from $167,000 at December 31, 2019 to $79,500 as of December 31, 2020, which was primarily due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, and we recognized an additional net loss of $41,652,000 due to the reserves and write-down of collateral related to the loans in process of foreclosure. Additionally, we had deemed all medallion loans impaired and placed them on nonaccrual in the third quarter of 2020. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, we saw the taxi medallion values decline slightly in the New York City and Chicago markets, although we did see an improvement in collections. For the nine months ended December 31, 2018, we saw a leveling off in the medallion values in the New York City market, while in other markets there were declines in values. During the 2018 fourth quarter, we deconsolidated Trust III, which resulted in a gain of $25,325,000, leading to an overall decline in medallion loans. All the loans are secured by the medallions and enhanced by personal guarantees of the shareholders and owners.
The following table presents certain financial data and ratios as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and the nine months ended December 31, 2018.
(1)
Loans 90 days or more past due.
RPAC
We are the majority owner and managing member of RPAC Racing, LLC, a performance and marketing company for NASCAR. Revenues are mainly earned through sponsorships and race winning activity over the ten month race season (February through November) during the year. As a result of COVID-19, the race season was suspended from March 15, 2020 through May 17, 2020. As states began to reopen, NASCAR began racing and completed all races on a revised schedule.
The following table presents certain financial data and ratios as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and the nine months ended December 31, 2018.
Corporate and Other Investments
This non-operating segment relates to our equity and investment securities as well as our legacy commercial business, other assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses not allocated to the operating segments. Commencing with the 2020 second quarter, the Bank began issuing loans related to the new strategic partnership business, which is currently included within this segment, for a total of $24,000 of net loans as of December 31, 2020. This segment also reflects the elimination of all intercompany activity among the consolidated entities.
The following table presents certain financial data and ratios as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and the nine months ended December 31, 2018.

Consolidated Results of Operations
For the Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019
Net loss attributable to shareholders was $34,783,000, or $1.42 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the net loss attributable to shareholders of $1,762,000, or $0.07 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Total interest income was $144,962,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $132,562,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in interest income reflected the continued growth in the consumer lending segments, which was partially offset by contraction in the medallion lending segment, driven by both a decline in overall medallion loans along with all loans being placed on nonaccrual. The yield on interest earning assets was 11.32% for 2020, compared to 11.75% for 2019. Average interest earning assets were $1,280,445,000 for the year, an increase from $1,255,251,000 in the prior year.
Loans before the allowance for loan losses were $1,229,838,000 as of December 31, 2020, comprised of recreation ($792,686,000), home improvement ($334,033,000), commercial ($65,327,000), medallion ($37,768,000), and strategic partnership ($24,000) loans. The Company had an allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2020 of $57,548,000, which was attributable to the recreation (48%), medallion (43%), and home improvement (9%) loan portfolios. As of December 31, 2019, loans before allowance for loan losses were $1,160,855,000, comprised of recreation ($713,332,000), home improvement ($247,324,000), medallion ($130,432,000), and commercial ($69,767,000) loans. The Company had an allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2019 of $46,093,000, which was attributable to medallion (55%), recreation (39%), and home improvement (6%) loans.
Loans increased $68,983,000, or 6%, from December 31, 2019 to $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2020 as a result of $497,221,000 of loan originations, partially offset by principal payments, net charge-offs (mainly on medallion loans), and transfers to loan collateral in process of foreclosure. The provision for loan losses was $69,817,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $47,386,000 for 2019. The increase was mainly due to all medallion loans being deemed impaired due to the continued uncertainty of the potential continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on those borrowers. In addition, New York City and almost all other market net collateral values decreased, and the loans were written down, leading to an increase in provisions of approximately $25,945,000. Additionally, this change reflected the increase of reserve percentages ranging from 25 to 100 basis points on the recreation subprime loan business, related to the uncertainty about the potential impact on the businesses as a result of COVID-19. The charge-off ratios on the loan portfolios increased to 5.00% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 3.60% for the prior year, mostly in the medallion segment. See Note 4 for additional information on loans and the allowance for loan losses.
Interest expense was $34,151,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $35,045,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The average cost of borrowed funds was 2.71% for 2020, compared to 3.08% for 2019, mainly driven by the decline in market rates for deposits. Average debt outstanding was $1,258,257,000 for 2020, compared to $1,138,746,000 for 2019. This increase was driven by the issuance additional certificates of deposits to increase our liquidity and help fund the growing consumer segment along with the new issuance of privately placed notes. See page 41 for a table which shows average balances and cost of funds for our funding sources.
Net interest income was $110,811,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $97,517,000 for the prior year. The net interest margin was 8.65%, compared to 8.64% for the year ended December 31, 2019, reflecting the above.
Net other income (loss), which is comprised of sponsorship and race winnings, prepayment fees, servicing fee income, late charges, write-downs of loan collateral, impairment of equity investments, and other miscellaneous income was a loss of $5,936,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to income of $20,387,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decline was mainly due to significant reductions in collateral values for the New York City taxi medallions and other markets, along with a $4,145,000 gain on debt extinguishment in 2019, and a $3,510,000 charge in connection with the writeoff of a non-core sports-related investment in 2020, all which was partly offset by an increase in sponsorship and race winnings in the year ended December 31, 2020.
Operating expenses were $72,039,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $68,181,000 for the prior year. Salaries and benefits were $28,172,000 for 2020, an increase from $24,971,000 for 2019, which was mainly attributable to increased salaries related to the Bank due to its continued growth, an increase in bonuses for the entire Company, as well as increased stock option expense. Race team costs were $8,366,000 in 2020, compared to $8,996,000 for 2019, which reflected the condensed race schedule and lower travel and racing costs. Professional fees were $8,047,000 for the year, an increase from the $7,402,000 for 2019, primarily reflective of legal costs for a variety of corporate matters. Loan servicing costs were $6,737,000 for the year, up from $5,253,000 for 2019, primarily reflecting the increased costs of servicing the growing recreation and home improvement consumer loans, which have grown 17% from December 31, 2019. Loan collection costs declined from $6,638,000 for 2019, to $5,454,000 for 2020, due to improvement in contracts with the collectors. Occupancy and other operating expenses were $15,263,000 for the year, which increased $342,000, or 2%, compared to the prior year, due to race related other costs, partly offset by lower travel, meals and entertainment expenses as a result of the shut-downs related to COVID-19.
Total income tax benefit was $10,074,000 for 2020, compared to an income tax provision of $341,000 for 2019. The 2020 year benefit included $1,228,000 of benefit related to a change in the effective tax rate, while the 2019 year included benefits of $380,000 attributable to net operating loss revaluations, $916,000 of benefits related to a change in the effective income tax rate and $600,000 tax benefit related to the settlement of a state audit. See Note 8 for more information.
Loan collateral in process of foreclosure was $54,460,000 at December 31, 2020, an increase from $52,711,000 at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily reflective of additional loans having reached 120 days past due and being charged down to their collateral value and reclassified to loan collateral in process of foreclosure, partly offset by the continued decline in collateral values on the medallion portfolio.
For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to the Nine Months Ended December 31, 2018
Net loss attributable to stockholders was $1,762,000 or $0.07 per diluted common share for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, compared to a net loss of $10,172,000 or $0.42 per diluted common share for the nine months ended December 31, 2018.
Total interest income was $132,562,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, compared to $96,803,000 for the nine months ended December 31, 2018. Interest income reflected the continued growth in the consumer lending segments partly offset by the contraction in the lower yielding medallion lending segment. The yield on interest earning assets was 11.75% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, an improvement from 10.98% for the nine months ended December 31, 2018. Average interest earning assets were $1,128,479,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, a decline from $1,170,612,000 for the nine months ended December 31, 2018.
Loans before allowance for loan losses were $1,160,855,000 as of December 31, 2019, comprised of recreation ($713,332,000), home improvement ($247,324,000), medallion ($130,432,000), and commercial ($69,767,000) loans. The Company had an allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2019 of $46,093,000, which was attributable to medallion (55%), recreation (39%), and home improvement (6%) loans. As of December 31, 2018, loans before allowance for loan loss were $1,017,882,000, which were comprised of recreation ($587,038,000), home improvement ($183,155,000), medallion ($183,606,000), and commercial ($64,083,000) loans. The Company had an allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2018 of $36,395,000, which was attributable to the medallion (76%), recreation (19%), and home improvement (5%) loan portfolios. Loans increased $142,973,000, or 14%, from the prior year end primarily due to $462,093,000 of loan originations mostly in the consumer segments, offset partly by principal payments, transfer to loans in process of foreclosure, and net charge-offs. The provision for loan losses was $47,386,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, compared to $59,008,000 for the nine months ended December 31, 2018. The improvement was reflective of lower net charge-offs on the medallion portfolio, along with taxi medallion values remaining relatively consistent during 2019. The charge off ratios on the loan portfolio increased to 3.60% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2.73% for the nine months ended December 31, 2018, driven by the recreation segment. See Note 4 for additional information on loans and the allowance for loan losses.
Interest expense was $35,045,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, compared to $24,816,000 for the nine months ended December 31, 2018. The average cost of borrowed funds was 3.08%, compared to 2.79%, mainly driven by new borrowings at higher rates and the roll off of lower cost borrowings. Average debt outstanding was $1,138,746,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, compared to $1,181,323,000 for the nine months ended December 31, 2018. See page 41 for a table which shows average balances and cost of funds for our funding sources.
Net interest income was $97,517,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, compared to $71,987,000 for the nine months ended December 31, 2018, and the net interest margin was 8.64%, compared to 8.19%, reflecting the above.
Noninterest income, which is comprised of sponsorship and race winnings, prepayment fees, servicing fee income, late charges, write-downs of loan collateral, impairment of equity investments, and other miscellaneous income was $20,387,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, compared to $41,946,000 for the nine months ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by the one-time gain on the deconsolidation of Trust III of $25,325,000 in the prior year.
Operating expenses were $68,181,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, compared to $62,081,000 for the nine months December 31, 2018. Salaries and benefits expense was $24,971,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 compared to $19,357,000 for the nine months ended December 31, 2018, professional fees were $7,402,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, compared to $8,609,000 for the nine months ended December 31, 2018, primarily reflecting legal costs for a variety of corporate and investment-related matters, and collections costs were $6,638,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, compared to $5,207,000 for the nine months ended December 31, 2018. The remaining expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 included race team costs of $8,996,000, loan servicing costs of $5,253,000, primarily reflecting costs of
servicing the recreation and home improvement consumer loans, and occupancy and other expenses of $14,921,000, whereas for the nine months ended December 31, 2018, race team costs were $7,121,000, loan servicing costs were $3,470,000, and occupancy and other operating expenses were $18,317,000, which included the impairment on goodwill of $5,615,000
Total income tax expense was $341,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, compared to $709,000 for the nine months ended December 31, 2018. The current year tax expense included $891,000 due to changes in effective state income tax rates, partly offset by $380,000, $640,000 and $309,000 of benefit due to the revaluation of the net operating losses, changes in state income tax accruals and income attributable to non-controlling interest. See Note 8 for more information.
Loan collateral in process of foreclosure was $52,711,000 at December 31, 2019, an increase from $49,495,000 at December 31, 2018, reflecting $31,348,000 of net loans transferred, partly offset by sales, cash payments, and valuation adjustments incurred during the current year.
Goodwill and intangible assets were $203,339,000 at December 31, 2019, down from $204,785,000 at December 31, 2018, reflecting the amortization of the intangible assets during 2019. See Note 2 for further information regarding goodwill and intangible assets.
ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT
Interest Rate Sensitivity
We, like other financial institutions, are subject to interest rate risk to the extent that our interest-earning assets (consisting of consumer, commercial, and medallion loans, and investment securities) reprice on a different basis over time in comparison to our interest-bearing liabilities (consisting primarily of bank certificates of deposit, credit facilities and borrowings with banks and other lenders, and SBA debentures and borrowings).
Having interest-bearing liabilities that mature or reprice more frequently on average than assets may be beneficial in times of declining interest rates, although such an asset/liability structure may result in declining net earnings during periods of rising interest rates. Abrupt increases in market rates of interest may have an adverse impact on our earnings until we are able to originate new loans at the higher prevailing interest rates. Conversely, having interest-earning assets that mature or reprice more frequently on average than liabilities may be beneficial in times of rising interest rates, although this asset/liability structure may result in declining net earnings during periods of falling interest rates. This mismatch between maturities and interest rate sensitivities of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities results in interest rate risk.
The effect of changes in interest rates is mitigated by regular turnover of the portfolios. We believe that the average life of our loan portfolios varies to some extent as a function of changes in interest rates. Borrowers are more likely to exercise prepayment rights in a decreasing interest rate environment because the interest rate payable on the borrower’s loan is high relative to prevailing interest rates. Conversely, borrowers are less likely to prepay in a rising interest rate environment. However, borrowers may prepay for a variety of other reasons, such as to monetize increases in the underlying collateral values. In addition, we manage our exposure to increases in market rates of interest by incurring fixed-rate indebtedness, such as ten year subordinated SBA debentures, and by setting repricing intervals on certificates of deposit, for terms of up to five years.
A relative measure of interest rate risk can be derived from our interest rate sensitivity gap. The interest rate sensitivity gap represents the difference between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, which mature and/or reprice within specified intervals of time. The gap is considered to be positive when repriceable assets exceed repriceable liabilities, and negative when repriceable liabilities exceed repriceable assets. A relative measure of interest rate sensitivity is provided by the cumulative difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities for a given time interval expressed as a percentage of total assets.
The following table presents our interest rate sensitivity gap at December 31, 2020. The principal amounts of interest earning assets are assigned to the time frames in which such principal amounts are contractually obligated to be repriced. We have not reflected an assumed annual prepayment rate for such assets in this table.
(1)
The ratio of the cumulative one year gap to total interest rate sensitive assets was (27%), as of December 31, 2020, and was (21%) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.
(2)
Excludes federal funds sold and investment securities.
Our interest rate sensitive assets were $1,364,352,000 and interest rate sensitive liabilities were $1,312,005,000 at December 31, 2020. The one-year cumulative interest rate gap was a negative $366,801,000 or 27% of interest rate sensitive assets. We seek to manage interest rate risk by originating adjustable-rate loans, by incurring fixed-rate indebtedness, by evaluating appropriate derivatives, pursuing securitization opportunities, and by other options consistent with managing interest rate risk.
With the cessation of LIBOR at the end of 2021, we are currently reviewing the impact on our loans and borrowings. We do not have lendings tied to LIBOR and do not expect a significant impact on our loans. We expect to rely on our lenders to adjust and communicate rate adjustments, however, we do not expect a material impact on our borrowings.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our sources of liquidity are with a variety of local and regional banking institutions, unfunded commitments to sell debentures to the SBA, loan amortization and prepayments, private issuances of debt securities, participations or sales of loans to third parties, the disposition of other assets of the Company, and dividends from Medallion Capital and the Bank, and are subject to compliance with regulatory ratios. As of December 31, 2020, we had unfunded commitments from the SBA of $25,000,000.
Additionally, the Bank has access to independent sources of funds for our business originated at the Bank, primarily through brokered certificates of deposit. The Bank has $45,000,000 available under federal funds lines with several commercial banks. In addition, the Bank can retain earnings in its business to fund future growth.
In February 2021, we completed a private placement to certain institutional investors of $25,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 7.25% unsecured senior notes due February 2026, with interest payable semiannually. A follow-on offering of these notes in March 2021 raised an additional $3,250,000.
In December 2020, we completed a private placement to certain institutional investors of $33,600,000 aggregate principal amount of 7.50% unsecured senior notes due December 2027, with interest payable semiannually. A follow-on offering of these notes in both February and March 2021 raised an additional $8,500,000.
The net proceeds from the December 2020 and February 2021 private placements will be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of outstanding debt such as the maturing 9.00% retail notes in April 2021 and may also be used to pay down other borrowings outstanding, possibly including some borrowings at a discount.
In December 2019, the Bank closed an initial public offering of $46,000,000 aggregate liquidation amount, yielding net proceeds of $42,485,000, of its Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series F. Dividends are payable quarterly from the date of issuance to, but excluding April 1, 2025, at a rate of 8% per annum, and from and including April 1, 2025, at a floating rate equal to a benchmark rate (which is expected to be three-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR) plus a spread of 6.46% per annum.
In March 2019, we completed a private placement to certain institutional investors of $30,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 8.25% unsecured senior notes due 2024, with interest payable semiannually. A follow-on offering of these notes in the 2019 third quarter raised an additional $6,000,000.
The components of our debt were as follows at December 31, 2020, exclusive of deferred financing costs of $5,805,000. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for details of the contractual terms of our borrowings.
(1)
Weighted average contractual rate as of December 31, 2020.
(2)
Balance includes $250 of strategic partner reserve deposits as of December 31, 2020.
We have employment agreements with certain key officers for either one-, two- or five-year terms. They all expire at various dates through 2025, with payments under these agreements of approximately $12,056,000 as of December 31, 2020.
Our contractual obligations expire on or mature at various dates through September 2037. The following table shows all contractual obligations at December 31, 2020, but does not reflect the additional notes issued in February 2021, as described above.
(1)
Total debt is exclusive of deferred financing costs of $5,805.
(2)
Balance excludes $250 of strategic reserve deposits as of December 31, 2020.
Approximately $730,000,000 of our borrowing relationships have maturity dates during 2021 through 2022, including almost $635,000,000 of brokered CD’s. We have been in active and ongoing discussions with each of these lenders and, to date, have
extended each of the facilities as they matured. We have arranged for changes to the terms of the notes and payment and borrowing base calculations which we anticipate will facilitate our operations for the foreseeable future. As a result of the cash flow shortages due to the slowdown in the taxi industry resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we received 180 day payment deferrals that terminated in August and modifications to provide for interest only payments through the end of 2020 for the notes payable to banks.
On July 16, 2019, we paid $10,819,000 at maturity in satisfaction of all our outstanding obligations under one of our credit facilities. In connection with this payment, we obtained a waiver from one of our other lenders, with a term note of $1,839,000, of certain resulting repayment and other obligations, which waiver expires on June 15, 2021.
In addition, the illiquidity of portions of our loan portfolio and investments may adversely affect our ability to dispose of them at times when it may be advantageous for us to liquidate such portfolio or investments. In addition, if we were required to liquidate some or all of our portfolio, the proceeds of such liquidation may be significantly less than the current value of such investments. Because we borrow money to make loans and investments, our net operating income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our interest income. In periods of sharply rising interest rates, our cost of funds would increase, which would reduce our net interest income.
We use a combination of long-term and short-term borrowings and equity capital to finance our investing activities. Our long-term fixed-rate investments are financed primarily with short-term floating-rate debt, and to a lesser extent by term fixed-rate debt. We may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. We have analyzed the potential impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income. Assuming that the balance sheet were to remain constant and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity a hypothetical immediate 1% increase in interest rates would result in an increase to net income as of December 31, 2020 by $1,183,000 on an annualized basis, and the impact of such an immediate increase of 1% over a one year period would have been ($1,763,000) at December 31, 2020. Although management believes that this measure is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality, size, and composition of the assets on the balance sheet, and other business developments that could affect net income from operations in a particular quarter or for the year taken as a whole. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the potential outcome simulated by these estimates.
We continue to work with investment banking firms and other financial intermediaries to investigate the viability of a number of other financing options which include, among others, the sale or spinoff of certain assets or divisions, the development of a securitization conduit program, and other independent financing for certain subsidiaries or asset classes. These financing options would also provide additional sources of funds for both external expansion and continuation of internal growth.
The following table illustrates sources of available funds for us and each of our subsidiaries, and amounts outstanding under credit facilities and their respective end of period weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2020. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about each credit facility.
(1)
Total debt is exclusive of deferred financing costs of $5,805 and $5,105 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
(2)
Includes $2,970 of an interest reserve associated with the 2019 private placement, which can be used for no other purpose for three years.
Loan amortization, prepayments, and sales also provide a source of funding for us. Prepayments on loans are influenced significantly by general interest rates, medallion loan market values, economic conditions, and competition.
We also generate liquidity through deposits generated at the Bank, borrowing arrangements with other banks, and through the issuance of SBA debentures, as well as from cash flow from operations. In addition, we may choose to participate a greater portion of our loan portfolio to third parties. We are actively seeking additional sources of liquidity; however, given current market conditions, there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure additional liquidity on terms favorable to us or at all. If that occurs, we may decline to underwrite lower yielding loans in order to conserve capital until credit conditions in the market become more favorable; or we may be required to dispose of assets when we would not otherwise do so, and at prices which may be below the net book value of such assets in order for us to repay indebtedness on a timely basis.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, or Topic 326: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” The main objective of this new standard is to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial assets and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. Under the new standard, the concepts used by entities to account for credit losses on financial instruments will fundamentally change. The existing “probable” and “incurred” loss recognition threshold is removed. Loss estimates are based upon lifetime “expected” credit losses. The use of past and current events must now be supplemented with “reasonable and supportable” expectations about the future to determine the amount of credit loss. The collective changes to the recognition and measurement accounting standards for financial instruments and their anticipated impact on the allowance for credit losses modeling have been universally referred to as the CECL (current expected credit loss) model. ASU 2016-13 applies to all entities and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 for public entities, with early adoption permitted. In November 2019 the FASB issued ASU 2019-10 to defer implementation of the standard for smaller reporting companies, such as us, to fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2022. We are assessing the impact the update will have on our financial statements, and expect the update to have a material impact on our accounting for estimated credit losses on our loans.
