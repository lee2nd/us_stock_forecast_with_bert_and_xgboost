ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Part I, including matters set forth in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and our financial statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Except when stated otherwise, we present the discussion in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on a consolidated basis.
Overview
LMP Automotive Holdings, Inc., through our subsidiaries, currently offers our customers the opportunity to buy, sell, rent, and subscribe for, and obtain financing for automobiles both online and in person.
We describe our business model as “Buy, Rent or Subscribe, Sell and Repeat.” This means that we “Buy” pre-owned automobiles primarily through auctions or directly from other automobile dealers, and new automobiles from manufacturers and manufacturer distributors at fleet rates. We “Rent or Subscribe” by either renting automobiles to our customers or allowing them to enter into our subscription plan for automobiles in which customers have use of an automobile for a minimum of thirty (30) days. We “Sell” our inventory, including automobiles previously included in our rental and subscription programs, to customers as well, and then we hope to “Repeat” the whole process.
Recent Developments
Public Offerings
On February 13, 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering of 1,200,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $16.00 per share, raising gross proceeds of approximately $19,200,000 and net proceeds received after underwriting fees and offering expenses were approximately $17,300,000. We have used the proceeds from the offering for strategic acquisitions, to build our vehicle inventory, for working capital and other general corporate purposes.
Asset Acquisition
On February 19, 2020, we purchased approximately a $2,800,000 luxury vehicle fleet and entered into a non-exclusive perpetual software license for a vehicle subscription service app for upcoming launch in the Apple App and Google Play stores. Any enhancements to the software will be our exclusive property. The Bancorp and Sutton Leasing have agreed to finance the vehicles. We paid approximately $526,000 in cash and issued 33,183 shares of our common stock at $14.69 per share (the closing price of our common stock on February 19, 2020) for the remainder of the transaction.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires our management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements, including the notes thereto, and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies, if any. We consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require the more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of financial statements, including the following:
Revenue Recognition
Used Vehicle Sales Revenue
Our business consists of retail and wholesale sales of used vehicles to customers. Sales are based on a physical showroom and efficient online showrooms on our websites. We offer a home delivery service so that it delivers the car to the place agreed upon with the client. We also sell used vehicles in auctions.
We recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control of a vehicle to a customer. The prices of the vehicles are stated in its contracts at stand-alone selling prices, which are agreed upon with our customer prior to delivery. We satisfy our performance obligation for used vehicle sales upon delivery when the transfer of title, risks and rewards of ownership and control pass to the customer. We recognize revenue at the agreed-upon price stated in the contract, including any delivery charges. In addition, any noncash consideration received from a customer (i.e., trade-in vehicles) is recognized at fair value. Customer payment is received or third-party financing is confirmed prior to vehicle transfer.
We lease vehicles to third parties that are accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC 842, Leases. These lease terms are short term in nature and generally less than one year. The accounting for investments in leases and leased vehicles is different depending on the type of lease. Each lease is classified as either a direct-financing lease, sales-type lease, or operating lease, as appropriate. If a lease meets one of the following five criteria, the lease is classified as either a sales-type lease or direct financing lease; otherwise, it is classified as an operating lease.
● The lease transfers ownership of the property to the lessee by the end of the lease term;
● The lease grants the lessee an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise;
● The lease term is for the major part of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset;
● The present value of the sum of the lease payments and any residual value guaranteed by the lessee that is not already reflected in the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset;
● The underlying asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease term.
Revenue on direct financing and sales-type leases is recognized at the inception of the lease and the related interest income is recognized over the term of the lease using the effective interest method. Revenues on the sales of vehicles at the end of a lease are recognized at the inception of the lease, and any net gain or loss on sales of such vehicles is presented within Vehicle Sales Revenues and Vehicle Sales Cost of Revenues in our consolidated statements of operations. Interest income is derived from the discounted cash flows of the lease payments. Investments in sales-type leases are comprised of the minimum lease payments receivable and guaranteed residual at their present value.
We collect sales taxes and other taxes from customers on behalf of governmental authorities at the time of sale. These taxes are accounted for on a net basis and are not included in sales or cost of sales.
Subscription Revenue
We offer a vehicle subscription plan where a customer will pay a monthly fee in exchange for access to a vehicle. Our subscriptions include monthly swaps, scheduled maintenance and upkeep, license and registration and in most cases roadside assistance. Customers have the flexibility to up-or-downgrade a vehicle monthly, with the vehicle payment adjusted accordingly. There is an activation payment at subscription inception that varies based upon the monthly payment of the selected vehicle. Monthly vehicle payments are dependent upon the vehicle selected by the customer. Due to the nature of the subscription contract, where the subscriber can swap out the vehicle in the contract and the performance obligation is completed and recognized each month, the revenues earned under these contracts are recognized in accordance with ASC 606.
We recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control of a vehicle to a customer under a subscription contract. The prices of the vehicles are stated in our contracts at stand-alone subscription prices, which are agreed upon with the customer prior to delivery. We satisfy our performance obligation for monthly subscription payments upon delivery to the customer and in each subsequent month the customer retains possession of the vehicle. We recognize revenue at the agreed-upon price stated in the contract in the month earned.
We also receive a one-time, non-refundable payment as an activation fee to our vehicle subscription program. This fee is deferred and amortized to income monthly over the term of the subscription, as the performance obligation (providing a vehicle for the customer) is completed over the term of the subscription.
Customer payment has been received prior to initial vehicle transfer and on each monthly recurring anniversary date. We collect sales taxes and other taxes from customers on behalf of governmental authorities at the time of sale. These taxes are accounted for on a net basis and are not included in sales or cost of sales.
Rental Revenue
The Company accounts for revenue earned from vehicle rentals and rental related activities wherein an identified asset is transferred to the customer and the customer has the ability to control that asset under FASB ASC 842, Leases.
Performance obligations associated with rental related activities, such as charges to the customer for the fueling of vehicles and value-added services such as loss damage waivers, navigation units, and other ancillary and optional products, are also satisfied over the rental period.
Payments are due from customers at the time of reservation. Additional charges incurred by the customers are collected at the time of vehicle return. We collect sales taxes and other taxes from customers on behalf of governmental authorities at the time of sale. These taxes are accounted for on a net basis and are not included in sales or cost of sales.
Accounts Receivable
We carry our accounts receivable at cost. The terms of our accounts receivable require payment upon receipt. We establish an allowance based on our management’s assessment of the creditworthiness of the customers, the aged basis of the receivables, as well as current economic conditions and historical information. Management has determined that no allowance for uncollectible accounts for accounts receivable is necessary at December 31, 2020 or 2019.
Stock-Based Compensation
We recognize the cost of services received in exchange for awards of stock options in accordance with ASC 718 “Stock Compensation”, based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant over the requisite service period, which generally is the vesting period of the award. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards.
Income Taxes
We account for income taxes under ASC 740 - Income Taxes which codified SFAS 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes” and FIN 48 “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an Interpretation of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Statement No. 109.” Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under ASC 740, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the enactment occurs. A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that we will not realize tax assets through future operations.
Per Share Information
We compute net loss per share accordance with FASB ASC 205 “Earnings per Share.” FASB ASC 205 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the income statement.
Basic EPS is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS excludes all potentially dilutive shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Our financial instruments consist of cash, prepaid expenses, payables, accrued expenses and notes payable. Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information about the financial instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. We consider the carrying values of our financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements to approximate fair value, due to their short-term nature.
Inventory
Our inventory consists of automobiles, which are valued at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined by specific identification and with market defined as net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Inventories at December 31, 2020 and 2019 are recorded based on perpetual inventory records.
We depreciate our fleet inventory monthly based on 1% of initial cost starting in 2018 when the subscriptions and rentals were launched. For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, fleet vehicle depreciation approximated $670,000 and $991,000, respectively, which includes non-standard impairment charges for estimated inventory obsolescence. This depreciation was recorded to Cost of revenues - subscription and rental.
We periodically review our automobile inventory to determine whether any inventories have become obsolete or have declined in value and record a charge to operations for known and estimated inventory obsolescence.
Buildings, Property and Equipment
Buildings, Property and equipment are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided for using straight-line methods over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, ranging from 5 to 39 years.
Valuation of Long-Lived Assets
We periodically evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. If the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) from the use of an asset were less than the carrying value, a write-down would be recorded to reduce the related asset to its estimated fair value.
Leases
We adopted ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (“Topic 842”) using the modified retrospective adoption method with an effective date of January 1, 2019. This standard requires all lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments.
To calculate our lease liability, we make certain assumptions related to lease term and discount rate. For lease terms, we evaluate renewal options. When available, we use the rate implicit in the lease to discount lease payments to present value. However, our lease does not provide a readily determinable implicit rate. Therefore, we estimate the rate to discount lease payments based on the 5-year Treasury constant maturity rate on the date of the commencement of the lease.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Revenues and Costs of Revenues
We generated total revenues of $30,442,617 for the year ended December 31, 2020, including rental and subscription revenue of $14,589 and $1,857,981, respectively, as compared with total revenues of $10,858,594, including rental and subscription revenue of $351,885 and $1,389,679, respectively, during the comparative year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $19,584,023. The increase mainly was due to an increase in revenue from sales type leases of $12,669,103 and an increase in vehicle sales of $6,229,220.
Costs of revenues were $27,388,025 for the year ended December 31, 2020, including subscription and rental costs of $824,073, resulting in a gross profit of $3,054,592. Costs of revenues were $11,005,620 for the year ended December 31, 2019, including subscription and rental costs of $1,285,907, resulting in a negative gross margin of $147,026. Gross profit in 2020 increased $3.2 million The increase in the cost of revenues is mainly due to the increase in our vehicle sales. We generated positive gross profit for the first time in 2020 due the increase in sales type leases and the related interest income, an increase in vehicle sales and an increase in subscription revenue.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
We incurred SG&A expenses of $3,988,292 during the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $1,109,304 as compared with $2,878,988 incurred during the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of approximately $1,100,000 is mainly due to increases in expenses related to payroll of approximately $717,000, Directors and Officers Liability Insurance of $677,000, an increase in dues and subscriptions primarily NASDAQ fees of $118,000, which were partially offset by a decrease in rent of $102,000.
Acquisition, Consulting, and Legal Expenses

The increase during 2020 is mainly due to an increase in acquisition legal fees and consultants plus increased use of outside accounting consultants and audit fees.
Net Losses
We sustained net losses of $4,815,793, and $4,029,841 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, for the reasons described above.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We have provided certain non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA, Subscription Leasing and Rental Margins and Vehicle Sales Margins, to supplement the financial results that are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). Management uses these financial metrics internally in analyzing our financial results to assess operational performance and to determine our future capital requirements. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these financial metrics in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. We believe these financial metrics are useful to investors and others to understand and evaluate our operating results and it allows for a more meaningful comparison between our performance and that of our competitors. Our use of EBITDA, Subscription Leasing and Rental Margins and Vehicle Sales Margins have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider these performance measures in isolation from or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because of these limitations, you should consider these financial metrics along with other financial performance measures, including total revenues, total gross profit and net loss presented in accordance with GAAP.
Adjusted EBITDA
We define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation (including vehicle inventory impairment) and amortization, stock option expense, amortization of operating leases, legal settlement accrual and acquisition and financing related expenses.
The following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, on a historical basis and for each of the periods indicated.
Subscription Leasing and Rental Margins
We calculate Subscription Leasing and Rental Margins by deducting subscription and rental cost of revenues from subscription fee and rental revenues adjusted for non-recurring, material adjustments.
The following table provides a reconciliation of Subscription Leasing and Rental Margins to subscription fee and rental revenues, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, on a historical basis and for each of the periods indicated.
Vehicle Sales Margins
We calculate Vehicle Sales Margins by deducting vehicle sales cost of revenues and inventory impairment from vehicle sales revenue.
The following table provides a reconciliation of Vehicle Sales Margins to Vehicle Sales Revenue, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, on a historical basis and for each of the periods indicated.
Plan of Operations
We completed our IPO in December 2019 where we received proceeds of approximately $12.0 million (net equity of $10.5 million after deducting deferred offering expenses and a secondary offering in February 2020 where we raised an additional $17.3 million. We have used the net proceeds from these offering for our strategic acquisitions, to build our vehicle inventory, and for working capital and other general corporate purposes

On March 23, 2021, the Company closed on the acquisition (the “Bachman Dealership Acquisition”) of a motor vehicle dealership located at 3365 East Andrew Johnson Highway, Greenville, Tennessee (the “Bachman Dealership”) contemplated by that certain Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of August 28, 2020 (the “Bachman APA”), by and among the Company, Bachman-Bernard Chevrolet-Buick-GMC-Cadillac, Inc., Philip M. Bachman, Jr. (“PMB”) and Myron Bernard (“MB”). In connection therewith, the Company also closed on the acquisition (together with the Bachman Dealership Acquisition, the “Bachman Acquisitions”) of the real property, buildings and improvements located at the Bachman Dealership pursuant to the terms of that certain Real Estate Purchase Agreement, dated as of August 28, 2020, by and among 601 NSR, PMB and MB. The consideration paid by the Company for the Bachman Acquisitions was approximately $7.5 million in cash, for which the Company used cash on its balance sheet and funds provided by The Bank pursuant to the Credit Agreement described above. The Bachman Acquisitions were previously reported on the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on September 1, 2020.
Management believes the income from operation from these acquired entities will provide working capital and fund additional acquisitions.
We believe short-term liquidity and short-term capital resources will cover cash needs in the future. When combined with expense reductions through consolidation of our operations, as previously discussed, cash on hand, increasing inventory through borrowings on vehicle financing and/or our line of credit and revenues will be sufficient to cover our day-to-day operating expenses and material commitments at least over the next 12 months.
