ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION
The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this prospectus. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to those differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this prospectus, particularly in “RISK FACTORS.” We caution the reader not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect management’s analysis only as of the date of this prospectus.
We are a smaller reporting company and have not generated any material revenues to date and have incurred substantial losses in connection with our limited operations. We need substantial capital to pursue our current plans to bring our first products to market. The first of such products is a proprietary gel-like protein-based biomedical material for injection into the afflicted body parts of animals suffering from osteoarthritis or other impairments to be marketed under the trade name Kush®. It will provide to veterinarians an innovative treatment for dogs and horses suffering from osteoarthritis.
The independent auditor’s report accompanying our March 31, 2021 financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared “assuming that we will continue as a going concern,” which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. We have suffered recurring losses from operations, have a substantial working capital deficit and are currently in default of the payment terms of certain note agreements. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
RESULTS OF OPERATION
* In October 2020, the Company approved a 1-for-4 reverse split of our outstanding shares of common stock that was made effective December 29, 2020. All share and per share data has been retroactively adjusted for this reverse split for all period presented.
For Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2021 (“fiscal 2021”) Compared to Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2020 (“fiscal 2020”)
Total Revenues. For fiscal 2021, we earned $12,578 in revenue compared to $3,588 in fiscal 2020. Our sales in fiscal 2021 and 2020 represented sample product sales.
Total Cost of Sales. For fiscal 2021, we incurred $10,695 in expenses compared to $19,710 in fiscal 2020. Cost of sales during fiscal 2021 was made up of costs during the year and subsequent reserve for obsolete inventory. Cost of sales during fiscal 2020 was made up of a reserve for obsolete inventory taken due to an analysis that included the product status, shelf life, and lack of material sales.
Operating Expenses. Operating expenses for fiscal 2021 were $1,960,871 compared to $2,000,010 for fiscal 2020, a decrease of $39,139. Operating expenses consisted of general and administrative, sales and marketing, and research and development expenses.
General and administrative (“G&A”) expenses were $1,767,664 in fiscal 2021 compared to $1,815,829 in fiscal 2020, a decrease of 48,165. General and administrative expenses include corporate overhead, financial and administrative contracted services, consulting fees and stock compensation costs.
Sales and marketing expenses were $94,977 in fiscal 2021 compared to $171,509 in fiscal 2020, a decrease of $76,532. This decrease was due to the lack of resources available for sales and marketing activities.
Research and development (“R&D”) expenses were $98,230 in fiscal 2021 compared to $12,672 in fiscal 2020, an increase of $85,558. The increase was related to efforts to support the launch of Kush®.
Operating Loss. As a result of the foregoing, our operating loss for fiscal 2021 was $1,958,988 compared to an operating loss of $2,016,132 for fiscal 2020.
Other Income (Expense). Other expense for fiscal 2021 was $1,563,792 compared to other expense of $66,602 for fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2021, other expense included derivative expense of $1,702,100 related to debt financing and interest expense of $228,595 offset by a $366,903 gain on extinguishment of debt. In fiscal 2020, other expense consisted primarily of a loss on debt extinguishment of $81,738 and interest expense of $32,185 partially offset by a $47,710 gain on settlement.
Net Loss. Our net loss for fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 was $3,522,780 or ($0.57) per share as compared to $2,082,734 or ($0.39) per share for fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. Net loss generally decreased primarily due to the derivative expense recognized on the debt financing in fiscal 2021. The weighted average number of shares outstanding during fiscal 2021 was 6,198,717 compared to 5,305,590 for fiscal 2020.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our financial position and future prospects depend significantly on our access to financing to fund our operations during our development stage. Much of our current cost structure is based on costs related to personnel and facilities, and not subject to material variability. In order to fund our operations and working capital needs, we historically have utilized loans from accredited investors and others, equity sales of common stock to accredited investors and others having pre-existing relationships with us, and substantial issuances of stock-based compensation to satisfy outstanding debt and pay for development, management, financial, professional and other services.
As of March 31, 2021, our current assets were $147,153 including $23,578 in cash and $123,575 in prepaid expenses. In comparison, our current liabilities as of that date were $1,405,048 consisting of $962,885 of accounts payable and accrued expenses, $36,808 of accrued expenses - related party, $235,671 in convertible notes payable, $39,020 in PPP loan, $20,000 in notes payable and accrued interest - directors, $44,554 in notes payable and accrued interest - related party, $39,528 in a note payable and $26,582 in operating lease liability - short term. Our working capital deficiency as of March 31, 2021 was $1,257,895.
We will need to raise substantial additional capital through private or public offerings of our equity or debt securities, or a combination thereof, and we may have to use a material portion of any capital raised to repay past due debt obligations. To the extent any capital raised is insufficient to both satisfy operational working capital needs and meet any required debt payments, we will most likely need to either extend, refinance or convert to equity our outstanding indebtedness.
We currently have little cash to support our operations and projected commercial growth. Accordingly, we will require substantial additional financing to fund our operational working capital for at least the next 12 months. Financing may be sought by us from several sources such as private or public sales of our equity or convertible debt securities, and/or loans from affiliates, banks or other financial institutions. We have filed Forms S-1 and S-1/A with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 13, 2020, December 31, 2020 and March 29, 2021, respectively, to raise capital through a public offering of our common stock. In the event we cannot obtain any such financing when needed on terms acceptable to us, if at all, our business would suffer substantially.
Liquidity represents the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash to provide for its immediate cash needs, which our continued losses have made it difficult for us to accomplish. Over the past several years we have continued to incur substantial losses without any source of material revenues or liquid assets, which has caused a serious and harmful effect to our liquidity and a substantial strain on our ongoing business operations.
We have not generated any operating cash flows since we are a development stage company which has not yet realized any significant commercial revenues.
Net Cash Used in Operating Activities - We used $1,047,329 of net cash in operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2021. This cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to our net loss of $3,522,780, gain on extinguishment of debt of $366,903 and an increase in deferred issue costs of $280,163 partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $174,652 and noncash expenses related to derivative expense of $1,702,100, stock compensation expense of $452,674 and common stock issued for services of $541,208. For the year ended March 31, 2020, we used $498,089 of net cash. The cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to our net loss of $2,082,734 offset by noncash expenses related to $863,012 of stock compensation expense and $559,544 of depreciation and amortization expense.
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities - We used $160,164 of net cash in investing activities for the year ended March 31, 2021, consisting of $140,685 of costs capitalized to property and equipment and $19,479 of costs capitalized to patents and trademarks. This is compared to $63,696 of net cash used in investing activities in the year ended March 31, 2020, which was due to $32,791 of costs capitalized to property and equipment and $43,386 of costs capitalized to patents and trademarks offset by proceeds of $12,481 from the sale of equipment.
Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities - During the year ended March 31, 2021, we were provided with net cash of $1,220,489 from financing activities consisting of $297,500 from entering into various convertible notes payable, $118,665 from notes payable proceeds (including PPP Loan), and $823,997 in stock and warrants sale proceeds, which were partially offset by $19,673 in repayments of note payable and note payable to related parties. In comparison, during the year ended March 31, 2020, we were provided with net cash of $565,907 from financing activities consisting primarily of $280,000 in proceeds from convertible notes payable and $339,000 in proceeds from stock and warrants sale which were partially offset by $68,093 in repayments of various notes payable, notes payable to related parties, convertible notes payable, and the debt instruments’ accrued interest.
Inventory
Inventories are stated at cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand through an inventory count.
At March 31, 2021, the Company’s inventory has a carrying value of $0 and is broken down into $36,973 of finished goods inventory, $8,773 in raw material inventory, and $1,322 in packaging inventory offset by a reserve of $47,068.
At March 31, 2020, the Company’s inventory had a carrying value of $-0- and was broken down into $50,357 of finished goods inventory, $-0- in work-in-process inventory, $-0- in raw material inventory, and $-0- in packaging inventory offset by a reserve of $50,357.
MATERIAL COMMITMENTS
Accrued Salary
We are indebted to certain related parties with respect to unreimbursed expenses and accrued salaries of $36,808 at March 31, 2021. This amount is included in accrued expenses - related party.
Notes and Convertible Notes Payable
As of March 31, 2021, we are obligated on the following notes:
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
As of March 31, 2021, and as of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
GOING CONCERN
The independent auditors’ report accompanying our March 31, 2021 Form 10-K and financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. We have suffered recurring losses from operations and have a working capital deficit. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards in the United States of America. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements attached hereto. We believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
The following describes the recently issued accounting standards used in reporting our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, accounting standards allow more than one alternative accounting method for reporting. In those cases, our reported results of operations would be different should we employ an alternative accounting method.
The FASB issued ASC 606 as guidance on the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers in May 2014 with amendments in 2015 and 2016. Revenue recognition will depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance also requires disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The guidance permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented, or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the cumulative catch-up transition method). The company adopted the guidance on April 1, 2018 and applied the cumulative catch-up transition method. There was no transition adjustment upon adoption of the new standard.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Topic 842 affects any entity that enters into a lease, with some specified scope exemptions. The guidance in this ASU supersedes Topic 840, Leases. The core principle of Topic 842 is that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases. A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The Company adopted Topic 842 on April 1, 2019 and resulted in a right of use asset and liability of $154,917.
All newly issued accounting pronouncements but not yet effective have been deemed either immaterial or not applicable.
JOBS Act
On April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.
We have chosen to opt out of the extended transition periods available to emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition periods for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.
We are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as an “emerging growth company,” we intend to rely on certain of these exemptions, including without limitation, (i) providing an auditor’s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) complying with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis. We will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of this offering; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC.
Employees and Services Performed by our Independent Contractors
We currently have two full-time employees, consisting of our CEO and CFO, and have contracted with two independent contractors, who serve as our General Counsel and Director of Science and Technology. If we receive proceeds of at least $7 million in our financing transactions, we have identified and plan to add additional staff including a Chief Operating Officer, a Chief Information Officer/Investor Relations, a National Director of Sales, a National Director of Marketing, a General Counsel and a Director of Manufacturing.
We also engage outside consultants to assist with research and development, clinical development and regulatory matters, business development, operations and other functions from time to time.
Insurance
We currently maintain a “life science” commercial insurance policy with coverage in the amount of $1 million for our products and operations. The policy has been designed for those engaged in the life science business. We may face claims in excess of the limits of such insurance. As well, claims made against us may fall outside of our coverage. The policy is a “claims made” policy. Thus, our coverage must be maintained at the time a claim is made for us to be entitled to seek coverage from the issuer of the policy for such claims.
DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTIES
We rent our Edina, Minnesota office in suburban Minneapolis under the provisions of a long-term lease. Our executive, administrative and operating offices are located at 5251 Edina Industrial Blvd., Edina, Minnesota 55439. We believe that our facility is adequate for our needs and that additional suitable space will be available on acceptable terms as required.
Legal Proceedings
From time to time, the Company is involved in various legal claims and actions arising in the ordinary course of business. While from time to time, claims are asserted that may make demands for sums of money, we do not believe that the resolution of any of these others matters, either individually or in the aggregate, will materially affect our financial position, cash flows or the results of our operations.
