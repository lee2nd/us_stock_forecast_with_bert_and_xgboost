•the loss of or a reduction in business from one or more of our key customers;
•negative developments in the macro-economic factors that impact our performance such as the U.S. housing market, general economy, unemployment rates, and consumer sentiment and the impact of such developments on our and our customers' business, operations, and access to financing;
