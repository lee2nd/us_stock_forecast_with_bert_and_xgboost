ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The COVID-19 pandemic, the resulting recession in the United States and its follow-on effects have impacted and will likely continue to impact business activity across industries, including the Company’s. During 2020, due to factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic such as delays in service at medical facilities and restrictions imposed by government agencies, and the Company’s customers in response to the spread of COVID-19, the Company experienced some delays in delivering certain Gamma Knife procedures and PBRT treatments. Similarly, the Company’s ability to conduct commercial efforts with its customers have been and are likely to continue to be disrupted as customers have turned their focus to dealing with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their operations and have restricted access to their sites in efforts to contain the spread of the virus. The global nature of the pandemic has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures designed to contain the virus, including travel bans and restrictions, border closures, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, business limitations and shutdowns. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and capital markets is significant, and on June 8, 2020 the National Bureau of Economic Research announced that the United States was in an economic recession. An extended economic recession in the United States or elsewhere could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s ability to conduct its business and to access financing, as well as on the Company’s results of operation, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. The prioritization of COVID-19 treatment and containment has resulted in delays in decisions by the Company’s customers and their patients, obstacles to the Company’s ability to market and deliver its services, declines in treatment volumes and adverse impacts to revenues for both Gamma Knife procedures and PBRT treatments. As a result of the pandemic and related governmental actions, Gamma Knife procedures and PBRT treatments, which currently make up all of the Company’s revenue, may be impacted differently at each of the Company’s various locations and may take longer to recover than other areas of the economy, which may have a material impact on the Company's business. The Company’s Gamma Knife operations in Latin America have experienced a decline in procedures due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our Gamma Knife and PBRT operations in the United States have also experienced negative impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to develop, additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently.
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic for the year ended December 31, 2020 has varied by location based on the stage of containment and actions by government agencies. The impact on treatments and costs in the three-month period ended March 31, 2020 did not appear material. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been greater for the three-month periods ended June 30, 2020, September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2020, including declines in patient volumes and corresponding reductions in Gamma Knife procedures and reduced PBRT fractions during the second and fourth quarters.
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and follow general practices within the industry in which it operates. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the financial statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions and judgments. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported.
The most significant accounting policies followed by the Company are presented in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. These policies along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and, in this discussion, and analysis, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined. Based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts, and the methods, assumptions and estimates underlying those amounts, management has identified revenue recognition and costs of sales for turn-key and revenue sharing arrangements, and the carrying value of fixed assets and useful lives, and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available. The following are our critical accounting policies in which management’s estimates, assumptions and judgments most directly and materially affect the financial statements:
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenues under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 842 Leases (“ASC 842”) and ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”). The Company had sixteen (16) Gamma Knife units and one (1) PBRT system in operation as of December 31, 2020. Four (4) of the Company’s customer contracts are through subsidiaries where GKF or its subsidiary is the majority owner and managing partner. Six (6) of the Company’s sixteen (16) current Gamma Knife customers are under fee-per-use contracts, and eight (8) customers are under retail arrangements. The Company, through GKF, also owns and operates single-unit Gamma Knife facilities in Lima, Peru and Guayaquil, Ecuador. These units economically function similar to the Company’s turn-key retail arrangements. The Company’s PBRT system at Orlando Health - UF Health Cancer Center (“Orlando Health”), is also considered a retail arrangement.
Rental Income from Medical Services
The Company recognizes revenues under ASC 842 when services have been rendered and collectability is reasonably assured, on either a fee per use or revenue sharing basis. The terms of the contracts do not contain any guaranteed minimum payments. The Company’s contracts are typically for a ten-year term and are classified as either fee per use or retail. Retail arrangements are further classified as either turn-key or revenue sharing. Revenues from fee per use contracts is determined by each hospital’s contracted rate. Revenues are recognized at the time the procedures are performed, based on each hospital’s contracted rate and the number of procedures performed. Under revenue sharing arrangements, the Company receives a contracted percentage of the reimbursement received by the hospital. The amount the Company expects to receive is recorded as revenue and estimated based on historical experience. Revenue estimates are reviewed periodically and adjusted as necessary. Under turn-key arrangements, the Company receives payment from the hospital in the amount of the hospital’s reimbursement from third party payors, and the Company is responsible for paying all the operating costs of the equipment. Operating costs are determined primarily based on historical treatment protocols and cost schedules with the hospital. The Company records an estimate of operating costs which are reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted as necessary to more accurately reflect the actual operating costs. For turn-key sites, the Company also shares a percentage of net operating profit. The Company records an estimate of net operating profit based on estimated revenues, less estimated operating costs. The operating costs and estimated net operating profit are recorded as other direct operating costs in the consolidated statement of operations. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized revenues of approximately $16,204,000 and $19,396,000 under ASC 842, respectively.
Revenue from retail arrangements amounted to approximately 64% and 64% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Because the revenue estimates are reviewed on a quarterly basis, any adjustments required for past revenue estimates would result in an increase or reduction in revenue during the current quarterly period.
Patient Income
The Company has stand-alone facilities in Lima, Peru and Guayaquil, Ecuador, where a contract exists between the Company’s facilities and the individual patient treated at the facility. Under ASC 606, the Company acts as the principal in this transaction and provides, at a point in time, a single performance obligation, in the form of a Gamma Knife treatment. Revenue related to a Gamma Knife treatment is recognized on a gross basis at the time when the patient receives treatment. There is no variable consideration present in the Company’s performance obligation and the transaction price is agreed upon per the stated contractual rate. GKPeru's payment terms are typically prepaid for self-pay patients and insurance provider payments are paid net 30 days. GKCE's patient population is primarily covered by a government payor and payments are paid approximately 30 to 60 days upon invoice. The Company did not capitalize any incremental costs related to the fulfillment of its customer contracts. Accounts receivable earned by GKPeru were not significant for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. GKCE's accounts receivable were $467,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized revenues of approximately $1,633,000 and $1,209,000 under ASC 606, respectively.
2020 Results
For the year ended December 31, 2020, 65% of the Company’s revenue was derived from its Gamma Knife business and 35% was derived from the PBRT system. For the year ended December 31, 2019, 66% of the Company’s revenue was derived from its Gamma Knife business, 30% was derived from the PBRT system, and the remaining 4% from its IGRT business.
TOTAL REVENUE
Total revenue in 2020 decreased 13.4% compared to 2019 primarily due to a decrease in average reimbursement for Gamma Knife procedures and a decrease in PBRT fractions. This decrease in volumes was partially attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Gamma Knife Revenue
Gamma Knife revenue for 2020 was $11,670,000 compared to $13,551,000 in 2019. Gamma Knife revenue for 2020 decreased $1,881,000 compared to 2019 due to a lower average reimbursement at the Company's retail sites driven by an increase in patients with Medicare coverage and a decrease in patients with Commercial insurance.
The number of Gamma Knife procedures performed in 2020 increased 32 compared to 2019 due to the Company's acquisition of GKCE in June 2020. This increase was offset by a Gamma Knife contract that terminated in October 2020 and due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In April 2020, an existing Gamma Knife customer contract expired. The site operated on a month-to-month basis through October 2020, when the customer notified the Company of their intent to terminate. Two additional existing Gamma Knife customers notified the Company of their intent to not renew their contract during the third and fourth quarters of 2020. One of the contracts terminated in February 2021 and the second is set to expire in December 2021.
Revenue per procedure decreased by $1,283 and in 2020 compared to 2019. For 2020, the decrease was due to lower average reimbursement at the Company's retail sites.
Proton Therapy Revenue
PBRT revenue for 2020 was $6,167,000 compared to $6,214,000 in 2019. The number of PBRT fractions performed in 2020 was 5,868 compared to 6,018 in 2019. Revenue per fraction in 2020 was $1,051 compared to $1,033 in 2019. In 2020, the Company's PBRT revenue declined due to an impact on volumes in the second and fourth quarter from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company's proton therapy system also experienced some down-time for maintenance in the third quarter of 2020.
IGRT Revenue
IGRT revenue for 2020 was $0 compared to $840,000 in 2019. IGRT revenue decreased for 2020 as the result of the winding down of the Company’s IGRT system, which was being used as a back-up system at the customer site. The Company’s contract for its IGRT equipment expired in April 2020 and the Company agreed to sell the equipment to its existing customer for $150,000, which was equal to the equipment's salvage value. The Company sold the equipment in July 2020.
COSTS OF REVENUE
The Company's costs of revenue, consisting of maintenance and supplies, depreciation and amortization, and other operating expenses (such as insurance, property taxes, sales taxes, marketing costs and operating costs from the Company’s retail sites) decreased by $314,000 in 2020 compared to 2019.
Maintenance and supplies costs as a percentage of total revenue were 13.4% and 12.7% in 2020 and 2019. Maintenance and supplies costs decreased by $233,000 in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease in 2020 compared to 2019 was due to a decrease in time and materials costs at the Company's existing sites.
Depreciation and amortization costs as a percentage of total revenue were 38.1% and 35.6% in 2020 and 2019. Depreciation and amortization costs decreased $552,000 in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to depreciation incurred on the Company's Gamma Knife and IGRT equipment at its location in Boston, Massachusetts in 2019, offset by increased depreciation recognition at two of the Company's expiring Gamma Knife sites. One of these contracts expired in October 2020 and the second expired in the first quarter of 2021.
Other direct operating costs as a percentage of total revenue were 23.5% and 18.1% in 2020 and 2019. Other direct operating costs increased by $471,000 in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in 2020 is primarily due to operating costs from the Company's acquisition of GKCE in June 2020.
SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE
The Company's selling and administrative costs increased $548,000 in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in 2020 was due to legal and other fees, including, but not limited to the COVID-19 pandemic and the transition in senior management and tax, legal, and consulting fees related to the Company's acquisition of GKCE of approximately $162,000.
INTEREST EXPENSE
The Company's interest expense decreased $261,000 in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease in 2020 was primarily due to a lower average principal base for the Company’s lease and debt portfolio, effectively reducing interest expense.
(LOSS) ON WRITE DOWN OF IMPAIRED ASSETS AND ASSOCIATED REMOVAL COSTS
*Not meaningful
As of December 31, 2020, the Company recognized a loss on the write down of impaired assets of $8,264,000. The Company reviewed its long-lived assets and deposits during the fourth quarter of 2020 and concluded events and circumstances existed that indicated the value of these assets was more-than temporarily impaired.
The impaired assets included six (6) Gamma Knife units and related removal costs, and two (2) deposits towards the purchase of proton beam systems and related capitalized interest. The six (6) Gamma Knife units that were impaired consisted of two (2) units that had been taken out of service in prior years, one (1) unit that was taken out of service in 2020 and three (3) units that have already been or the Company anticipates will be taken out of service in 2021.
INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME
Interest and other income decreased $6,000 in 2020 compared to 2019. Interest and other income is generally comprised of interest expense and interest earned, and increases or decreases generally reflect fluctuations in these amounts.
INCOME TAX EXPENSE
*Not meaningful
Income tax expense decreased $1,865,000 in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease in income tax benefit provision in 2020 was due to the loss on write-down of impaired assets recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020.
The Company anticipates that it will continue to record income tax expense if it operates profitably in the future. Currently there are state income tax payments required for most states in which the Company operates. At December 31, 2020, the Company exhausted the remainder of its net operating loss carryforward for federal income tax return purposes. The Company has net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes.
NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS
Net income attributable to non-controlling interests decreased $1,429,000 in 2020 compared to 2019. Net income attributable to non-controlling interests represents the pre-tax income earned by the 19% non-controlling interest in GKF, and the pre-tax income or losses of the non-controlling interests in various subsidiaries controlled by GKF. The decrease or increase in net income attributable to non-controlling interests reflects the relative profitability of GKF. The decrease in 2020 compared to 2019 was due to the loss on write off of impaired assets.
NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO AMERICAN SHARED HOSPITAL SERVICES
*Not meaningful
Net (loss) attributable to American Shared Hospital Services was $7,058,000 in 2020 compared to net income of $659,000 in 2019. Net loss decreased $7,717,000 in 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to the loss on write down of impaired assets.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Company had cash and cash equivalents of $4,325,000 at December 31, 2020 compared to $1,779,000 at December 31, 2019, an increase of $2,546,000. The Company’s expected primary cash needs on both a short and long-term basis are for capital expenditures, business expansion, working capital, and other general corporate purposes.
Operating activities provided cash of $9,745,000 in 2020, which was driven by non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization of $6,970,000, stock-based compensation expense of $299,000, non-cash lease expense of $288,000, a loss on the write-down of impaired assets of $8,184,000, interest expense associated with lease liabilities of $65,000, changes in receivables of $2,966,000, changes in prepaid and other assets of $762,000, and changes in other accrued liabilities, income taxes payable of $179,000, and deferred revenue of $263,000. These were offset by a net loss of $7,716,000, an income tax benefit of $2,162,000, and net lease liabilities of $353,000.
The Company’s trade accounts receivable decreased by $2,591,000 to $4,303,000 at December 31, 2020 from $6,894,000 at December 31, 2019, primarily due to an outstanding payment related to a contractual Medicare adjustment for one of the Company's Gamma Knife contracts, which was collected in January 2020, and an increase in collections from the Company's proton therapy customer. The number of days revenue (sales) outstanding (“DSO”) in accounts receivable as of December 31, 2020 decreased to 88 days compared to 122 days at December 31, 2019. DSO can and does fluctuate depending on timing of customer payments received and the mix of fee per use versus retail customers. Retail sites generally have longer collection periods than fee per use sites.
Investing activities used $2,389,000 of cash in 2020 due to payments made towards the purchase of property and equipment of $455,000 and payment for the Acquisition of $2,084,000, offset by proceeds from the sale of equipment of $150,000.
Financing activities used $4,810,000 of cash during 2020, primarily due to principal payments on long-term debt of $1,726,000, principal payments towards finance leases of $3,199,000, principal payments on short-term financing of $519,000, and distributions to non-controlling interests of $761,000. These decreases were offset by long-term debt financing of the Acquisition of $1,425,000.
The Company had a working capital deficit at December 31, 2020 of $1,530,000 compared to working capital of $2,528,000 at December 31, 2019. The $4,058,000 decrease in net working capital was due to an decrease in accounts receivable and other receivables of $2,488,000, an increase in accounts payable of $126,000, an increase in employee compensation and benefits of $171,000, an increase in accrued liabilities of $266,000, asset retirement obligations of $1,270,000, an increase in income taxes payable of $243,000, working capital payment due of $197,000, increase in lease liabilities of $26,000, and an increase in finance leases of $2,236,000. This was offset by an increase in cash and restricted cash of $2,546,000, increases in prepaid and other assets of $50,000, and a decrease in long term debt of $369,000. The Company believes that its cash flow from cash on hand, operations, and other cash resources are adequate to meet its scheduled debt and finance lease obligations during the next 12 months. See additional discussion below related to commitments.
The Company, in the past, has secured financing for its Gamma Knife and radiation therapy units. The Company has secured financing for its projects from several lenders and anticipates that it will be able to secure financing on future projects from these or other lending sources, but there can be no assurance that financing will continue to be available on acceptable terms.
