Explanatory Note
On November 30, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Bags. Our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes the results of operations for the period of November 30, 2018 through December 31, 2018. See Note 3. Acquisition, which is included in Part IV, Item 15. "Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules" for further discussion of the acquisition of Bags.
General Overview
In evaluating our financial condition and operating performance, our primary focus is on our gross profit and total general and administrative expenses. Revenue from lease type contracts includes all gross customer collections derived from our lease type contracts (net of local parking taxes), whereas revenue from management type contracts only includes our contractually agreed upon management fees and amounts attributable to ancillary services. Gross customer collections at facilities under management type contracts, therefore, are not included in our revenue. Accordingly, while a change in the proportion of our operating agreements that are structured as lease type contracts may cause significant fluctuations in reported revenue and cost of services, those changes will not artificially affect our gross profit. For example, as of December 31, 2020, 85% of our commercial business was operating under management type contracts. Only 54% of total revenue (excluding reimbursed management type contract revenue) for the year ended December 31, 2020, however, was from management type contracts. Under those contracts, the revenue collected from customers belongs to our clients.
We believe that sophisticated clients (which also include property owners) recognize the potential for parking services, parking management, ground transportation services, baggage handling services, technology-driven mobility solutions and other ancillary services to be a profit generator and/or a service differentiator to their customers. By outsourcing these services, they are able to capture additional profit and improve customer experiences by leveraging the unique operational skills and controls that an experienced services company can offer. Our ability to consistently deliver a uniformly high level of services to our clients, including the use of various technological enhancements, allows us to maximize the profit and/or customer experience to our clients and improves our ability to win contracts and retain existing clients. Our focus on customer service and satisfaction is a key driver of our high retention rate, which was approximately 87% and 93% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, for the Commercial segment.
Commercial Segment Facilities
In order to mitigate some of the effects from the COVID-19 pandemic (“COVID-19”), we converted many of our lease locations to management locations during the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, we were able to exit many less profitable contracts, which were for both lease and management locations. The following table reflects our Commercial facilities (by contractual type) operated at the end of the years indicated:
Revenue
We recognize services revenue from our contracts as the related services are provided. Substantially all of our revenue comes from the following two sources:
Lease type contracts. Consists of all revenue received at lease type locations, including gross receipts (net of local taxes), consulting and real estate development fees, gains on sales of contracts and payments for exercising termination rights. Revenue from lease type contracts includes a reduction for service concessions.
Management type contracts. Consists of management fees, including fixed, variable and/or performance-based fees, and amounts attributable to ancillary services such as accounting, equipment leasing, baggage services, payments received for exercising termination rights, consulting, developmental fees, gains on sales of contracts, insurance and other value-added services. We believe we generally can purchase required insurance at lower rates than our clients can obtain on their own because we effectively self-insure for all liability, worker’s compensation and health care claims by maintaining a large per-claim deductible. As a result, we have generated operating income on the insurance provided under our management type contracts by focusing on our risk management efforts and controlling losses. Management type contract revenues do not include gross customer collections at those facilities, as those revenues belong to the client rather than to us. Management type contracts generally provide us with a management fee regardless of the operating performance of the underlying management type contract.
Reimbursed Management Type Contract Revenue. Consists of the direct reimbursement from the client for operating expenses incurred under a management type contract, which are reflected in our revenue.
Cost of Services
Our cost of services consists of the following:
Lease type contracts. Consists of contractual rents or fees paid to the client and all operating expenses incurred in connection with operating the leased facility. Contractual rents or fees paid to the client are generally based on either a fixed contractual amount, a percentage of gross revenue or a combination thereof. Generally, under a lease type arrangement we are not responsible for major capital expenditures or real estate taxes.
Management type contracts. Cost of services under a management type contract is generally the responsibility of the client. As a result, these costs are not included in our results of operations. However, our reverse management type contracts, which typically provide for larger management fees, do require us to pay for certain costs and those costs are included in our results of operations.
Reimbursed Management Type Contract Expense. Consists of directly reimbursed costs incurred on behalf of a client under a management type contract, which are reflected in our cost of services.
Gross Profit
Gross profit equals our revenue less the cost of generating such revenue. This is the key metric we use to examine our performance because it captures the underlying economic benefit to us of both lease and management type contracts.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses include salaries, wages, payroll taxes, insurance, travel and office related expenses for our headquarters, field offices, supervisory employees, and board of directors.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation is determined using a straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the various asset classes, or in the case of leasehold improvements, over the initial term of the operating lease or its useful life, whichever is shorter. Intangible assets determined to have finite lives are amortized over their remaining estimated useful lives.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price paid over the fair value of net assets acquired. In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board's ("FASB") authoritative accounting guidance on goodwill, we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more often if events or circumstances change that could cause goodwill to become impaired. We have elected to assess the impairment of goodwill annually on October 1 or at an interim date if there is an event or change in circumstances indicating the carrying value may not be recoverable. The goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level; our reporting units represent our operating segments, consisting of Commercial and Aviation. Factors that could trigger an impairment review include, among others, significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the use of acquired assets or our business strategy, and significant negative industry or economic trends.
We may perform a qualitative, rather than quantitative, assessment, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount. As of January 1, 2020, we adopted Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2017-04, which eliminated the two step approach from the current goodwill impairment test and allows impairment to be calculated based on the quantitative assessment. The determination of fair value of a reporting unit utilizes cash flow projections that assume certain future revenue and cost levels, comparable marketplace data, assumed discount rates based upon current market conditions and other valuation factors, all of which involve the use of significant judgment and estimates. We also assess critical areas that may impact our business including economic conditions, market related exposures, competition, changes in service offerings and changes in key personnel.
Beginning in March 2020, COVID-19 and the resulting stay at home orders issued by local governments were impacting certain of our businesses. These factors have significantly impacted the hospitality and travel industries, as well as overall consumer discretionary spending.
Due to the impacts of COVID-19, revenues for certain markets in which we operate have dropped significantly as compared to the expectations as of the October 1, 2019 annual impairment test. We do not know how long the impacts of COVID-19 will or may impact our results. In addition, certain Aviation contracts were terminated during August 2020. The termination of these contracts and the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 on our expected future operating cash flows triggered us to complete a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis for our Aviation reporting unit as of August 31, 2020. Based on the quantitative analysis, we determined that estimated carrying values exceeded implied fair value for the Aviation reporting unit and goodwill was impaired, and therefore an impairment charge was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020. As of October 1, 2020 (our annual goodwill impairment test date), we performed a qualitative assessment of goodwill, since projections used in the August 31, 2020 impairment test have not materially changed and we concluded no further impairment testing was required. See Note 11. Goodwill in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Other Intangibles Assets, net
Other intangible assets represent assets with finite lives that are amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment when circumstances change that would indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. We evaluate the remaining useful life of the other intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to their remaining useful lives. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors, such as changes in our business strategy and internal forecasts. Although management believes the historical assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact reported financial results.
As a result of the termination of certain contracts within the Aviation reporting unit and the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our expected future operating cash flows, we determined certain impairment testing triggers had occurred related to our intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2020. Accordingly, we analyzed undiscounted cash flows for certain intangible assets and determined that estimated net carrying values exceeded undiscounted future cash flows, resulting in certain intangible assets being impaired, resulting in impairment charges being recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020. See Note 10. Other Intangible Assets, net in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
For both goodwill and intangible assets, future events may indicate differences from our judgments and estimates which could, in turn, result in impairment charges. Future events that may result in impairment charges include extended unfavorable economic impacts of COVID-19, increases in interest rates, which would impact discount rates, or other factors which could decrease revenues and profitability of existing locations and changes in the cost structure of existing facilities.
Long-Lived Assets
We evaluate long-lived assets, primarily including right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, leasehold improvements, equipment and construction in progress for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. We group assets at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identified in order to measure impairment. Events or circumstances that would result in an impairment review include a significant change in the use of an asset, the planned sale or disposal of an asset, or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset group. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group. If it is determined to be impaired, the impairment is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value.
As a result of the impact of COVID-19 on our expected future operating cash flows, we determined certain impairment triggers had occurred for certain ROU assets associated with certain asset groups, resulting in impairment charges being recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020. See Note 2. Leases in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Assumptions and estimates used to determine cash flows in the evaluation of impairment and the fair values used to determine the impairment are subject to a degree of judgment and complexity. Any future changes to the assumptions and estimates resulting from changes in actual results or market conditions from those anticipated may affect the carrying value of long-lived assets and could result in additional impairment charges. Future events that may result in impairment charges include extended unfavorable economic impacts of COVID-19, or other factors which could decrease revenues and profitability of existing locations and changes in the cost structure of existing facilities.
Segments
An operating segment is defined as a component of an enterprise that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenue and incur expenses, and about which separate financial information is regularly evaluated by our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), in deciding how to allocate resources. Our CODM is our chief executive officer.
The operating segments are reported to our CODM as Commercial and Aviation.
•
Commercial encompasses our services in healthcare facilities, municipalities, including meter revenue collection and enforcement services, government facilities, hotels, commercial real estate, residential communities, retail, colleges and universities, as well as ancillary services such as shuttle and ground transportation services, valet services, taxi and livery dispatch services and event planning, including shuttle and transportation services.
•
Aviation encompasses our services in aviation (e.g., airports, airline and certain hospitality clients with baggage and parking services), as well as ancillary services, which includes shuttle and ground transportation services, valet services, baggage handling, baggage repair and replacement, remote air check-in services, wheelchair assist services and other services.
•
"Other" consists of ancillary revenue and costs that are not specifically attributable to Commercial or Aviation and certain unallocated items, such as and including prior year insurance reserve adjustments/costs and other corporate items.
In July 2020, we changed our internal reporting segment information reported to the CODM. Certain hospitality locations previously reported under Aviation are now included in Commercial. All prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the Company’s current reporting structure.
Analysis of Results of Operations
2020 Compared to 2019
Existing business represents business that has been operating for at least one year and operating for the entire period in the comparative period being presented. Other business comprises of expired business, conversions and new/acquired business. As a result of COVID-19, we have executed on a strategy to successfully convert certain lease type contracts to management type contracts which should provide a higher gross profit over the contract term. In addition, for those locations that have remained leases, we have worked with landlords to either receive rent concessions or change lease terms to be more favorable to us. Expired business relates to contracts that have expired but where we were operating the business in the comparative period presented. Existing business in the Other segment represents amounts not specifically attributable to Commercial or Aviation and certain unallocated items.
Consolidated results for the for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, included the following notable items:
(1)
Excludes Reimbursed management type contract revenue
(2)
Excludes Reimbursed management type contract expense and lease impairment
Services revenue decreased by $385.9 million, or 41.3%, attributable to the following:
•
Services revenue for lease type contracts decreased $219.5 million, or 53.7%, primarily driven by a decrease of $133.4 million from existing business, $43.0 million from locations that converted to management type contracts during the periods presented, $41.2 million from expired business, and $1.9 million from new/acquired business. Existing business revenue decreased $133.4 million, or 47.2%, primarily due to a decrease in transient revenue as a result of COVID-19.
•
Services revenue for management type contracts decreased $166.4 million, or 31.6%, primarily due to a decrease of $140.9 million from existing business and $48.3 million from expired business, partially offset by an increase of $21.4 million from new/acquired business and $1.4 million from locations that converted from lease type contracts during the periods presented. Existing business revenue decreased $140.9 million, or 34.1%, primarily due to a decrease in activity for volume based management type contracts primarily related to the Aviation segment as a result of COVID-19, partially offset by $5.6 million of termination fees received related to certain terminated Aviation contacts.
Gross profit decreased by $197.7 million, or 86.7%, attributable to the following:
•
Gross profit for lease type contracts decreased $47.6 million, or 113.3%, and gross profit percentage was negative 3.0% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 10.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Gross profit declined as a result of decreases in gross profit for existing business, expired business, locations that converted to management type contracts during the periods presented and new/acquired business. Gross profit for existing business decreased $28.5 million, or 81.7%, primarily due to decreases in transient revenue as a result of COVID-19 and an increase in legal and bad debt expense, partially offset by the recognition of certain rent concessions of $57.2 million, as well as a decrease in compensation, benefits and overall lower net operating costs.
•
Gross profit for management type contracts decreased $53.0 million, or 28.5%, while gross profit percentage for management type contracts increased to 37.0% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 35.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Gross profit declined as a result of decreases in gross profit for existing business and expired business, partially offset by increases in new/acquired business and locations that converted from lease type contracts during the periods presented. Gross profit for existing business decreased $37.1 million, or 24.6%, primarily due to a decrease in activity for volume based management type contracts primarily related to the Aviation segment as a result of COVID-19 and an increase in bad debt and legal expenses, partially offset by decreases in compensation, benefits, overall net operating costs and $5.6 million of termination fees received related to certain terminated Aviation contacts.
•
We recognized $97.1 million of impairment charges related to operating lease ROU assets in the Commercial segment during the year ended December 31, 2020. Due to the impact of COVID-19 on our operations, our projected future operating cash flows for certain locations is expected to lower. As a result, the fair value of those locations was lower than their carrying value and corresponding impairment charges were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020. No impairment charge was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2019.
General and administrative expenses decreased $23.6 million, or 21.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily related to lower stock based compensation expense related to performance share units during the year ended December 31, 2020, as well as lower performance based compensation and cost initiatives, partially offset by an increase in acquisition, restructuring and integration costs. Impairment charges of $1.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to certain abandoned operating leases. No similar impairment charges were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019.
We recognized $135.3 million of impairment charges related to certain finite lived intangible assets and goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2020 in the Aviation segment. Due to the impact of COVID-19 on our operations and the termination of certain Aviation contracts, our projected future revenue, profitability and operating cash flows within the Aviation segment are expected to be lower than our prior projections. As a result, the implied fair value of certain asset groups related to finite lived intangible assets within the Aviation segment were lower than their carrying value, resulting in $75.8 million of impairment charges being recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, based on the quantitative goodwill impairment analysis performed by us as of August 31, 2020, the estimated carrying values for the Aviation reporting unit exceeded their implied fair value, resulting in $59.5 million of goodwill impairment charges being recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020. No similar impairment charges were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019.
Our effective tax rate was 28.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 27.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 reflects the benefit related to the ability to carryback our current year federal Net Operating Loss (“NOL”) to tax years that had a higher tax rate.

2019 Compared to 2018
Consolidated results for the for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, include the following notable items:
(1)
Excludes Reimbursed management type contract revenue
(2)
Excludes Reimbursed management type contract expense
Services revenue increased by $159.5 million, or 20.6%, attributable to the following:
•
Services revenue for lease type contracts decreased $5.0 million, or 1.2%, primarily driven by a decrease of $26.9 million from expired business, partially offset by an increase of $12.0 million from new/acquired business, $9.7 million from existing business, and $0.2 million from locations that converted from management type contracts during the periods presented. Existing business revenue increased $9.7 million, or 3.0%, primarily due to an increase in fees for transient revenue.
•
Services revenue for management type contracts increased $164.5 million, or 45.5%, primarily due to an increase of $185.9 million from new/acquired business, mainly due to the acquisition of Bags, and $0.2 million from locations that converted from lease type contracts during the periods presented,
partially offset by a decrease of $17.7 million from expired business and $3.9 million from existing business. Existing business revenue decreased $3.9 million, or 1.3%, primarily due to changes in contract terms for certain management type contracts, whereby the contract terms converted from “reverse” management type contracts to management type contracts, which typically have lower management fees from the facility owner but do not require us to pay certain operating costs associated with the facilities operation, partially offset by increased management fees.
Gross profit increased by $44.1 million, or 24.0%, attributable to the following:
•
Gross profit for lease type contracts increased $5.7 million, or 15.7%, and gross profit percentage increased to 10.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 8.8% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Gross profit increased as a result of increases from existing business, new/acquired business, expired business and locations that converted from management type contracts during the periods presented. Gross profit for existing business increased $2.8 million, or 9.1%, primarily due to increases in transient revenue, partially offset by an increase in compensation, benefits costs and rent expense.
•
Gross profit for management type contracts increased $38.4 million, or 26.0%, while gross profit percentage for management type contracts decreased to 35.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 40.9% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Gross profit increased as a result of increases from new/acquired business, primarily due to the acquisition of Bags, partially offset by decreases in expired business and existing business. Gross profit for existing business decreased $0.9 million, or 0.7%, primarily due to increases in net operating costs.
General and administrative expenses increased $18.0 million, or 19.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily related to the acquisition of Bags, a one-time $1.7 million cost recovery (reduction of expense) from a vendor partner recognized in 2018 and higher compensation and benefit costs, including costs associated with our performance-based compensation program, partially offset by a reduction in acquisition, restructuring and integration related costs.
Our effective tax rate was 27.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 25.8% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 reflects the benefit recorded in 2018 related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the ”2017 Tax Act”).
The following charts summarize our revenues (excluding reimbursed management type contract revenue) and gross profit by segment for years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.

Lease type contract revenue decreased $8.9 million, or 2.3%, to $377.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $386.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Revenue from other business decreased by $17.4 million, or 19.7%, primarily due to a decrease of $26.5 million from expired business, partially offset by increases of $8.9 million from new/acquired business and $0.2 million from locations that converted from management type contracts during the periods presented. Existing business revenue increased $8.5 million, or 2.9%, primarily due to an increase in transient revenue.
Management type contracts. Management type contract revenue increased $15.2 million, or 6.1%, to $264.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $249.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Management type revenue from other business increased by $15.9 million, or 34.9%, primarily due to increases of $35.8 million from new/acquired business, mainly due to the acquisition of Bags, and $0.2 million in locations that converted from lease type contracts during the periods presented, partially offset by a decrease of $20.1 million from expired business. Existing business revenue decreased by $0.7 million, or 3.0%, primarily due to a decrease in volume based management type contracts.
Commercial segment: Gross Profit
Lease type contracts. Gross profit increased $3.7 million, or 14.3%, to $29.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $25.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Gross profit percentage increased to 7.8% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 6.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Gross profit increased as a result of increases in existing business, expired business, new/acquired business and locations that converted from management type contracts in the periods presented. Gross profit for existing business increased $1.4 million, or 6.3%, primarily due to increases in transient revenue, partially offset by an increase in compensation and benefits costs, as well as rent expense.
Management type contracts. Gross profit increased $5.8 million, or 5.9%, to $104.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $98.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Gross profit percentage decreased to 39.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 39.4% for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Gross profit for existing business increased $0.1 million, or 0.1%.
Aviation segment: Services Revenue
Lease type contracts. Lease type contract revenue increased $3.7 million, or 13.7%, to $30.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $27.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Revenue from other business increased by $2.7 million, or 50.9%, primarily due to an increase of $3.1 million new/acquired business, partially offset by a decrease of $0.4 million from expired business. Existing business revenue increased $1.0 million, or 4.6%, primarily due to an increase in transient revenue.
Management type contracts. Management type contract revenue increased $150.6 million, or 148.8%, to $251.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $101.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Revenue from other business decreased by $152.5 million, or 648.9%, primarily due to increases of $150.1 million from new/acquired business and $2.4 million from expired business. Existing business decreased $1.9 million, or 2.4%, primarily due to changes in contract terms for certain management type contracts, whereby the contract terms converted from “reverse” management type contracts to management type contracts, which typically have lower management fees from the facility owner but do not require us to pay certain operating costs associated with the facilities operation, partially offset by increased management fees.
Aviation segment: Gross Profit
Lease type contracts. Gross profit increased $0.9 million, or 12.3%, to $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

“Other” segment
"Other" consists of ancillary revenue and costs that are not specifically identifiable to Commercial or Aviation and certain unallocated items, such as and including prior year insurance reserve adjustments/costs and other corporate items. Total service revenue in “Other” decreased $1.1 million, or 9.5%, to $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Gross profit for “Other” decreased $0.6 million, or 2.9%, to $20.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $20.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Analysis of Financial Condition
Liquidity and Capital Resources
General
We continually project anticipated cash requirements for our operating, investing and financing needs, as well as cash flows generated from operating activities available to meet these needs. Our operating needs can include, among other items, commitments for cost of services, operating leases, payroll, insurance claims, interest and legal settlements. Our investing and financing spending can include payments for acquired businesses, joint ventures, capital expenditures, cost of contracts, distributions to noncontrolling interests, share repurchases and payments on our outstanding indebtedness.
As of December 31, 2020, we had $13.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and $190.3 million of borrowing availability under our Senior Credit Facility. COVID-19 and the resulting global disruptions have negatively affected the global economy, as well as our business and the businesses of our customers and clients. The full impact of COVID-19 on our business and the businesses of our customers and clients is unknown and highly unpredictable and could continue beyond the containment of the COVID-19 outbreak. We are taking further actions to improve our liquidity, including, without limitation, reducing operating expenses and capital expenditures and suspending repurchases of our common stock. Based on these actions and our expectations regarding the impact of COVID-19, we believe we will be able to generate sufficient liquidity to satisfy our obligations and remain in compliance with our existing debt covenants for the next twelve months.
Outstanding Indebtedness
As of December 31, 2020, we had total indebtedness of approximately $362.1 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from $369.0 million as of December 31, 2019. The $362.1 million included:
•
$330.6 million under our Senior Credit Facility (as defined below); and
•
$31.5 million of other debt including finance lease obligations.
Senior Credit Facility
On November 30, 2018, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, and various other institutions (the “Lenders”), pursuant to which the Lenders made available to us, a senior secured credit facility (the “Senior Credit Facility”). The Senior Credit Facility was further amended during 2020 and 2021. See Item 9B. Other Information for further information.
Under the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement (as defined in Item 9B. Other Information), term loans under the Senior Credit Facility are subject to scheduled quarterly payments of principal in installments equal to 1.25% of the initial aggregate principal amount of such term loan through the first quarter of 2021 and will increase to 1.875% thereafter.
We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of December 31, 2020.
As of December 31, 2020, we had $190.3 million of borrowing availability under the Credit Agreement, of which we could have borrowed $21.6 million on December 31, 2020 and remained in compliance with the above described covenants as of such date. Our borrowing availability under the Amended Credit Agreement is limited only as of our fiscal quarter-end by the covenant restrictions described above. At December 31, 2020, we had $49.0 million letters of credit outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility and borrowings against the Senior Credit Facility aggregated to $333.2 million (excluding debt discount of $0.9 million and deferred financing costs of $1.7 million).
Stock Repurchases
On March 10, 2020, we suspended stock repurchases in order to help improve liquidity in response to the impacts of COVID-19.
In May 2016, our Board of Directors (the “Board”) authorized us to repurchase, on the open market, shares of our outstanding common stock in an amount not to exceed $30.0 million. Under this program, the entire authorized amount was applied to repurchase 988,767 shares of common stock at an average price of $30.30 resulting in completion of the program in August 2019.
In July 2019, the Board authorized us to repurchase, on the open market, shares of our outstanding common stock in an amount not to exceed $50.0 million in aggregate. Under this program,
we repurchased 393,375 shares of common stock at an average price of $38.78 during the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we repurchased 652,000 shares of common stock at an average price of $38.88 under this program.
In March 2020, the Board authorized a new program to repurchase, on the open market, shares of our outstanding stock in an amount not to exceed $50.0 million in aggregate. We have yet to repurchase shares under this program.
As of December 31, 2020, $59.4 million remained available for repurchase under the July 2019 and March 2020 stock repurchase programs. Purchases of our common stock may be made in open market transactions effected through a broker-dealer at prevailing market prices, in block trades, or by other means in accordance with Rules 10b-18 and 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 at time and prices considered to be appropriate at our discretion. As noted above, we have currently suspended stock repurchases. The share repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any particular amount of common stock, has no fixed termination date and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion.
Share repurchase activity under the stock repurchase programs for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was as follows:
The remaining authorized amounts in the aggregate under the July 2019 and March 2020 repurchase programs as of December 31, 2020 was as follows:
Letters of Credit
We provided letters of credit totaling $14.4 million and $17.2 million to our casualty insurance carriers to collateralize our casualty insurance program as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
We provided $34.6 million and $33.0 million in letters of credit to collateralize other obligations as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Interest Rate Collars
In May 2019, we entered into three-year interest rate collar contracts with an aggregate $222.3 million notional amount. The interest rate collars are used to manage interest rate risk associated with variable interest rate borrowings under the Credit Agreement. The interest rate collars establish a range where we will pay the counterparties if the one-month U.S. dollar LIBOR rate falls below the established floor rate, and the counterparties will pay us if the one-month U.S. dollar LIBOR rate exceeds the established ceiling rate of 2.5%. The interest rate collars settle monthly through the termination date of April 2022. No payments or receipts are exchanged on the interest rate collar contracts unless interest rates rise above or fall below the pre-determined ceiling or floor rates. The notional amount amortized consistently with the term loan portion of the Senior Credit Facility under the Credit Agreement prior to the Third Amendment. The interest rate collars were classified as cash flow hedges through May 5, 2020. On May 6, 2020, concurrent with entering into the Third Amendment, we de-designated the three-year interest rate collars. Prior to de-designation, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the collars was reported in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Upon de-designation, the balance in Accumulated other comprehensive loss is being reclassified to Other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income on a straight-line basis through April 2022, which is over the remaining life for which the interest rate collars had previously been designated as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of the collars after de-designation are included within Other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income. For the year ended December 31, 2020, $1.6 million of interest was paid related to the interest rate collars.
We do not enter into derivative instruments for any speculative purposes.
Daily Cash Collections
As a result of day-to-day activity at our parking locations, we collect significant amounts of cash. Lease type contract revenue is generally deposited into our local bank accounts, with a portion remitted to our clients in the form of rental payments according to the terms of the leases. Under management type contracts, clients may require us to deposit the daily receipts into one of our local bank accounts, with the cash in excess of our operating expenses and management fees remitted to the clients at negotiated intervals. Other clients may require us to deposit the daily receipts into client designated bank accounts and the clients then reimburse us for operating expenses and pay our management fee subsequent to month-end, or may require segregated bank accounts for the receipts and disbursements at locations. Our working capital and liquidity may be adversely affected if a significant number of our clients require us to deposit all parking revenues into their respective accounts.
Our liquidity also fluctuates on an intra-month and intra-year basis depending on the contract mix and timing of significant cash payments. Additionally, our ability to utilize cash deposited into our local accounts is dependent upon the availability and movement of that cash into our corporate accounts. For all these reasons, from time to time, we carry a significant cash balance, while also utilizing our Senior Credit Facility.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
We had cash and cash equivalents of $13.9 million and $24.1 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The cash balances reflect our ability to utilize funds deposited into our bank accounts. Availability, timing of deposits and the subsequent movement of cash into our corporate bank accounts may result in significant changes to our cash balances.
Summary of Cash Flows
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities and availability under our Senior Credit Facility. Our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:
Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $35.8 million to $40.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 from $76.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities primarily resulted from the impacts of COVID-19, partially offset by lower cash taxes and favorable working capital management.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased $5.1 million to $76.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 from $70.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities primarily resulted from increased revenue, partially offset by higher cash interest.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $11.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $1.0 million from $12.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. Cash used to purchase leasehold improvements, equipment and cost of contracts was $11.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $12.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold investments and equipment for $1.2 million and bought out a minority partner for $1.7 million as part of our decision to convert our agreement with the Bradley International Airport to a standard management type agreement.
Net cash used in investing activities was $12.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $255.9 million from $268.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. Cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 included $277.9 million used for the acquisition of Bags and $19.3 million in proceeds received from the sale of an equity method investee’s sale of assets. Cash used to purchase leasehold improvements, equipment and cost of contracts was $12.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $10.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.
Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities was $39.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $40.4 million from $79.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower repurchases of common stock and lower net payments on the Senior Credit Facility.
Net cash used in financing activities was $79.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $215.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 included net proceeds from the Senior Credit Facility of $222.2 million, which was primarily used for the acquisition of Bags. Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 included $47.6 million for the repurchase of our common stock and net payments on the Senior Credit Facility of $26.3.
Summary Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments
The following table summarizes certain of our contractual obligations at December 31, 2020 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods. The nature of our business is to manage parking facilities and as a result, we do not have significant short-term purchase obligations.
(1)
Represents minimum rental commitments, excluding (i) contingent rent provisions under all non-cancelable leases; and (ii) sublease income of $3.8 million.
(2)
Represents lease type contracts that meet the definition of service concession arrangements under Topic 853.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company's critical accounting policies and estimates as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We base these estimates and judgments on historic experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their complexity and the possibility that future events affecting them may differ materially from our current judgments and estimates.
This listing of critical accounting policies is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results, which are included in Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies and Practices of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15. "Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules."
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price paid over the fair value of net assets acquired. In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board's ("FASB") authoritative accounting guidance on goodwill, we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more often if events or circumstances change that could cause goodwill to become impaired. We have elected to assess the impairment of goodwill annually on October 1 or at an interim date if there is an event or change in circumstances indicating the carrying value may not be recoverable. The goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level; the Company's reporting units represent its operating segments, consisting of Commercial and Aviation. Factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the use of acquired assets or its business strategy, and significant negative industry or economic trends.
We may perform a qualitative, rather than quantitative, assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. As of January 1, 2020, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2017-04, which eliminated the two step approach from the current goodwill impairment test and allows impairment to be calculated based on the quantitative assessment. The determination of fair value of a reporting unit utilizes cash flow projections that assume certain future revenue and cost levels, comparable marketplace data, assumed discount rates based upon current market conditions and other valuation factors, all of which involve the use of significant judgement and estimates. We also assess critical areas that may impact our business including economic conditions, market related exposures, competition, changes in service offerings and changes in key personnel.
Other intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We evaluate the remaining useful life of other intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to their remaining useful lives. In addition, other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when circumstances change that would indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of intangibles are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors, such as changes in our business strategy and internal forecasts. Although management believes the historical assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results.
Long-Lived Assets
We evaluate long-lived assets, including ROU assets, leasehold improvements, equipment and construction in progress, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. We group assets at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identified in order to measure an impairment. Events or circumstances that would result in an impairment review include a significant change in the use of an asset, the planned sale or disposal of an asset, or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset group. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group. If it is determined to be impaired, the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value.
Assumptions and estimates used to determine cash flows in the evaluation of impairment and the fair values used to determine the impairment are subject to a degree of judgment and complexity. Any changes to the assumptions and estimates resulting from changes in actual results or market conditions from those anticipated may affect the carrying value of long-lived assets and could result in an impairment charge.
Insurance Reserves
We purchase comprehensive casualty insurance covering certain claims that arise in connection with our operations. In addition, we purchase umbrella/excess liability coverage. Under the various liability and workers' compensation insurance policies, we are obligated to pay directly or reimburse the insurance carrier for the deductible / retention amount of each loss covered by our general / garage liability, automobile, workers' compensation and garage keepers legal liability policies. As a result, we are in effect, self-insured for all claims within the deductible / retention amount of each loss. Any loss over the deductible / retention is the responsibility of the third-party insurer. We apply the provisions as defined in the guidance related to accounting for contingencies, in determining the timing and amount of expense recognition associated with claims against us. The expense recognition is based upon our determination of an unfavorable outcome of a claim being deemed as probable and capable of being reasonably estimated, as defined in the guidance related to accounting for contingencies. This determination requires the use of judgment in both the estimation of probability and the amount to be recognized as an expense. We utilize historical claims experience and exposures specific to each type of insurance, along with actuarial methods performed quarterly by a third party actuarial adviser in determining the required level of insurance reserves. As of December 31, 2020, the insurance reserve for general, garage, automobile and workers’ compensation liabilities was recorded in Accrued and other current liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for short term and long term balances, respectively. Future information regarding historical loss experience may require changes to the level of insurance reserves and could result in increased expense recognition in the future.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
We report accounts receivable, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts, to represent our estimate of the amount that ultimately will be realized in cash. In determining the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts, we primarily use the review of specific accounts but also use historical collection trends and aging of receivables and make adjustments in the allowance as necessary. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances could have an impact on the collection of existing receivable balances or future allowance considerations.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense involves management judgment as to the ultimate resolution of any tax issues. Historically, our assessments of the ultimate resolution of tax issues have been reasonably accurate. The current open issues are not dissimilar from historical items.
Deferred income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, such that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between US GAAP amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws and tax rates in effect for the periods in which these temporary differences are expected to reverse or be settled. Income tax expense is the tax payable for the period plus the change during the period in deferred income taxes. We have certain state net operating loss carry forwards which expire in 2040. We consider a number of factors in our assessment of the recoverability of our net operating loss carryforwards including their expiration dates, the limitations imposed due to the change in ownership, as well as future projections of income. Future changes in our operating performance, along with these considerations, may significantly impact the amount of net operating losses ultimately recovered, and our assessment of their recoverability.
When evaluating our tax positions, we account for uncertainty in income taxes in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process, the first step being recognition. The first step is to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on only the technical merits of the position and the weight of available evidence. If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not threshold, which is more than 50% likely of being realized, the benefit of that position is not recognized in our financial statements. The second step is measurement of the tax benefit. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more-likely-than-not of being realized, which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority.
Legal and Other Contingencies
We are subject to claims and litigation in the normal course of our business. The outcomes of claims and legal proceedings brought against us and other loss contingencies are subject to uncertainty. We accrue a charge when we determine that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When a loss is probable, we record an accrual based on the reasonably estimable loss or range of loss. When no point of loss is more likely than another, we record the lowest amount in the estimated range of loss and disclose the estimated range. We do not record liabilities for reasonably possible loss contingencies, but do disclose a range of reasonably possible losses if they are material and we are able to estimate such a range. If we cannot provide a range of reasonably possible losses, we explain the factors that prevent us from determining such a range. In addition, we accrue for the authoritative judgments or assertions made against us by government agencies at the time of their rendering regardless of our intent to appeal. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether an accrual should be established or adjusted. Estimating the probability that a loss will occur and estimating the amount of a loss or a range of loss involves significant estimation and judgment.
