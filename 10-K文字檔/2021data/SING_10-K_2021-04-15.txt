Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include,but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report. Our audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
Plan of Operation
We are focused on providing renewable energy solutions and energy-efficient applications to drive better health and living. We currently have core subsidiaries including solar and air purification. We built our portfolio through synergistic acquisitions, products, and partnerships to provide a rich, diversified holding base. The Company’s initial focus is on solar energy and we are committed to building a foundation for future expansion opportunities and building brands based on technology solutions we believe will increase efficiencies across various markets. We strive to create long-term value for our shareholders by helping our partner companies to increase their market penetration, grow revenue and improve cash flow and that complement our desire to build a comprehensive national renewable energy network. The Company is actively looking for and executing on strategic initiatives to sell, partner with or spin-off other non renewable energy related assets.
Results from Operations - For the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019.
Net Revenue
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had total sales of $2,878,161 and $3,343,833, respectively. The decrease of $465,672 in revenues was due primarily to the pandemic which shut down the traditional door to door sales model of Singlepoint Direct Solar, LLC. Additionally, the Company experienced delays in permitting, and site visits which continued throughout the year and into 2021. Social distancing guidelines, stay-at-home orders and similar government measures associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as actions by individuals to reduce their potential exposure to the virus, contributed to a decline in origination, with new contract origination. This decline reflected an inability by our dealers to perform in-person sales calls based on the stay-at-home orders in some locations. In the third quarter 2020 the Company also took a one-time adjustment for the proportional sales related to residential solar revenue derived from Direct Solar America of $276,382.68 for cancelled projects.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue decreased from $2,353,056 for the year ending December 31, 2019 to $2,204,391 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $148,665. This decrease was due primarily to the decreased revenues from our subsidiary Direct Solar America.
Gross Profit
As a result of the foregoing, our gross profit was $673,770 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with $990,777, for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in our overall gross profit was primarily a result of the subsidiary Direct Solar America.
Operating Expenses
Total operating expenses decreased from $6,455,236 in 2019 to $3,972,882 in 2020, a decrease of $2,482,354. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in general and administrative expense of $3,111,304 as a result of additional costs related to our newly acquired subsidiaries, our new office, marketing, insurance and travel. We had a decrease in consulting fees of $219,649 in the year ended December 31, 2020 from the year ending December 31, 2019. Professional and legal fees increased $22,970 for the year ending December 31, 2020, as compared to year ending December 31, 2019, primarily due to increased audit and legal expenses as a result of the Company complying with 1934 Act reporting obligations of the SEC. Investor relations expense increased from $168,117 for the year ending December 31, 2019, as compared to $181,637 for the year ending December 31, 2020, an increase of $13,460.
Other Expense
Other expense decreased from $2,604,274 in 2019 to $1,145,393 in 2020 due primarily to the decrease in interest expense and amortization of debt discounts as a result of our decrease in convertible notes payable during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Net Loss
For the year ended December 31, 2019 the Company had a net loss of approximately $8,068,733 compared to a net loss of approximately $4,444,505 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease in net loss of $3,624,228. The decrease in net loss is primarily a result of the change in fair value of derivative liabilities as well as a decrease in overall operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020 the Company had $2,915,680 in total assets, including $198,473 in cash, $3,368 of accounts receivable, $4,834 in prepaid expenses, $63,456 in inventory, and non-current assets of $2,645,549 related to property, investments and goodwill. The Company had negative working capital of $5,646,208 as of December 31, 2020.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company has yet to achieve profitable operations, and while the Company hopes to achieve profitable operations in the future, if not it may need to raise capital from stockholders or other sources to sustain operations and to ultimately achieve viable operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operating activities, as well as its ability to raise capital. The Company’s operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties and it is uncertain if the Company will be able to become profitable and continue growth for the foreseeable future. If management is not able to increase revenue and/or manage operating expenses, the Company may not be able to achieve profitability. The Company’s ability to continue in existence is dependent on the Company’s ability to achieve profitable operations.
To continue operations for the next 12 months we will have a cash need of approximately $2.0 million. Should we not be able to fulfill our cash needs through the increase of revenue we will need to raise money through outside investors through convertible notes, debt or similar instrument(s). The Company plans to pay off current liabilities through sales and increasing revenue through sales of Company services and or products, or through financing activities as mentioned above, although there is no guarantee that the Company will ultimately do so.
Advances from Officer
The Company’s CEO advanced the Company funds during 2020 and 2019, with a balance due of $911,826 and $735,000 respectfully, plus accrued interest of $216,807 and $96,273 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These balances accrue interest at 12% beginning October 1, 2018, are unsecured and due on demand.
In November 2020 the Company effectuated the sale of 1,075,527 shares of Common Stock of Jacksam Corporation in exchange for the extinguishment of $218,874 of bona fide debt owed by the Company to its CEO.
Our cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are summarized below:
Net Cash Used in Operating Activities

Net Cash Provided in Investing Activities

Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, contingencies and taxes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Loss Contingencies
The Company is subject to various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company considers the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as its ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when management concludes that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company regularly evaluates current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted.
Income Taxes
The Company recognizes deferred tax assets (future tax benefits) and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the expected future tax return benefits or consequences of those differences, which are expected to be either deductible or taxable when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We are not currently a party to, or otherwise involved with, any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This standard provides a single set of guidelines for revenue recognition to be used across all industries and requires additional disclosures. It is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2018 and it did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
Purchase of Significant Equipment
We have not previously, nor do we intend to purchase any significant equipment during the next twelve months.
