Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Company Overview
We are a growth-oriented renewable fuels technology and development company that is commercializing the next generation of renewable low-carbon liquid transportation fuels, such as sustainable aviation fuel and renewable isooctane (which we refer to as “renewable premium gasoline”), with the potential to achieve a “net zero” greenhouse gas footprint and address global needs of reducing GHG emissions with sustainable alternatives to petroleum fuels. Our technology transforms carbon from the atmosphere using photosynthetic energy, wind energy and biogas energy into liquid hydrocarbons with a low or potentially “net-zero” GHG footprint.
As next generation renewable fuels, our hydrocarbon transportation fuels have the advantage of being “drop-in” substitutes for conventional fuels that are derived from crude oil, working seamlessly and without modification in existing fossil-fuel based engines, supply chains and storage infrastructure. In addition, with SAF, the carbon footprint of air travel can be reduced, or in the long run, eliminated on a net carbon basis, without change to planes or fuel systems. In addition to the potential of net-zero carbon emissions across the whole fuel life-cycle, our renewable fuels eliminate other pollutants associated with the burning of traditional fossil fuels such as particulates and sulfur, while delivering superior performance. We believe that the world is substantially under-supplied with low-carbon, drop-in renewable fuels that can be immediately used in existing transportation engines and infrastructure, and we are uniquely positioned to grow in serving that demand.
We use low-carbon, renewable resource-based raw materials as feedstocks. In the near-term, our feedstocks will primarily consist of non-food corn. As our technology is applied globally, feedstocks can consist of sugar cane, molasses or other cellulosic sugars derived from wood, agricultural residues and waste. Our patented fermentation yeast biocatalyst produces isobutanol, a four-carbon alcohol, via the fermentation of renewable plant biomass carbohydrates. The resulting renewable isobutanol has a variety of direct applications but, more importantly to our fundamental strategy, serves as a building block to make renewable isooctane (which we refer to as renewable premium gasoline) and SAF using simple and common chemical conversion processes. We also plan to reduce or eliminate fossil-based process energy inputs by replacing them with renewable energy such as wind-powered electricity and renewable natural gas.
Our technology represents a new generation of renewable fuel technology that overcomes the limitations of first-generation renewable fuels.
Net-Zero Projects
In early 2021, we announced the concept of “Net-Zero Projects” for the production of energy dense liquid hydrocarbons using renewable energy and our proprietary technology. The concept of a Net-Zero Project is to convert renewable energy (photosynthetic, wind, renewable natural gas, biogas) from a variety of sources into energy dense liquid hydrocarbons, that when burned in traditional engines, have the potential to achieve net-zero GHG emissions across the whole lifecycle of the liquid fuel: from the way carbon is captured from the atmosphere, processed to make liquid fuel products, and including the end use (burning as a fuel for cars, planes, trucks, and ships). We announced that our project is currently planned to be constructed at Lake Preston, South Dakota will be the first Net-Zero Project (the “Net-Zero 1 Project”). We expect that the Net-Zero 1 Project will have the capability to produce liquid hydrocarbons that when burned have a “net-zero” greenhouse gas footprint. We currently expect the Net-Zero 1 Project to have a capacity of 45 MGPY of hydrocarbons (for renewable premium gasoline and SAF, based on current take-or-pay contracts), to produce more than 350,000,000 pounds per year of high protein feed products for use in the food chain, to produce enough renewable natural gas to be self-sufficient for the production process needs, and also to generate renewable electricity with a combined heat and power system. We also expect that the Net-Zero 1 Project will utilize wind energy. Based on current engineering work completed to date, the unleveraged capital cost for the Net-Zero 1 Project is projected to be on the order of $650 million, including the hydrocarbon production and related renewable energy infrastructure which includes anaerobic digestion to produce biogas to run our plant and generate some electricity on-site.
Recent Developments
SAS Amendment. In February 2021, we signed an amendment to our Fuel Sales Agreement with Scandinavian Airlines System (“SAS”) to supply 5 million gallons per year of SAF beginning in 2024.
Lake Preston Site. On December 21, 2020, we announced that we optioned the right to purchase approximately 240 acres of land near Lake Preston, SD (the “Lake Preston Site”). The Lake Preston Site is expected to be the location of the Net-Zero 1 Project. We intend to make a decision on whether to purchase the Lake Preston Site in the future as part of the Citigroup led project financing process.
Senior Secured Debt. On December 31, 2020, we reported that all obligations under its 12% convertible senior secured notes due 2020/2021 (the “2020/21 Notes”) had been fully paid and satisfied, and the 2020/21 Notes and the related indenture have been terminated in accordance with its terms at maturity on December 31, 2020.
On July 10, 2020, the holders of the 2020/21 Notes converted $2.0 million in aggregate outstanding principal amount of 2020/21 Notes (including the applicable make-whole payment) into an aggregate of 4,169,426 shares of common stock. In December 2020, the holders of the 2020/21 Notes converted the remaining $12.7 million in aggregate outstanding principal amount of 2020/21 Notes (including the applicable make-whole payment) into an aggregate of 5,672,654 shares of common stock pursuant to the terms of the indenture, which represented the entire outstanding principal amount of the 2020/21 Notes.
At-the-Market Offering Program. On December 30, 2020, the at-the-market offering program was amended to provide available capacity under the at-the-market offering program of $150.0 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued 3,518,121 shares of common stock under the at-the-market offering program for total proceeds of $8.4 million, net of commissions and other offering related expenses. During the period January 1, 2021 to February 26, 2021, we issued 24,420,579 shares of common stock under the at-the-market offering program for total proceeds of $135.8 million, net of commissions and other offering related expenses.
January 2021 Offering. On January 19, 2021, we completed a registered direct offering of common stock priced at-the-market under Nasdaq rules of an aggregate of 43,750,000 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $8.00 per share. After deducting placement agent’s fees, advisory fees and other offering expenses payable by us, we received net proceeds of approximately $321.7 million.
COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on global commercial activity, including the global transportation industry and its supply chain, and has contributed to significant volatility in financial markets. It has also resulted in increased travel restrictions and extended shutdowns of businesses in various industries including, among others, the airline industry, and significantly reduced overall economic output. It is possible that that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on general economic activity could negatively impact our revenue and operating results for 2021 and beyond. In light of the current and potential future disruption to our business operations and those of its customers, suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business, we considered the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global transportation industry could continue to result in less demand for our transportation fuel products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and our prospects for the foreseeable future. The suspension of ethanol production at our Luverne Facility and reduction in our workforce during the first quarter of 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19 had an adverse impact on our financial results for the fiscal year ended 2020 reducing revenue by 77% compared to 2019. There is also a risk that COVID-19 could have a material adverse impact on the development of our Net-Zero 1 Project, customer demand and cash flow, depending on the extent of our future production activities.
Results of Operations
The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes to those Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in this Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve significant risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth under “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Report, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.
This section of this Report discusses year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019, as well as other discussions of 2020 and 2019 items. We have omitted discussion of the year ended December 31, 2018 (the earliest of the three years covered by our Consolidated Financial Statements presented in this Report) as permitted by the SEC’s recent amendments to Regulation S-K. The complete Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 and other discussions of 2018 items can be found within Part II, Item 7, to our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 17, 2020, which is available free of charge on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and our corporate website at www.gevo.com.
Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
(in thousands)
Revenue. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized revenue of $5.5 million associated with the sale of 2.4 million gallons of ethanol, as well as isobutanol and related products, a decrease of $19.0 million from the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily the result of terminating ethanol and distiller's grains production at the Luverne Facility in March 2020 as a result of COVID-19 and in response to an unfavorable commodity environment. Our Luverne Facility is currently shut down until further notice. Currently, the South Hampton Facility is not producing renewable premium gasoline or jet fuel. We expect to produce isobutanol in intermittent campaigns during 2021 to supply the South Hampton Facility so that renewable premium gasoline or jet fuel can be produced in 2021.
Hydrocarbon revenues are comprised of SAF, isooctane and isooctene sales. Hydrocarbon revenue decreased $0.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily as a result of fewer shipments of finished products from the South Hampton Facility.
Cost of goods sold. Our cost of goods sold decreased $21.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year. Production was decreased compared to the prior year due to terminating ethanol production in March 2020 as a result of COVID-19 and in response to an unfavorable commodity environment. Cost of goods sold during the year ended December 31, 2020 included $9.3 million associated with the production of isobutanol, ethanol and related products and $5.7 million in depreciation expense. Cost of goods sold during the year ended December 31, 2019 included $30.4 million associated with the production of isobutanol, ethanol and related products and $6.3 million in depreciation expense.
Until the Luverne Facility restarts production, cost of goods sold will primarily be comprised of costs to process SAF, isooctane and isooctene at our South Hampton Facility as well as costs to maintain the Luverne Facility.
Research and development expense. We continue to develop technologies for the production of isobutanol. Research and development expenses stayed relatively flat during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year.
Selling, general and administrative expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $2.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, primarily due to increases of $1.5 million in personal cost attributed to increased hiring, increases of $0.9 million in consulting service due to related regulatory requirements, marketing and investor relations expenditures and increases in insurance cost totaling $0.5 million, offset by a reduction $0.4 million in travel expenses due to COVID-19.
Restructuring Costs. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred $0.3 million of restructuring charges related to the restructuring of Agri-Energy in response to COVID-19, termination of employees at Agri-Energy and Gevo and renegotiating contracts.
Interest expense. Interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $2.1 million as compared to $2.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease of $0.6 million of interest expense was due to lower amortization of original issue discounts and debt issuance costs and conversion of $2.0 million of 2020/21 Notes into common stock during July 2020. The remaining $12.7 million of 2020/21 Notes was converted to common stock during December 2020.
(Loss) from modification of 2020 Notes. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred $0.7 million of legal and professional fees to modify the 12% Convertible Senior Notes due 2020, which were issued to WB Gevo, Ltd. and its affiliates in June 2017 (the “2020 Notes”), into the 2020/21 Notes.
(Loss) on conversion of 2020/21 Notes. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred a $1.9 million loss related to the conversion of $2.0 million of 2020/21 Notes into common stock during July 2020 and $12.7 million of 2020/21 Notes into common stock during December 2020, which reflects the cost of the make-whole payments.
(Loss) gain from change in fair value of the 2020/21 Notes and 2020 Notes embedded derivative liability. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized a noncash loss of $8.6 million related to the 2020/21 Notes embedded derivative liability as a result of increasing stock price at the time that the 2021/21 Notes were converted into common stock. The loss recorded is the result of the change in fair value between the beginning of the period and the end of the period, or the date on which the derivative liability was extinguished through conversion.
Sources of Our Revenues
Our revenues are primarily derived from: (i) the sale of isobutanol and related products; (ii) hydrocarbon sales consisting primarily of the sale of SAF and isooctane derived from our isobutanol for purposes of certification and testing; and (iii) government grants and research and development programs.
Principal Components of Our Cost Structure
Cost of Goods Sold. Our cost of goods sold consists primarily of costs directly associated with the production of isobutanol at the Luverne Facility and production of biojet fuel and isooctane at the South Hampton Facility. Such costs include direct materials, direct labor, depreciation, other operating costs and certain plant overhead costs. Direct materials include corn feedstock, denaturant and process chemicals. Direct labor includes compensation of personnel directly involved in production operations at the Luverne Facility. Other operating costs include utilities and natural gas usage.
Research and Development. Our research and development costs consist of expenses incurred to identify, develop and test our technologies for the production of isobutanol and the development of downstream applications thereof. Research and development expenses include personnel costs (including stock-based compensation), consultants and related contract research, facility costs, supplies, depreciation and amortization expense on property, plant and equipment used in product development, license fees paid to third parties for use of their intellectual property and patent rights and other overhead expenses incurred to support our research and development programs.
Selling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs (including stock-based compensation), consulting and service provider expenses (including patent counsel-related costs), legal fees, marketing costs, insurance costs, occupancy-related costs, depreciation and amortization expenses on property, plant and equipment not used in our product development programs or recorded in cost of goods sold, travel and relocation expenses and hiring expenses.
Interest Expense. Our senior secured notes had a fixed interest rate of 12%. As of December 31, 2020, the 2020/21 Notes were repaid in full.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Since our inception in 2005, we have devoted most of our cash resources to manufacturing ethanol, isobutanol and related products, research and development and selling, general and administrative activities related to the commercialization of isobutanol, as well as related products from renewable feedstocks. We have incurred losses since inception and expect to incur losses through at least 2022. We have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from multiple sales of equity and debt securities, borrowings under debt facilities and product sales.
We have incurred consolidated net losses since inception and had a significant accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2020. Our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2020 totaled $78.3 million. As noted above, in January 2021, we raised $321.7 million through a registered direct offering. We also raised $135.8 million during the period January 1, 2021 to February 26, 2021 through its At-the-Market Offering Programs. Our transition to profitability is dependent upon the successful development of the Net-Zero 1 Project and the achievement of a level of revenues adequate to support our cost structure. We may never achieve profitability or generate positive cash flows, and unless and until we do, we may need to raise additional cash by issuing securities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional funds or achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flows from operations.
The following table sets forth the major sources and uses of cash for each of the periods set forth below (in thousands):
Operating Activities
Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are personnel related expenses and research and development-related expenses including costs incurred under development agreements, costs of licensing of technology, legal-related costs, expenses for production of isobutanol, ethanol and related products, logistics and further processing of isobutanol and ethanol at the Luverne Facility and for the operation of our South Hampton Facility.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used for operating activities was $19.3 million compared to $20.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $1.5 million decrease in operating cash flows was primarily due to reduced production at the Luverne Facility, as discussed below, offset by increased engineering and development costs for our RNG project. During the first quarter of 2020, we terminated our ethanol production at the Luverne Facility due to COVID-19 and an unfavorable commodity environment, largely the result of greater corn costs as compared to national markets than the region has historically produced. We are currently maintaining the Luverne Facility until we arrange financing of its expansion for the production of hydrocarbons.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we used $20.8 million in cash for operating activities due to a net loss of $28.7 million, excluding the impact of $9.1 million in non-cash expenses and $1.2 million net cash increase associated with a decrease in working capital primarily a result of a decreases in both receivables and inventories.
We currently plan to spend approximately $50 million - $60 million over the next 12 months for engineering and development costs related to our RNG and Net-Zero 1 projects and other business initiatives.
Investing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we used $5.9 million in cash for investing activities, including $1.0 million related to capital expenditures at our Luverne Facility related to dry fractionation and hydrocarbon skid equipment and $4.5 million related to our RNG project. We are installing equipment to fractionate distillers grains at the Luverne Facility totaling approximately $2.0 million as of December 31, 2020. The cost of the fractionation machine and the thermal dryer have been funded with financing leases. No amounts are payable on this financing lease until the equipment is operational. The fractionation machine is expected to be operational in the first half of 2023.
We are developing an RNG project comprised of anaerobic digesters to be located at three dairy farms in northwest Iowa, plus associated gas upgrading equipment, to supply our Net Zero 1 project with renewable thermal energy upon its startup in 2024. We expect to finance the RNG project with approximately $69 million of private activity bonds during the first half of 2021. Agri-Energy is expected to have a purchase option on approximately 50% of the RNG project’s estimated annual 350,000 MMBtu of RNG production. The RNG project is expected to be operational in early 2022, subject to securing adequate financing to complete the RNG project.
We are also evaluating whether to install approximately $20.0 million of manufacturing equipment at our Luverne Facility that is intended to support the development of a 1 MGPY hydrocarbon production facility and to reduce the cost of producing isobutanol. If we decide to move forward with this project, the manufacturing equipment is expected to be operational in the first half of 2022. We anticipate equipment financing the hydrocarbon manufacturing equipment and funding the isobutanol production improvements with equity.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we used $7.5 million in cash for investing activities including $6.0 million related to capital expenditures at our Luverne Facility and $1.5 million investment in Juhl.
Financing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated $87.3 million in cash from financing activities, which primarily consisted of $8.4 million of net proceeds under our "at-the-market" offering program, receiving $16.1 million from the sale of common stock and warrants in the July 2020 Offering, $45.8 million from the sale of common stock and pre-funded warrants in the August 2020 Offering, $17.1 million from the exercise of the Series 2020-A Warrants, the Series 2020-B Warrants and the Series 2020-C Warrants, and $1.0 million from the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program discussed below, offset by $0.5 million paid on loans payable - other.

The net proceeds to the Company from the January 2021 Offering were approximately $321.7 million, after deducting placement agent fees and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company, and not including any future proceeds from the exercise of the Warrants. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the January 2021 Offering to fund development and investment in our RNG and Net-Zero 1 projects, working capital and for other general corporate purposes.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated $10.9 million in cash from financing activities, which primarily consisted of $11.6 million of net proceeds under our "at-the-market" offering program discussed below offset by $0.3 million paid on equipment and insurance financed, $0.2 million of debt and equity offering costs and $0.2 million net settlement of common stock under stock plans.
At-the-Market Offering Program. In February 2018, the Company commenced an at-the-market offering program, which allows it to sell and issue shares of its common stock from time-to-time. In August 2019, the at-the-market offering program was amended to provide available capacity under the at-the-market offering program of $10.7 million. On December 30, 2020, the at-the-market offering program was amended to provide available capacity under the at-the-market offering program of $150.0 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company issued 3,518,121 shares of common stock under the at-the-market offering program for total proceeds of $8.4 million, net of commissions and other offering related expenses. During the period January 1, 2021 to February 26, 2021, the Company issued 24,420,579 shares of common stock under the at-the-market offering program for total proceeds of $135.8 million, net of commissions and other offering related expenses.
2020/21 Notes. On January 10, 2020, the Company entered into an Exchange and Purchase Agreement which exchanged all of the outstanding principal amount of the 2020 Notes, which totaled $14.1 million including unpaid accrued interest, for approximately $14.4 million in aggregate principal amount of the Company's newly created 2020/21 Notes. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized an approximately $0.7 million loss on the modification of the 2020 Notes within the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
On July 10, 2020, certain holders of the 2020/21 Notes converted $2.0 million in the aggregate principal amount of 2020/21 Notes (including the conversion of an additional $0.3 million for make-whole payment) into 4,169,426 shares of common stock pursuant to the terms of the indenture. In December 2020, certain holders of the 2020/21 Notes converted the remaining $12.7 million in aggregate principal amount of 2020/21 Notes (including the conversion of an additional $1.2 million for make-whole payment) into an aggregate of 5,672,654 shares of common stock pursuant to the terms of the 2020/21 Notes related Indenture.

See Note 9, Debt, to our consolidated financial statements included herein for further discussion of the 2020/21 Notes.
Loans Payable - Other. During the first quarter of 2020, we purchased equipment under a financing lease. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we financed part of our insurance obligation. The equipment notes and financing lease pay interest between 4% and 21%, have total monthly payments of $0.1 million and mature at various date from August 2020 to February 2025. The equipment loans are secured by the related equipment.
In April 2020, we entered into two loan agreements with Live Oak Banking Company, pursuant to which we obtained two unsecured loans from the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program (“SBA PPP”) totaling $1.0 million in the aggregate (the "SBA Loans"). The SBA Loans will mature in April 2022 and bear interest at a rate equal to 1% per annum, subject to the potential for partial or full loan forgiveness as dictated by U.S. federal law. Principal and interest are deferred until August 2021 and interest continues to accrue during the deferral period. The SBA Loans are payable monthly beginning August 5, 2021, with aggregate payments totaling $0.1 million per month, including interest and principal. The SBA Loans must be used for payroll, rent payments, mortgage interest payments and utilities payments as governed by the SBA PPP and are subject to partial or full forgiveness for the initial 24-week period following the loan disbursement if all proceeds are used for eligible purposes and within certain thresholds, we maintain certain employment levels and that we maintain certain compensation levels. No assurance can be given that we will obtain forgiveness of the loan in whole or in part. The loan contains customary events of default relating to, among other things, payment defaults, making materially false and misleading representations to the lender or breaching the terms of the loan documents.
See Note 9, Debt, to our consolidated financial statements included herein for further discussion.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide information under this item.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2020, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Our Consolidated Financial Statements are based on the application of U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty; therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. We believe our judgments related to these accounting estimates are appropriate. However, if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be materially different from the amounts recorded.
Critical Accounting Policies
While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and reflect the more significant judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Accounting for Senior Secured Debt, Convertible Notes and Embedded Derivative
In June 2017, the Company issued its 12% convertible senior secured notes due 2020 (the “2020 Notes”) in exchange for its 12% convertible senior secured notes due 2017 (the “2017 Notes”). In January 2020, the Company issued 12% convertible senior secured notes due 2020/2021 (the “2020/21 Notes”) in exchange for its 2020 Notes.
The 2020 Notes contained the following embedded derivatives: (i) a Make-Whole Payment (as defined in the indenture governing the 2020 Notes (the “2020 Notes Indenture”)) upon either conversion or redemption; (ii) right to redeem the outstanding principal upon a Fundamental Change (as defined in the 2020 Notes Indenture); (iii) issuer rights to convert into a limited number of shares in any given three-month period commencing nine months from the issuance date and dependent on the stock price exceeding 150% of the then in-effect conversion price over a ten-business day period; and (iv) holder rights to convert into either shares of the Company’s common stock or pre-funded warrants upon the election of the holders of the 2020 Notes.
The 2020/21 Notes contain the following embedded derivatives: (i) a Make-Whole Payment (as defined in the 2020/21 Notes Indenture (as defined below) upon either conversion or redemption in certain circumstances; (ii) holder right to require the Company to repurchase the outstanding principal upon a Fundamental Change (as defined in the 2020/21 Notes Indenture); and (iii) holder rights to convert into either shares of the Company’s common stock or pre-funded warrants upon the election of the holders of the 2020/21 Notes.
Embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and the 2020 Notes and 202/21 Notes and carried at fair value when: (a) the embedded derivative possesses economic characteristics that are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract; and (b) a separate, stand-alone instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument. The Company has concluded that certain embedded derivatives within the 2020 Notes and 2020/21 Notes meet these criteria and, as such, must be valued separate and apart from the 2020 Notes and 2020/21 Notes as one embedded derivative and recorded at fair value each reporting period.
The Company used a binomial lattice model in order to estimate the fair value of the embedded derivative in the 2020 Notes and 2020/21 Notes. A binomial lattice model generates two probable outcomes, whether up or down, arising at each point in time, starting from the date of valuation until the maturity date. A lattice was initially used to determine if the 2020 Notes and 20200/21 Notes would be converted by the holder, called by the issuer, or held at each decision point. Within the lattice model, the following assumptions are made: (i) the 2020 Notes and 2020/21 Notes will be converted by the holder if the conversion value plus the holder’s Make-Whole Payment is greater than the holding value; or (ii) the 2020 Notes and 2020/21 Notes will be called by the issuer if (a) the stock price exceeds 150% of the then in-effect conversion price over a ten-business day period and (b) if the holding value is greater than the conversion value plus the Make-Whole Payment at the time.
Using this lattice model, the Company valued the embedded derivative using a “with-and-without method”, where the value of the 2020 Notes and 2020/21 Notes including the embedded derivative is defined as the “with”, and the value of the 2020 Notes and 2020/21 Notes excluding the embedded derivative is defined as the “without”. This method estimates the value of the embedded derivative by comparing the difference in the values between the 2020 Notes and 2020/21 Notes with the embedded derivative and the value of the 2020 Notes and 2020/21 Notes without the embedded derivative. The lattice model requires the following inputs: (i) price of Gevo common stock; (ii) Conversion Rate (as defined in the 2020 Notes Indenture and the 2020/21 Notes Indenture); (iii) Conversion Price (as defined in the 2020 Notes Indenture the 2020/21 Notes Indenture); (iv) maturity date; (v) risk-free interest rate; (vi) estimated stock volatility; and (vii) estimated credit spread for the Company.
We had concluded that the embedded derivatives within the 2020 Notes and the 2020/21 Notes required separation from the host instrument and was re-valued each reporting period, with changes in the fair value of the embedded derivatives recognized as a component of our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Warrants
The Company has warrants outstanding as of December 31, 2020 representing 2,013,901 shares of Gevo's common stock, which expire at various dates through July 6, 2025. The exercise prices of the warrants range from $0.60 to $220.00 as of December 31, 2020. Based on the terms of the warrant agreements, the Company has determined that all warrants issued between 2013 and 2019 qualify as derivatives and, as such, are included in "Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and recorded at fair value each reporting period. The decrease (increase) in the estimated fair value of the warrants outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 represents an unrealized gain (loss) which has been recorded as a gain (loss) from the change in fair value of derivative warrant liability in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The Series 2020-A Warrants, Series 2020-B Warrants and Series 2020-C Warrants issued during 2020 are classified as component of permanent equity because they are freestanding financial instruments that are legally detachable and separately exercisable from the shares of common stock with which they were issued, are immediately exercisable, do not embody an obligation for the Company to repurchase its shares, and permit the holders to receive a fixed number of shares of common stock upon exercise. In addition, the Warrants do not provide any guarantee of value or return. The Company valued the Series 2020-A Warrants, the Series 2020-B Warrants and the Series 2020-C Warrants at issuance using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and determined the fair value. The key inputs to the valuation model included a weighted average volatility of 130% to 141%, risk-free rate of 0.30% to 0.31% and an expected term of five years.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue Recognition. We record revenue from the sale of hydrocarbon products and related products. We recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are satisfied: (i) we have identified a contract with a customer; (ii) we have identified the performance obligations of the customer; (iii) we have determined the transaction price; (iv) we have allocated the transaction price to the identified performance obligations in the contract with the customer; and (v) we have satisfied each individual performance obligation with the contract with a customer.
Hydrocarbon related products are generally shipped free on board shipping point for domestic sales and free on board destination point for foreign sales. Collectability of revenue is reasonably assured based on historical evidence of collectability with our customers. In accordance with our agreements for the marketing and sale of hydrocarbon and related products, commissions due to marketers were deducted from the gross sales price at the time payment was remitted.
Revenue related to government research grants and cooperative agreements is recognized in the period during which the related costs are incurred, provided that the conditions under the awards have been met and only perfunctory obligations are outstanding.
Revenues related to operating lease agreements are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract.
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, Eco-Energy, accounted for approximately 52% and 71% of our consolidated revenue, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, HCS accounted for approximately 21% and 7% of our consolidated revenue, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, Purina accounted for approximately 15% and 17% of our consolidated revenue, respectively. HCS is a customer of our Gevo segment. Eco-Energy and Purina are customers of our Gevo Development/Agri-Energy segment. Given the production capacity compared to the overall size of the North American market and the fungible demand for our products, we do not believe that a decline in a specific customer's purchases would have a material adverse long-term effect upon our financial results.
