ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our financial statements and the related notes and the other financial information included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly those under “Risk Factors.” Dollars in tabular format are presented in thousands, except per share data, or otherwise indicated.
OVERVIEW
Odyssey Semiconductor Technologies, Inc. (the “Company”) was formed as a Delaware corporation on April 12, 2019. The Company acquired its wholly-owned subsidiary, Odyssey Semiconductor, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Odyssey Semiconductor”), on September 21, 2019. Odyssey Semiconductor commenced business operations on September 17, 2019 when it acquired its wholly-owned subsidiary, JR2J LLC (“JR2J”), from its founders, Richard Brown and James Shealy, in exchange for shares of Odyssey Semiconductor.
We are a semiconductor device company developing revolutionary high-voltage power switching components and systems based on proprietary Gallium Nitride (GaN) processing technology. The premium power switching device market, which is described as applications where silicon-based (Si) systems perform insufficiently, is projected to reach over $3.5 billion by 2025 and is currently dominated by the semiconductor material silicon carbide (SiC). GaN-based systems outperform Si and SiC based systems in every way due to the superior material properties of GaN. However, GaN devices have, to-date, proven difficult to process using standard semiconductor processing methods that are used to create Si and SiC based devices. We have developed a novel processing modification that allows GaN to be processed in a manner that for the first time, makes high voltage GaN power switching devices viably manufacturable. Our mission is to disrupt the rapidly growing premium power switching device market using our newly developed GaN high voltage power transistor for switching applications.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
On September 21, 2019, the Company entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with Odyssey Semiconductor and 100% of the stockholders of Odyssey Semiconductor (the “Semiconductor Stockholders”), pursuant to which the Semiconductor Stockholders agreed to transfer an aggregate of 5,666,667 shares of common stock of Odyssey Semiconductor to the Company in exchange for the Company’s issuance of an aggregate of 5,666,667 shares of the Company’s Common Stock to the Semiconductor Stockholders (the “Share Exchange”). As of September 21, 2019, Odyssey Semiconductor became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, the Semiconductor Stockholders beneficially owned approximately 61.37% of the Company’s Common Stock on a fully-diluted basis, the Company began operating Odyssey Semiconductor’s business of developing high-voltage power switching components and systems, all then directors and officers of the Company resigned and were replaced by the directors and officers of Odyssey Semiconductor.
2019 Private Placements
On September 21 and August 5, 2019, the Company sold an aggregate of 1,776,346 shares of Common Stock at $1.50 per share to accredited investors for aggregate gross and net cash proceeds of $2,664,513 and $2,204,502, respectively. In addition, the Company issued to the Company’s placement agent immediately vested five-year warrants to purchase an aggregate of 155,966 shares of the Company’s Common Stock at an exercise price of $1.50 per share.
On September 24, 2019, the Company sold an aggregate of 149,981 shares of common stock at $1.50 per share to accredited investors for aggregate cash proceeds of $224,972.
2021 Private Placement
On March 30, 2021, the Company received the proceeds of the first closing pursuant to an offering of its common stock. The Company sold 1,251,625 shares of common stock at $4.00 per share for gross proceeds of $5,006,500 (after expenses, net proceeds were approximately $4.6 million). Warrants equal to 8% of the common shares sold, other than to Excluded Counterparties, will be issued to the placement agent with a 5 year exercise period and an exercise price of $4.00 per share. The Company may sell up to an additional 2,498,375 shares pursuant to this offering. The maximum number of shares in the offering is 3,750,000, but includes up to 250,000 shares that the Company can sell to Excluded Counterparties without incurring fees (cash or warrants) to the placement agent.
In connection with this offering, the Company entered into registration rights agreements with the investors, pursuant to which the Company agreed to file a registration statement to register the resale of their shares and/or shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the placement agent warrants within 60 calendar days after the final closing of the offering and cause the registration statement to be declared effective by the SEC within 120 calendar days after the final closing of the offering. In addition, the Company agreed to keep such registration statement effective for a period of five (5) years after its effective date or for such shorter period ending on the date on which all securities registered thereunder have been sold. If the Company fails to file or cause the registration statement to be declared effective within the timeframe provided in the registration rights agreements, or the registrations statement ceases to remain continuously effective or the holders of registrable securities are otherwise not permitted to utilize the prospectus therein to resell their shares for a period of more than fifteen (15) consecutive trading days, with respect to the days of such delay we will be subject to cash liquidated damages at a rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum of the total of the following as applicable for the registrable securities: (i) aggregate purchase price paid by the investor who purchased the shares in the offering; and/or (ii) $4 per share of the placement agent warrants. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the maximum amount of liquidated damages that may be paid by the Company pursuant to the registration rights agreements shall be an amount equal to five percent (5%) of the applicable foregoing amounts described in clauses (i) and (ii) in the preceding sentence with respect to such holder's registrable securities that are affected by the delay.
Governmental Assistance
Paycheck Protection Program
On May 1, 2020, the Company received loan proceeds in the amount of approximately $211,000 under the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”). The PPP, established as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, as amended (“CARES Act”), provides for loans to qualifying businesses for amounts up to 2.5 times of the average monthly payroll expenses of such qualifying business. The loans and accrued interest are forgivable after certain time periods further defined in the CARES Act (“Covered Period”) as long as the borrower uses the loan proceeds for eligible purposes, including payroll, benefits, rent and utilities, and maintains its payroll levels. The amount of loan forgiveness will be reduced if the borrower terminates employees or reduces salaries during the Covered Period.
The unforgiven portion of the PPP loan, if any, is payable over two years at an interest rate of 1%, with a deferral of payments for the first six months. The Company intends to use the proceeds for purposes consistent with the PPP. While the Company currently believes that its use of the loan proceeds will meet the conditions for forgiveness of the loan, there can be no assurance that the Company will not take actions that could cause the Company to be ineligible for forgiveness of the loan, in whole or in part. On March 6, 2021, the entire loan balance was forgiven.
On February 24, 2021, the Company received $193,625 pursuant to a promissory note issued under the Paycheck Protection Program Part 2 (“PPP2”). Interest accrues at 1% per annum and the note is payable in 60 monthly installments of $3,300 commencing May 2022.
Economic Injury Disaster Loan Advance
On May 1, 2020, the Company received an advance in the amount of $10,000 from the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) under the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (“EIDL”) program administered by the SBA, which program was expanded pursuant to the CARES Act. Such advance amount will reduce the Company’s PPP loan forgiveness amount described above.
Tomkins County Area Development Loan
On May 27, 2020, the Company received loan proceeds in the amount of $50,000 from the Tomkins County Area Development (“TCAD”) Emergency Relief Loan Fund. The loan matures after four years and bears interest in the amount of 2.5% per annum, with one year of no interest or principal payments, followed by three years of monthly payments of principal and interest in the amount of $1,443 per month. The loan is collateralized against certain assets of the Company.
Equipment Loans
On August 21, 2020, the Company received a loan of $100,000 from Broome County Industrial Development Agency (5 year facility, 2.5% annual interest rate, monthly payment of $1,775); on September 3, 2020, the Company received a loan of $100,000 from Southern Tier Region Economic Development Corporation (5 year facility, 5.0% annual interest rate, monthly payment of $2,072) ; and on September 10, 2020, the Company received a loan of $75,000 from TCAD(5 year facility, 2.5% annual interest rate, monthly payment of $1,331). These loans were used to acquire equipment used in the laboratory, and are secured by the underlying assets of the Company.
Consulting Service
On October 18, 2019, the Company entered into an exclusive two-year consulting agreement with Akash Systems, Inc. (“Akash”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to provide certain consulting services to Akash in connection with process development and fabrication of GaN-on-Diamond high-electron-mobility transistors and monolithic microwave integrated circuits. Pursuant to the agreement, Akash guarantees to purchase at least one wafer per month from the Company for a total of 24 wafers during the term of the agreement, at a price of $85,000 per wafer. The Company delivered 2 wafers as of December 31, 2020, and currently, the Company is awaiting new substrates to arrive from Akash so it may perform services on the remaining wafers pursuant to the agreement.
COMPONENTS OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Revenues
Our revenues are derived from contracts with customers that require us to design, develop, manufacture, test and integrate complex equipment and to provide engineering and technical services according to customer specifications. These contracts are often priced on a time and material type basis. Revenues on time and material type contracts are generally recognized in each period based on the amount billable to the customer which is based on direct labor hours expended multiplied by the contractual fixed rate per hour, plus the actual costs of materials and other direct non-labor costs. We bill customers based upon contractual terms, and accordingly, we have deferred revenues and contract assets depending upon whether we can bill in advance of earnings or in arrears, respectively.
Cost of Revenues
Cost of revenues consist of material, labor, a portion of occupancy expenses, and other expenses directly related to our revenue contracts.
Research and Development
Research and development includes expenses, primarily material, labor, a portion of occupancy expenses, and other expenses incurred in connection with the research and development of certain exploratory projects. Research and development expenses are expensed as they are incurred.
Selling, General, and Administrative
Selling, general, and administrative expenses consist of salaries, payroll taxes and other benefits, legal and professional fees, stock- based compensation, rent and office expenses, marketing and travel and other costs associated with our operation.
Other Income
Other income (expense) consists primarily of interest income on cash balances, and other miscellaneous items.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Year ended December 31, 2020 Compared with year ended December 31, 2019
Overview
The following table presents certain information from the consolidated statements of operations:
Revenues
Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were approximately $1,374,000 and $720,000, respectively, which represented an increase of $654,000, or 91%. We have two principal clients as of December 31, 2020 (Akash and the government contract) as well as several smaller clients. The timing of revenue recognition is driven by the completion of specified deliverables and the billing of time and materials over periods of time. Accordingly, the recognition of revenue for these contracts will vary from time to time. In both the years ended December 30, 2020 and 2019, we recognized 93% and 28% of our revenue from these two principal clients. The Company remainder of the revenue recognized for both the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was for delivery of products to other clients.
Cost of Revenues
Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were approximately $1,453,000 and $590,000, respectively, which represented an increase of $863,000, or 146%. The increase was attributable to increased labor costs and supplies associated with our revenue generating projects in the 2020 period. Also, there was an increase in facility and equipment usage fees during the 2020 period as compared to the 2019 period in order to support the same revenue generating projects and reflect the increased infrastructure built over the past few quarters. We also shift personnel from client projects to internal research and development projects depending on the timing of client deliverables. We do not yet have a sufficient volume of client projects to fully utilize all of the fixed and variable operating expenses of the facility booked, thereby generating a gross loss for 2020.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were approximately $607,000 and $156,000, respectively, which represented an increase of $451,000, or 289%. The increase was primarily attributable to an overall increase in our focus on research and development activities, which resulted in increased wage allocation as well as increased rent, facility fees, equipment usage costs and general lab supplies.
General and Administrative
Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were approximately $1,354,000 and $1,434,000, respectively, which represented a decrease of $80,000, or 6%. The 2020 period expense was primarily attributable to payroll and employee related expenses, and legal and professional fees. During 2020, the Company also wrote-off approximately $111,000 in previously deferred offering costs, as a component of general and administrative expenses. In 2019, the Company subcontracted all of our labor and did not have employees until September 2019, however there was a non-cash charge of approximately $525,000 related to a stock based compensation charge. By comparison, the total non-cash compensation expense was approximately $623,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $571,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019. During the 2019 period, the Company also incurred significant costs associated with the reverse recapitalization transaction. The Company has attempted to carefully manage in general and administrative expenses.
Other Income (expense)
Other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily attributable to interest on the government loans, while in 2019 other income (expense) was insignificant.
Net (Loss) Income
Net (loss) income for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was approximately $(2,043,000) and $(1,458,000), respectively, which represented a increase of $(585,000), or 40%. The decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in research and development expenses of approximately $451,000 and a decrease in gross profit of $209,000 due to the faster growth of fixed costs as compared to the growth in revenues, partially offset by an $80,000 decrease in general and administrative costs. This reflects the establishment of the fabrication lab and increased emphasis on internal research projects.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Liquidity
We measure our liquidity in a number of ways, including the following:
As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and working capital of approximately $273,000 and $63,000, respectively. We received approximately $685,000 in funding in the form of loans from several governmental support programs from May to September 2020 - see recent developments above. We also received approximately $405,000 from the exercise of stock options in the year ended December 31, 2020.
In February 2021, the Company received approximately $68,000 from the exercise of stock options to purchase 45,625 shares of common stock. On February 24, 2021, the Company received $193,625 pursuant to a promissory note issued under the Paycheck Protection Program Part 2 ("PPP2"). Interest accrues at 1% per annum and the note is payable in 60 monthly installments of $3,300 commencing May 2022. On March 30, 2021, the Company received the proceeds of the first closing pursuant to an offering of its common stock. The Company sold 1,251,625 shares of common stock at $4.00 per share for gross proceeds of $5,006,500 (after expenses, net proceeds were approximately $4.6 million). Warrants equal to 8% of the common shares sold, other than to certain parties that were excluded from fees ("Excluded Counterparties"), will be issued to the placement agent with a 5 year exercise period and an exercise price of $4.00 per share. The Company may sell up to an additional 2,498,375 shares pursuant to this offering. The maximum number of shares in the offering is 3,750,000, but includes up to 250,000 shares that the Company can sell to Excluded Counterparties without incurring fees (cash or warrants) to the placement agent.
We expect our current cash on hand plus the above mentioned funding in the first quarter of 2021 to be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months from the date of this filing. Thereafter, we may need to raise further capital, through the sale of additional equity or debt securities, to support our future operations. Our operating needs include the planned costs to operate our business, including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures as well as research and development. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors, including our ability to successfully commercialize our products and services, competing technological and market developments, and the need to enter into collaborations with other companies or acquire other companies or technologies to enhance or complement our product and service offerings. If we are unable to secure additional capital, we may be required to curtail our research and development initiatives and take additional measures to reduce costs in order to conserve our cash.
Our sources and uses of cash were as follows:
Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was approximately $(776,000) and $(1,061,000), respectively. Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes cash used to fund a net loss of approximately $(2,043,000), reduced by $859,000 of non-cash expenses, and reduced by $408,000 of net cash provided by changes in the levels of operating assets and liabilities. Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 included cash provided by net loss of approximately $(1,458,000) partially offset by $585,000 of non-cash expenses and reduced by $189,000 of net cash used in changes in the levels of operating assets and liabilities.
Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was approximately $(687,000) and $(365,000), respectively. Net cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was primarily attributable to the purchase property and equipment, and leasehold improvements in the laboratory.
Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was approximately $1,041,000 and $2,199,000, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily attributable proceeds under government loan programs of $685,000 and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $405,000. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily attributable proceeds from private placements of common stock of approximately $2,400,000 less a dividend paid the stockholders prior to the reverse recapitalization of $200,000.
