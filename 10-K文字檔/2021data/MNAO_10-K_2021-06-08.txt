We cannot guarantee that we will manage to sell all the shares required. We will attempt to raise the necessary funds to proceed with all phases of our plan of operation.
As of the date of this report, the current funds available to the Company will not be sufficient to continue maintaining a reporting status. The Company’s sole officer and director, Yulia Lazaridou, has concluded a verbal agreement with the Minaro Corp. in order to fund completion of the registration process and to maintain the reporting status with SEC.
Our auditors have issued a “going concern” opinion, meaning that there is substantial doubt we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital. Our only sources for cash at this time are investments by others in this offering, selling our paper dung products and loans from our director. We must raise cash to implement our plan and stay in business.
Management believes that current trends toward lower capital investment in start-up companies pose the most significant challenge to the Company’s success over the next year and in future years. Additionally, the Company will have to meet all the financial disclosure and reporting requirements associated with being a publicly reporting company. The Company’s management will have to spend additional time on policies and procedures to make sure it is compliant with various regulatory requirements, especially that of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This additional corporate governance time required of management could limit the amount of time management has to implement is business plan and impede the speed of its operations.
Limited operating history; need for additional capital
There is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in a start-up stage of operations and have generated limited revenues since inception. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company's financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
