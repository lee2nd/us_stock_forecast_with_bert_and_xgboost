In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the section titled “Item 1A. Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All amounts in this report are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted.
Overview
HealthLynked Corp. (the “Company,” “we,” “our, or “us”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on August 4, 2014. We currently operate in four distinct divisions: the Health Services Division, the Digital Healthcare Division, the ACO/MSO (Accountable Care Organization / Managed Service Organization) Division, and the Medical Distribution Division. Our Health Services division is comprised of the operations of (i) Naples Women’s Center (“NWC”), a multi-specialty medical group including OB/GYN (both Obstetrics and Gynecology) and General Practice, (ii) Naples Center for Functional Medicine (“NCFM”), a Functional Medical Practice acquired in April 2019 that is engaged in improving the health of its patients through individualized and integrative health care, and (iii) Bridging the Gap Physical Therapy (“BTG”), a physical therapy practice in Bonita Springs, FL opened in January 2020 that provides hands-on functional manual therapy techniques to speed patients’ recovery and manage pain without pain medication or surgery. Our Digital Healthcare division develops and operates an online personal medical information and record archive system, the “HealthLynked Network,” which enables patients and doctors to keep track of medical information via the Internet in a cloud-based system. Our ACO/MSO Division is comprised of the business acquired of Cura Health Management LLC (“CHM”) and its subsidiary ACO Health Partners LLC (“AHP”), which were acquired by the Company on May 18, 2020. CHM and AHP operate an Accountable Care Organization (“ACO”) and Managed Service Organization (“MSO”) that assists physician practices in providing coordinated and more efficient care to patients via the Medicare Shared Savings Program (“MSSP”) as administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (the “CMS”), which rewards providers for efficiency in patient care. Our Medical Distribution Division is comprised of the operations of MedOffice Direct LLC (“MOD”), a virtual distributor of discounted medical supplies selling to both consumers and medical practices throughout the United States we acquired on October 19, 2020.
Recent Developments
On August 20, 2020, we completed a financing transaction (the “August 2020 Equity Transaction”) with trusts (the “Trusts”) controlled by our CEO, Dr. Michael Dent, pursuant to which the Trusts contributed an aggregate of 76,026 shares of common stock of NeoGenomics, Inc. (NEO” and the “NEO Shares”) with a fair value of $3,066,889 to us, in exchange for an aggregate of 2,750,000 shares of our newly designated Series B Preferred Stock and an aggregate of 24,522,727 shares of our common stock.
Using in part the proceeds from sale of the NEO Shares received in the August 2020 Equity Transaction, during the year ended December 31, 2020 we retired debt with a face value of $1,658,750, including $1,012,750 convertible notes with adjustable conversion rates pegged to a fixed discount to the trading price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2020, we had no further outstanding convertible notes with such adjustable conversion rates. We also retired accrued interest of $292,678 related to repayment of debt obligations during the quarter, including forgiveness of $105,003 accrued interest on notes payable to our CEO, Dr. Michael Dent.
On October 19, 2020, we acquired MedOfficeDirect L.L.C. (“MOD”), a virtual distributor of discounted medical supplies selling to both consumers and medical practices throughout the United States. With over 13,000 name brand medical products in over 150 different categories, MOD leverages Group Purchasing Organization pricing discounts with a small unit-of-measure direct-to-consumer shipping model to make ordering medical supplies both convenient and highly cost effective for its users.
Critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates
See Note 2, “Significant Accounting Policies,” in the Notes to consolidated Financial Statements.
Results of Operations: Years Ended December 31, 2020 and
The following table summarizes the changes in our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with the year ended December 31, 2019:
Patient service revenue increased by $724,993, or 18%, from 2019 to 2020, primarily as a result of higher revenue from NCFM (which was acquired April 15, 2019 and therefore only reflected in our operating results for five-and-a-half months of the 2019 period) and revenue from BTG (which started January 9, 2020 with no corresponding revenue in 2019), offset by lower revenue from NWC.
Medicare shared savings revenue increased by $767,744, or 100% from 2019 to 2020. The primary source of revenue of CHM, which we acquired in May 2020, is from payments earned under the Medicare shared savings program. Such amounts are determined annually when we are notified by CMS of the amount of shared savings earned. Accordingly, we recognize Medicare shared savings revenue in the period in which the CMS notifies us of the exact amount of shared savings to be paid, which historically has occurred during the three-month period ended September 30 for the program year ended December 31 of the previous year. During September 2020, we were notified of, and received payment for, our shared savings revenue relating to program year 2019 in the amount of $767,744, which amount was recognized as Medicare shared savings revenue in the year ended December 31, 2020.
Consulting revenue increased by $432,977, or 100%, from 2019 to 2020. Consulting revenue was earned by the newly formed ACO/MSO Division comprised of the operations acquired with CHM in May 2020.
Product revenue increased by $188,588, or 100%, from 2019 to 2020. Product revenue was earned by the newly formed Medical Distribution Division comprised of the operations acquired with MOD in October 2020.
Practice salaries and benefits increased by $187,527, or 8%, in 2020 primarily as a result of new practice salary and benefits expense from the inception of BTG in 2020 and a full year of NCFM operating costs in 2020 compared to only eight-and-a-half months in 2019.
Other practice operating costs increased by $304,048, or 16%, in 2020 primarily as a result of a full period of practice operating costs related to BTG and NCFM in 2020, offset by lower practice operating costs corresponding to lower revenue and cost cutting measures at NWC.
Medicare shared savings expenses increased by $1,017,494, or 100%, in 2020. Medicare shared savings expenses represent costs incurred to deliver Medicare shared savings revenue, including overhead and consulting fees related to advising participating physician practices, as well as the physicians’ contractual portion of any shared savings received by the ACO. There was no corresponding Medicare shared savings expense in 2019 as CHM was acquired in May 2020.
Cost of product revenue increased by $146,461, or 100%, in 2020. Cost of product revenue relates to the cost of medical products sold by the newly formed Medical Distribution Division, which is comprised of the operations acquired with MOD in October 2020.
Selling, general and administrative costs increased by $147,610, or 5%, in 2020 primarily due to increased legal, accounting and software development fees in 2020 offset by lower corporate overhead expense associated with a shift from a direct sales to an indirect sale approach for our Digital Healthcare segment.
Depreciation and amortization increased by $173,981, or 237%, in 2020 primarily as a result of depreciation of amortization of intangible assets acquired in MOD acquisition and fixed and intangible assets acquired in the NCFM acquisition.
Loss from operations decreased by $137,181, or 4%, in 2020 primarily as a result of profits from the ACO/MSO business acquired in May 2020 and improved profits from the Health Services Division, offset by higher selling, general and administrative costs.
Loss on sales of marketable securities increased by $282,107, or 100%, in 2020. Such losses arose from sales of marketable securities acquired in the August 2020 Equity Transaction at prices below the acquisition price.
Loss on extinguishment of debt increased by $117,594, or 10%, primarily as a result of the impact of repayment and conversion of convertible notes payable. Losses on extinguishment of debt arise when the fair value consideration paid to retire a convertible note exceeds the carrying value of the instrument being retired, including any related derivative financial instruments such as embedded conversion features (“ECFs”). Moreover, during the first quarter of 2020 we changed from the Black-Scholes model to a binomial lattice model to estimate the fair value of certain financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments associated with outstanding convertible notes retired during 2020. The change in methodology generally resulted in lower values of our ECF derivative financial instruments, which in turn resulted in higher losses on debt extinguishment when such liabilities were retired.
Losses from the change in fair value of debt increased by $260,327, or 214%, in 2020. Such gains and losses result from certain convertible notes and notes payable to related parties that, in previous periods, were extended and treated as an extinguishment and reissuance for accounting purposes, requiring these notes to be subsequently carried at fair value. The change in fair value at the end of each reporting period is recorded as “Change in fair value of debt.”
Financing cost decreased by $135,528, or 100% in 2020. Financing cost arises when the inception date fair value of embedded conversion features on a convertible note are greater than the face value of the note. No such notes were issued in 2020.
Amortization of original issue and debt discounts decreased by $729,583, or 58%, in 2020 as a result of the amortization of convertible notes with smaller average discount balances being amortized in 2020 as floating rate convertible notes were converted and paid down with proceeds from equity-based financing transactions.
Gains from the change in fair value of derivative financial instruments increased by $67,663, or 10%. The change is due primarily to our change on January 1, 2020 from the Black-Scholes model to a binomial lattice model to estimate the fair value of certain financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments. We believe that the binomial lattice model results in a better estimate of fair value because it embodies all of the requisite assumptions (including the underlying price, exercise price, term, volatility, and risk-free interest-rate) necessary to fair value these instruments and, unlike the Black-Scholes model, also accommodates assumptions regarding investor exercise behavior and other market conditions that market participants would likely consider in negotiating the transfer of such an instruments. Moreover, we retired all derivative financial instruments in 2020 with the repayment of all adjustable-rate convertible notes payable that had associated embedded conversion feature derivatives.
Gain from the change in the fair value of contingent acquisition consideration increased by $75,952, or 100%, in 2020. There was no corresponding change in 2019. Fair value of contingent acquisition consideration relates to future acquisition consideration that may be payable if certain prescribed performance milestones are met by businesses acquired by us, including NCFM (acquired in April 2019), CHM (acquired in May 2020), and MOD (acquired in October 2020). The fair value of contingent acquisition consideration is remeasured at each reporting period using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model.
Loss on settlement of litigation and other dispute increased by $706,862, or 100%, in 2020. Loss on settlement of litigation and other dispute arose from the settlement in first quarter 2021 of ongoing litigation and non-litigation disputes related to a 2018 financing transaction.
Interest expense increased by $5,674, or 2%, as a result of slightly higher average balance on convertible notes and notes payable to related parties during 2020.
Total other expenses increased by $363,838, or 16%, in 2020 primarily as a result of losses on settlement of litigation and other disputes arising in 2020, higher losses on extinguishment of debt related to repayment of convertible notes payable, losses on sales of marketable securities incurred in 2020 with no corresponding charges in 2019, and higher losses on the change in fair value of debt. These gains were offset by lower amortization of debt discounts on convertible notes payable, the absence of financing cost in 2020, and larger gains from changes in fair values of derivative financial instruments and contingent acquisition consideration.
Net loss increased by $226,657, or 4%, in 2020 primarily as a result of losses on settlement of litigation and other disputes arising in 2020, higher losses on extinguishment of debt related to repayment of convertible notes payable losses on sales of marketable securities incurred in 2020 with no corresponding charges in 2019, higher losses from the change in fair value of debt, and higher losses on extinguishment of debt related to repayment of convertible notes payable, offset by improved profits from the Health Services Division, new profits from the ACO/MSO business acquired in May 2020 and Medial Distribution business acquired in October 2020, as well as lower amortization of debt discounts on convertible notes payable.
Seasonal Nature of Operations
We acquired CHM in May 2020. CHM’s primary source of revenue is derived from payments earned under the Medicare shared savings program. Such amounts are determined annually when we are notified by CMS of the amount of shared savings earned. Accordingly, we recognize Medicare shared savings revenue in the period in which the CMS notifies us of the exact amount of shared savings to be paid, which historically has occurred during the three-month period ended September 30 for the program year ended December 31 of the previous year. Medicare shared savings revenue for the program year ended December 31, 2019, for which we received notification and payment in September 2020, was $767,744. Future recognition of Medicare shared savings revenue is expected to result in a material increase in our consolidated revenues in the third fiscal quarter of each year compared to the first, second and fourth fiscal quarters. Likewise, in the period in which we recognize Medicare shared savings revenue, we also determine the amount of shared savings expense to be paid to physicians participating in our ACO. This expense is also expected to be recognized in the third fiscal quarter of each year and is expected to materially increase our total operating expenses in the third fiscal quarter compared to other quarters of the fiscal year.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity Condition
As of December 31, 2020, we had cash balances of $162,184, a working capital deficit of $4,478,223 and accumulated deficit $21,784,910. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had a net loss of $5,755,256 and net cash used by operating activities of $2,117,297. Net cash provided by investing activities was $1,812,239, including $2,784,782 received from the sale of marketable securities received in an August 2020 financing transaction. Net cash provided by financing activities was $356,801, resulting principally from $1,071,069 proceeds from loans issued by the federal government, $827,500 net proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes, and $149,000 proceeds from the issuance of related party loans. We also repaid $1,882,405 of convertible notes, $967,756 of related party loans and $27,893 of vendor notes payable during 2020.
Subsequent to December 31, 2020 and through March 30, 2021, we raised $4,389,361 through sales of our common stock in private placement transactions and Investment Agreement puts. We believe that our current cash balances on hand following the capital infusion is adequate to meet our cash requirements for the next twelve months.
In July 2016, we entered into an Investment Agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) with Iconic Holdings, LLC (the “Investor”), pursuant to which the Investor agreed to purchase up to $3,000,000 of our common stock over a three-year period starting upon registration of the underlying shares, with such shares put to the Investor by us pursuant to a specified formula that limits the number of shares able to be put to the Investor to the number equal to the average trading volume of our common shares for the ten consecutive trading days prior to the put notice being issued. In May 2020, the Investment Agreement, which was scheduled to expire on May 15, 2020, was extended an additional two years to May 15, 2022. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we issued 5,797,348 and 5,074,068 shares pursuant to draws under the Investment Agreement, respectively, for gross proceeds of $489,286 and $929,986, respectively. Subsequent to December 31, 2020 and through March 30, 2021, we issued 3,006,098 shares pursuant to draws under the Investment Agreement for gross proceeds of $900,636.
We intend that the longer term (i.e., beyond twelve months) cost of completing additional intended acquisitions, implementing our development and sales efforts related to the HealthLynked Network and maintaining existing and expanding overhead and administrative costs will be financed from (i) cash on hand resulting from our fund raising efforts in the first quarter of 2021, (ii) profits generated by NCFM, CHM and AHP, and (ii) the use of further outside funding sources, including the put rights associated with the Investment Agreement, sales of common and/or preferred stock, and government loans. No assurances can be given that the Company will be able to access additional outside capital in a timely fashion. If necessary funds are not available, the Company’s business and operations would be materially adversely affected and in such event, the Company would attempt to reduce costs and adjust its business plan.
COVID-19
A novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, that was first identified in China in December 2019, has surfaced in several regions across the world and resulted in travel restrictions and business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas. The further spread of COVID-19, and the requirement to take action to limit the spread of the illness, may impact our ability to carry out our business as usual and may materially adversely impact global economic conditions, our business and financial condition, including our potential to conduct financings on terms acceptable to us, if at all. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the ultimate geographic spread of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, travel restrictions and social distancing in the United States and other countries, business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease.
Significant Liquidity Events
Through December 31, 2020, we have funded our operations principally through a combination of convertible promissory notes, private placements of our common stock, promissory notes and related party debt, as described below.
First Quarter 2021 Equity Transactions
Subsequent to December 31, 2020 and through March 30, 2021, we sold 11,787,766 shares of common stock in 46 separate private placement transactions. We received $3,488,725 in proceeds from the sales. In connection with these stock sales, we also issued 5,893,889 five-year warrants to purchase shares of common stock at exercise prices between $0.27 and $1.05 per share. We also issued 3,006,098 shares pursuant to draws under the Investment Agreement for additional gross proceeds of $900,636.
August 2020 Equity Transaction
On August 20, 2020, we completed the August 2020 Equity Transaction with Trusts controlled by our CEO, Dr. Michael Dent, pursuant to which the Trusts contributed an aggregate of 76,026 NEO Shares with a fair value of $3,066,889 to us, in exchange for an aggregate of 2,750,000 shares of our newly designated Series B Preferred Stock and an aggregate of 24,522,727 shares of our common stock. Through December 31, 2020, we sold all 76,026 of the NEO Shares and received proceeds of $2,784,782.
Beginning on December 31, 2022, each share of Series B Preferred Stock is convertible into five shares of our common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, including in the event of any stock split. The Series B Preferred Stock ranks senior to the common stock. Upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, our assets available for distribution to its stockholders will be distributed to holders of Series B Preferred Stock on an as converted basis and pro rata with the holders of common stock. Holders of Series B Preferred Stock are also entitled to participate in dividends declared or paid on the common stock on an as-converted basis.
The holders of Series B Preferred Stock generally are entitled to vote with the holders of the shares of common stock on all matters submitted for a vote of holders of shares of common stock (voting together with the holders of shares of common stock as one class). The holder of the shares of Preferred B Stock shall have that number of votes (identical in every other respect to the voting rights of the holders of common stock entitled to vote at any regular or special meeting of the shareholders) equal to 100 shares of common stock for each share of Preferred B Preferred Stock held (which shall never be deemed less than 51% of the vote required to approve any action), which Nevada law provides may or must be approved by vote or consent of the holders of common stock or the holders of other securities entitled to vote, if any.
Investment Agreement
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we issued 5,797,348 and 5,074,068 shares pursuant to draws under the Investment Agreement, respectively, for gross proceeds of $489,286 and $929,986, respectively. During May 2020, the Investment Agreement was extended by two years and now expires on May 15, 2022.
Other Sales of Common Stock
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold 7,022,867 shares of common stock in 21 separate private placement transactions and received $698,000 in proceeds from the sales. In connection with the stock sales, we also issued 3,511,444 five-year warrants to purchase shares of common stock at exercise price between $0.16 and $0.27 per share.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold 3,239,924 shares of common stock in eight separate private placement transactions. We received $670,000 in proceeds from the sales. In connection with these stock sales, we also issued 1,619,962 five-year warrants to purchase shares of common stock at exercise prices between $0.22 and $0.40 per share and 250,000 three-year warrants to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.50 per share.
Convertible Notes Payable
As of December 31, 2020, we had the following outstanding convertible notes payable:
On January 6, 2021, the holder of the above convertible notes agreed to extend the maturity date from December 31, 2020 to January 14, 2021. In exchange for the extension, the Company agreed to extend the expiration date of 3,508,333 existing warrants held by the holder from dates between July 2021 and March 2022 until March 2023.
On January 14, 2021, the Company and the holder entered into a series of agreements pursuant to which (i) the holder agreed to convert the full face value of $1,038,500 on outstanding convertible notes, plus $317,096 of accrued interest on such notes, into 13,538,494 shares of common stock pursuant to the original conversion terms of the underlying notes, (ii) the holder agreed to a 180-day leak out provision, whereby, from and after January 14, 2021, it may not sell in shares of the Company’s common stock in excess of 5% of the Company’s daily trading volume for the first 90 days and 10% of the Company’s daily volume for the next 90 days, subject to certain exceptions, (iii) the holder agreed to release all security interests and share reserves related to the above convertible notes, and (iv) the Company issued to the holder a new five-year warrant to purchase 13,538,494 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.30 per share.
Plan of operation and future funding requirements
Our plan of operations is to profitably operate our Health Services and Medical Distribution businesses and continue to invest in our Digital Healthcare business, including our cloud-based online personal medical information and record archiving system, the “HealthLynked Network.”
We intend to market the HealthLynked Network via telesales targeting physicians’ offices, direct to patient marketing, affiliated marketing campaigns, co-marketing with our Medical Distribution businesses retailer MOD, and expanded southeast regional sales efforts. We intend that our initial primary sales strategy will be physician telesales through the use of telesales representatives whom we will hire as access to capital allows. In combination with our telesales, we intend to also utilize Internet based marketing to increase penetration to targeted geographical areas. These campaigns will be focused on both physician providers and patient members. We also intend to leverage MOD’s discounted medical supplies as an offering to our patient and physician members in both the HealthLynked Network and our ACO network and plans. If we fail to complete the development of, or successfully market, the HealthLynked Network, our ability to realize future increases in revenue and operating profits could be impacted, and our results of operations and financial position would be materially adversely affected.
A summarized timeline of our strategic acquisition transactions and the related funding sources is as follows:
● In July 2018 we raised approximately $1.8 million in the July 2018 Private Placement for the purpose of technology enhancement, sales and marketing initiatives and to fund a portion of the first phase of our planned acquisition strategy.
● In 2019, we continued our plan to acquire health service businesses and offer physician owners cash, stock, and deferred compensation.
● On April 15, 2019, we acquired HCFM for $750,000 in cash, $750,000 in shares of our common stock and $500,000 in a three-year performance-based payout.
● On May 18, 2020, we acquired CHM for $214,000 in cash, $201,675 in shares of our common stock, up to $223,000 cash and $660,000 in shares of our common stock based on a target MSSP payment of $1,725,000 in the current year, and up to $437,500 in a four-year performance-based payout.
● On August 20, 2020, we completed the August 2020 Equity Transaction with Trusts controlled by our CEO, Dr. Michael Dent, pursuant to which the Trusts contributed an aggregate of 76,026 NEO Shares with a fair value of $3,066,889 to us, in exchange for an aggregate of 2,750,000 shares of our newly designated Series B Preferred Stock and an aggregate of 24,522,727 shares of our common stock.
● On October 19, 2020, we acquired MOD, a virtual distributor of discounted medical supplies selling to both consumers and medical practices throughout the United States, in exchange for 19,045,563 restricted shares of our common stock, the issuance of an aggregate of up to 10,004,749 restricted shares of our common stock over a four year period based on MOD achieving certain revenue targets, and (iii) the partial satisfaction of certain outstanding debt obligations of MOD in the amount of $703,200 in cash by us.
● During the second half of 2020, we retired floating rate convertible debt with a face value of $1,012,750 through conversions and repayments and repaid related party notes with a face value of $646,000 in an effort to improve our balance sheet;
● During January 2021, the holder of $1,038,500 fixed rate convertible debt converted the full face value of $1,038,500, plus $317,096 of accrued interest on such notes, into 13,538,494 shares of common stock pursuant to the original conversion terms of the underlying notes. Following the conversion, we had no further convertible debt outstanding.
● Subsequent to December 31, 2020 and through March 30, 2021, we sold 11,787,766 shares of common stock in 46 separate private placement transactions. We received $3,488,725 in proceeds from the sales. In connection with these stock sales, we also issued 5,893,889 five-year warrants to purchase shares of common stock at exercise prices between $0.27 and $1.05 per share. We also issued 3,006,098 shares pursuant to draws under the Investment Agreement for additional gross proceeds of $900,636.
Currently, we are focusing on acquiring additional profitable ACOs with a concentration on physician-based ACOs in Florida, the Southeast, Texas, New Jersey and Arizona. ACOs’ objectives are to reduce patients’ healthcare costs while improving their health. Our initial targets are physician-based Florida Medicare ACOs. Profitable ACOs have shared savings, which are payments made by the Medicare governing body CMS to ACOs whose Medicare patients have aggregate total savings over the regional threshold for all Medicare patients in the territory and that meet CMS’ quality standards. Given HealthLynked’s goal to improve healthcare and reduce healthcare costs for all patients, we anticipate that the ACO acquisition model can help us expand both physician and patient utilization of the HealthLynked Network while continuing to add incremental revenue and profit from to our health services and ACO segments.
We plan to raise additional capital to fund our ongoing acquisition strategy.
Historical Cash Flows
Operating Activities - During the year ended December 31, 2020, we used cash from operating activities of $2,117,297, as compared with $2,362,851 in the same period of 2019. The decrease in cash usage results primarily from new profits generated by our ACO/MSO business (acquired in May 2020) and our new physical therapy practice BTG (started in January 2020), as well as increased profits generated by our NCFM practice, which was acquired in April 2019 and therefore only reflected in our results for eight-and-a-half months of 2019.
Investing Activities - During the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated $1,812,239 from investing activities, including $2,784,782 received from the sale of marketable securities received in an August 2020 financing transaction, offset by $810,156 used to acquire CHM and MOD (net of $107,044 cash received), $137,390 paid against contingent acquisition consideration related to the acquisitions of NCFM and CHM and $24,997 for the acquisition of computers and equipment. During the same period of 2019, we used $465,000 for the acquisition of HCFM (net of $35,000 cash received) and $10,056 for the acquisition of computers and equipment.
Financing Activities - During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we realized $356,801 and $2,812,570, respectively, from financing activities. Cash realized in 2020 was comprised mainly of $1,187,286 from the proceeds of the sale of shares of common stock to investors and pursuant to the Investment Agreement, $1,071,069 net proceeds from government loans, $827,500 from the issuance of convertible notes, and $149,000 from related party loans. We also repaid $1,882,405 of convertible loans and $967,756 of related party loans.
