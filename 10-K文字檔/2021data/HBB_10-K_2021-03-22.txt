RESTATEMENT OF PREVIOUSLY ISSUED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
During the quarter ended March 31, 2020, the Company discovered certain accounting irregularities at its Mexican subsidiaries. As a result of the investigation performed, the Company, along with the Audit Review Committee and its third party experts, concluded that certain former employees of one of the Company’s Mexican subsidiaries engaged in unauthorized transactions with the Company’s Mexican subsidiaries that resulted in expenditures being deferred on the balance sheet beyond the period for which the costs pertained. The Company recorded a non-cash write-off for certain amounts included in the Company’s historical consolidated financial statements in trade receivables and prepaid expenses and other current assets, among other corrections, related to these transactions, and restated its consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 and each of the quarters during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The restatement also included corrections for other errors identified as immaterial, individually and in the aggregate, to our consolidated financial statements. These restated financial statements were previously filed on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2019. All amounts included herein reflect the restated financial statements.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities (if any). Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.
Revenue Recognition: Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the Company's customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Sales taxes are excluded from revenue. At contract inception, the Company assesses the goods and services promised in its contracts with customers and identifies a performance obligation for each promised good or service that is distinct. The Company has elected to account for shipping and handling activities performed after a customer obtains control of the goods as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer the goods, and therefore these activities are not assessed as a separate service to customers. The amount of revenue recognized varies primarily with changes in returns. In addition, the Company offers price concessions to our customers for incentive offerings, special pricing agreements, price competition, promotions or other volume-based arrangements. We determine whether price concessions offered to our customers are a reduction of the transaction price and revenue or are advertising expense, depending on whether we receive a distinct good or service from our customers and, if so, whether we can reasonably estimate the fair value of that distinct good or service. We evaluated such agreements with our customers and determined they should be accounted for as variable consideration.
To estimate variable consideration, the Company applies both the expected value method and most likely amount method based on the form of variable consideration, according to which method would provide the better prediction. The expected value method involves a probability weighted determination of the expected amount, whereas the most likely amount method identifies the single most likely outcome in a range of possible amounts.
The Company monitors its estimates of variable consideration, which includes returns and price concessions, and periodically makes adjustments to the carrying amounts as appropriate. During 2020, there were no material adjustments to the aforesaid estimates and the Company's past results of operations have not been materially affected by a change in these estimates. Although there can be no assurances, the Company is not aware of any circumstances that would be reasonably likely to materially change these estimates in the future.
Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS HAMILTON BEACH BRANDS HOLDING COMPANY
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Per Share and Percentage Data)
Retirement Benefit Plans: The Company maintains two defined benefit pension plans that provide benefits based on years of service and average compensation during certain periods. The Company's policy is to periodically make contributions to fund the defined benefit pension plans within the range allowed by applicable regulations. The defined benefit pension plan assets consist primarily of publicly traded stocks and government and corporate bonds. There is no guarantee the actual return on the plans’ assets will equal the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets or that the plans will not incur investment losses.
The expected long-term rate of return on defined benefit plan assets reflects management’s expectations of long-term rates of return on funds invested to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligations. In establishing the expected long-term rate of return assumption for plan assets, the Company considers the historical rates of return over a period of time that is consistent with the long-term nature of the underlying obligations of these plans as well as a forward-looking rate of return. The historical and forward-looking rates of return for each of the asset classes used to determine the Company's estimated rate of return assumption are based upon the rates of return earned or expected to be earned by investments in the equivalent benchmark market indices for each of the asset classes.
Expected returns for the U.S. pension plan are based on a calculated market-related value for U.S. pension plan assets. Under this methodology, asset gains and losses resulting from actual returns that differ from the Company's expected returns which are recognized ratably in the market-related value of assets over three years. Expected returns for the non-U.S. pension plan are based on fair market value for non-U.S. pension plan assets.
The basis for the selection of the discount rate for each plan is determined by matching the timing of the payment of the expected obligations under the defined benefit plans against the corresponding yield of high-quality corporate bonds of equivalent maturities.
Changes to the estimate of any of these factors could result in a material change to the Company's pension obligation causing a related increase or decrease in reported net operating results in the period of change in the estimate. Because the 2020 assumptions are used to calculate 2021 pension expense amounts, a one percentage-point change in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would result in a change in pension expense for 2021 of approximately $0.3 million for the plans. A one percentage-point change in the discount rate would result in a change in pension expense for 2021 by less than $0.1 million. A one percentage-point increase in the discount rate would have lowered the plans’ projected benefit obligation as of the end of 2020 by approximately $1.7 million; while a one percentage-point decrease in the discount rate would have raised the plans’ projected benefit obligation as of the end of 2020 by approximately $2.0 million.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The results of operations for Hamilton Beach Holding were as follows for the years ended December 31:
2020 Compared with 2019
Effective income tax rate on continuing operations 28.7 % 37.6 %
The following table identifies the components of the change in revenue for 2020 compared with 2019:
Revenue - Revenue decreased $8.1 million, or 1.3%. While unprecedented demand continues for small kitchen appliances, the cutover to our new enterprise resource planning ("ERP") system during the third quarter of 2020 reduced shipping capabilities at the Company's US distribution center and resulted in a significant shortfall in revenue during the third quarter. Despite a strong finish to 2020, which made up for a significant portion of the revenue shortfall in the third quarter, revenue decreased year over year as a result of lower volumes. The lower sales volume in the US consumer market is the result of the ERP cutover challenges, while lower volume in the international consumer and global commercial markets is attributable to the pandemic. The impact of lower volume was partially offset by higher average sales price driven primarily by product and customer mix. Foreign currency had a negative impact on revenue of $4.2 million.
Gross profit - The increase in gross profit of $10.1 million, or 7.9%, is primarily due to sales of higher margin products. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit margin increased from 21.0% to 23.0% primarily due to customer and product mix. Additionally, gross profit in 2020 includes a benefit of approximately $2.1 million for tariff relief.
Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS HAMILTON BEACH BRANDS HOLDING COMPANY
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Per Share and Percentage Data)
Selling, general and administrative expenses - Included in selling, general and administrative expenses are charges related to unauthorized transactions at our Mexican subsidiaries of $1.9 million in 2020 compared with $6.9 million in 2019. Offsetting this decrease in 2020 is an increase in incentive compensation expense of $3.3 million primarily driven by stronger Company performance as well as an increase in legal, other third-party fees and consulting expenses primarily related to the accounting irregularities at our Mexican subsidiaries and the implementation of our new ERP system.
Other expense (income), net - Other expense in 2020 was $1.7 million due primarily to currency losses from the re-measurement of liabilities related to inventory purchases denominated in US dollars by HBB’s foreign subsidiaries. Other income in 2019 was $0.4 million and included currency gains of $0.4 million.
Income tax expense - The Company recognized income tax expense of $9.7 million on income from continuing operations before income taxes of $33.7 million, an effective tax rate of 28.7% in 2020 compared to income tax expense of $9.1 million on income from continuing operations before income taxes of $24.2 million, an effective tax rate of 37.6% in 2019. The higher effective tax rate in 2019 is attributable to non-cash charges to write-off unrealizable assets at our Mexican subsidiaries for which the corresponding tax benefit has been substantially offset by an increase in unrecognized tax benefits and $1.6 million of deferred tax expense related to a change in judgment regarding the valuation allowance recorded against the deferred tax assets of KC.
2019 Compared with 2018
The results of operations for Hamilton Beach Holding were as follows for the years ended December 31:
Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS HAMILTON BEACH BRANDS HOLDING COMPANY
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Per Share and Percentage Data)
The following table identifies the components of the change in revenue for 2019 compared with 2018:
Revenue - Revenue decreased $18.3 million, or 2.9%. The decline is primarily due to lower sales volume in the U.S. consumer, international consumer and global commercial markets. Globally, our ecommerce business grew 27%; however, these gains were more than offset by the adverse impact of tariffs, a loss of placements in the dollar store channel resulting from HBB's decision not to maintain very low margin business, ongoing foot traffic challenges at some retailers and other pressure points facing individual retail companies. Revenue in the global commercial market decreased due primarily to lower volume driven by the adverse impact of tariffs.
Gross profit - The decline in gross profit of $10.5 million, or 7.6%, is primarily due to lower sales volume. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit margin declined from 22.1% to 21.0% primarily due to increased inbound freight expenses, the adverse impact of tariffs and unfavorable foreign currency movements.
Selling, general and administrative expenses - The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was mainly attributable to a $5.2 million decline in environmental expense due to the reduction to the environmental reserve at one site of $3.2 million related to a change in the expected type and extent of investigation and remediation activities and to a $1.5 million reduction in environmental expense due to the probable recovery of investigation and remediation costs associated with the same site from a responsible party in exchange for release from all future obligations by that party. Additionally, advertising expenses declined $3.1 million and employee-related costs decreased $2.0 million due to reduced incentive compensation expense. These decreases were partially offset by a one-time charge of $3.2 million recorded in the second quarter of 2019 for a contingent loss related to patent litigation. Additionally, certain former employees of one of our Mexican subsidiaries engaged in unauthorized transactions with the Company’s Mexican subsidiaries and in doing so, expenditures were deferred on the balance sheet of the Company's Mexican subsidiaries beyond the period for which the costs pertained. Included in selling, general and administrative expenses are charges of $6.9 million in 2019 compared with charges of $4.9 million in 2018 to write-off unrealizable assets created as a result of these unauthorized transactions.
Other expense (income), net - Other income in 2019 includes currency gains of $0.4 million compared with other expense in 2018 related to currency losses of $0.5 million as the Mexican peso strengthened against the U.S. dollar.
Income tax expense - The Company recognized income tax expense of $9.1 million on income from continuing operations before income taxes of $24.2 million, an effective tax rate of 37.6% compared to income tax expense of $7.4 million, an effective tax rate of 24.4%. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to $2.0 million of deferred tax expense related to a change in judgment regarding the valuation allowance recorded against certain deferred tax assets of KC. Additionally, certain former employees of one of our Mexican subsidiaries engaged in unauthorized transactions with the Company’s Mexican subsidiaries and in doing so expenditures were deferred on the balance sheet of the Mexican subsidiaries beyond the period for which the costs pertained. Included in selling, general and administrative expenses are non-cash charges to write-off unrealizable assets for which the corresponding tax benefit has been substantially offset by an increase in unrecognized tax benefits.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Company cash flows are provided by dividends paid or distributions made by its subsidiaries. The only material assets held by it are the investments in consolidated subsidiaries. As a result, certain statutory limitations or regulatory or financing agreements could affect the levels of distributions allowed to be made by its subsidiaries. Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Company has not guaranteed any of the obligations of its subsidiaries.
HBB's principal sources of cash to fund liquidity needs are: (i) cash generated from operations and (ii) borrowings available under the revolving credit facility, as defined below. HBB's primary use of funds consists of working capital requirements, operating expenses, capital expenditures, and payments of principal and interest on debt. At December 31, 2020, the Company had cash and cash equivalents for continuing operations of $2.4 million, compared to $2.1 million at December 31, 2019.
The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in governments around the world implementing stringent measures to help control the spread of the virus, including business shutdowns and limitations, travel restrictions, border closings, restrictions on public gatherings and shelter-in-place restrictions. This has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted financial markets and resulted in increased unemployment levels, all of which have negatively impacted various industries. We believe we are well positioned to effectively navigate the COVID-19 pandemic for a number of reasons. Demand for certain retail small kitchen appliances in the US remains strong as consumers prepare more food and beverages at home. We are managing discretionary expenses, and have sufficient availability under the revolving credit facility to meet our future anticipated obligations. We have demonstrated effective management of net working capital which was a major contributor to improved borrowing activity during the year, with average debt down $11.6 million compared to the prior year ended December 31, 2019. Additionally, the Company is no longer impacted by KC’s losses and negative cash flow. We will continue to work with our customers, employees, suppliers and communities to address the impacts of COVID-19 and closely monitor our liquidity.
The following table presents selected cash flow information from continuing operations:
December 31, 2020 Compared with December 31, 2019
Operating activities - Net cash used for operating activities was $27.9 million compared to cash provided by operating activities of $0.2 million in 2019 primarily due to an increase of $59.9 million in net working capital. Trade receivables increased primarily due to increased fourth quarter sales in 2020 compared with prior year. The increase in inventory and accounts payable are primarily due to the earlier build of inventory to offset the impacts of longer lead times driven by shipping congestion in our supply chain from China, as well as to support expected strong demand in the first half of 2021.
Investing activities - Net cash used for investing activities was relatively flat in 2020 compared to 2019. Capital spending for internal-use software development costs was lower in 2020 as the Company implemented its new ERP system in July 2020. The decline in spending on internal-use software was offset by other investments.
Financing activities - Net cash provided by financing activities increased $33.1 million in 2020 primarily due to an increase in HBB's net borrowing activity on the revolving credit facility. The increase in borrowings was used to fund net working capital.
Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS HAMILTON BEACH BRANDS HOLDING COMPANY
(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Per Share and Percentage Data)
December 31, 2019 Compared with December 31, 2018
Operating activities - Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $17.7 million in 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to increased trade receivables, partially offset by a decline in inventory. Trade receivables increased primarily due to the timing of collections and increased fourth quarter sales in 2020 compared with prior year. The decline in inventory is primarily due to the continued efficient management of inventory levels.
Investing activities - Net cash used for investing activities from continuing operations decreased $3.6 million in 2019 primarily due to lower capital expenditures related to HBB internal-use software development costs and tooling for new products.
Financing activities - Net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations was $1.1 million in 2019 compared to a use of cash of $9.3 million in 2018 primarily due to an increase in HBB's net borrowing activity on the revolving credit facility. The increase in borrowings was used to fund net working capital and stock repurchases.
Capital Resources
On November 23, 2020, HBB entered into Amendment No. 8 to its Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Agreement amended and restated the Credit Agreement in its entirety and extended the term of HBB's credit facility to June 30, 2025, increased the credit facility from $115.0 million to $125.0 million, amended the pricing grid and provided for an accordion feature to increase the facility by an additional $25.0 million upon HBB's request, subject to Lender consent. The Company expects to continue to borrow against the facility and make voluntary repayments within the next twelve months. As a result of the amendment, repayment of the credit facility is due on June 30, 2025, therefore all borrowings are classified as long term debt as of December 31, 2020. The obligations under the HBB Facility are secured by substantially all of HBB's assets. At December 31, 2020, the borrowing base under the HBB Facility was $123.3 million and borrowings outstanding were $98.4 million. At December 31, 2020, the excess availability under the HBB Facility was $24.9 million.
The maximum availability under the HBB Facility is governed by a borrowing base derived from advance rates against eligible trade receivables, inventory and trademarks of the borrowers, as defined in the HBB Facility. Borrowings bear interest at a floating rate, which can be a base rate, LIBOR or bankers' acceptance rate, as defined in the HBB Facility, plus an applicable margin. The applicable margins, effective December 31, 2020, for base rate loans and LIBOR loans denominated in U.S. dollars were 0.0% and 1.75%, respectively. The applicable margins, effective December 31, 2020, for base rate loans and bankers' acceptance loans denominated in Canadian dollars were 0.0% and 1.75%, respectively. The HBB Facility also requires a fee of 0.25% per annum on the unused commitment. The margins and unused commitment fee under the HBB Facility are subject to quarterly adjustment based on average excess availability. The weighted average interest rate applicable to the HBB Facility for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 2.88%, including the floating rate margin and the effect of the interest rate swap agreements described below.
To reduce the exposure to changes in the market rate of interest, HBB has entered into interest rate swap agreements for a portion of the HBB Facility. Terms of the interest rate swap agreements require HBB to receive a variable interest rate and pay a fixed interest rate. HBB has interest rate swaps with notional values totaling $25.0 million at December 31, 2020 at an average fixed interest rate of 1.66%.
The HBB Facility includes restrictive covenants, which, among other things, limit the payment of dividends to Hamilton Beach Holding, subject to achieving availability thresholds. Under Amendment No. 8 to the HBB Facility, dividends to Hamilton Beach Holding are not to exceed $6.0 million during any calendar year to the extent that for the thirty days prior to the dividend payment date, and after giving effect to the dividend payment, HBB maintains excess availability of not less than $15.0 million. Dividends to Hamilton Beach Holding are discretionary to the extent that for the thirty days prior to the dividend payment date, and after giving effect to the dividend payment, HBB maintains excess availability of not less than $25.0 million. The HBB Facility also requires HBB to achieve a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio in certain circumstances, as defined in the HBB Facility. At December 31, 2020, HBB was in compliance with all financial covenants in the HBB Facility.

(Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Per Share and Percentage Data)
The Company maintains an arrangement with a financial institution to sell certain U.S. trade receivables on a non-recourse basis. The Company utilizes this arrangement as an integral part of financing working capital.
HBB believes funds available from cash on hand, the HBB Facility and operating cash flows will provide sufficient liquidity to meet its operating needs and commitments arising during the next twelve months and until the expiration of the HBB Facility.
Contractual Obligations, Contingent Liabilities and Commitments
Following is a table which summarizes the contractual obligations of Hamilton Beach Holding as of December 31, 2020:
Not included in the table above, HBB has a long-term liability of approximately $4.7 million for unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, as of December 31, 2020. At this time, the Company is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the timing of payments due to, among other factors, the uncertainty of the timing and outcome of its audits.
HBB’s variable interest payments are calculated based upon HBB's anticipated payment schedule and the December 31, 2020 base rate and applicable margins, as defined in the HBB Facility. A 1/8% increase in the base rate would increase HBB’s estimated total annual interest payments on the HBB Facility by approximately $0.3 million.
HBB's purchase and other obligations are primarily for accounts payable, open purchase orders and accrued payroll and incentive compensation.
An event of default, as defined in the HBB Facility and in HBB's operating lease agreements, could cause an acceleration of the payment schedule. No such event of default for HBB has occurred or is anticipated to occur.
Pension funding can vary significantly each year due to plan amendments, changes in the market value of plan assets, legislation and the Company’s decisions to contribute above the minimum regulatory funding requirements. As a result, pension funding has not been included in the table above. HBB does not expect to contribute to its pension plans in 2021. Pension benefit payments are made from assets of the pension plans.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company has not entered into any off balance sheet financing arrangements, other than operating leases, which are disclosed in the contractual obligations table above.
Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted
The Company is an emerging growth company and has elected not to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or nonpublic entities, the Company can adopt the new or revised standard at the time nonpublic entities adopt the new or revised standard.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)," which requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leased assets. For nonpublic entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is planning to adopt ASU 2016-02 when required and is currently evaluating to what extent ASU 2016-02 will affect the Company's financial position, results of operations, cash flows and related disclosures.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)," which requires an entity to recognize credit losses as an allowance rather than as a write-down. For nonpublic entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is planning to adopt ASU 2016-03 for its year ending December 31, 2022 and is currently evaluating to what extent ASU 2016-13 will affect the Company's financial position, results of operations, cash flows and related disclosures.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
The statements contained in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and elsewhere throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are not historical facts are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward looking statements are made subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those presented. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly revise these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date hereof. Such risks and uncertainties include, without limitation: (1) the Company’s ability to ship products to meet the anticipated increase in demand, (2) the Company’s ability to successfully manage the anticipated transportation constraints, (3) the unpredictable nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential impact on our business; (4) changes in the sales prices, product mix or levels of consumer purchases of small electric and specialty housewares appliances, (5) changes in consumer retail and credit markets, including the increasing volume of transactions made through third-party internet sellers, (6) bankruptcy of or loss of major retail customers or suppliers, (7) changes in costs, including transportation costs, of sourced products, (8) delays in delivery of sourced products, (9) changes in or unavailability of quality or cost effective suppliers, (10) exchange rate fluctuations, changes in the import tariffs and monetary policies and other changes in the regulatory climate in the countries in which HBB buys, operates and/or sells products, (11) the impact of tariffs on customer purchasing patterns, (12) product liability, regulatory actions or other litigation, warranty claims or returns of products, (13) customer acceptance of, changes in costs of, or delays in the development of new products, (14) increased competition, including consolidation within the industry, (15) shifts in consumer shopping patterns, gasoline prices, weather conditions, the level of consumer confidence and disposable income as a result of economic conditions, unemployment rates or other events or conditions that may adversely affect the level of customer purchases of HBB products, (16) changes mandated by federal, state and other regulation, including tax, health, safety or environmental legislation, (17) the result of shareholder or governmental actions relating to the restatement of our financial statements and accounting and legal fees that we may incur in connection with the restatement, (18) difficulties arising as a result of our implementation, integration or operation of an enterprise resource planning system in the US, (19) our ability to successfully remediate the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting disclosed in Item 9A of the Annual Report on Form 10-K within the time periods and in the manner currently anticipated, additional material weaknesses or other deficiencies that may arise in the future or our ability to maintain an effective system of internal controls, and (20) other risk factors, including those described in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. Furthermore, the situation surrounding COVID-19 remains fluid and the potential for a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and stock price increases the longer the virus impacts activity levels in the US and globally. For this reason, the Company cannot reasonably estimate with any degree of certainty the future impact COVID-19 may have on its results of operations, financial position, liquidity and stock price. The extent of any impact will depend on the extent of new outbreaks, the extent to which new shutdowns may be needed, the nature of government public health guidelines and the public’s adherence to those guidelines, the impact of government economic relief on the US economy, unemployment levels, the success of businesses reopening fully, the timing for proven treatments and the availability of vaccines for COVID-19, consumer confidence and demand for our products.
