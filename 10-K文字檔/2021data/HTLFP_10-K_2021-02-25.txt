ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Management’s discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Heartland as of the dates and for the periods indicated is presented below. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data, the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and other financial data appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Heartland and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly-owned.
For a discussion of 2018 results of operations, including a discussion of the financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, refer to Part I, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on February 26, 2020.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. These estimates are based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Among other things, the estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Refer to Note 1, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," for further discussion on Heartland's critical accounting policies.
The estimates and judgments that management believes have the most effect on Heartland’s reported financial position and results of operations are as follows:
Allowance For Credit Losses
The process utilized by Heartland to estimate the allowance for credit losses is considered a critical accounting policy for Heartland. The allowance for credit losses represents management’s estimate of identified and unidentified current expected credit losses in the existing loan portfolio. Therefore, the accuracy of this estimate could have a material impact on Heartland’s earnings.
For certain commercial and agricultural loans and any related unfunded loan commitments, the expected credit losses are calculated on a pool basis through a transition matrix model derived life of loan probability of default and loss given default methodology. The probability of default and loss given default methodology have been developed using Heartland’s historical loss experience over the look back period, currently over the most recent 12 years. For smaller commercial and agricultural loans, residential real estate loans and consumer loans and any related unfunded loan commitments, a lifetime average historical loss rate is established for each pool of loans based upon an average loss rate calculated using Heartland historical loss experience over the look back-period. The loss rates used in the allowance calculation are periodically re-evaluated and adjusted to reflect changes in historical loss levels or other risks.
If a loan no longer shares similar risk characteristics with other loans in the pool, it is evaluated on an individual basis and is not included in the collective evaluation. All individually assessed loan calculations are completed at least semi-annually.
Heartland's allowance methodology also has a qualitative component, the purpose of which is to provide management with a means to take into consideration changes in current conditions that could potentially have an effect, up or down, on the level of recognized loan losses, that, for whatever reason, may not be represented in the quantitative analysis performed in determining its base loan loss rates.
Additionally, our allowance calculation utilizes an overlay approach for its economic forecasting component, similar to the method utilized for the qualitative factors. The length of the reasonable and supportable forecast period is a judgmental determination based on the level to which Heartland can reasonably support its forecast of economic conditions that drive its estimate of expected loss.
The appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is monitored on an ongoing basis by the credit administration group, loan review staff, executive and senior management and the boards of directors of Heartland and each Bank. There can be no assurances that the allowance for credit losses will be adequate to cover all current expected credit losses, but management believes that the allowance for credit losses was appropriate at December 31, 2020. While management uses available
information to provide for credit losses, the ultimate collectability of a substantial portion of the loan portfolio and the need for future additions to the allowance will be based on changes in economic conditions. Should the economic climate deteriorate, borrowers may experience financial difficulty, and the level of nonperforming loans, charge-offs, and delinquencies could rise and require further increases in the provision for credit losses. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the allowance for credit losses carried by the Banks. Such agencies may require us to make additional provisions to the allowance based upon their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examinations.
Business Combinations, Goodwill and Core Deposit Intangibles
We record all assets and liabilities purchased in an acquisition, including intangibles, at fair value. Determining the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired often involves estimates based on third-party valuations, such as appraisals, or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques that may include the use of estimates. Goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are not amortized but are subject, at a minimum, to annual tests for impairment. In certain situations, interim impairment tests may be required if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Core deposit intangibles assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using straight-line and accelerated methods and are subject to impairment if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount.
The initial fair value measurement of loans and core deposit intangibles require us to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of how the acquired assets will perform in the future using valuation methods. The fair value of acquired loans is based on a discounted cash flow methodology that projects principal and interest payments using key assumptions related to the discount rate and loss rates. The fair value of core deposit intangibles is based on the cost savings approach under a discounted cash flow methodology, whereby projected net cash flow benefits are derived from estimating costs to carry deposits compared to alternative funding costs, and includes key assumptions related to the discount rate, deposit attrition rates and net costs, including discounted cash flow analyses. Events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include, among others, competitive forces, customer behaviors, changes in revenue growth trends, cost structures, technology, changes in discount rates and market conditions. In determining the reasonableness of cash flow estimates, Heartland reviews historical performance of the underlying assets or similar assets in an effort to assess and validate assumptions utilized in its estimates.
OVERVIEW
Heartland is a multi-bank holding company providing banking, mortgage, wealth management, investments and insurance services to individuals and businesses. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Heartland has eleven banking subsidiaries with 133 locations in Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, New Mexico, Arizona, Montana, Colorado, Minnesota, Kansas, Missouri, Texas and California. Our primary objectives are to increase profitability and diversify our market area and asset base by expanding through acquisitions and to grow organically by increasing our customer base in the markets we serve.
Our results of operations depend primarily on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income from interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities. Noninterest income, which includes service charges and fees, loan servicing income, trust income, brokerage and insurance commissions, securities gains and gains on sale of loans held for sale and income on bank owned life insurance also affects our results of operations. Our principal operating expenses, aside from interest expense, consist of the provision for credit losses, salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, professional fees, advertising, core deposit intangibles and customer relationship intangibles amortization and other real estate and loan collection expenses.
2020 Overview
Net income available to common stockholders was $133.5 million, or $3.57 per diluted common share, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $149.1 million, or $4.14 per diluted common share, earned during the prior year. Return on average common equity was 8.06% and return on average assets was 0.90% for 2020, compared to 10.12% and 1.24%, respectively, for 2019.
Total assets of Heartland were $17.91 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $4.70 billion or 36% from $13.21 billion at year-end 2019.

2020 Developments
Adoption of ASU 2016-13, "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)"
On January 1, 2020, Heartland adopted ASU 2016-13, "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)," commonly referred to as "CECL." The impact of Heartland's adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020 ("Day 1") resulted in the following:
•an increase of $12.1 million to the allowance for credit losses related to loans, which included a reclassification of $6.0 million of purchased credit impaired loan discount on previously acquired loans, and a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings totaling $4.6 million, net of taxes of $1.5 million;
•an increase of $13.6 million to the allowance for unfunded commitments and a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings totaling $10.2 million, net of taxes of $3.4 million, and
•established an allowance for credit losses for Heartland's held to maturity debt securities of $158,000 and a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings totaling $118,000, net of taxes of $40,000.
The allowance calculation under CECL is an expected loss model, which encompasses expected losses over the life of the loan and held to maturity securities portfolios, including expected losses due to changes in economic conditions and forecasts, such as those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. For more information, see Note 1, "Basis of Presentation" and Note 6, "Allowance for Credit Losses" to the consolidated financial statements contained herein.
COVID-19
In March 2020, the outbreak of the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 ("COVID-19") was recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The spread of COVID-19 has created a global public health crisis that has resulted in unprecedented uncertainty, volatility and disruption in financial markets and in governmental, commercial and consumer activity in the United States, as well as globally. Governmental responses to the pandemic have included orders closing businesses not deemed essential and directing individuals to restrict their movements, observe social distancing and shelter in place. These actions, together with responses to the pandemic by businesses and individuals, have resulted in rapid decreases in commercial and consumer activity, temporary closures of many businesses, which have led to a loss of revenues and a rapid increase in unemployment, material decreases in commodity prices and business valuations, disruptions in global supply chains, market downturns and volatility, changes in consumer behavior related to pandemic fears, emergency response legislation and an expectation that the Federal Reserve will maintain a low interest rate environment for the foreseeable future.
In the first quarter of 2020, Heartland implemented and continues to operate under its pandemic management plan to assure workplace and employee safety and business resiliency. Relief and support provided to employees, customers and communities facing challenges from the impacts of COVID-19 included the following measures:
•employees who can work from home continue to do so, and those employees who are working in bank offices have been placed on rotating teams to limit potential exposure to COVID-19;
•all in-person events and large meetings are canceled and have transitioned to virtual meetings;
•employees receive an increase in time off and enhanced health care coverage related to testing and treatments for COVID-19;
•Heartland has installed and requires the use of personal protective equipment in bank offices;
•Heartland implemented a 20% wage premium for certain customer-facing employees through August 2020, and pandemic pay for employees unable to work due to exposure or contraction of the virus;
•Heartland participates in the Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP"), originally created by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the "CARES Act") and later expanded with the adoption of the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act (the "PPFA") and the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits and Venues Act (the "Economic Aid Act"). PPP loans are 100% SBA guaranteed and borrowers may be eligible to have an amount up to the entire principal balance forgiven and paid by the SBA. Heartland originated $1.2 billion of PPP loans during 2020 and continues to originate PPP loans under the first and second draw programs that were established under the Economic Aid Act.
•Heartland has participated in the CARES Act SBA loan payment and deferral program for existing SBA loans; and
•Heartland has contributed $1.5 million to support communities served by Heartland and its subsidiary banks, including donations of $264,000 to local schools.
While the measures described above remain in effect, Heartland's pandemic management plan continues to evolve in response to the recent developments relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Heartland's financial condition and results of operations will depend on the severity and duration of the pandemic, related restrictions on business and consumer activity, efficacy and distribution of vaccines and the availability of government programs to alleviate the economic stress of the pandemic. See Heartland's "Safe Harbor Statement" in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Issued $115.0 Million of Preferred Equity
On June 26, 2020, Heartland issued and sold 4.6 million depositary shares, each representing a 1/400th interest in a share of 7.00% Fixed-Rate Reset Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series E.

The net proceeds of $110.7 million are being used for general corporate purposes, which may include organic and acquired growth, financing investments, capital expenditures, investments in wholly-owned subsidiaries as regulatory capital and repayment of debt.
Branch Optimization
In the second half of 2020, Heartland's member banks approved plans to consolidate eight branch locations, which included two branches in the Midwest region, five branches in the Western region and one in the Southwestern region, and resulted in $1.2 million and $2.3 million of fixed asset write-downs in the third and fourth quarters of 2020, respectively. The branch consolidations are expected to be completed in early 2021. Heartland continues to review its branch network for optimization and consolidation opportunities, which may result in additional write-downs of fixed assets in future periods.

Through the end of 2019, approximately $14 million of the net gains from the divestitures were invested in talent, process improvement, and technology upgrades that management believes are necessary to support future organic and acquired growth, improve efficiency and ultimately provide a superior customer experience and enhance profitability. Three of the most significant investments in technology and process improvement were:
•a project called Operation Customer Compass, which was focused gaining efficiencies through streamlined and automated processes.
•an upgrade to the existing customer relationship management system to the Salesforce Platform, which is an industry leader for relationship management, and,
•the implementation of nCino, a premier commercial loan origination system.
The integration between nCino and Salesforce improved back office functions and shortened the sales cycle, and these two projects were completed in 2020.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Net Interest Margin and Net Interest Income
Heartland's management monitors and manages net interest income and net interest margin and shares the results with investors because they are indicators of Heartland's profitability and growth of earning assets.
Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on earning assets and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities. As such, net interest income is affected by changes in the volume and yields on earning assets and the volume and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets.
Our success in maintaining competitive net interest margin despite the low-interest rate environment has been the result of an increase in average earning assets and a favorable deposit mix. Also contributing to our ability to maintain net interest margin has been the amortization of purchase accounting discounts associated with acquisitions completed since 2015. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our net interest margin included 12 basis points, 18 basis points and 22 basis points, respectively, of purchase accounting discount amortization.
See "Analysis of Average Balances, Tax-Equivalent Yields and Rates" for a description of our use of net interest income and net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent basis, which is not defined by GAAP, and a reconciliation of annualized net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent basis to GAAP.
Net interest margin, expressed as a percentage of average earning assets, was 3.65% (3.69% on a fully tax-equivalent basis) during 2020, compared to 4.00% (4.04% on a fully tax-equivalent basis) during 2019 and 4.26% (4.32% on a fully tax-equivalent basis) during 2018.
Total interest income and average earning asset changes for 2020 compared to 2019 were:
•Total interest income increased $22.3 million or 4% to $536.6 million from $514.3 million due to an increase in average earning assets, which was partially offset by a decrease in the average rate on earning assets.
•Total interest income on a tax-equivalent basis (non-GAAP) was $542.1 million compared to $519.3 million, which was an increase of $22.8 million or 4%.
•Average earning assets increased $2.64 billion or 24% to $13.48 billion from $10.85 billion, which was primarily attributable to recent acquisitions, increases in securities and loan growth, including PPP loans.
•The average rate on earning assets decreased 77 basis points to 4.02% compared to 4.79%, which was primarily due to recent decreases in market interest rates and the lower yield on PPP loans, which was 3.25%.
Total interest expense and average interest bearing liability changes for 2020 compared to 2019 were:
•Total interest expense decreased $35.7 million or 44% to $44.9 million compared to $80.6 million.
•The average rate paid on Heartland's interest bearing liabilities decreased to 0.54% compared to 1.14%, which was primarily due to recent decreases in market interest rates.
•Average interest bearing deposits increased $1.16 billion or 17% to $7.81 billion from $6.65 billion, which was primarily attributable to recent acquisitions and deposit growth, including deposits from government stimulus payments and other COVID-19 relief programs.
•The average rate paid on Heartland's interest bearing deposits decreased 57 basis points to 0.39% compared to 0.96%, which was primarily attributable to recent decreases in market interest rates.
•Average borrowings increased $135.9 million or 34% to $538.2 million from $402.3 million. The average interest rate paid on Heartland's borrowings was 2.71% compared to 4.19%.
Net interest income changes for 2020 compared to 2019 were:
•Net interest income totaled $491.7 million compared to $433.7 million, which was an increase of $58.0 million or 13%.
•Net interest income on a tax equivalent basis (non-GAAP) totaled $497.2 million compared to $438.7 million, which was an increase of $58.5 million or 13%.
Total interest income and average earning asset changes for 2019 compared to 2018 were:
•Total interest income increased $48.5 million or 10% to $514.3 million from $465.8 million.
•Total interest income on a tax-equivalent basis was $519.3 million, an increase of $47.2 million or 10% from $472.0 million.
•Average earning assets increased $1.13 billion or 12% to $10.85 billion compared to $9.72 billion, which was primarily attributable to acquisitions completed during 2019 and 2018.
•The average rate earned on average earning assets was 4.79% during 2019 compared to 4.86% during 2018, which was a decrease of seven basis points.
Total interest expense and average interest bearing liability changes for 2019 compared to 2018 were:
•Total interest expense increased $28.7 million or 55% during 2019 to $80.6 million from $51.9 million during 2018.
•The average interest rate paid on Heartland's interest bearing liabilities was 1.14% in 2019 compared to 0.83% in 2018.
•Average interest bearing deposits increased $807.5 million or 14% to $6.65 billion from $5.84 billion.
•The average rate paid on Heartland's interest bearing deposits increased to 0.96% from 0.61%, which was primarily attributable to the full year impact of the 2018 Federal Funds rate increases partially offset by the impact of the three Federal Funds rate cuts in the second half of 2019.
Net interest income changes for 2019 compared to 2018 were:
•Net interest income totaled $433.7 million compared to $414.0 million, which was an increase of $19.8 million or 5%.
•Net interest income on a tax equivalent basis (non-GAAP) totaled $438.7 million compared to $420.2 million, which was an increase of $18.5 million or 4%.
Management believes net interest margin in dollars will continue to increase as the amount of earning assets grows, however net interest margin as a percentage of average earning assets may decrease because of interest rate changes. The Federal
Reserve has indicated it will closely assess economic data and be patient before moving ahead with any additional changes to the Federal Funds rate; therefore, the timing and magnitude of any such changes are uncertain and will depend on domestic and global economic conditions.
We attempt to manage our balance sheet to minimize the effect that a change in interest rates has on our net interest margin. We plan to continue to work toward improving both our earning assets and funding mix through targeted organic growth strategies, which we believe will result in additional net interest income. We believe our net interest income simulations reflect a well-balanced and manageable interest rate posture.
