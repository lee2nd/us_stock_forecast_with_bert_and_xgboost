ITEM 7: MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS
OVERVIEW
M/I Homes, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company” or “we”) is one of the nation’s leading builders of single-family homes, having sold over 127,650 homes since commencing homebuilding activities in 1976. The Company’s homes are marketed and sold primarily under the M/I Homes brand. The Company has homebuilding operations in Columbus and Cincinnati, Ohio; Indianapolis, Indiana; Chicago, Illinois; Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota; Detroit, Michigan; Tampa, Sarasota and Orlando, Florida; Austin, Dallas/Fort Worth, Houston and San Antonio, Texas; and Charlotte and Raleigh, North Carolina.
Included in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are the following topics relevant to the Company’s performance and financial condition:
•Application of Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies;
•Results of Operations;
•Discussion of Our Liquidity and Capital Resources;
•Summary of Our Contractual Obligations;
•Discussion of Our Utilization of Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements; and
•Impact of Interest Rates and Inflation.
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and various other factors that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates such estimates and assumptions and makes adjustments as deemed necessary. Actual results could differ from these estimates using different estimates and assumptions, or if conditions are significantly different in the future. See “Forward - Looking Statements” above in Part I.
Listed below are those estimates and policies that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application. Our critical accounting estimates should be read in conjunction with the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Revenue Recognition. Revenue and the related profit from the sale of a home and revenue and the related profit from the sale of land to third parties are recognized in the financial statements on the date of closing if delivery has occurred, title has passed to the buyer, all performance obligations (as defined below) have been met, and control of the home or land is transferred to the buyer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for the home or land. If not received immediately upon closing, cash proceeds from home closings are held in escrow for the Company’s benefit, typically for up to three days, and are included in Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Sales incentives vary by type of incentive and by amount on a community-by-community and home-by-home basis. The costs of any sales incentives in the form of free or discounted products and services provided to homebuyers are reflected in Land and housing costs in the Consolidated Statements of Income because such incentives are identified in our home purchase contracts with homebuyers as an intrinsic part of our single performance obligation to deliver and transfer title to their home for the transaction price stated in the contracts. Sales incentives that we may provide in the form of closing cost allowances are recorded as a reduction of housing revenue at the time the home is delivered.
We record sales commissions within Selling expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income when incurred (i.e., when the home is delivered) as the amortization period is generally one year or less and therefore capitalization is not required as part of the practical expedient for incremental costs of obtaining a contract.
Contract liabilities include customer deposits related to sold but undelivered homes. Substantially all of our home sales are scheduled to close and be recorded to revenue within one year from the date of receiving a customer deposit. Contract liabilities expected to be recognized as revenue, excluding revenue pertaining to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less, is not material.
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. All of our home purchase contracts have a single performance obligation as the promise to transfer the home is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contract and, therefore, not distinct. Our performance obligation, to deliver the agreed-upon home, is generally satisfied in less than one year from the original contract date. Deferred revenue resulting from uncompleted performance obligations existing at the time we deliver new homes to our homebuyers is not material.
Although our third party land sale contracts may include multiple performance obligations, the revenue we expect to recognize in any future year related to remaining performance obligations, excluding revenue pertaining to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less, is not material. We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for land sale contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less.
We recognize the majority of the revenue associated with our mortgage loan operations when the mortgage loans are sold and/or related servicing rights are sold to third party investors or retained and managed under a third party sub-service arrangement. The revenue recognized is reduced by the fair value of the related guarantee provided to the investor. The fair value of the guarantee is recognized in revenue when the Company is released from its obligation under the guarantee. We recognize financial services revenue associated with our title operations as homes are delivered, closing services are rendered, and title policies are issued, all of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is delivered. All of the underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies is transferred to third-party insurers.
See Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our revenues disaggregated by geography and revenue source.
Inventory. Inventory includes the costs of land acquisition, land development and home construction, capitalized interest, real estate taxes, direct overhead costs incurred during development and home construction, and common costs that benefit the entire community, less impairments, if any. Land acquisition, land development and common costs (both incurred and estimated to be incurred) are typically allocated to individual lots based on the total number of lots expected to be closed in each community or phase, or based on the relative fair value, the relative sales value or the front footage method of each lot. Any changes to the estimated total development costs of a community or phase are allocated proportionately to the homes remaining in the community or phase and homes previously closed. The cost of individual lots is transferred to homes under construction when home construction begins. Home construction costs are accumulated on a specific identification basis. Costs of home deliveries include the specific construction cost of the home and the allocated lot costs. Such costs are charged to cost of sales simultaneously with revenue recognition, as discussed above. When a home is closed, we typically have not yet paid all incurred costs necessary to complete the home. As homes close, we compare the home construction budget to actual recorded costs to date to estimate the additional costs to be incurred from our subcontractors related to the home. We record a liability and a corresponding charge to cost of sales for the amount we estimate will ultimately be paid related to that home. We monitor the accuracy of such estimates by comparing actual costs incurred in subsequent months to the estimate. Although actual costs to complete a home in the future could differ from our estimates, our method has historically produced consistently accurate estimates of actual costs to complete closed homes.
Inventory is recorded at cost, unless events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the land is impaired, at which point the inventory is written down to fair value as required by Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 360-10, Property, Plant and Equipment (“ASC 360”). The Company assesses inventory for recoverability on a quarterly basis if events or changes in local or national economic conditions indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In conducting our quarterly review for indicators of impairment on a community level, we evaluate, among other things, margins on sales contracts in backlog, the margins on homes that have been delivered, expected changes in margins with regard to future home sales over the life of the community, expected changes in margins with regard to future land sales, the value of the land itself as well as any results from third-party appraisals. From the review of all of these factors, we identify communities whose carrying values may exceed their estimated undiscounted future cash flows and run a test for recoverability. For those communities whose carrying values exceed the estimated undiscounted future cash flows and which are deemed to be impaired, the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the communities exceeds the estimated fair value. Due to the fact that the Company’s cash flow models and estimates of fair values are based upon management estimates and assumptions, unexpected changes in market conditions and/or changes in management’s intentions with respect to the inventory may lead the Company to incur additional impairment charges in the future. Because each inventory asset is unique, there are numerous inputs and assumptions used in our valuation techniques, including estimated average selling price, construction and development costs, absorption pace (reflecting any product mix change strategies implemented or to be implemented), selling strategies, alternative land uses (including disposition of all or a portion of the land owned), or discount rates, which could materially impact future cash flow and fair value estimates.
As of December 31, 2020, our projections generally assume a gradual improvement in market conditions. If communities are not recoverable based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets. The fair value of a community is estimated by discounting management’s cash flow projections using an appropriate risk-adjusted interest rate. As of December 31, 2020, we utilized discount rates ranging from 13% to 16% in our valuations. The discount rate used in determining each asset’s estimated fair value reflects the inherent risks associated with the related estimated cash flow stream, as well as current risk-free rates available in the market and estimated market risk premiums.
Our quarterly assessments reflect management’s best estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainties in management’s estimates and uncertainties related to our operations and our industry as a whole as further discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are unable to determine at this time if and to what extent continuing future impairments will occur. Additionally, due to the volume of possible outcomes that can be generated from changes in the various model inputs for each community, we do not believe it is possible to create a sensitivity analysis that can provide meaningful information for the users of our financial statements.
Warranty Reserves. We record warranty reserves to cover our exposure to the costs for materials and labor not expected to be covered by our subcontractors to the extent they relate to warranty-type claims. Warranty reserves are established by charging cost of sales and crediting a warranty reserve for each home delivered. The warranty reserves for the Company’s Home Builder’s Limited Warranty (“HBLW”) are established as a percentage of average sales price and adjusted based on historical payment patterns determined, generally, by geographic area and recent trends. Factors that are given consideration in determining the HBLW reserves include: (1) the historical range of amounts paid per average sales price on a home; (2) type and mix of amenity packages added to the home; (3) any warranty expenditures not considered to be normal and recurring; (4) timing of payments; (5) improvements in quality of construction expected to impact future warranty expenditures; and (6) conditions that may affect certain projects and require a different percentage of average sales price for those specific projects. Changes in estimates for warranties occur due to changes in the historical payment experience and differences between the actual payment pattern experienced during the period and the historical payment pattern used in our evaluation of the warranty reserve balance at the end of each quarter. Actual future warranty costs could differ from our current estimated amount.
Our warranty reserves for our 30-year (offered on all homes sold after April 25, 1998 and on or before December 1, 2015 in all of our markets except our Texas markets), 15-year (offered on all homes sold after December 1, 2015 in all of our markets except our Texas markets) and 10-year (offered on all homes sold in our Texas markets) transferable structural warranty programs are established on a per-unit basis. While the structural warranty reserve is recorded as each house is delivered, the sufficiency of the structural warranty per unit charge and total reserve is reevaluated on an annual basis, with the assistance of an actuary, using our own historical data and trends, industry-wide historical data and trends, and other project specific factors. The reserves are also evaluated quarterly and adjusted if we encounter activity that is inconsistent with the historical experience used in the annual analysis. These reserves are subject to variability due to uncertainties regarding structural defect claims for products we build, the markets in which we build, claim settlement history, insurance and legal interpretations, among other factors.
Our warranty reserve amounts are based upon historical experience and geographic location. While we believe that our warranty reserves are sufficient to cover our projected costs, there can be no assurances that historical data and trends will accurately predict our actual warranty costs. See Note 1 and Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our warranty reserves.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Overview
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we achieved record levels of new contracts, homes delivered, revenue and income before income taxes. We also achieved record levels of backlog sales value at December 31, 2020. Our improved profitability is attributable primarily to the increase in homes delivered, improved margins and overhead leverage. Additionally, our complementary financial services business also achieved record revenue and income before income taxes, and originated a record number of loans in 2020, while benefiting from a higher margin per loan throughout the year.
Following a substantial decline in new contracts in the latter half of March and April as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced a sharp recovery and an increase in sales activity commencing in May as pandemic-related restrictions began to ease. This trend of increasing sales volume continued through our third and fourth quarters, resulting in the Company achieving a record for new contracts in 2020, along with records in a number of other operating and financial metrics described below. We believe that the homebuilding industry benefited from record-low interest rates, a continued undersupply of available homes and a desire of many consumers to move from rental apartments and densely populated areas to single family homes in suburban locations. We believe these factors will continue to support demand into 2021, subject to the economic uncertainties caused by the continuing COVID-19 pandemic as well as higher unemployment levels.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we achieved the following record results in comparison to the year ended December 31, 2019:
•New contracts increased 39% to 9,427 contracts - a record high for our Company
•Homes delivered increased 22% to 7,709 homes - a record high for our Company
•Total sales value in backlog increased 74% to $1.84 billion - a year-end record for our Company
•Revenue increased 22% to $3.05 billion - a record high for our Company
•Income before income taxes increased 87% to $310.0 million - a record high for our Company
In addition to the record results described above, our number of homes in backlog increased 64%, and we achieved net income of $239.9 million in 2020, an 88% increase from the prior year. Our financial services operations also achieved record income before income taxes in 2020, benefiting from an increase in homes closed, the number of mortgages originated and higher margins, as well as technology enabled efficiencies. Our company-wide absorption pace of sales per community in 2020 improved to 3.7 per month compared to 2.6 per month in 2019. Partially as a result of this accelerated sales pace, we sold out of some communities earlier and our number of active communities declined to 202 at the end of 2020 from 225 at the end of 2019. We continued to place additional land under contract for communities that will be brought online in future periods, and controlled approximately 39,500 lots at December 31, 2020. Our ability to timely replace existing communities could further impact our number of active communities. We continue to work to open new communities, and we are also actively managing sales pace, in part by selectively increasing prices, to better match our availability of lots and production schedule.
Summary of Company Financial Results in 2020
The calculations of adjusted income before income taxes, adjusted net income, and adjusted housing gross margin, each of which is a non-GAAP measure, are described and reconciled to income before income taxes, net income, and housing gross margin, respectively, which represent the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, below under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”
Income before income taxes for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 increased 87% from $166.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $310.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Income before income taxes for 2020 was unfavorably impacted by asset impairment charges of $8.4 million and $0.9 million of stucco-related repair costs (as more fully discussed below and in Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). Income before income taxes for 2019 was unfavorably impacted by asset impairment charges of $5.0 million and $0.6 million of acquisition-related charges as a result of our acquisition of Pinnacle Homes in March 2018. Excluding these charges in both 2020 and 2019, adjusted income before income taxes increased 86% from $171.7 million in 2019 to $319.3 million in 2020.
In 2020, we achieved net income of $239.9 million, or $8.23 per diluted share, which includes the after-tax impact of both the asset impairment charges and stucco-related charges noted above ($0.22 and $0.02 per diluted share, respectively), compared to net income of $127.6 million, or $4.48 per diluted share in 2019, which includes the after-tax impact of both the asset impairment charges and the acquisition-related charges noted above ($0.13 and $0.02 per diluted share, respectively). Excluding these charges in both periods, adjusted net income increased 87% from $131.9 million ($4.63 per diluted share) in 2019 to $246.9 million ($8.47 per diluted share) in 2020. Our effective tax rate was 22.6% in 2020 compared to 23.2% in 2019.
In 2020, we recorded record total revenue of $3.05 billion, of which $2.94 billion was from homes delivered, $19.2 million was from land sales, and $87.0 million was from our financial services operations. Revenue from homes delivered increased 21% from 2019 driven primarily by the 1,413 additional homes delivered in 2020 (a 22% increase), offset, in part, by a 1% decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered ($3,000 per home delivered), which was primarily the result of the mix of homes delivered. Revenue from land sales decreased $5.4 million from 2019 due primarily to fewer land sales in the current year compared to the prior year. Revenue from our financial services segment increased 57% to $87.0 million in 2020 as a result of an increase in loans closed and sold during the year, in addition to higher margins on loans sold during the period compared to the prior year.
Total gross margin (total revenue less total land and housing costs) increased $186.9 million in 2020 compared to 2019 as a result of a $155.2 million improvement in the gross margin of our homebuilding operations (the sum of housing gross margin and land gross margin) and a $31.7 million improvement in the gross margin of our financial services operations. With respect to our homebuilding gross margin, our gross margin on homes delivered (housing gross margin) improved $154.7 million, due to the 22% increase in the number of homes delivered, offset partially by an increase of $3.4 million in asset impairment charges. Our housing gross margin percentage improved 210 basis points from 17.9% in the prior year to 20.0% in 2020. Exclusive of the asset impairment charges and stucco-related repair charges in 2020, and the asset impairment charges and acquisition-related charges in 2019, our adjusted housing gross margin percentage improved from 18.1% in 2019 to 20.3% in 2020 as a result of the mix of homes delivered during the period. Our gross margin on land sales (land gross margin) improved $0.5 million in 2020 compared to 2019 as a result of the mix of lots sold in the current year compared to the prior year. The gross margin of our financial services operations increased $31.7 million in 2020 compared to 2019 as a result of increases in the number of loan originations, in addition to higher margins on loans sold during the period, mainly due to a favorable pricing environment.
We opened 69 new communities during 2020. We sell a variety of home types in various communities and markets, each of which yields a different gross margin. The timing of the openings of new replacement communities as well as underlying lot costs varies from year to year. As a result, our new contracts and housing gross margin may fluctuate up or down from year to year depending on the mix of communities delivering homes. Due to the increase in demand that we have experienced since May 2020, we are selling through communities faster; therefore, our ability to replace existing communities timely could impact our ability to meet current demand and negatively impact recent growth trends in our number of active communities.
For 2020, selling, general and administrative expense increased $54.7 million, which partially offset the increase in our gross margin discussed above, but declined as a percentage of revenue to 11.7% in 2020 from 12.1% in 2019. Selling expense increased $25.1 million from 2019 and improved as a percentage of revenue to 5.9% in 2020 from 6.2% in 2019. Variable selling expense for sales commissions contributed $24.5 million to the increase due to the higher number of homes delivered during the period, and the remainder was attributable to an increase in non-variable selling expense. General and administrative expense increased $29.6 million compared to 2019 but declined as a percentage of revenue from 5.9% in 2019 to 5.8% in 2020. The dollar increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to a $15.2 million increase in compensation-related expenses due to our increased headcount and strong financial performance which led to higher incentive-based compensation, a $2.6 million increase in land-related expenses, a $2.4 million increase in costs associated with new information systems, a $1.4 million increase in corporate home office rent-related expenses, a $1.4 million increase in professional fees, a $1.2 million increase in COVID-19-related cleaning expenses, a $1.0 million increase in rent related to our division offices, a $0.8 million increase in advertising expenses, and a $3.6 million increase in miscellaneous expenses.
Outlook
We believe that new home sales will continue to benefit from record-low interest rates, a continued undersupply of available homes and consumer demographics, including a growing number of homebuyers moving from rental apartments and more densely populated areas to single family homes in suburban locations. However, we also expect that overall economic conditions in the United States will continue to be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent to which these matters will impact the U.S. economy and level of employment, capital markets, secondary mortgage markets, consumer confidence and availability of mortgage loans to homebuyers, and therefore our operational and financial performance, is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.
In addition, in the latter part of 2020, we experienced cost increases in certain construction materials, particularly lumber, and are actively managing and monitoring those costs. We have been able to raise home prices in many of our communities to offset these cost increases and preserve or increase our margins. During the second half of 2020, our ability to raise prices, together with cost management, enabled us to achieve a total gross margin percentage of 22.2% for 2020, an improvement of 260 basis points compared to 2019. We may experience future shortages in materials and labor as well as price increases for materials and labor and may not be able to maintain our current level of direct construction costs as a percentage of average sales price. We remain sensitive to changes in market conditions, and continue to focus on controlling overhead leverage and carefully managing our investment in land and land development spending.
Also due to strong overall housing demand, we have experienced periodic disruptions in our supply chain, including the availability of skilled labor and the timely availability of certain finishing products such as cabinets and appliances which have lengthened the production cycles in certain markets. In 2020, we were able to manage through these disruptions but we cannot predict whether any widespread supply chain disruptions will occur in 2021 or the extent to which any such disruptions will affect our business in 2021.
We are also closely monitoring mortgage availability and lending standards. Interest rates remain low, and the decline in mortgage availability and tightening of underwriting standards that we experienced in March 2020 have eased. This tightening did not significantly impact our business during 2020, but it did require us to adjust our deliveries of lower credit quality loans. We adjusted our pre-closing documentation timeframes based on Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and government agency recommendations.
We expect to continue to emphasize the following strategic business objectives in 2021:
•managing our land spend and inventory levels;
•accelerating the opening of new communities wherever possible;
•maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity levels;
•expanding the availability of our more affordable Smart Series homes; and
•emphasizing customer service, product quality and design, and premier locations.
During 2020, we invested $415.0 million in land acquisitions and $318.3 million in land development. We continue to closely review all of our land acquisition and land development spending and monitor our ongoing pace of home sales and deliveries, including any potential effects as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we will adjust our land and inventory home investment spend accordingly. As a result of the uncertainty of the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are not providing land spending estimates for 2021 at this time.
Due to the uncertainty of the current environment, and the unknown effects on the specific timing of opening and closing out communities, we are not providing estimated community count information for 2021 at this time. However, as a result of our accelerated pace of home sales, we are selling through communities at a faster pace, which will make it challenging to increase our number of active communities in 2021. We ended 2020 with approximately 39,500 lots under control, which represents a 5.1 year supply of lots based on 2020 homes delivered, including certain lots that we anticipate selling to third parties. This represents a 19% increase from our approximately 33,300 lots under control at the end of 2019. We opened 69 communities and closed 92 communities in 2020, ending the year with a total of 202 communities, compared to 225 at the end of 2019. Of our total communities at the end of 2020, 62 offered our more affordable Smart Series designs, which are primarily designed for first-time homebuyers.
We believe our ability to design and develop attractive homes in desirable locations at an affordable cost, and to grow our business while also leveraging our fixed costs, has enabled us to maintain and improve our strong financial results. We further believe that we are well positioned with a strong balance sheet to manage through the current economic environment.
See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further information regarding the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

A home is included in “new contracts” when our standard sales contract is executed. “Homes delivered” represents homes for which the closing of the sale has occurred. “Backlog” represents homes for which the standard sales contract has been executed, but which are not included in homes delivered because closings for these homes have not yet occurred as of the end of the period specified.
The composition of our homes delivered, new contracts, net and backlog is constantly changing and may be based on a dissimilar mix of communities between periods as new communities open and existing communities wind down. Further, home types and individual homes within a community can range significantly in price due to differing square footage, option selections, lot sizes and quality and location of lots. These variations may result in a lack of meaningful comparability between homes delivered, new contracts, net and backlog due to the changing mix between periods.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This report contains information about our adjusted housing gross margin, adjusted income before income taxes, and adjusted net income, each of which constitutes a non-GAAP financial measure. Because adjusted housing gross margin, adjusted income before income taxes, and adjusted net income are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, these financial measures may not be completely comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies in the homebuilding industry and, therefore, should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to operating performance and/or financial measures prescribed by GAAP. Rather, these non-GAAP financial measures should be used to supplement our GAAP results in order to provide a greater understanding of the factors and trends affecting our operations.
Adjusted housing gross margin, adjusted income before income taxes, and adjusted net income are calculated as follows:

(b)Represents asset impairment charges taken during the respective periods.
(c)Represents acquisition-related charges related to our acquisition of Pinnacle Homes in Detroit, Michigan on March 1, 2018 (as more fully discussed in Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).
(d)Represents costs which include, but are not limited to, legal fees and expenses, travel and communication expenses, cost of appraisals, accounting fees and expenses, and miscellaneous expenses related to our acquisition of Pinnacle Homes. As these costs are not eligible for capitalization as initial direct costs, such amounts are expensed as incurred.
We believe adjusted housing gross margin, adjusted income before income taxes, and adjusted net income are each relevant and useful financial measures to investors in evaluating our operating performance as they measure the gross profit, income before income taxes, and net income we generated specifically on our operations during a given period. These non-GAAP financial measures isolate the impact that the acquisition-related charges, stucco-related charges and impairment charges have on housing gross margins; the impact that the acquisition-related charges, acquisition and integration costs, stucco-related charges and impairment charges have on income before income taxes; and that the acquisition-related charges, acquisition and integration costs, stucco-related charges and impairment charges have on net income, and allow investors to make comparisons with our competitors that adjust housing gross margins, income before income taxes, and net income in a similar manner. We also believe investors will find these adjusted financial measures relevant and useful because they represent a profitability measure that may be compared to a prior period without regard to variability of the charges noted above. These financial measures assist us in making strategic decisions regarding community location and product mix, product pricing and construction pace.
Year Over Year Comparisons
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019
The calculation of adjusted housing gross margin (referred to below) is described and reconciled to housing gross margin, the financial measure that is calculated using our GAAP results, below under “Segment Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”
Northern Region. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, homebuilding revenue in our Northern region increased $229.1 million, from $1.0 billion in 2019 to $1.3 billion in 2020. This 22% increase in homebuilding revenue was the result of a 24% increase in the number of homes delivered (589 units), offset, in part, by a 1% decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered ($3,000 per home delivered) and a $3.1 million decrease in land sale revenue. Operating income in our Northern region increased $29.4 million, from $96.2 million in 2019 to $125.6 million in 2020. The increase in operating income was primarily the result of a $50.0 million increase in our gross margin, offset, in part, by a $20.7 million increase in selling, general, and administrative expense. With respect to our homebuilding gross margin, our housing gross margin improved $50.0 million, due to the 24% increase in the number of homes delivered noted above. Our housing gross margin percentage improved 70 basis points from 17.9% in 2019 to 18.6% in 2020. Our housing gross margin was unfavorably impacted in 2020 by $8.4 million of asset impairment charges, and in 2019 by $3.4 million of asset impairment charges and $0.6 million of acquisition-related charges as a result of our acquisition of Pinnacle Homes in March 2018. Exclusive of these charges in both years, our adjusted housing gross margin percentage in 2020 improved from 18.3% in 2019 to 19.3% in 2020 largely due to a change in product type and market mix of homes delivered compared to prior year and improved demand, offset, in part, by increased lot costs. Our land sale gross margin remained flat in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019.
Selling, general and administrative expense increased $20.7 million, from $86.6 million in 2019 to $107.3 million in 2020, and increased as a percentage of revenue to 8.5% in 2020 from 8.4% in 2019. The increase in selling, general and administrative expense was attributable, in part, to a $13.1 million increase in selling expense, due to (1) a $10.7 million increase in variable selling expenses resulting from increases in sales commissions produced by the higher number of homes delivered and (2) a $2.4 million increase in non-variable selling expenses primarily related to increased headcount and other costs associated with our sales offices and models. The increase in selling, general and administrative expense was also attributable to a $7.6 million increase in general and administrative expense, which was primarily related to a $3.1 million increase in compensation related expenses, a $2.1 million increase in land-related expenses, a $1.1 million increase in professional fees, and a $1.3 million increase in miscellaneous other expenses.
During 2020, we experienced a 39% increase in new contracts in our Northern region, from 2,695 in 2019 to 3,743 in 2020, and a 59% increase in backlog from 1,143 homes at December 31, 2019 to 1,815 homes at December 31, 2020. The increases in new contracts and backlog were attributable to (1) improved demand in our Smart Series communities compared to the prior year and (2) an increase in our average number of communities during the period. Average sales price in backlog increased to $436,000 at December 31, 2020 compared to $433,000 at December 31, 2019 which was primarily due to improved demand in our Northern Region in 2020 compared to prior year. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we opened 29 new communities in our Northern region compared to 28 during 2019. Our monthly absorption rate in our Northern region improved to 3.4 per community in 2020, compared to 2.5 per community in 2019.
Southern Region. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, homebuilding revenue in our Southern region increased $285.1 million, from $1.4 billion in 2019 to $1.7 billion in 2020. This 20% increase in homebuilding revenue was primarily the result of a 22% increase in the number of homes delivered (824 units), partially offset by a $2.3 million decrease in land sale revenue and a 1% decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered ($3,000 per home delivered). Operating income in our Southern region increased $87.5 million from $115.1 million in 2019 to $202.6 million in 2020. This increase in operating income was the result of a $105.2 million improvement in our gross margin, offset, in part, by a $17.7 million increase in selling, general, and administrative expense. With respect to our homebuilding gross margin, our housing gross margin improved $104.8 million, due primarily to the 22% increase in the number of homes delivered noted above and the $1.6 million decline in pre-tax impairment charges compared to prior year, partially offset by $0.9 million of stucco-related repair costs in certain of our Florida communities recorded in 2020 (as more fully described in Note 8). Our housing gross margin percentage improved 320 basis points from 17.9% in 2019 to 21.1% in 2020. Exclusive of the stucco-related repair charges in 2020 and the impairment charges in 2019, our adjusted housing gross margin percentage improved 310 basis points from 18.0% in 2019 to 21.1% in 2020 largely due to a change in product type and mix of homes delivered compared to prior year and improved demand in our Southern Region. Our land sale gross margin improved $0.4 million as a result of the mix of lots sold in the current year compared to the prior year.
Selling, general and administrative expense increased $17.8 million from $136.1 million in 2019 to $153.9 million in 2020 but declined as a percentage of revenue to 9.0% in 2020 from 9.6% in 2019. The increase in selling, general and administrative expense was attributable, in part, to a $12.0 million increase in selling expense due to a $13.9 million increase in variable selling expenses resulting from increases in sales commissions produced by the higher number of homes delivered, offset, in part, by a $1.9 million decrease in non-variable selling expenses primarily related to the timing of sales office and model openings and a reduction in marketing costs. The increase in selling, general and administrative expense was also attributable to a $5.8 million increase in general and administrative expense, which was primarily related to a $3.7 million increase in incentive compensation due to our improved performance, and a $2.1 million increase in land-related expenses.
During 2020, we experienced a 39% increase in new contracts in our Southern region, from 4,078 in 2019 to 5,684 in 2020, and a 68% increase in backlog from 1,528 homes at December 31, 2019 to 2,574 homes at December 31, 2020. The increases in new contracts and backlog were primarily due to changes in product type and market mix, along with improvement in demand across our Southern markets compared to prior year. Average sales price in backlog increased to $406,000 at December 31, 2020 from $368,000 at December 31, 2019 primarily due to a change in product type and market mix and improved demand in our Southern Region. During 2020, we opened 40 communities in our Southern region compared to 52 in 2019. Our monthly absorption rate in our Southern region improved to 3.9 per community in 2020 from 2.7 per community in 2019.
Financial Services. Revenue from our mortgage and title operations increased $31.7 million, or 57%, from $55.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 to a record $87.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 as a result of a 32% increase in the number of loan originations, from 4,476 in 2019 to 5,888 in 2020, and an increase in the average loan amount from $309,000 in 2019 to $313,000 in 2020. We also experienced higher margins on loans sold during the period compared to 2019. Revenue was reduced by a $0.2 million impairment charge on our mortgage servicing rights caused by the disruption in the mortgage industry as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. See Note 3 to our financial statements for further information.
Our financial service operations ended 2020 with a $26.0 million increase in operating income compared to 2019, which was primarily due to the increase in our revenue discussed above partially offset by a $5.6 million increase in selling, general and administrative expense compared to 2019. The increase in selling, general and administrative expense was attributable to an increase in compensation expense related to our increase in employee headcount and an increase in incentive compensation due to improved results.
At December 31, 2020, M/I Financial provided financing services in all of our markets. Approximately 85% of our homes delivered during 2020 were financed through M/I Financial, compared to 82% during 2019. Capture rate is influenced by financing availability and can fluctuate from quarter to quarter.
Corporate Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Corporate selling, general and administrative expense increased $10.7 million, from $51.6 million in 2019 to $62.3 million in 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $4.7 million increase in compensation expense due to improved results during the period, a $1.4 million increase in corporate home office rent-related expense, a $1.3 million increase related to costs associated with new information systems, a $0.9 million increase in charitable contributions, and a $2.4 million increase in other miscellaneous expenses.
Equity in income from joint venture arrangements. Equity in income from joint venture arrangements represents our portion of pre-tax earnings from our joint venture arrangements where a special purpose entity is established (“LLCs”) with the other partners. The Company earned $0.5 million and $0.3 million of equity in income from its LLCs during 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Interest Expense - Net. Interest expense for the Company decreased $11.7 million from $21.4 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 to $9.7 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in average borrowings under our Credit Facility during 2020 compared to prior year, the redemption of our 6.75% Senior Notes due 2021 (the “2021 Senior Notes”) at the beginning of the first quarter of 2020, and the issuance of our 2028 Senior Notes, which were not outstanding during 2019 and have a lower interest rate than the 2021 Senior Notes. Our weighted average borrowings decreased from $842.4 million in 2019 to $767.5 million in 2020, and our weighted average borrowing interest rate declined from 6.17% in 2019 to 5.53% in the 2020.
Income Taxes. Our overall effective tax rate was 22.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 23.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in the effective rate for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was primarily attributable to a $7.2 million tax benefit related to energy tax credits (see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information).
Segment Non-GAAP Financial Measures. This report contains information about our adjusted housing gross margin, which constitutes a non-GAAP financial measure. Because adjusted housing gross margin is not calculated in accordance with GAAP, this financial measure may not be completely comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies in the homebuilding industry and, therefore, should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to operating performance and/or financial measures prescribed by GAAP. Rather, this non-GAAP financial measure should be used to supplement our GAAP results in order to provide a greater understanding of the factors and trends affecting our operations.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Overview of Capital Resources and Liquidity
At December 31, 2020, we had $260.8 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, with $260.7 million of this amount comprised of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, which represents a $254.8 million increase in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents from December 31, 2019. Our principal uses of cash during 2020 were investment in land and land development, construction of homes, mortgage loan originations, investment in joint ventures, operating expenses, short-term working capital, debt service requirements, including the redemption of our 2021 Senior Notes and the repayment of amounts outstanding under our credit facilities, and the repurchase of $1.9 million of our outstanding common shares under our 2018 Share Repurchase Program (as defined below) during the first quarter of 2020. In order to fund these uses of cash, we used proceeds from home deliveries, the sale of mortgage loans and the sale of mortgage servicing rights, as well as excess cash balances, proceeds from the issuance of our 2028 Senior Notes (as described below), borrowings under our credit facilities, and other sources of liquidity.
The Company is a party to three primary credit agreements: (1) the Credit Facility, our $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility, with M/I Homes, Inc. as borrower and guaranteed by the Company’s wholly-owned homebuilding subsidiaries; (2) the MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement, our $125 million secured mortgage warehousing agreement (which increased to $160 million from September 25, 2020 to October 15, 2020 and to $185 million from November 15, 2020 to February 4, 2021), with M/I Financial as borrower; and (3) the MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility, our $90 million mortgage repurchase agreement, with M/I Financial as borrower.
In January 2020, we issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of our 2028 Senior Notes at par, for net proceeds of approximately $393.9 million. We used $300.4 million of the net proceeds to redeem all $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 2021 Senior Notes, at par, and we used the remaining net proceeds to repay a portion of our outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2020, there were no borrowings outstanding and $61.0 million of letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Facility, leaving $439.0 million in available borrowings.
We expect to continue managing our balance sheet and liquidity carefully in 2021 by managing our spending on land acquisition and development and construction of inventory homes, as well as overhead expenditures, relative to our ongoing volume of home deliveries, and we expect to meet our current and anticipated capital requirements in 2021 from cash receipts and availability under our Credit Facility, as well as excess cash balances.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we delivered 7,709 homes, started 8,611 homes, and spent $415.0 million on land purchases and $318.3 million on land development.
We are selectively acquiring and developing lots in our markets to replenish and increase our lot supply and will continue to monitor market conditions and our pace of home sales and deliveries and adjust our land spending accordingly. Pursuant to such land option agreements, as of December 31, 2020, we had a total of 22,710 lots under contract, with an aggregate purchase price of approximately $799.7 million, to be acquired during the period from 2021 through 2029.
Operating Cash Flow Activities. During 2020, we generated $168.3 million of cash from operating activities, compared to generating $65.6 million of cash in operating activities in 2019. The cash generated from operating activities in 2020 was primarily a result of net income of $239.9 million and a $128.7 million increase in accounts payable, customer deposits and other liabilities, offset partially by payments for mortgage loan originations which exceeded the proceeds from the sale of mortgage loans by $78.7 million and a $134.9 million increase in inventory. The cash provided by operating activities in 2019 was primarily a result of net income of $127.6 million and $12.1 million of proceeds from the sale of mortgage loans net of mortgage loan originations, offset partially by an $88.4 million increase in inventory and a $17.5 million decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities.
Investing Cash Flow Activities. During 2020, we used $33.9 million of cash in investing activities, compared to using $27.6 million of cash in investing activities during 2019. This $6.3 million increase in cash usage was primarily due to a $7.2 million increase in purchases of property and equipment during the period compared to prior year, offset partially by $3.9 million in proceeds from the sale of a portion of our mortgage servicing rights during the fourth quarter of 2020.
Financing Cash Flow Activities. During 2020, we generated $120.3 million of cash from our financing activities, compared to using $53.5 million of cash during 2019. The cash generated from financing activities in 2020 was primarily due to the issuance of our 2028 Senior Notes, net of debt issuance costs, for $391.5 million and increased borrowings under our two M/I Financial credit facilities of $88.7 million, offset partially by the redemption of all $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 2021 Senior Notes, and repayments of $66.0 million (net of proceeds from borrowings) under our Credit Facility during 2020.
On August 14, 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program (the “2018 Share Repurchase Program”) pursuant to which the Company may purchase up to $50 million of its outstanding common shares (see Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). During 2020, the Company repurchased 0.1 million common shares with an aggregate purchase price of $1.9 million which was funded with cash on hand and borrowings under our Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2020, the Company is authorized to repurchase an additional $17.2 million of outstanding common shares under the 2018 Share Repurchase Program.
At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, our ratio of homebuilding debt to capital was 34% and 38%, respectively, calculated as the carrying value of our outstanding homebuilding debt (which consists of borrowings under our Credit Facility, our 2028 Senior Notes, our 2025 Senior Notes, and Notes Payable-Other) divided by the sum of the carrying value of our outstanding homebuilding debt plus shareholders' equity. We believe that this ratio provides useful information for understanding our financial position and the leverage employed in our operations, and for comparing us with other homebuilders.
We fund our operations with cash flows from operating activities, including proceeds from home deliveries, land sales and the sale of mortgage loans. We believe that these sources of cash, along with our balance of unrestricted cash and borrowings available under our credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund our currently anticipated working capital needs, investment in land and land development, construction of homes, operating expenses, planned capital spending, and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months. In addition, we routinely monitor current and anticipated operational and debt service requirements, financial market conditions, and credit relationships and we may choose to seek additional capital by issuing new debt and/or equity securities or engaging in other financial transactions to strengthen our liquidity or our long-term capital structure. The financing needs of our homebuilding and financial services operations depend on anticipated sales volume in the current year as well as future years, inventory levels and related turnover, forecasted land and lot purchases, debt maturity dates, and other factors. If we seek such additional capital or engage in such other financial transactions, there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain such additional capital or consummate such other financial transactions on terms acceptable to us, if at all, and such additional equity or debt financing or other financial transactions could dilute the interests of our existing shareholders, add operational limitations and/or increase our interest costs.
Included in the table below is a summary of our available sources of cash from the Credit Facility, the MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement and the MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility as of December 31, 2020:
(In thousands) Expiration

Amount
Notes payable - homebuilding (a)
(a) $ - $ 439,015
Notes payable - financial services (b)
(b) $ 225,634 $ 1,670
(a)The available amount under the Credit Facility is computed in accordance with the borrowing base calculation under the Credit Facility, which applies various advance rates for different categories of inventory and totaled $926.9 million of availability for additional senior debt at December 31, 2020. As a result, the full $500 million commitment amount of the facility was available, less any borrowings and letters of credit outstanding. There were no borrowings outstanding and $61.0 million of letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2020, leaving $439.0 million available. The Credit Facility has an expiration date of July 18, 2023 for $475.0 million of commitments and July 18, 2021 for $25.0 million of commitments.
(b)The available amount is computed in accordance with the borrowing base calculations under the MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement and the MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility, each of which may be increased by pledging additional mortgage collateral. The maximum aggregate commitment amount of M/I Financial's warehousing agreements as of December 31, 2020 was $275 million, which included a temporary increase for the MIF Mortgage Warehouse Agreement applicable through February 4, 2021 (as described below) at which time the maximum aggregate commitment amount under the two agreements reverted to $215 million. The MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement has an expiration date of May 28, 2021 and the MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility has an expiration date of October 25, 2021.
Notes Payable - Homebuilding.
Homebuilding Credit Facility. The Credit Facility provides for an aggregate commitment amount of $500 million, and also includes an accordion feature pursuant to which the maximum borrowing availability may be increased to an aggregate of $600 million, subject to obtaining additional commitments from lenders. The Credit Facility matures on July 18, 2023 for $475.0 million of commitments and July 18, 2021 for $25.0 million of commitments. Interest on amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility is payable at a rate which is adjusted daily and is equal to the sum of one-month LIBOR (subject to a floor of 0.75%) plus a margin of 250 basis points (subject to adjustment in subsequent quarterly periods based on the Company’s leverage ratio).
Borrowings under the Credit Facility constitute senior, unsecured indebtedness and availability is subject to, among other things, a borrowing base calculated using various advance rates for different categories of inventory. The Credit Facility also provides for a $125 million sub-facility for letters of credit. The Credit Facility contains various representations, warranties and covenants which require, among other things, that the Company maintain (1) a minimum level of Consolidated Tangible Net Worth of $813.4 million at December 31, 2020 (subject to increase over time based on earnings and proceeds from equity offerings), (2) a leverage ratio not in excess of 60%, and (3) either a minimum Interest Coverage Ratio of 1.5 to 1.0 or a minimum amount of available liquidity. In addition, the Credit Facility contains covenants that limit the Company’s number of unsold housing units and model homes, as well as the amount of Investments in Unrestricted Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures (each as defined in the Credit Facility).
The Company’s obligations under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by all of the Company’s subsidiaries, with the exception of subsidiaries that are primarily engaged in the business of mortgage financing, title insurance or similar financial businesses relating to the homebuilding and home sales business, certain subsidiaries that are not 100%-owned by the Company or another subsidiary, and other subsidiaries designated by the Company as Unrestricted Subsidiaries, subject to limitations on the aggregate amount invested in such Unrestricted Subsidiaries. The guarantors for the Credit Facility are the same subsidiaries that guarantee our 2028 Senior Notes and our 2025 Senior Notes.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all covenants of the Credit Facility, including financial covenants. The following table summarizes the most significant restrictive covenant thresholds under the Credit Facility and our compliance with such covenants as of December 31, 2020:

Notes Payable - Financial Services.
MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement. The MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement is used to finance eligible residential mortgage loans originated by M/I Financial. The MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement provides a maximum borrowing availability of $125 million, which increased to $160 million from September 25, 2020 to October 15, 2020 and increased to $185 million from November 15, 2020 to February 4, 2021, which were periods of expected increases in the volume of mortgage originations. The MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement expires on May 28, 2021. Interest on amounts borrowed under the MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement is payable at a per annum rate equal to the one-month LIBOR rate (subject to a floor of 1.0%) plus a spread of 200 basis points.
As is typical for similar credit facilities in the mortgage origination industry, at closing, the expiration of the MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement was set at approximately one year and is under consideration for extension annually by the participating lenders. We expect to extend the MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement on or prior to the current expiration date of May 28, 2021, but we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to obtain such an extension.
The MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement is secured by certain mortgage loans originated by M/I Financial that are being “warehoused” prior to their sale to investors. The MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement provides for limits with respect to certain loan types that can secure outstanding borrowings. There are currently no guarantors of the MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement.
As of December 31, 2020, there was $168.1 million outstanding under the MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement and M/I Financial was in compliance with all covenants thereunder. The financial covenants, as more fully described and defined in the MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement, are summarized in the following table, which also sets forth M/I Financial’s compliance with such covenants as of December 31, 2020:
Financial Covenant Covenant Requirement Actual
(Dollars in millions)
Leverage Ratio ≤ 10.0 to 1.0 6.9 to 1.0
Liquidity ≥ $ 6.3 $ 34.6
Adjusted Net Income > $ 0.0 $ 31.6
Tangible Net Worth ≥ $ 12.5 $ 37.2
MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility. The MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility is used to finance eligible residential mortgage loans originated by M/I Financial and is structured as a mortgage repurchase facility. The MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility provides for a maximum borrowing availability of $90 million. The MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility expires on October 25, 2021. As is typical for similar credit facilities in the mortgage origination industry, at closing, the expiration of the MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility was set at approximately one year, and is under consideration for extension annually by the participating lender.
M/I Financial pays interest on each advance under the MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility at a per annum rate equal to the one-month LIBOR rate (subject to a floor of 1.0%) plus 175 or 200 basis points depending on the loan type. The covenants in the MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility are substantially similar to the covenants in the MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement. The MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility provides for limits with respect to certain loan types that can secure outstanding borrowings, which are substantially similar to the restrictions in the MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement. There are no guarantors of the MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility. As of December 31, 2020, there was $57.5 million outstanding under the MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility. M/I Financial was in compliance with all financial covenants under the MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility as of December 31, 2020.
Senior Notes.
4.95% Senior Notes. On January 22, 2020, the Company issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2028 Senior Notes. The 2028 Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.95% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year, and mature on February 1, 2028. The 2028 Senior Notes contain covenants substantially similar to the covenants described below for the 2025 Senior Notes, and as more fully described and defined in the indenture governing the 2028 Senior Notes. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2028 Senior Notes to redeem all of its outstanding 2021 Senior Notes at 100.000% of the principal amount outstanding on January 22, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all terms, conditions, and covenants under the indenture. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the 2028 Senior Notes.
5.625% Senior Notes. In August 2017, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2025 Senior Notes. The 2025 Senior Notes contain certain covenants, as more fully described and defined in the indenture governing the 2025 Senior Notes, which limit the ability of the Company and the restricted subsidiaries to, among other things: incur additional indebtedness; make certain payments, including dividends, or repurchase any shares, in an aggregate amount exceeding our “restricted payments basket”; make certain investments; and create or incur certain liens, consolidate or merge with or into other companies, or liquidate or sell or transfer all or substantially all of our assets. These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions and qualifications as described in the indenture governing the 2025 Senior Notes. As of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all terms, conditions, and covenants under the indenture. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the 2025 Senior Notes.
Supplemental Financial Information.
As of December 31, 2020, M/I Homes, Inc. had $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 2028 Senior Notes and $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 2025 Senior Notes outstanding.
The 2028 Senior Notes and the 2025 Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by all of M/I Homes, Inc.’s subsidiaries (the “Subsidiary Guarantors”) with the exception of subsidiaries that are primarily engaged in the business of mortgage financing, title insurance or similar financial businesses relating to the homebuilding and home sales business, certain subsidiaries that are not 100%-owned by M/I Homes, Inc. or another subsidiary, and other subsidiaries designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the indentures governing the 2028 Senior Notes and the 2025 Senior Notes), subject to limitations on the aggregate amount invested in such Unrestricted Subsidiaries in accordance with the terms of the Credit Facility and the indentures governing the 2028 Senior Notes and the 2025 Senior Notes (the “Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries”). The Subsidiary Guarantors of the 2028 Senior Notes, the 2025 Senior Notes and the Credit Facility are the same and are listed on Exhibit 22 to this Form 10-K.
Each Subsidiary Guarantor is a direct or indirect 100%-owned subsidiary of M/I Homes, Inc. The guarantees are senior unsecured obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor. The guarantees are effectively subordinated to any existing and future secured indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor with respect to any assets comprising security or collateral for such indebtedness.
The guarantees are “full and unconditional,” as those terms are used in Regulation S-X, Rule 3-10(b)(3), except that the indentures governing the 2028 Senior Notes and the 2025 Senior Notes provide that a Subsidiary Guarantor’s guarantee will be released if: (1) all of the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor have been sold or otherwise disposed of in a transaction in compliance with the terms of the applicable indenture; (2) all of the Equity Interests (as defined in the applicable indenture) held by M/I Homes, Inc. and the Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the applicable Indenture) of such Subsidiary Guarantor have been sold or otherwise disposed of to any person other than M/I Homes, Inc. or a Restricted Subsidiary in a transaction in compliance with the terms of the applicable indenture; (3) the Subsidiary Guarantor is designated an Unrestricted Subsidiary (or otherwise ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary (including by way of liquidation or merger)) in compliance with the terms of the
applicable indenture; (4) M/I Homes, Inc. exercises its legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option under the applicable indenture; or (5) all obligations under the applicable indenture are discharged in accordance with the terms of the applicable indenture.
The enforceability of the obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors under their guarantees may be subject to review under applicable federal or state laws relating to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference and similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally. In certain circumstances, a court could void the guarantees, subordinate amounts owing under the guarantees or order other relief detrimental to the holders of the 2028 Senior Notes and the 2025 Senior Notes.
The following tables present summarized financial information on a combined basis for M/I Homes, Inc. and the Subsidiary Guarantors. Transactions between M/I Homes, Inc. and the Subsidiary Guarantors have been eliminated and the summarized financial information does not reflect M/I Homes, Inc.’s or the Subsidiary Guarantors’ investment in, and equity in earnings from, the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries.

Weighted Average Borrowings. In 2020 and 2019, our weighted average borrowings outstanding were $767.5 million and $842.4 million, respectively, with a weighted average interest rate of 5.53% and 6.17%, respectively. The decrease in our weighted average borrowings and our weighted average interest rate related to decreased borrowings under our Credit Facility in 2020 compared to 2019, as well as the issuance of our 2028 Senior Notes on January 22, 2020, which have a lower interest rate than our 2021 Senior Notes which were redeemed on January 22, 2020.
At December 31, 2020, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility, a decrease from $66.0 million of outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2019. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the company used the Credit Facility for investment in land and land development, construction of homes, operating expenses, working capital requirements and share repurchases under our 2018 Share Repurchase Program. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the average daily amount outstanding under the Credit Facility was $17.3 million and the maximum amount outstanding under the Credit Facility was $111.3 million. Based on our currently anticipated spending on home construction, overhead expenses, and land acquisition and development in 2021, offset by expected cash receipts from home deliveries and other sources, we may borrow under the Credit Facility during 2021, but do not expect the peak amount outstanding to exceed $100 million. The actual amount borrowed in 2021 (and the estimated peak amount outstanding) and the related timing will be subject to numerous factors, which are subject to significant variation as a result of the timing and amount of land and house construction expenditures, payroll and other general and administrative expenses, and cash receipts from home deliveries. The amount borrowed will also be impacted by other cash receipts and payments, any capital markets transactions or other additional financings by the Company, any repayments or redemptions of outstanding debt, any additional share repurchases under the 2018 Share Repurchase Program and any other extraordinary events or transactions, including the uncertain effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company may also experience significant variation in cash and Credit Facility balances from week to week due to the timing of such receipts and payments.
There were $61.0 million of letters of credit issued and outstanding under the Credit Facility at December 31, 2020. During 2020, the average daily amount of letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Facility was $66.9 million and the maximum amount of letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Facility was $69.9 million.
At December 31, 2020, M/I Financial had $168.1 million outstanding under the MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement. During 2020, the average daily amount outstanding under the MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement was $37.4 million and the maximum amount outstanding was $168.1 million, which occurred during December, while the temporary increase provision was in effect and the maximum borrowing availability was $185.0 million.
At December 31, 2020, M/I Financial had $57.5 million outstanding under the MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility. During 2020, the average daily amount outstanding under the MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility was $39.2 million and the maximum amount outstanding was $69.8 million, which occurred during December.
Universal Shelf Registration. In June 2019, the Company filed a $400 million universal shelf registration statement with the SEC, which registration statement became effective upon filing and will expire in June 2022. Pursuant to the registration statement, the Company may, from time to time, offer debt securities, common shares, preferred shares, depositary shares, warrants to purchase debt securities, common shares, preferred shares, depositary shares or units of two or more of those securities, rights to purchase debt securities, common shares, preferred shares or depositary shares, stock purchase contracts and units. The timing and amount of offerings, if any, will depend on market and general business conditions.

(a)At December 31, 2020, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility. Interest on amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility is payable at a rate which is adjusted daily and is equal to the sum of the one month LIBOR rate (subject to a floor of 0.75%) plus a margin of 250 basis points. The margin is subject to adjustment in subsequent quarterly periods based on the Company’s leverage ratio. Interest payments by period will be based upon the outstanding borrowings and the applicable interest rate(s) in effect. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
(b)Borrowings under the MIF Mortgage Warehousing Agreement are at the one-month LIBOR rate (subject to a floor of 1.0%) plus a spread of 200 basis points. Borrowings under the MIF Mortgage Repurchase Facility are at the one-month LIBOR rate (subject to a floor of 1.0%) plus 175 or 200 basis points, depending on the loan type. Total borrowings outstanding under both agreements at December 31, 2020 had a weighted average interest rate of 3.0%. Interest payments by period will be based upon the outstanding borrowings and the applicable interest rate(s) in effect.
(c)The Company is party to certain land purchase agreements in which the Company has specific performance requirements. The future amounts payable related to these land purchase agreements is the number of lots the Company is obligated to purchase at the lot price set forth in the agreement. In addition, the amount of deposits and prepaid acquisition and development costs on certain land purchase agreements have exceeded thresholds relative to the remaining purchase price of the lots for those agreements, such that the remaining purchase price of the lots is recorded as an Obligation for consolidated inventory not owned on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In each case, the time period in which these payments will be made is the Company’s best estimate of when these lots will be purchased.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
Reference is made to Notes 6, 7, and 8 in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These Notes discuss our off-balance sheet arrangements with respect to land acquisition contracts and option agreements, and land development joint ventures, including the nature and amounts of financial obligations relating to these items. In addition, these Notes discuss the nature and amounts of certain types of commitments that arise in the ordinary course of our land development and homebuilding operations, including commitments of land development joint ventures for which we might be obligated.
Our off-balance sheet arrangements relating to our homebuilding operations include joint venture arrangements, land option agreements, guarantees and indemnifications associated with acquiring and developing land, and the issuance of letters of credit
and completion bonds. Our use of these arrangements is for the purpose of securing the most desirable lots on which to build homes for our homebuyers in a manner that we believe reduces the overall risk to the Company. Additionally, in the ordinary course of its business, M/I Financial issues guarantees and indemnities relating to the sale of loans to third parties.
INTEREST RATES AND INFLATION
Our business is significantly affected by general economic conditions within the United States and, particularly, by the impact of interest rates and inflation. Inflation can have a long-term impact on us because increasing costs of land, materials and labor can result in a need to increase the sales prices of homes. In addition, inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates, which can have a negative impact on housing demand and the costs of financing land development activities and housing construction. Higher interest rates also may decrease our potential market by making it more difficult for homebuyers to qualify for mortgages or to obtain mortgages at interest rates that are acceptable to them. The impact of increased rates can be offset, in part, by offering variable rate loans with lower interest rates. In conjunction with our mortgage financing services, hedging methods are used to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations between the commitment date of the loan and the time the loan closes. Rising interest rates, as well as increased materials and labor costs, may reduce gross margins. An increase in material and labor costs is particularly a problem during a period of declining home prices. Conversely, deflation can impact the value of real estate and make it difficult for us to recover our land costs. Therefore, either inflation or deflation could adversely impact our future results of operations.
