ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
Overview
Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relates to Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership.
Ferrellgas Partners is a holding entity that conducts no operations and has two direct subsidiaries, Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp. and the operating partnership. Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp. and Ferrellgas Finance Corp. have nominal assets, do not conduct any operations and have no employees other than officers. Our activities are primarily conducted through the operating partnership. Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp. has served as co-issuer and co-obligor for debt securities of Ferrellgas Partners, while Ferrellgas Finance Corp., a subsidiary of the operating partnership, serves as co-issuer and co-obligor for debt securities of the operating partnership. Accordingly, and due to the reduced disclosure format, a discussion of the results of operations, liquidity and capital resources of Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp. and Ferrellgas Finance Corp. is not presented in this section.
The following is a discussion of our historical financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our audited historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The discussions set forth in the “Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” sections generally refer to Ferrellgas Partners and its consolidated subsidiaries. However, in these discussions there exists two material differences between Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership:
● Ferrellgas Partners had outstanding $357.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Ferrellgas Partners Notes and, accordingly, had interest expense that the operating partnership did not have. On the Effective Date, by operation of the Plan, the Ferrellgas Partners Notes were discharged and cancelled.
● Ferrellgas Partners entered into a term loan credit agreement with the operating partnership, pursuant to which the operating partnership extended to Ferrellgas Partners an unsecured, non-amortizing term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $19.9 million. The term loan bears interest at a rate of 20% per annum, and all interest on the term loan will be added to the outstanding principal amount of the term loan. The term loan will mature on July 1, 2022. During July 2021, Ferrellgas Partners made an optional prepayment of $9.0 million principal amount of the term loan, and the outstanding principal and accrued interest at July 31, 2021 was $13.1 million. As of July 31, 2021, the operating partnership had additional intercompany receivables from Ferrellgas Partners not related to the term loan totaling $3.9 million.
Recent Developments
COVID-19
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has been declared by the World Health Organization as a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern,” continues to impact the economy of the United States and other countries around the world. COVID-19 poses the risk that we or our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers and other business partners may be prevented from or limited in conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time. The outbreak of COVID-19 has already resulted in significant governmental measures being implemented to control the spread of the virus, including quarantines, travel restrictions, manufacturing restrictions, declarations of national emergency and states of emergency, business shutdowns and restrictions on the movement of people throughout the United States and the world. While some of our business operations and support systems are deemed essential in many jurisdictions, we are continuing to assess the impact that COVID-19 may have on our results of operations and financial condition and cannot at this time accurately predict what effects these conditions will have on our operations and sales due to uncertainties relating to the ultimate geographic spread of the virus, the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak and the length of the travel restrictions and business closures imposed by governments in different jurisdictions. Additionally, initiatives we have implemented or may implement to slow and/or reduce the impact of COVID-19, such as using staggered start times for drivers, may increase our operating expenses and reduce the efficiency of our operations.
Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Cases
As previously reported on January 11, 2021, Ferrellgas Partners and Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp. filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the “Bankruptcy Court”). The chapter 11 cases were jointly administered under the caption and case numbers, In re: Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. and Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp., Chapter 11 Case Nos. 21-10020 and 21-10021.
On March 5, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order (the “Confirmation Order”) confirming the Second Amended Prepackaged Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. and Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp. (the “Plan”).
On March 30, 2021 (the “Effective Date”), the conditions to effectiveness of the Plan were satisfied and the Confirmation Order was deemed binding upon Ferrellgas Partners, Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp. and all other parties affected by the Plan. In satisfying the conditions of the Plan, on the Effective Date, certain restructuring transactions by Ferrellgas Partners and certain financing transactions by the operating partnership were completed, as further described under “-Transactions” below.
Ferrellgas has accounted for the effects of the reorganization and determined that fresh-start accounting does not need to be applied, as a change in control did not occur.
Transactions
Satisfaction of Ferrellgas Partners Notes; Issuance of Class B Units to Holders of Ferrellgas Partners Notes
On the Effective Date, by operation of the Plan, all outstanding indebtedness (including accrued interest) of Ferrellgas Partners and Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp. under their $357.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Ferrellgas Partners Notes were discharged and cancelled.
Pursuant to the Plan, Ferrellgas Partners issued an aggregate of 1.3 million Class B Units to holders of the Ferrellgas Partners Notes in satisfaction of their claims in respect of the Ferrellgas Partners Notes. For additional discussion, see Note K - Equity in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.
Issuance of Preferred Units of the Operating Partnership
On the Effective Date, the operating partnership and the general partner (in its capacity as the general partner of operating partnership) entered into an Investment Agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) with certain purchasers named therein, pursuant to which, on the Effective Date, the operating partnership issued and sold to such purchasers an aggregate of 700,000 Senior Preferred Units, having an aggregate initial liquidation preference of $700.0 million. The purchase price per Preferred Unit was $1,000 less a 3.0% purchase price discount, for an aggregate purchase price of $679.0 million.
The operating partnership received net proceeds from the issuance and sale of the Preferred Units of approximately $651.3 million, after deducting the purchase price discount and certain expenses. The operating partnership used such net proceeds, together with the net proceeds of the issuance and sale of the OpCo Notes (as defined and described below) and cash on hand, (i) to redeem (or satisfy and discharge and subsequently redeem) all of the operating partnership’s previously issued and outstanding senior notes, as described below, and (ii) to repay all outstanding obligations under the operating partnership’s then-existing accounts receivable securitization facility in connection with the termination of that facility, as described below. For additional discussion, see Note J - Preferred units in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.
Issuance of Senior Unsecured Notes of the Operating Partnership
On the Effective Date, two wholly-owned subsidiaries of the operating partnership (the “Escrow Issuers”) issued $650.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.375% senior notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) and $825.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% senior notes due 2029 (the “2029 Notes” and, together with the 2026 Notes, the “OpCo Notes”), in each case, at an offering price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof. On the Effective Date and immediately after the issuance of the 2026 Notes and the 2029 Notes by the Escrow Issuers, (i) the Escrow Issuers were merged into the operating partnership and Ferrellgas Finance Corp., respectively, and the operating partnership and Ferrellgas Finance Corp. assumed the obligations of the Escrow Issuers as co-issuers of the 2026 Notes and the 2029 Notes, and (ii) the general partner and certain subsidiaries of the operating partnership guaranteed the 2026 Notes and the 2029 Notes.
The operating partnership received aggregate net proceeds from the issuance and sale of the 2026 Notes and the 2029 Notes of approximately $1,441.2 million, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discount and offering expenses. The operating partnership used such net proceeds, together with the net proceeds of the issuance and sale of the Preferred Units and cash on hand, (i) to redeem (or satisfy and discharge the indentures governing and subsequently redeem) all of the operating partnership’s previously issued and outstanding senior notes, as described below, and (ii) to repay all outstanding obligations under the operating partnership’s then-existing accounts receivable securitization facility in connection with the termination of that facility, as described below. For additional discussion, see Note I - Debt in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.
Redemption of Previously Issued Senior Notes of the Operating Partnership
Prior to the Effective Date, the operating partnership delivered notices of redemption of all its previously issued and outstanding 10.00% senior secured notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes”), 6.50% senior unsecured notes due 2021 (the “2021 Notes”), 6.75% senior unsecured notes due 2022 (the “2022 Notes”) and 6.75% senior unsecured notes due 2023 (the “2023 Notes”), in the aggregate combined principal amount for all such notes of $2,175.0 million, pursuant the terms of the indentures governing those notes, with a redemption date of March 30, 2021 for the 2025 Notes and April 5, 2021 for the 2021 Notes, the 2022 Notes and the 2023 Notes.
On the Effective Date, the operating partnership redeemed all of the issued and outstanding 2025 Notes. Also on the Effective Date, the operating partnership (i) satisfied and discharged the indentures governing the 2021 Notes, the 2022 Notes and the 2023 Notes by irrevocably depositing with the applicable trustees under such indentures funds in an amount sufficient to pay the redemption price for all of such notes on April 5, 2021 and (ii) delivered irrevocable instructions directing the applicable trustees to apply such funds to the redemption of such notes on April 5, 2021. As a result, as of the Effective Date, the indentures governing the 2021 Notes, the 2022 Notes and the 2023 Notes ceased to be of further effect (except as to certain expressly surviving rights), and all of the issued and outstanding 2021 Notes, 2022 Notes and 2023 Notes were redeemed on April 5, 2021.
The aggregate redemption price for the 2021 Notes, the 2022 Notes, the 2023 Notes and the 2025 Notes was approximately $2,320.9 million, consisting of principal, redemption premium (in the case of the 2023 Notes and the 2025 Notes) and accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable redemption date. For additional discussion, see Note I - Debt in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.

For additional discussion, see Note I - Debt in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.
Termination of Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility
On the Effective Date, the operating partnership and its receivables subsidiary repaid all of the outstanding obligations and fees under the then-existing accounts receivable securitization facility and terminated that facility. For additional discussion, see Note G - Accounts and notes receivable, net in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.
Amended Partnership Agreements of Ferrellgas Partners and the Operating Partnership
On the Effective Date, the general partner executed the Sixth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. (the “Amended Ferrellgas Partners LPA”), which amended and restated in its entirety the Fifth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. Among other matters, the Amended Ferrellgas Partners LPA provided for the restructuring of Ferrellgas Partners in accordance with the Plan, including (i) effecting a reverse unit split of Ferrellgas Partners’ then-outstanding common units pursuant to which the holders of the common units received one Class A Unit for every twenty common units held, and (ii) providing for the issuance of Class B Units to the holders of the Ferrellgas Partners Notes in exchange for such holders’ contribution of the Ferrellgas Partners Notes as a capital contribution to Ferrellgas Partners and in satisfaction of such holders’ claims in respect of the Ferrellgas Partners Notes.

Also on the Effective Date, the general partner executed (i) the Fifth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Ferrellgas, L.P. (the “Amended OpCo LPA”), which amended and restated in its entirety the Fourth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Ferrellgas L.P., and (ii) a First Amendment to the Amended OpCo LPA (the “OpCo LPA Amendment”), which sets forth the preferences, rights, privileges and other terms of the Preferred Units.
Termination of Bridger Agreement with Jamex Marketing, LLC
In connection with the closing of our acquisition of Bridger in June 2015, Bridger entered into a ten-year transportation and logistics agreement (the “Jamex TLA”) with Jamex Marketing, LLC (“Jamex”) pursuant to which Jamex would be responsible for certain payments to Bridger and also for sourcing crude oil volumes for Bridger’s largest customer at that time. On September 1, 2016, Bridger, Jamex, Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. and certain other affiliated parties entered into a group of agreements that terminated the Jamex TLA, as summarized below.
On September 1, 2016, we entered into a Secured Promissory Note with Jamex (the “Jamex Secured Promissory Note”) pursuant to which Jamex agreed to pay us a principal amount of $49.5 million plus interest, which principal amount was due over time pursuant to an amortization schedule and with a final maturity date of December 17, 2021. Jamex’s obligations under the Jamex Secured Promissory Note were fully guaranteed by certain subsidiaries and affiliates of Jamex, and were partially guaranteed (up to a maximum of $20 million) by James Ballengee, the individual owner of Jamex, and another entity owned by Mr. Ballengee. The Jamex Secured Promissory Note obligations of Jamex and those other fully guaranteeing entities were secured by certain assets owned by those entities, actively traded marketable securities and cash, which were held in a controlled account and were subject to seizure by us in the event of default. The operating partnership also agreed to provide Jamex with a $5.0 million revolving secured working capital facility evidenced by a revolving promissory note (the “Jamex Revolving Promissory Note”).
On June 25, 2018, Ferrellgas and Mr. Ballengee entered into an Omnibus Agreement (the “Omnibus Agreement”) that, among other things, terminated and cancelled the Jamex Secured Promissory Note, the joint guarantee, and the Jamex Revolving Promissory Note. In connection with the termination and cancellation of such agreements, (1) Mr. Ballengee and Jamex paid Ferrellgas $16.3 million towards the remaining balance due under the Jamex Secured Promissory Note and Mr. Ballengee executed a new unsecured promissory note in favor of the operating partnership with an original principal amount of $18.3 million (the “Revised Jamex Promissory Note”), (2) Bacchus, a company controlled by Mr. Ballengee, executed a guaranty agreement to guarantee Mr. Ballengee’s obligations under the Revised Jamex Promissory Note, (3) Ferrellgas agreed to dismiss without prejudice certain indemnification claims against Jamex and any affiliates of Jamex related to the Eddystone litigation and to toll the statute of limitations with respect thereto, and to dismiss with prejudice the tortious interference claim asserted by Ferrellgas against Mr. Ballengee related to the Eddystone litigation, and (4) Mr. Ballengee agreed to dismiss with prejudice, or cause to be dismissed, all counterclaims by him or his affiliates, as the case may be, with respect to such actions.
On July 1, 2020, Mr. Ballengee defaulted on the Revised Jamex Promissory Note by failing to make the first payment in the amount of $2.5 million. As a result, as of July 31, 2020, Ferrellgas recorded a bad debt reserve against $17.3 million of the Revised Jamex Promissory Note and is pursuing collections from Mr. Ballengee.
On January 27, 2021 we reached an agreement with Mr. Ballengee pursuant to which he would execute an additional promissory note for $2.5 million secured by his assets, separate from the Revised Jamex Promissory Note, and pay $1.5 million in cash to us. The $1.5 million cash payment was received on February 1, 2021. In light of these developments, we released $0.5 million of reserve in our second fiscal quarter. We deemed it appropriate to keep the $2.5 million additional promissory note fully reserved.
How We Evaluate Our Operations
We evaluate our overall business performance based primarily on a metric we refer to as “Adjusted EBITDA”, which is not defined by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to earnings measures defined by GAAP. We do not utilize depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in our key measures because we focus our performance management on cash flow generation and our revenue generating assets have long useful lives. For the definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss attributable to Ferrellgas Partners, L.P., the most directly comparable GAAP measure, see the subheading “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.
Propane operations and related equipment sales
Based on our propane sales volumes in fiscal 2021, we believe that we are the second largest retail marketer of propane in the United States and a leading national provider of propane by portable tank exchange. We serve residential, industrial/commercial, portable tank exchange, agricultural, wholesale and other customers in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Our operations primarily include the retail distribution and sale of propane and related equipment and supplies with concentrations in the Midwest, Southeast, Southwest and Northwest regions of the United States.
We use information on temperatures to understand how our results of operations are affected by temperatures that are warmer or colder than normal. Normal temperatures computed by us are the average of the last 10 years of information published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Based on this information we calculate a ratio of actual heating degree days to normal heating degree days. Heating degree days are a general indicator of weather impacting propane usage.
Weather conditions have a significant impact on demand for propane for heating purposes primarily during the months of November through March (the “winter heating season”). Accordingly, the volume of propane used by our customers for this purpose is directly affected by the severity of the winter weather in the regions we serve and can vary substantially from year to year. In any given region, sustained warmer-than-normal temperatures will tend to result in reduced propane usage, while sustained colder-than-normal temperatures will tend to result in greater usage. Although there is a strong correlation between weather and customer usage, general economic conditions in the United States and the wholesale price of propane can have a significant impact on this correlation. Additionally, there is a natural time lag between the onset of cold weather and increased sales to customers. If the United States were to experience a cooling trend, we could expect nationwide demand for propane to increase which could lead to greater sales, income and liquidity availability. Conversely, if the United States were to experience a continued warming trend, we could expect nationwide demand for propane for heating purposes to decrease which could lead to a reduction in our sales, income and liquidity availability as well as impact our ability to maintain compliance with our debt covenants.
We employ risk management activities that attempt to mitigate price risks related to the purchase, storage, transport and sale of propane generally in the contract and spot markets from major domestic energy companies. We attempt to mitigate these price risks through the use of financial derivative instruments and forward propane purchase and sales contracts. We enter into propane sales commitments with a portion of our customers that provide for a contracted price agreement for a specified period of time. These commitments can expose us to product price risk if not immediately hedged with an offsetting propane purchase commitment.
Our open financial derivative propane purchase commitments are designated as hedges primarily for fiscal 2021 and 2022 sales commitments and, as of July 31, 2021, we have experienced net mark-to-market gains of approximately $89.8 million. Because these financial derivative purchase commitments qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the resulting asset, liability and related mark-to-market gains or losses are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as “Prepaid expenses and other current assets,” "Other assets, net," “Other current liabilities,” "Other liabilities" and “Accumulated other comprehensive loss,” respectively, until settled. Upon settlement, realized gains or losses on these contracts will be reclassified to “Cost of sales-propane and other gas liquid sales” in the consolidated statements of operations as the underlying inventory is sold. These financial derivative purchase commitment net losses are expected to be offset by increased margins on propane sales commitments that qualify for the normal purchase normal sale exception. At July 31, 2021, we estimate 4% of currently open financial derivative purchase commitments, the related propane sales commitments and the resulting gross margin will be realized into earnings during the next twelve months.
Summary Discussion of Results of Operations:
For the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020
Weather in the more highly concentrated geographic areas we serve for fiscal 2021 was approximately 1% warmer than normal, and 3% colder than fiscal 2020.
During fiscal 2021, we recognized net loss attributable to Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. of $68.4 million, compared to net loss attributable to Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. of $82.5 million during fiscal 2020. This decreased loss reflects a $67.4 million increase in “Loss on extinguishment of debt”, a $14.3 million increase in “General and administrative expense” and $10.4 million of “Reorganization expense - professional fees” incurred only in fiscal 2021, partially offset by a $44.2 million increase in “Gross margin - Propane and other gas liquid sales”, a $27.2 million decrease in “Operating expenses - personnel, vehicle, plant and other” and $19.3 million decrease in “Interest expense”. “General and administrative expense” reflects the effects of legal fees and settlement related to non-core businesses of $10.1 million and $7.3 million during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively.
“Interest expense” for Ferrellgas Partners decreased $19.3 million primarily due (i) a decrease in interest on the Ferrellgas Partners Notes and (ii) lower interest expense for the last 4 months of the year ended July 31, 2021 as a result of the March 30, 2021 refinancing transactions, partially offset by an increase in interest expense resulting from the April 2020 transactions.
Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors increased to $135.7 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $63.7 million in fiscal 2020, primarily due to a $52.6 million increase in our Adjusted EBITDA and $22.1 million decrease in cash interest expense.
Distributable cash flow excess increased to $111.2 million in fiscal 2021 as compared to $62.4 million in fiscal 2020, primarily due to a $52.6 million increase in our Adjusted EBITDA, and $22.1 million decrease in cash interest expense, partially offset by a $24.0 million increase in distributions paid or accrued to preferred unitholders.
Consolidated Results of Operations
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In this Annual Report we present the following non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors, Distributable cash flow attributable to Class A and B Unitholders, and Distributable cash flow excess.
Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for Ferrellgas Partners is calculated as net loss attributable to Ferrellgas Partners, L.P., plus the sum of the following: income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, non-cash employee stock ownership plan compensation charge, loss on extinguishment of debt, loss on asset sales and disposals, other income (expense), net, reorganization expense - professional fees, severance costs, legal fees and settlements related to non-core businesses, provision for doubtful accounts related to non-core businesses, lease accounting standard adjustment and other and net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest. Management believes the presentation of this measure is relevant and useful because it allows investors to view the partnership’s performance in a manner similar to the method management uses, adjusted for items management believes make it easier to compare its results with other companies that have different financing and capital structures. Adjusted EBITDA, as management defines it, may not be comparable to Adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measurements used by other companies. Items added into our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA that will not occur on a continuing basis may have associated cash payments. This method of calculating Adjusted EBITDA should be viewed in conjunction with measurements that are computed in accordance with GAAP.
Distributable Cash Flow Attributable to Equity Investors. Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA minus net cash interest expense, maintenance capital expenditures and cash paid for income taxes, plus proceeds from certain asset sales. Management considers distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors a meaningful measure of Ferrellgas’ ability to declare and pay quarterly distributions to equity investors, including holders of the operating partnership’s Preferred Units. Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors, as management defines it, may not be comparable to distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors or similarly titled measurements used by other companies. Items added into our calculation of distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors that will not occur on a continuing basis may have associated cash payments. Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors should be viewed in conjunction with measurements that are computed in accordance with GAAP.
Distributable Cash Flow Attributable to Class A and B Unitholders. Distributable cash flow attributable to Class A and B Unitholders is calculated as Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors minus distributions accrued or paid to Preferred Unitholders and distributable cash flow attributable to general partner and noncontrolling interest. Management considers Distributable cash flow attributable to Class A and B Unitholders a meaningful measure of the partnership’s ability to declare and pay quarterly distributions to Class A and B Unitholders. Distributable cash flow attributable to Class A and B Unitholders, as management defines it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements used by other companies. Items added into our calculation of distributable cash flow attributable to Class A and B Unitholders that will not occur on a continuing basis may have associated cash payments. Distributable cash flow attributable to Class A and B Unitholders should be viewed in conjunction with measurements that are computed in accordance with GAAP.
Distributable Cash Flow Excess. Distributable cash flow excess is calculated as Distributable cash flow attributable to Class A and B unitholders minus Distributions paid to Class A and B unitholders. Distributable cash flow excess, if any, is retained to establish reserves, to reduce debt, to fund capital expenditures and for other partnership purposes, and any shortage is funded from previously established reserves, cash on hand or borrowings under our Credit Facility or, previously, under our terminated accounts receivable securitization facility. Management considers Distributable cash flow excess a meaningful measure of the partnership’s ability to effectuate those purposes. Distributable cash flow excess, as management defines it, may not be comparable to distributable cash flow excess or similarly titled measurements used by other companies. Items added into our calculation of distributable cash flow excess that will not occur on a continuing basis may have associated cash payments. Distributable cash flow excess should be viewed in conjunction with measurements that are computed in accordance with GAAP.
The following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors, Distributable cash flow attributable to Class A and B Unitholders and Distributable cash flow excess to Net loss attributable to Ferrellgas Partners, L.P., the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for the fiscal years indicated:
(a) Net cash interest expense is the sum of interest expense less non-cash interest expense and other income (expense), net. This amount includes interest expense related to the terminated accounts receivable securitization facility.
(b) Maintenance capital expenditures include capitalized expenditures for betterment and replacement of property, plant and equipment, and may from time to time include the purchase of assets that are typically leased.
Operating Results for the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020
Propane operations and related equipment sales
The following table summarizes propane sales volumes and Adjusted EBITDA results for the fiscal years indicated:
NM - Not meaningful
(a) Gross margin for Other Gas Sales is allocated to Gross margin “Retail - Sales to End Users” and “Wholesale - Sales to Resellers” based on the volumes in each respective category.
(b) Other primarily includes various customer fee income and to a lesser extent appliance and material sales.
(c) Gross margin from “Propane and other gas liquids sales” represents “Revenues - Propane and other gas liquids sales” less “Cost of sales - Propane and other gas liquids sales” and does not include depreciation and amortization.
(d) “Operating, general and administrative expense” above includes both the “Operating expense - personnel, vehicle, plant and other” and “General and administrative expense” captions in the consolidated statement of operations.
(e) Lease accounting standard adjustment and other reflects the additional expense recognized in excess of cash paid.
Propane sales volumes during fiscal 2021 decreased 2%, or 13.5 million gallons, from fiscal 2020 primarily due to decreased sales volumes to retail and wholesale customers, substantially offset by increased sales to tank exchange customers. Sales volumes to retail customers were impacted by a now recovering industrial commercial customer base and weak agricultural demand. Weather in the more highly concentrated geographic areas we serve for fiscal 2021 was approximately 1% warmer than normal, and 3% colder than the prior year.
Our wholesale sales price per gallon partially correlates to the change in the wholesale market price of propane. The wholesale market price at major supply points in Mt. Belvieu, Texas during fiscal 2021 averaged 77% more than fiscal 2020, while at the Conway, Kansas major supply point prices averaged 85% more than fiscal 2020. The wholesale market price at Mt. Belvieu, Texas averaged $0.76 and $0.43 per gallon during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively, while the wholesale market price at Conway, Kansas averaged $0.74 and $0.40 per gallon during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively. This increase in the wholesale cost of propane contributed to our increase in sales price per gallon and therefore revenues.
Revenues
Retail sales increased $159.9 million compared to fiscal 2020. This increase resulted primarily from a $168.9 million increase in sales price per gallon and $5.7 million increase in sales related to colder weather than the prior year, partially offset by a $16.4 million decrease in sales volume, both as discussed above.
Wholesale sales increased $86.2 million compared to fiscal 2020. This increase is sales was primarily due to an increase in sales price per gallon, as discussed above.
Other gas sales increased $7.0 million compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to an increase in sales price per gallon.
Other revenues increased $3.4 million compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to increased miscellaneous fees billed to customers and increased tank rental income, partially offset by a $2.9 million one-time refund of federal fuel excise tax received in fiscal 2020 that was not repeated in fiscal 2021.
Gross margin - Propane and other gas liquids sales
Gross margin increased $47.9 million primarily due to increased retail gross margin per gallon, partially offset by the decreased other sales volumes, each as discussed above. The $27.5 million increase in wholesale gross margin primarily relates to increased tank exchange sales volumes. The increase in retail gross margin of $16.7 million resulted primarily from a $21.6 million increase in gross margin per gallon and $3.1 million increase in sales related to colder weather than the prior year, partially offset by a $9.3 million decrease in sales volume, as discussed above.
Gross margin - other
Gross margin increased $3.7 million compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to increased miscellaneous fees billed to customers and increased tank rental income, partially offset by a $2.9 million one-time refund of federal fuel excise tax received in fiscal 2020 that was not repeated in fiscal 2021.
Operating income
Operating income increased $67.6 million primarily due to a $44.2 million increase in "Gross margin - Propane and other gas liquid sales" and a $3.7 million increase in “Gross margin - other”, both as discussed above, a $12.9 million decrease in “Operating, general and administrative expense”, and a $6.0 million decrease in “Operating expense - equipment lease expense”. “Operating, general and administrative expense” decreased due to a $27.2 million decrease in “Operating expense - personnel, vehicle, plant and other”, partially offset by a $14.3 million increase in “General and administrative expense”. “Operating expense - personnel, vehicle, plant and other” decreased primarily due to a one-time $17.3 million provision for doubtful accounts recorded in fiscal 2020 related to non-core business, a $1.2 million decrease in vehicle fuel and other vehicle costs and $4.6 million in decreased plant and office costs. “General and administrative expense” increased primarily due to a $6.6 million increase in legal costs and an $8.3 million increase in personnel incentives. “Operating expense - equipment lease expense” decreased due to our entering into more finance leases instead of operating leases, resulting in less lease expense and greater interest expense and amortization expense.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA increased $52.6 million primarily due to a $44.2 million increase in "Gross margin - Propane and other gas liquid sales" and a $3.7 million increase in “Gross margin - other”, both as discussed above, and a $6.0 million decrease in “Operating expense - equipment lease expense, partially offset by $1.1 million increase in “Operating, general and administrative expense”. “Operating, general and administrative expense” increased due to a $10.5 million increase in “General and administrative expense”, partially offset by a $9.4 million decrease in “Operating expense - personnel, vehicle, plant and other”. “Operating expense - personnel, vehicle, plant and other” decreased primarily due to a $1.2 million decrease in vehicle fuel and other vehicle costs and $4.6 million in decreased plant and office costs. “General and administrative expense” increased primarily due to a $3.8 million increase in legal costs and a $7.3 million increase in personnel incentives.
Adjusted EBITDA increased $34.7 million primarily due to a $36.4 million increase in "Gross margin - Propane and other gas liquid sales" and a $4.9 million increase in “Gross margin - other”, both as discussed above, partially offset by a $7.1 million increase in “Operating, general and administrative expense”. “Operating, general and administrative expense” increased due to a $9.4 million increase in “Operating expense - personnel, vehicle, plant and other,” partially offset by a $2.3 million decrease in “General and administrative expense”. “Operating expense - personnel, vehicle, plant and other” increased primarily due to a $12.7 million increase in field personnel costs, a $1.5 million increase related to acquisitions made in the last twelve months, a $1.5 million increase in plant and office costs, a $1.1 million increase in selling expenses and a $1.1 million increase in personnel incentives, partially offset by a $1.4 million decrease in vehicle fuel costs. “General and administrative expense” remained unchanged, primarily due to a $3.2 million decrease in legal costs offset by a $2.3 million increase in personnel incentives and a $0.9 million increase in other corporate costs.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
General
Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from operating activities, our Credit Facility and funds received from sales of debt and equity securities. As of July 31, 2021, our total liquidity was $490.4 million, which was comprised of $270.5 million in unrestricted cash and $219.9 million of availability under our Credit Facility. These sources of liquidity and short-term capital resources are intended to fund our working capital requirements, acquisitions and capital expenditures. As of July 31, 2021, letters of credit outstanding totaled $107.7 million. Our access to long-term capital resources, to the extent needed to refinance debt or for other purposes, may be affected by our ability to access the capital markets, covenants in our debt agreements and other financial obligations, unforeseen demands on cash, or other events beyond our control.
As of July 31, 2021, we had $11.5 million of restricted cash for a cash deposit made with the administrative agent under our prior senior secured credit facility that was terminated in April 2020.
Our working capital requirements are subject to, among other things, the price of propane, delays in the collection of receivables, volatility in energy commodity prices, liquidity imposed by insurance providers, downgrades in our credit ratings, decreased trade credit, significant acquisitions, the weather, customer retention and purchasing patterns and other changes in the demand for propane. Relatively colder weather or higher propane prices during the winter heating season are factors that could significantly increase our working capital requirements.
Our ability to satisfy our obligations is dependent upon our future performance, which will be subject to prevailing weather, economic, financial and business conditions and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Due to the seasonality of the retail propane distribution business, a significant portion of our propane operations and related products cash flows from operations is generated during the winter heating season. Our net cash provided by operating activities primarily reflects earnings from our business activities adjusted for depreciation and amortization and changes in our working capital accounts. Historically, we generate significantly lower net cash from operating activities in our first and fourth fiscal quarters as compared to the second and third fiscal quarters due to the seasonality of our propane operations and related equipment sales operations.
During periods of high volatility, our risk management activities may expose us to the risk of counterparty margin calls in amounts greater than we have the capacity to fund. Likewise, our counterparties may not be able to fulfill their margin calls from us or may default on the settlement of positions with us.
We believe that the liquidity available from cash flows from operating activities, unrestricted cash and the Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditure, working capital and letter of credit requirements for the foreseeable future.
Distributable Cash Flow
Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors is reconciled to net loss attributable to Ferrellgas Partners, L.P., the most directly comparable GAAP measure, in this Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -Non-GAAP Financial Measures" above. A comparison of distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors to cash distributions accrued or paid to equity investors for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021 to the twelve months ended July 31, 2020 is as follows (in thousands):
(a) DCF ratio is calculated as Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors divided by Cash distributions accrued or paid to equity investors.
(b) NM - Not Meaningful.
For fiscal 2021, Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors increased $72.0 million compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to the increase in Adjusted EBITDA. We declared an $8.0 million quarterly distribution to Preferred Unitholders on April 30, 2021 and paid this cash distribution in May 2021. Additionally, we declared a $16.0 million quarterly distribution to Preferred Unitholders on July 31, 2021 and paid this cash distribution in August 2021. We did not pay any cash distributions to our Class A Unitholders during fiscal 2021 or fiscal 2020, and we did not pay any distributions to Class B Unitholders during the period from the issuance of the Class B Units on the Effective Date through the end of fiscal 2021. Thus, cash reserves, which we utilize to meet future anticipated expenditures, increased by $111.6 million during the twelve months ended July 31, 2021, compared to an increase of $63.5 million during the twelve months ended July 31, 2020.
Operating Activities
Ferrellgas Partners
Fiscal 2021 v Fiscal 2020
Net cash provided by operating activities was $206.4 million for fiscal 2021, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $130.4 million for fiscal 2020. This increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a $5.7 million decrease in working capital requirements, a $59.7 million increase in cash flow from operations and a $10.6 million inflow associated with other assets and liabilities.
The decrease in working capital requirements for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to a $32.3 million increase in requirements for accounts and notes receivable, a $25.0 million increase in accrued interest expense, a $23.5 million increase in inventories, a $13.4 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, partially offset by a $12.6 million decrease in requirements for accounts payable due to timing of payments and an $87.4 million decrease in other current liabilities.
The increase in cash flow from operations was primarily due to a $47.9 million increase in gross profit, a net decrease in “Operating expense - personnel, vehicle, plant and other” and “Operating expense - equipment lease expense” of $33.2 million and a net decrease in “Interest expense” of $19.3 million, partially offset by a $14.3 million increase in “General and administrative expense” and a $10.4 million increase in “Reorganization expense - professional fees”.
The operating partnership
Fiscal 2021 v Fiscal 2020
Net cash provided by operating activities was $217.0 million for fiscal 2021, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $145.8 million for fiscal 2020. This increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a $7.2 million decrease in working capital requirements, a $54.6 million increase in cash flow from operations and a $9.4 million inflow associated with other assets and liabilities.
The decrease in working capital requirements for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to a $32.3 million increase in requirements for accounts and notes receivable, a $23.5 increase in inventories, a $23.4 million increase in accrued interest expense, and $13.4 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, partially offset by an $87.2 million decrease in other current liabilities and a $12.6 million decrease in accounts payable.
The increase in cash flow from operations was primarily due to a $47.9 million increase in gross profit and a net decrease in “Operating expense - personnel, vehicle, plant and other” and “Operating expense - equipment lease expense” of $33.2 million, partially offset by a $14.0 million increase in “General and administrative expense”.
Investing Activities
Ferrellgas Partners
Capital Requirements
Our business requires continual investments to upgrade or enhance existing operations and to ensure compliance with safety and environmental regulations. Capital expenditures for our business consist primarily of:
● Maintenance capital expenditures. These capital expenditures include expenditures for betterment and replacement of property, plant and equipment, and may from time to time include the purchase of assets that are typically leased, rather than to generate incremental distributable cash flow. Examples of maintenance capital expenditures include a routine replacement of a worn-out asset or replacement of major vehicle components; and
● Growth capital expenditures. These expenditures are undertaken primarily to generate incremental distributable cash flow. Examples include expenditures for purchases of both bulk and portable propane tanks and other equipment to facilitate expansion of our customer base and operating capacity.
Fiscal 2021 v Fiscal 2020
Net cash used in investing activities was $61.0 million for fiscal 2021, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $71.3 million for fiscal 2020. This decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a $35.3 million decrease in "Cash payments to construct assets in connection with future lease transactions”, a $11.0 million decrease in “Capital expenditures” and a $3.6 million decrease in "Business acquisitions, net of cash acquired", partially offset by a $40.4 million decrease in “Cash receipts in connection with leased vehicles”.
The decrease in "Capital expenditures" during fiscal 2021 was primarily due to a decrease in financing the construction of assets with cash, a decrease in maintenance capital expenditures, and to a lesser extent a decrease in growth capital expenditures during fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. The decrease in both growth and maintenance capital expenditures was primarily due to more effective use of equipment on hand. This was especially noticeable in tank and cylinders, but also had an impact in vehicles and storage facilities.
Due to the mature nature of our operations we do not anticipate significant fluctuations in maintenance capital expenditures, with the exception of future decisions regarding lease versus buy financing options. However, future fluctuations in growth capital expenditures could occur due to the opportunistic nature of these projects.
The operating partnership
The investing activities discussed above also apply to the operating partnership, other than the net activity of the term loan credit agreement with Ferrellgas Partners described below under “-Disclosures about Effects of Transactions with Related Parties.”
Financing Activities
Ferrellgas Partners
Fiscal 2021 v Fiscal 2020
Net cash used in financing activities was $197.3 million for fiscal 2021, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $263.6 million for fiscal 2020. This decrease in cash flow provided by financing activities was primarily due to a $1,891.1 million increase in payments for settlement and early extinguishment of liabilities due to the redemption of the 2021 Notes, the 2022 Notes, the 2023 Notes and the 2025 Notes (as discussed further in Note I - Debt), a $67.5 million increase in payments of redemption premiums related to those extinguishments of liabilities, a $14.8 million increase in cash paid for financing costs and a $5.1 million increase in cash payments for the principal portion of finance lease liabilities, partially offset by a $771.3 million increase in proceeds from the debt offering due to the issuance of the 2026 Notes and the 2029 Notes, a $651.3 million increase in proceeds from the sale of the Preferred Units, net of offering costs and issue discount and a $43.0 million net decrease in short-term borrowings in fiscal 2020 that was not repeated in fiscal 2021.
Letters of credit outstanding at July 31, 2021 and July 31, 2020 totaled $107.7 million and $126.0 million, respectively, and were used to secure insurance arrangements, product purchases and commodity hedges. As of July 31, 2021, we had available borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility of $219.9 million. At July 31, 2020, we did not have in place a credit facility providing for the issuance of letters of credit and had $78.2 million of restricted cash pledged as cash collateral for letters of credit outstanding. Additionally, at July 31, 2020, we also issued letters of credit of $50.0 million by utilizing our liquidity available on the terminated accounts receivable securitization facility.
Distributions
Partnership distributions
The Amended Ferrellgas Partners LPA requires Ferrellgas Partners to make quarterly cash distributions of all of its “available cash”. Available cash is defined in the Amended Ferrellgas Partners LPA as, generally, the sum of Ferrellgas’ Partners cash receipts less consolidated cash disbursements and net changes in reserves established by our general partner for future requirements. In general, the amount of Ferrellgas Partners’ available cash depends primarily on whether and the extent to which Ferrellgas Partners receives cash distributions from the operating partnership, as such distributions generally would be Ferrellgas Partners’ only significant cash receipts.
Pursuant to the Amended Ferrellgas Partners LPA, while any Class B Units remain outstanding, any distributions by Ferrellgas Partners to its partners must be made such that the ratio of (i) the amount of distributions made to holders of Class B Units to (ii) the amount of distributions made to holders of Class A Units and the general partner is not less than 6:1. The Amended Ferrellgas Partners LPA permits Ferrellgas Partners, in the general partner’s discretion, to make distributions to the Class B Unitholders in a greater proportion than the minimum 6:1 ratio, including paying 100% of any such distribution Class B Unitholders. The Class B Units will not be convertible into Class A Units until Class B Unitholders receive distributions in the aggregate amount of $357.0 million (which was the outstanding principal amount of the Ferrellgas Partners Notes), and the rate at which Class B Units will convert into Class A Units increases annually. Additionally, the price at which Ferrellgas Partners may redeem the Class B Units during the first five years after the Effective Date is based on the Class B Unitholders’ receipt of a specified internal rate of return in respect of their Class B Units. This specified internal rate of return in respect of the Class B Units is 15.85%, but that amount increases under certain circumstances, including if the operating partnership paid distributions on the Preferred Units in-kind rather than in cash for a certain number of quarters. Accordingly, distributing cash to the Class B Unitholders in a greater proportion than the minimum 6:1 ratio could result in the Class B Units becoming convertible into Class A Units more quickly or at a lower conversion rate or reduce the redemption price for the Class B Units. For additional discussion of the terms of the Class B Units, see Note K - Equity in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.
For these reasons, although the general partner has not made any decisions or adopted any policy with respect to the allocation of future distributions by Ferrellgas Partners to its partners, the general partner may determine that it is advisable to pay more than the minimum amount of any distribution, up to 100% of the amount of such distribution, to Class B Unitholders. In fact, on October 8, 2021, Ferrellgas Partners made a cash distribution in the aggregate amount of approximately $49.9 million entirely to the Class B Unitholders, without making any distribution to Class A Unitholders and the general partner. See “Risk Factors-Risks Inherent in an Investment in our Class A or Class B Units or our Debt Securities and Other Risks Related to Our Capital Structure and Financing Arrangements-If Ferrellgas Partners is permitted to make and makes distributions to its partners, while any Class B Units remain outstanding, Class B Unitholders collectively will receive at least approximately 85.7% of the aggregate amount of each such distribution and may receive up to 100% of any such distribution. Accordingly, while any Class B Units remain outstanding, Class A Unitholders may not receive any distributions and, in any case, will not receive collectively more than approximately 14.1% of any distribution.”
The ability of Ferrellgas Partners to make cash distributions to its Class A Unitholders and Class B Unitholders is dependent on the receipt by Ferrellgas Partners of cash distributions from the operating partnership. For so long as any Preferred Units remain outstanding, the amount of cash that otherwise would be available for distribution by the operating partnership to Ferrellgas Partners will be reduced by the amount of cash distributions and other payments made by the operating partnership in respect of the Preferred Units, including payments to redeem Preferred Units. Further, the Indentures governing the OpCo Notes, the Credit Agreement and the OpCo LPA Amendment governing the Preferred Units contain covenants that limit the ability of the operating partnership to make distributions to Ferrellgas Partners and therefore effectively limit the ability of Ferrellgas Partners to make distributions to its Class A Unitholders and Class B Unitholders. See Note I - Debt and Note J - Preferred units for a discussion of these limitations. See also “Risk Factors- Risks Inherent in an Investment in our Class A or Class B Units or our Debt Securities and Other Risks Related to Our Capital Structure and Financing Arrangements- Our ability to make cash distributions to holders of Class A Units and Class B Units is dependent on the receipt by Ferrellgas Partners of cash distributions from the operating partnership, which are limited by our obligations under the Indentures, the Credit Agreement and the OpCo LPA Amendment and may be limited by a variety of other factors. Accordingly, we may be unable to make cash distributions to holders of Class A Units and Class B Units.”
Preferred unit distributions
Pursuant to the OpCo LPA Amendment, the operating partnership is required to pay to the holders of each Preferred Unit a cumulative, quarterly distribution (the "Quarterly Distribution") at the Distribution Rate (as defined below) on the unit purchase price of such Preferred Unit, which is $1,000 per unit.
"Distribution Rate" means, for the first five years after March 30, 2021, a rate per annum equal to 8.956%, with certain increases in the Distribution Rate on each of the 5th, 6th and 7th anniversaries of March 30, 2021, subject to a maximum rate of 11.125% and certain other adjustments and exceptions.
The Quarterly Distribution may be paid in cash or, at the election of the operating partnership "in kind" through the issuance of additional Preferred Units ("PIK Units") at the quarterly Distribution Rate plus an applicable premium that escalates each year from 75 bps to 300 bps so long as the Preferred Units remain outstanding. In the event the operating partnership fails to make any Quarterly Distribution in cash, such Quarterly Distribution will automatically be paid in PIK Units.
The Distribution Rate on the Preferred Units will increase upon violation of certain protective provisions for the benefit of Preferred Unit holders notwithstanding the cap mentioned above.
During the year ended July 31, 2021, Quarterly Distributions paid to holders of the Preferred Units totaled $8.0 million. As of July 31, 2021, an additional aggregate Quarterly Distribution and Additional Amounts (as defined in Note J - Preferred units) was accrued for $16.0 million, and that amount was paid in cash to holders of Preferred Units on August 16, 2021.
 
Preferred unit tax distributions
For any quarter in which the operating partnership makes a Quarterly Distribution in PIK Units in lieu of cash, it shall make a subsequent cash tax distribution for such quarter in an amount equal to the (i) the lesser of (x) 25% and (y) the highest combined federal, state and local tax rate applicable for corporations organized in New York, multiplied by (ii) the excess (if any) of (A) one-fourth (1/4th) of the estimated taxable income to be allocated to the holders of Preferred Units for the year in which the Quarterly Tax Payment Date (which refers to certain specified dates that next follow a Quarterly Distribution date on which PIK Units were issued) occurs, over (B) any cash paid on the Quarterly Distribution date immediately preceding the Quarterly Tax Payment Date on which a quarterly tax amount would otherwise be paid (such amount, the "Tax Distribution"). Tax Distributions are treated as advances against, and reduce, future cash distributions for any reason, including payments in redemption of Preferred Units or PIK Units, or payments to the holders in their capacity as such pursuant to any side letter or other agreement.
Cash distributions paid
Ferrellgas Partners did not pay any cash distributions to its Class A or Class B Unitholders during fiscal 2021 or fiscal 2020. On October 8, 2021, Ferrellgas Partners paid a cash distribution to holders of the Class B Units in the amount of $38.46 per Class B Unit or approximately $49.9 million in the aggregate. As permitted by the Amended Ferrellgas LPA as described above, Ferrellgas Partners made this distribution solely to Class B Unitholders without any contemporaneous distribution to Class A Unitholders and the general partner.
The operating partnership did not pay cash distributions during fiscal 2021 except in respect of its Preferred Units as discussed above under “-Preferred unit distributions”. The operating partnership paid cash distributions to Ferrellgas Partners and the general partner of $15.7 million during fiscal 2020.
On September 14, 2021, the operating partnership paid a cash distribution to Ferrellgas Partners in the amount of approximately $49.9 million, which Ferrellgas Partners used to make the October 8, 2021 distribution to Class B Unitholders described above.
The operating partnership
The financing activities discussed above also apply to the operating partnership except for distributions by Ferrellgas Partners, fees paid in connection with the Class B Unit exchange and other amounts related to the Ferrellgas Partners Notes, and proceeds received by Ferrellgas Partners pursuant to the term loan credit agreement described below under “-Disclosures about Effects of Transactions with Related Parties.”
Disclosures about Effects of Transactions with Related Parties
We have no employees and are managed and controlled by our general partner. Pursuant to our partnership agreements, our general partner is entitled to reimbursement for all direct and indirect expenses incurred or payments it makes on our behalf, and all other necessary or appropriate expenses allocable to us or otherwise reasonably incurred by our general partner in connection with operating our business. These reimbursable costs, which totaled $295.7 million for fiscal 2021, include operating expenses such as compensation and benefits paid to employees of our general partner who perform services on our behalf as well as related general and administrative expenses.
Term loan credit agreement between Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership
As discussed in Note O - Transactions with related parties in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of the operating partnership, on January 8, 2021 Ferrellgas Partners entered into a term loan credit agreement with the operating partnership, pursuant to which the operating partnership extended to Ferrellgas Partners an unsecured, non-amortizing term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $19.9 million. The term loan bears interest at a rate of 20% per annum, and all interest on the term loan will be added to the outstanding principal amount of the term loan. The term loan will mature on July 1, 2022. During July 2021, Ferrellgas Partners made an optional prepayment of $9.0 million principal amount of the term loan and the outstanding principal and accrued interest at July 31, 2021 was $13.1 million.
Related party Class A Unitholders
Related party Class A Unitholder information consisted of the following:
(1) Ferrell Companies is the owner of the general partner and is an approximate 23% direct owner of Class A Units and thus a related party. Ferrell Companies also beneficially owns 9,784 and 2,560 Class A Units held by FCI Trading Corp. (“FCI Trading”) and Ferrell Propane, Inc. (“Ferrell Propane”), respectively, bringing Ferrell Companies’ beneficial ownership to 23.4% at July 31, 2021.
(2) FCI Trading is an affiliate of the general partner and thus a related party.
(3) Ferrell Propane is controlled by the general partner and thus a related party.
(4) James E. Ferrell is the Chief Executive Officer and President of our general partner; and is the Chairman of the Board of Directors of our general partner. JEF Capital Management owns 237,942 of these Class A Units and is owned by the James E. Ferrell Revocable Trust Two and other family trusts, all of which James E. Ferrell and/or his family members are trustees and beneficiaries. James E. Ferrell holds all voting common stock of JEF Capital Management. The remaining 230 Class A Units are held by Ferrell Resources Holdings, Inc., which is wholly-owned by the James E. Ferrell Revocable Trust One, for which James E. Ferrell is the trustee and sole beneficiary.
Contractual Obligations
In the performance of our operations, we are bound by certain contractual obligations.
The following table summarizes our long-term debt, including current portion, fixed rate interest obligations and certain other contractual obligations at July 31, 2021. These obligations reflect the operating partnership’s issuance of the $650.0 million aggregate principal amount 2026 Notes and the $825.0 million aggregate principal amount 2029 Notes and the other transactions effected on the Effective Date.
(1) We have long and short term payment obligations under agreements such as the indentures governing our senior notes. Amounts shown in the table represent our scheduled future maturities of long-term debt (including current maturities thereof) for the periods indicated. For additional information regarding our debt obligations, see Note I - Debt to our consolidated financial statements
(2) Fixed rate interest obligations represent the amount of interest due on fixed rate long-term debt.
(3) We lease certain property, plant and equipment under noncancelable and cancelable operating leases. Amounts shown in the table represent minimum lease payment obligations under our third-party operating leases for the periods indicated.
(4) We lease certain property, plant and equipment under noncancelable and cancelable financing leases. Amounts shown in the table represent minimum lease payment obligations under our third-party financing leases for the periods indicated.
(5) These payments relate to a liability incurred in connection with the withdrawal from certain pension plans.
(6) We define a purchase obligation as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding (unconditional) on us that specifies all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions. We have long and short-term product purchase obligations for propane and energy commodities with third-party suppliers. These purchase obligations are entered into at either variable or fixed prices. The purchase prices that we are obligated to pay under variable price contracts approximate market prices at the time we take delivery of the volumes. Our estimated future variable price contract payment obligations are based on the July 31, 2021 market price of the applicable commodity applied to future volume commitments. Actual future payment obligations may vary depending on market prices at the time of delivery. The purchase prices that we are obligated to pay under fixed price contracts are established at the inception of the contract. Our estimated future fixed price contract payment obligations are based on the contracted fixed price under each commodity contract. Quantities shown in the table represent our volume commitments and estimated payment obligations under these contracts for the periods indicated.
The components of other noncurrent liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheets principally consist of property and casualty liabilities and the fair value of derivatives in connection with our risk management activity. These liabilities are not included in the table above because they are estimates of future payments and not contractually fixed as to timing or amount.
The operating partnership
The contractual obligations discussed above also apply to the operating partnership.
Off-balance Sheet Financing Arrangements
As of July 31, 2021, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Our off-balance sheet arrangements primarily include letters of credit under the Credit Facility.
Adoption of New Accounting Standards
As of July 31, 2021 there was one new accounting standard that we adopted during fiscal 2021, Accounting Standard Update No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)”, which requires financial assets measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. Ferrellgas adopted the amended guidance effective August 1, 2020. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. These financial statements include some estimates and assumptions that are based on informed judgments and estimates of management. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an on-going basis and discuss the development, selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of our general partner. Predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and as such requires the use of judgment. Our consolidated financial statements may differ based upon different estimates and assumptions.
We discuss our significant accounting policies in Note B - Summary of significant accounting policies - to our consolidated financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are subject to judgments and uncertainties that affect the application of such policies. We believe these financial statements include the most likely outcomes with regard to amounts that are based on our judgment and estimates. Our financial position and results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from the actual amounts, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. We believe the following accounting policies are critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements due to the estimation process and business judgment involved in their application:
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment
We calculate depreciation on property, plant and equipment using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from two to 30 years. Changes in the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment could have a material effect on our results of operations. The estimates of the assets’ useful lives require our judgment regarding assumptions about the useful life of the assets being depreciated. When necessary, the depreciable lives are revised and the impact on depreciation is treated on a prospective basis. There were no material revisions to depreciable lives in fiscal 2021.
Residual value of customer and storage tanks
We use an estimated residual value when calculating depreciation for our customer and bulk storage tanks. Customer and bulk storage tanks are classified as property, plant and equipment on our consolidated balance sheets. The depreciable basis of these tanks is calculated using the original cost less the residual value. Depreciation is calculated using straight-line method based on the tanks’ estimated useful life of 30 years. Changes in the estimated residual value could have a material effect on our results. The estimates of the tanks’ residual value require our judgment of the value of the tanks at the end of their useful life or retirement. When necessary, the tanks’ residual values are revised and the impact on depreciation is treated on a prospective basis. There were no such revisions to residual values in fiscal 2021, 2020 or 2019.
Valuation methods, amortization methods and estimated useful lives of intangible assets
The specific, identifiable intangible assets of a business enterprise depend largely upon the nature of its operations. Potential intangible assets include intellectual property such as trademarks and trade names, customer lists and relationships, and non-compete agreements, permits, favorable lease arrangements as well as other intangible assets. The approach to the valuation of each intangible asset will vary depending upon the nature of the asset, the business in which it is utilized, and the economic returns it is generating or is expected to generate. During fiscal 2021 or 2020, we did not find it necessary to adjust the valuation methods used for any acquired intangible assets.
Our recorded intangible assets primarily include the estimated value assigned to certain customer-related and contract-based assets representing the rights we own arising from the acquisition of propane distribution companies and related contractual agreements. A customer-related or contract-based intangible with a finite useful life is amortized over its estimated useful life, which is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the entity. We believe that trademarks and trade names have an indefinite useful life due to our intention to utilize all acquired trademarks and trade names indefinitely. When necessary, the intangible assets’ useful lives are revised and the impact on amortization will be reflected on a prospective basis. The determination of the fair market value of the intangible asset and the estimated useful life are based on an analysis of all pertinent factors including (1) the use of widely-accepted valuation approaches, the income approach or the cost approach, (2) the expected use of the asset by the entity, (3) the expected useful life of related assets, (4) any legal, regulatory or contractual provisions, including renewal or extension periods that would cause substantial costs or modifications to existing agreements, (5) the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors and (6) the level of maintenance required to obtain the expected future cash flows.
If the underlying assumption(s) governing the amortization of an intangible asset were later determined to have significantly changed (either favorably or unfavorably), then we may be required to adjust the amortization period of such asset to reflect any new estimate of its useful life. Such a change would increase or decrease the annual amortization charge associated with the asset at that time. During fiscal 2021 or 2020, we did not find it necessary to adjust the valuation method, estimated useful life or amortization period of any of our intangible assets.
Should any of the underlying assumptions indicate that the value of the intangible asset might be impaired, we may be required to reduce the carrying value and may also be required to reduce the subsequent useful life of the asset. Any such write-down of the value and any unfavorable change in the useful life (i.e., amortization period) of an intangible asset would increase operating expense at that time.
We did not recognize any impairment losses related to our intangible assets during fiscal 2021.

Accounting for risk management activities and derivative financial instruments
We enter into commodity forward, futures, swaps and options contracts involving propane to hedge exposures to price risk. We may also enter into commodity forward, futures, swaps and options contracts involving diesel, gasoline and related products to hedge exposures to price risk. These derivative contracts are reported in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in cost of sales and operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations or in other comprehensive income in the consolidated statement of partners’ capital. We utilize published settlement prices for exchange-traded contracts, quotes provided by brokers and estimates of market prices based on daily contract activity to estimate the fair value of these contracts. Changes in the methods used to determine the fair value of these contracts could have a material effect on our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations.
