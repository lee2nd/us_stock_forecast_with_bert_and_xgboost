ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion of financial condition as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and results of operations for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2020 should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto, included in this report. Average balances, including balances used in calculating certain financial ratios, are generally comprised of average daily balances. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. You should carefully read “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” included in this report.
Introduction
Our continued focus on responsible community banking fundamentals and our strong customer relationships have enabled us to increase our market presence through growth in our loan portfolio, which is primarily funded by steady core deposit growth.
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $1.51 billion in total assets, $1.01 billion in total gross loans, and $1.37 billion in total deposits.
We believe the following were key indicators of our performance during 2020:
●
Total assets increased to $1.51 billion at the end of 2020, an increase of 31.7% from $1.15 billion at the end of 2019.
●
Total deposits increased to $1.37 billion at the end of 2020, an increase of 34.1%, from $1.02 billion at the end of 2019.
●
Total net loans increased to $997 million at the end of 2020, an increase of 34.6%, from $741 million at the end of 2019.
●
Net interest income increased to $45.0 million in 2020, an increase of $3.9 million or 9.6%, compared to $41.0 million in 2019, mainly as a result of growth of our loan and investment portfolios.
●
The growth in total assets, deposits, loans and net interest income as described above was bolstered by PPP loans funded during 2020, which had an outstanding balance of $211 million as of December 31, 2020.
●
Provision for loan losses increased by $1,620,000 to $2,165,000 in 2020, compared to $545,000 in 2019, mainly due to a qualitative adjustment in the loan loss reserve corresponding to the COVID-19 pandemic and loan growth during 2020.
●
The ratio of total non-performing loans to total loans decreased to 0.00% at December 31, 2020 from 0.15% at December 31, 2019. Management considers the size of the ratio of non-performing assets to total loans to be low and manageable, and reserves have been taken appropriately.
●
Total noninterest income decreased to $4.8 million in 2020, a decrease of 4.6%, from $5.0 million in 2019, which is mainly due to a reduction in overdraft fee income during 2020 as higher deposit account balances corresponding to PPP and stimulus payments, coupled with pandemic related changes in spending patterns resulted in relatively low overdraft activity.
●
Total noninterest expense increased from $28.8 million in 2019 to $29.9 million in 2020, primarily due to staffing increases and general operating costs necessary to support the growing loan and deposit portfolios.
●
Provision from income taxes decreased by $144,000 to $4.1 million in 2020, mainly due to a higher percentage of our pre-tax income coming from tax-free municipal bond interest income.
These items, as well as other factors, contributed to the increase in net income for 2020 to $13.7 million from $12.5 million in 2019, which translates into $1.68 per diluted share in 2020 as compared to $1.54 per diluted share in 2019.
Over the past several years, our network of branches and loan production offices have expanded geographically. We currently maintain seventeen full-service offices. We intend to continue our growth strategy in future years through the opening of additional branches and loan production offices as our needs and resources permit.
COVID-19 Impact
The coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic and the Federal Reserve's response to the economic challenges during 2020 has resulted in an uncertain and rapidly evolving economy. In response to the pandemic, approximately 27% of our administrative staff were working remotely as of December 31, 2020, while all of the branch staff have returned to working in the office. . To date, we have been able to fully support our remote workforce and these remote work arrangements have not adversely impacted our ability to serve our clients. These remote work arrangements have also not had an impact on our financial reporting systems or the internal controls we have over financial reporting, disclosures and related procedures. In addition to the remote work arrangements, the Company has taken many other measures to protect employees and customers, including, adherence to state mask wearing mandates, social distancing, sanitizing protocols and posting of public safety notices on branch buildings.
The most significant impact of COVID-19 on our business has been to the quality of our loan portfolio and to net interest income as short-term interest rates have sharply declined. During the second quarter, we increased the qualitative factors used in the determination of the adequacy of our allowance for loan and lease loss in anticipation of the impact that COVID-19 will have on our clients and their ability to fulfill their obligations. The provision for loan losses increased by $1,620,000 in 2020 due to qualitative adjustments in the loan loss reserve corresponding to COVID-19 pandemic.
Offsetting these factors was loan interest and fee income of $4,720,000 in Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loans funded during 2020 through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), as the Bank committed early to be an active participant in the effort to support local businesses through the PPP program. Further, higher deposit account balances corresponding to PPP and government stimulus payments, coupled with changes in business and consumer spending patterns amid the COVID-19 stay-at-home orders and business lockdowns, resulted in relatively low overdraft activity and hence the decrease to non-interest income. Outside of this recent trend, the Bank’s core customer base and corresponding service fee income related to servicing loan and deposit accounts, continues to grow at a steady pace. The year-to-date results were also bolstered by deferred loan cost GAAP accounting adjustments of $1,253,000 against salary expense during 2020, corresponding to the PPP loans funded.
The COVID-19 Pandemic negatively impacted the revenue streams of certain borrowers, and during the second quarter of 2020 the Company elected to allow these borrowers to defer payments for a term up to six months. These deferrals were specifically related to the pandemic and the resulting economic hardships. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had no loans for which payments were deferred, as normal payment schedules had resumed on the deferrals granted during the second quarter of 2020. This compares to 53 loans with an outstanding balance of $74,868,000 as of June 30, 2020 for which payments were deferred due to the financial impact of COVID-19. After an evaluation of financial stability, no specific loan loss reserve allocation was required on any of these loans at the time of deferral and the short-term modifications granted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic are not considered to be troubled debt restructurings.
We have no certainty that the provisions we made during 2020 will be sufficient to absorb the losses that stem from the impact of COVID-19 on our clients. As the longer-term effects on our clients from the COVID-19 pandemic become more apparent, we may still need to charge-off some or all of the balance on certain loans and make further provisions to increase our allowance for loan and lease losses. These potential additional provisions for loan and lease losses will have a direct impact upon our capital, including the potential need to reevaluate the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset. At this time, we do not expect that there would be any material impairment to the valuation of other long-lived assets, right of use assets, or our investment securities. However, we expect a reduction in the amount of interest income we earn for the remainder of the year due to the FOMC rate cuts. In addition, on June 8, 2020, the National Bureau of Economic Research announced that the United States was in an economic recession. A prolonged recession may result in increased overdraft activity and defaults on loans, which could materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
The Bank is currently well capitalized under federal banking regulations that apply to all United States-based banks (see “Capital Ratios” section below for more information on the Bank’s capital position). In the event that future loan and leases loss and/or tax provisions reduce our capital surplus, we would be required to undertake measures to return the Bank's capital ratios to well capitalized levels, which could include but not be limited to raising additional capital or reducing the Banks asset size. We believe that we would have access to equity and debt markets to secure additional capital for the Bank should the need arise, but we have no certainty regarding the extent of the availability of these markets at the time such need would arise.
Increased demand for liquidity by our clients is another impact that we anticipate could occur should the COVID-19 effects be prolonged. As of December 31, 2020, the Company and the Bank's on-balance sheet liquidity was very strong and combined with our contingent liquidity resources, we believe that the Bank has sufficient resources to meet the liquidity needs of our clients. In response to COVID-19, the Federal Reserve has made other provisions that could assist the Bank in satisfying its liquidity needs, such as reducing our reserve requirement to zero, expanding access to the discount window through collateral pledging and extension of term borrowings.
The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic affects the Company’s future financial results and operations will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the duration and broad impacts of the pandemic, and current or future actions in response thereto. Management is working closely with our Board of Directors as we plan and execute our response to the significant disruption caused by the crisis. See Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional discussion of risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
2021 Outlook
As we begin our strategic business plan for 2021, we remained focused on relationship-based expansion throughout our market area. We plan to continue to focus on increasing our loan-to-deposit ratio to expand our net interest margin, while attempting to control expenses and credit losses.
Favorable trends in our economy prompted the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee, or FOMC, to increase the target federal funds by 0.25% in 2016, 0.75% in 2017 and 1.00% in 2018, which was followed by decreases of 0.75% and 1.50% in 2019 and 2020, respectively. The increased market interest rates from 2016 through 2018 had a positive impact on net interest income mainly due to growth of earning assets and the fact that our balance sheet is slightly asset sensitive. In 2019 and 2020, that trend reversed and we recognized yield compression on our earning assets due to the FOMC rate cuts. Even though further FOMC rate cuts are not forecasted for 2021, we expect this negative impact will continue to some degree due to continued repricing of existing loans and investment securities. The potential compression of net interest income and net interest margin could occur if interest rates remain static or decline, given that our balance sheet is asset sensitive to interest rate changes primarily due to the number of variable rate loans and a high level of interest-earning cash balances. This could in turn result in further decrease on the yield of earning assets compared to the cost of deposits and other funds, which remain at historic lows and cannot reasonably be further reduced.
Given our asset sensitive balance sheet, we expect our net interest income to benefit from interest rate increases, but we expect any such benefit to be proportional to the increase in rates. If we experience an increase in our yield on earnings assets, we could then determine to increase the interest rates we pay on our deposit accounts or change our promotional or other interest rates on new deposits in marketing activation programs to attempt to achieve a certain net interest margin. That said, in light of the current economic environment, if the rates increase is modest, it may not be possible to manage the interest margin in this manner, as competitive pressures may dictate that we increase deposit rates at a faster rate than the earning assets increase, thereby offsetting any gains to the net interest margin. The economies and real estate markets in our primary market areas are expected to continue to be significant determinants of the quality of our assets in future periods and, thus, our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.
For 2021, management remains focused on the above challenges and opportunities and other factors affecting the business similar to the factors driving the 2020 results as discussed in this section.
Critical Accounting Policies
Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that effect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. In addition, GAAP itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method, although the economics of our transactions would be the same.
Management has determined the following accounting policies to be critical:
Asset Impairment Judgments
Certain of our assets are carried in our consolidated balance sheets at fair value or at the lower of cost or fair value. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to recognize impairment of such assets. We periodically perform analyses to test for impairment of various assets. In addition to our impairment analyses related to loans, another significant impairment analysis relates to other than temporary declines in the value of our securities.
Loans for which it is probable that payment of interest and principal will not be made in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement are considered impaired and are carried at fair value or below. Appraisals are done periodically on impaired loans and if required, an allowance is established based on the fair value of collateral less the cost related to liquidation of the collateral. In some circumstances, an impaired loan may be charged off to bring the carrying value to fair value.
Net realizable value of the underlying collateral is the fair value of the collateral, less estimated selling costs and any prior liens. Appraisals, recent comparable sales, offers and listing prices are factored in when valuing the collateral. We review and verify the qualifications and licenses of the certified general appraisers used for appraising commercial properties or certified residential appraisers for residential properties. Real estate appraisals may utilize a combination of approaches including replacement cost, sales comparison and the income approach. Comparable sales and income data are analyzed by the appraisers and adjusted to reflect differences between them and the subject property such as type, leasing status and physical condition. When the appraisals are received, management reviews the assumptions and methodology utilized in the appraisal, as well as the overall resulting value in conjunction with independent data sources, such as recent market data and industry-wide statistics. We generally use a 6% discount for selling costs which is applied to all properties, regardless of size. Appraised values may be adjusted to reflect changes in market conditions that have occurred subsequent to the appraisal date, or for revised estimates regarding the timing or cost of the property sale. These adjustments are based on qualitative judgments made by management on a case-by-case basis.
Our available for sale portfolio is carried at estimated fair value, with any unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity. We conduct a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if the value of any security has declined below its carrying value and whether such decline is other than temporary. If such decline is deemed other than temporary, we would adjust the carrying amount of the security by writing down the security to fair value through a charge to current period income for the amount that is determined to be other than temporary. The fair values of our securities are significantly affected by changes in interest rates.
In general, as interest rates rise, we expect that the fair value of fixed-rate securities should decrease; as interest rates fall, we expect that the fair value of fixed-rate securities should increase. With significant changes in interest rates, we evaluate our intent and ability to hold the security for a sufficient time to recover the recorded principal balance. Estimated fair values for securities are based on published or securities dealers’ market values. Market volatility is unpredictable and may impact such values.
Allowance for Loan Losses
Credit risk is inherent in the business of lending and making commercial loans. Accounting for our allowance for loan losses involves significant judgment and assumptions by management and is based on historical data and management’s view of the current economic environment. At least on a quarterly basis, our management reviews the methodology and adequacy of allowance for loan losses and reports its assessment to the Board of Directors for its review and approval.
The allowance for loan losses is an estimate of probable incurred losses with regard to our loans. Our loan loss provision for each period is dependent upon many factors, including loan growth, net charge-offs, changes in the composition of the loans, delinquencies, management's assessment of the quality of the loans, the valuation of problem loans and the general economic conditions in our market area. We base our allowance for loan losses on an estimation of probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio.
Our methodology for assessing loan loss allowances are intended to reduce the differences between estimated and actual losses and involves a detailed analysis of our loan portfolio, in three phases:
● the specific review of individual loans,
● the segmenting and review of loan pools with similar characteristics, and
● our judgmental estimate based on various subjective factors:
The first phase of our methodology involves the specific review of individual loans to identify and measure impairment. We evaluate each loan by use of a risk rating system, except for homogeneous loans, such as automobile loans and home mortgages. Specific risk rated loans are deemed impaired if all amounts, including principal and interest, will likely not be collected in accordance with the contractual terms of the related loan agreement. Impairment for commercial and real estate loans is measured either based on the present value of the loan’s expected future cash flows or, if collection on the loan is collateral dependent, the estimated fair value of the collateral, less selling and holding costs.
The second phase involves the segmenting of the remainder of the risk rated loan portfolio into groups or pools of loans, together with loans with similar characteristics, for evaluation. We determine the calculated loss ratio to each loan pool based on its historical net losses and benchmark it against the levels of other peer banks.
In the third phase, we consider relevant internal and external factors that may affect the collectability of loan portfolio and each group of loan pool. The factors considered are, but are not limited to:
● concentration of credits,
● nature and volume of the loan portfolio,
● delinquency trends,
● non-accrual loan trends,
● problem loan trends,
● loss and recovery trends,
● quality of loan review,
● lending and management staff,
● lending policies and procedures,
● economic and business conditions, and
● other external factors.
Our management estimates the probable effect of such conditions based on our judgment, experience and known or anticipated trends. Such estimation may be reflected as an additional allowance to each group of loans, if necessary. Management reviews these conditions with our senior credit officers. To the extent that any of these conditions is evidenced by a specifically identifiable problem credit or portfolio segment as of the evaluation date, management’s estimate of the effect of such condition may be reflected as a specific allowance applicable to such credit or portfolio segment.
Central to our credit risk management and our assessment of appropriate loss allowance is our loan risk rating system. Under this system, the originating credit officer assigns borrowers an initial risk rating based on a thorough analysis of each borrower’s financial capacity in conjunction with industry and economic trends. Approvals are made based upon the amount of inherent credit risk specific to the transaction and are reviewed for appropriateness by senior line and credit administration personnel. Credits are monitored by line and credit administration personnel for deterioration in a borrower’s financial condition which may impact the ability of the borrower to perform under the contract. Although management has allocated a portion of the allowance to specific loans, specific loan pools, and off-balance sheet credit exposures (which are reported separately as part of other liabilities), the adequacy of the allowance is considered in its entirety.
It is the policy of management to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level adequate for risks inherent in the overall loan portfolio, however, the loan portfolio can be adversely affected if the state of California’s economic conditions and its real estate market in our general market area were to further deteriorate or weaken. Additionally, further weakness of a prolonged nature in the agricultural and general economy would have a negative impact on the local market. The effect of such economic events, although uncertain and unpredictable at this time, could result in an increase in the levels of nonperforming loans and additional loan losses, which could adversely affect our future growth and profitability. No assurance of the level of predicted credit losses can be given with any certainty.
Non-Accrual Loan Policy
Interest on loans is credited to income as earned and is accrued only if deemed collectible. Accrual of interest is discontinued when a loan is over 90 days delinquent or if management believes that collection is highly uncertain. Generally, payments received on nonaccrual loans are recorded as principal reductions. Interest income is recognized after all principal has been repaid or an improvement in the condition of the loan has occurred that would warrant resumption of interest accruals.
Income Taxes
Deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled using the liability method. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes.
We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and the state of California. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal or state/local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2016.
Fair Value Measurements
We use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures. We base our fair values on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Securities available for sale, derivatives, and loans held for sale, if any, are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, we may be required to record certain assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis, such as certain impaired loans held for investment and securities held to maturity that are other-than-temporarily impaired. These non-recurring fair value adjustments typically involve write-downs of individual assets due to application of lower-of-cost or market accounting.
We have established and documented a process for determining fair value. We maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements. Whenever there is no readily available market data, management uses its best estimate and assumptions in determining fair value, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, our recorded earnings or disclosures could have been materially different from those reflected in these financial statements. For detailed information on our use of fair value measurements and our related valuation methodologies, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326). This update revises the methodology used by financial institutions under GAAP to recognize credit losses in the financial statements. Currently, GAAP requires the use of the incurred loss model, whereby financial institutions recognize in current period earnings, incurred credit losses and those inherent in the financial statements, as of the date of the balance sheet. This guidance results in a new model for estimating the allowance for loan and lease losses, commonly referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss (“CECL”) model. Under the CECL model, financial institutions are required to estimate future credit losses and recognize those losses in current period earnings. The amendments within the update are effective for fiscal years and all interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. In October 2019, FASB approved an amendment that will delay the adoption of this ASU for three years for certain entities including the Company since we are classified as a Small Reporting Company. Accordingly, this ASU will become effective for the Company on January 1, 2023. Upon adoption of the amendments within this update, the Company will be required to make a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact the adoption of this update will have on its financial statements. While the Company has not quantified the impact of this ASU, it does expect changing from the current incurred loss model to an expected loss model will result in an earlier recognition of losses.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Subtopic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. The provisions of the update eliminate the existing second step of the goodwill impairment test which provides for the allocation of reporting unit fair value among existing assets and liabilities, with the net leftover amount representing the implied fair value of goodwill. In replacement of the existing goodwill impairment rule, the update will provide that impairment should be recognized as the excess of any of the reporting unit’s goodwill over the fair value of the reporting unit. Under the provisions of this update, the amount of the impairment is limited to the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. For public business entities that are Securities and Exchange Commission filers, the amendments of the update became effective in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company adopted the standards update January 1, 2020 and evaluates goodwill in accordance with the provisions of the standard. Due to the economic impact that COVID-19 has had on the Company, management concluded that factors such as the decline in macroeconomic conditions have led to the occurrence of a triggering event and therefore an interim impairment test over goodwill was performed as of September 30, 2020. As part of this interim impairment assessment, in the event that the Company concluded that all or a portion of its goodwill is impaired, a non-cash charge for the amount of such impairment would be recorded to earnings. Such a charge would have no impact on tangible capital or regulatory capital. Based upon the results of our interim goodwill assessment, we have concluded that an impairment did not exist as of the time of the assessment.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Subtopic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. The primary focus of ASU 2018-13 is to improve the effectiveness of the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The changes affected all companies that are required to include fair value measurement disclosures. In general, the amendments in ASU 2018-13 are effective for all entities for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. An entity is permitted to early adopt the removed or modified disclosures upon the issuance of ASU 2018-13 and may delay adoption of the additional disclosures, which are required for public companies only, until their effective date. The Company first adopted this ASU beginning with the period ended March 31, 2020, and it did not have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
In April 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments that clarifies and improves areas of guidance related to recently issued standards on credit losses, hedging and recognition and measurement. The provisions of this ASU are effective January 1, 2020 and contain various methods of adoption. This ASU did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
In May 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-05, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Targeted Transition Relief. This ASU allows an option for entities to irrevocably elect the fair value option on an instrument-by-instrument basis for eligible financial assets measured at amortized cost basis upon adoption of the credit loss standards. This amendment provides relief for those entities electing the fair value option on newly originated or purchased financial assets, while maintaining existing similar financial assets at amortized cost, avoiding the requirement to maintain dual measurement methods for similar assets. The fair value option does not apply to held-to-maturity debt securities. The effective date for this ASU is the same as for ASU 2016-13, as discussed above. We will evaluate this ASU in conjunction with ASU 2016-13 to determine its impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
In March 2020, FASB issued ASU 2020-04 - Reference Rate Reform (Subtopic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. This ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or other reference rates expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The ASU is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company is in the process of evaluating the provisions of this ASU and its effects on our consolidated financial statements.
Results of Operations
The Company earns income from two primary sources. The first is net interest income, which is interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities. The second is noninterest income, which primarily consists of deposit service charges and fees, the increase in cash surrender value of life insurance, investment advisory service fee income and mortgage commissions. The majority of the Company's noninterest expenses are operating costs that relate to providing a full range of banking services to our customers.
Overview
We recorded net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $13,687,000 or $1.68 per diluted share compared to $12,489,000 or $1.54 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to an increase of $3,923,000 in net interest income, mainly from PPP loan fees and interest income and the growth of our loan and investment portfolios. Non-interest income decreased by $232,000 in 2020, mainly as a result of decreased NSF revenue due to higher cash balances in checking deposit accounts. The provision for loan losses increased by $1,620,000 in 2020 due to qualitative adjustments in the loan loss reserve corresponding to COVID-19 pandemic. Non-interest expense increased by $1,017,000 associated with staffing and general operating overhead increases to support the growth of our loan and deposit portfolios.
Highlights of the financial results are presented in the following table:
Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin
Our primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is the difference between interest and fees derived from earning assets and interest paid on liabilities obtained to fund those assets. Our net interest income is affected by changes in the level and mix of interest-earning assets and interest- bearing liabilities, referred to as volume changes. Our net interest income is also affected by changes in the yields earned on assets and rates paid on liabilities, referred to as rate changes. Interest rates charged on our loans are affected principally by the demand for such loans, the supply of money available for lending purposes and competitive factors. Those factors are, in turn, affected by general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control, such as federal economic policies, the general supply of money in the economy, legislative tax policies, governmental budgetary matters, and the actions of the Federal Reserve Board.
For a detailed analysis of interest income and interest expense, see the “Average Balance Sheets” and the “Rate/Volume Analysis” below.
(1)
Loan fees have been included in the calculation of interest income.
(2)
Yields on municipal securities and loans have been adjusted to their fully-taxable equivalents (FTE), based on a federal marginal tax rate of 21.0%.
(3)
Represents the average rate earned on interest-earning assets less the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities.
(4)
Represents net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets.
Net interest income, on a fully tax equivalent basis (“FTE”), increased $4,176,000 or 10.0% to $45,884,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $41,708,000 in 2019. Net interest spread and net interest margin were 3.52% and 3.59%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 4.03% and 4.13%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019. This downward trend is mainly due to the FOMC rate cuts in March 2020 of 1.50% resulting in a decrease in earning asset yields, as described below.
Our earning asset yield decreased 61 basis points in 2020 compared to 2019. The yield on loans recognized a decrease of 57 basis points for 2020 compared to 2019, which was primarily due to repricing of variable rate loans and lower rate indexes on new loans, resulting from the FOMC rate cuts in March 2020. The FOMC cut rates by 0.25% three times in 2019 with the first one in August and again by 1.50% in March 2020, so rates on average were significantly lower in 2020, as compared to 2019. Further compressing loan yield was the funding of $244 million in PPP loans beginning in April 2020, which only earned a contractual interest rate of 1.00%. The decrease in loan yield was minimized by the $3,091,000 in PPP net loan fees and costs recognized during 2020, which was paid by the SBA and is scheduled to be deferred over the life of the PPP loans. Also offsetting the earning asset yield compression was growth in the loan and investment portfolio average balances of $213,323,000 and $19,382,000, respectively, in 2020 as compared to 2019.
The cost of funds on interest-bearing liabilities decreased to 0.16% in 2020 compared to 0.26% in 2019 as our excess liquidity has allowed us to keep deposit rates at historic lows and even make some downward adjustments on certain accounts. Average non-interest-bearing demand deposit balances increased by $155,883,000 in 2020 compared to 2019, which contributed in lowering our cost of funds on total deposits.
The net interest margin compression the Company recognized in 2020, is due to the factors discussed above which could possibly result in further compression if rate indexes on assets were to fall, and/or: 1) deposit interest rates remain at historic lows from which they cannot reasonably be further reduced, 2) competition in the lending market restrict significant increases in new loan rates, and 3) deposit growth out-paces loan growth as recognized in recent years, resulting in higher interest-bearing cash balances, which yield approximately 0.10% as of December 31, 2020.
Changes in volume resulted in an increase in net interest income (on a FTE basis) of $11,636,000 for the year of 2020 compared to the year 2019, and changes in interest rates and the mix resulted in a decrease in net interest income (on a FTE basis) of $7,460,000 for the year 2020 versus the year 2019. Management closely monitors both total net interest income and the net interest margin.
Market rates are in part based on the FOMC target Federal funds interest rate (the interest rate banks charge each other for short-term borrowings). The change in the Federal funds sold rates is the result of target rate changes implemented by the FOMC. In 2008, there were seven downward adjustments to the target rate totaling 325 basis points, bringing the target interest rate to a historic low with a range of 0% to 0.25% where it remained until December 2015 when the FOMC increased by 0.25% to a range of 0.25% to 0.50%. The FOMC increased the Federal funds rate again in December 2016 by 0.25% to a range of 0.50% to 0.75%. In 2017, the FOMC increased the Federal funds rate by 0.25% on three occasions resulting in a range of 1.25% to 1.50% as of December 31, 2017. In 2018, the FOMC increased the Federal funds rate by 0.25% on four occasions resulting in a range of 2.25% to 2.50% as of December 31, 2018. In 2019, the FOMC decreased the Federal funds rate by 0.25% on three occasions resulting in a range of 1.50% to 1.75% as of December 31, 2019. In 2020, the FOMC decreased the Federal funds rate by 0.50% and 1.00% on two occasions in March resulting in a range of 0.00% to 0.25% as of December 31, 2020.
Rate/Volume Analysis
The following table below sets forth certain information regarding changes in interest income and interest expense of the Company for the periods indicated. For each category of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to (i) changes in volume (change in average volume multiplied by old rate); and (ii) changes in rates (change in rate multiplied by old average volume). Changes in rate/volume (change in rate multiplied by the change in volume) have been allocated to the changes due to volume and rate in proportion to the absolute value of the changes due to volume and rate prior to the allocation.

Loan fees have been included in the calculation of interest income.
Provision for Loan Losses
Credit risk is inherent in the business of making loans. The Company establishes an allowance for loan losses through charges to earnings, which are shown in the consolidated statements of income as the provision for loan losses. Specifically identifiable and quantifiable losses are promptly charged off against the allowance. The Company maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level that it considers to be adequate to provide for credit losses inherent in its loan portfolio. Management determines the level of the allowance by performing a quarterly analysis that considers concentrations of credit, past loss experience, current economic conditions, the amount and composition of the loan portfolio (including nonperforming and potential problem loans), estimated fair value of underlying collateral, and other information relevant to assessing the risk of loss inherent in the loan portfolio such as loan growth, net charge-offs, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio, and delinquencies. As a result of management’s analysis, a range of the potential amount of the allowance for loan losses is determined.
The Company recorded provision for loan losses of $2,165,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020 to provide an adequate loan loss reserve for the new loan funding and to make a qualitative adjustment corresponding to the COVID-19 pandemic, as compared to provisions of $545,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The Company did not have any nonperforming loans at December 31, 2020 as compared to $1,103,000 at December 31, 2019, or 0.15% of total loans. Nonperforming loans are primarily in nonperforming real estate construction and development loans. The allowance for loan losses was $11,297,000 and $9,146,000 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, or 1.12% and 1.22%, respectively, of total loans. The decrease as a percentage of total loans is due to the $211 million in PPP loans outstanding as of December 31, 2020 that do not require a reserve as they are fully guaranteed by the U.S. government through the SBA program. The strong credit quality has resulted in relatively low net charge-off totals of $14,000 in 2020 and $84,000 in 2019.
The Company will continue to monitor the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and make additions to the allowance in accordance with the analysis referred to above. Because of uncertainties inherent in estimating the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses, actual results may differ from management’s estimate of credit losses and the related allowance.
Noninterest Income
The following table sets forth a summary of noninterest income for the periods indicated:
Noninterest income was $4,815,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $5,047,000 for the year 2019. Service charge income decreased to $1,272,000 compared to $1,619,000 for 2019, due to higher balances held in checking deposit accounts and a change in spending patterns due to the COVID-19 pandemic leading to less overdraft activity and NSF fee income. Debit card transaction fee income increased to $1,355,000 in 2020 as compared to $1,297,000 in 2019, as a result of the increase in the aggregate number of transaction deposit accounts and corresponding service fee income, and the aforementioned spending pattern shift to debit cards due to the COVID-19 stay at home orders. Earnings on the cash surrender value of life insurance recognized an increase of $92,000 in 2020 compared to 2019, due to four new life insurance policies that began earning revenue in July of 2019. Mortgage commissions have increased by $42,000 for the year 2020, as compared to 2019, as a result of the increased demand for home purchases and refinancing. Gains on called securities decreased from $138,000 in 2019 to $2,000 in 2020, mainly due to one security that was called during the first quarter of 2019. There was one sale of an OREO property in 2020, which resulted in a gain of $34,000 as compared to no sales or corresponding gains in 2019. In 2020, other income increased by $25,000, which was attributable to investment advisory fee income increases. The Company continues to evaluate its deposit product offerings with the intention of continuing to expand its offerings to the consumer and business depositors.
Noninterest Expense
The following table sets forth a summary of noninterest expenses for the periods indicated:
Noninterest expense was $29,864,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $1,017,000 or 3.5% compared to $28,847,000 for the year ended 2019. Salaries and employee benefits increased by $572,000 in 2020 to $17,972,000 compared to the prior year, due to expanding our staff to support loan and deposit growth. Included in the salary and benefit expense total is deferred loan cost GAAP accounting adjustments of $1,253,000 against salary expense in 2020, corresponding to PPP loans funded.
Occupancy expense realized an increase of $149,000 in 2020 compared to the prior year, primarily from depreciation expense on new ATM machines purchased for our branches and rent increases on certain branch locations.
Data processing costs increased in 2020 over 2019 by $155,000, primarily due to servicing costs on the growing number of loan and deposit accounts.
FDIC and DFPI regulatory assessments increased by $54,000 in 2020 compared to 2019. In January 2019, the FDIC sent notification that small banks less than $10 billion would receive assessment credits for the portion of their assessments that contributed to the growth in the Deposit Insurance Fund Reserve Ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%, to be applied when the reserve ratio reached 1.38%. That threshold was achieved in early 2019 and therefore the Company did not recognize any expense for FDIC assessments during the third quarter of 2019. Additionally, the initial base assessment rate for financial institutions varies based on the overall risk profile of the institution as defined by the FDIC and our risk profile was stable during 2019 and 2020, with a slight improvement for both years in asset quality metrics that are included in the risk profile. We expect that the relatively low assessment rate should be offset by deposit growth in 2021. The increase to our recorded expense in 2020 was due to the aforementioned credit that was recognized in 2019 and higher deposit balances in 2020, as the FDIC assessment rates are applied to average quarterly total liabilities as the primary basis. Management is also aware of the potential for further assessment credits to be recognized in future periods if the FDIC reserve ratio remains above 1.38%.
Other operating expenses increased by $87,000 or 1.5% to $5,864,000 in 2020, primarily as a result of various general operating expense increases required to support our growing business portfolios and compliance mandates, some of which included telephone and data communications, software license fees, advertising and charitable contributions.
Management anticipates that noninterest expense should continue to increase as we continue to grow, and management believes the Company’s administration as currently set up is scalable to handle future deposit growth. However, management remains committed to cost-control and efficiency, and we expect to keep these increases to a minimum relative to growth.
Provision for Income Taxes
We reported a provision for income taxes of $4,056,000 and $4,200,000 for the years 2020 and 2019, respectively. The effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations was 22.9% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 25.2% for the year 2019. These provisions reflect accruals for taxes at the applicable rates for federal income tax and California franchise tax based upon reported pre-tax income and adjusted for the effects of all permanent differences between income for tax and financial reporting purposes (such as earnings on qualified municipal securities, BOLI and certain tax-exempt loans).
Financial Condition
The Company’s total assets were $1,511,478,000 at December 31, 2020 compared to $1,147,785,000 at December 31, 2019, an increase of $363,693,000 or 31.7%. Net loans increased by $256,199,000, of which $210,822,000 was from PPP loans, investments increased $27,204,000, bank premises and equipment increased $541,000, interest receivable and other assets increased $90,000, while cash and cash equivalents increased $79,062,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019.
Loans gross of the allowance for loan losses and deferred fees were $1,013,115,000 at December 31, 2020, compared to $750,985,000 at December 31, 2019, an increase of $262,130,000 or 34.9%. The increase was due to an increase of $54,329,000 or 9.0% in commercial real estate loans, an increase of $214,302,000 or 275.8% in commercial and industrial loans which included growth of $210,822,000 from PPP loans, a decrease of $6,398,000 or 16.9% in consumer loans and consumer residential loans and a decrease of $103,000 or 0.4% in agriculture loans. The PPP loans changed the composition of the loan portfolio categories, but excluding those loans, the composition remained relatively unchanged as a percentage of total loans, with commercial real estate comprising 65% and 81% of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Deposits increased $347,880,000 or 34.1% to $1,367,809,000 at December 31, 2020 compared to $1,019,929,000 at December 31, 2019. Demand, Money Market and Savings increased by $243,226,000, $67,980,000 and $37,763,000, respectively, while Time Deposits decreased by $1,089,000 as of December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019.
There were no short-term borrowing or long-term debt outstanding balances at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The Company uses short-term borrowings, primarily short-term FHLB advances, to fund short-term liquidity needs and manage net interest margin.
Equity increased $17,124,000 or 15.2% to $129,694,000 at December 31, 2020, compared to $112,570,000 at December 31, 2019.
Investment Activities
Investments are a key source of interest income. Management of our investment portfolio is set in accordance with strategies developed and overseen by our Investment Committee. Investment balances, including cash equivalents and interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions, are subject to change over time based on our asset/liability funding needs and interest rate risk management objectives. Our liquidity levels take into consideration anticipated future cash flows and all available sources of credits and are maintained at levels management believes are appropriate to assure future flexibility in meeting anticipated funding needs.
Cash Equivalents and Interest-bearing Deposits in other Financial Institutions
The Company holds federal funds sold, unpledged available-for-sale securities and salable government guaranteed loans to help meet liquidity requirements and provide temporary holdings until the funds can be otherwise deployed or invested. As of December 31, 2020, and 2019, we had $33,085,000 and $13,785,000, respectively, in federal funds sold.
Investment Securities
Management of our investment securities portfolio focuses on providing an adequate level of liquidity and establishing an interest rate-sensitive position, while earning an adequate level of investment income without taking undue risk. Investment securities that we intend to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity securities, and all other investment securities are classified as either available-for-sale or equity securities. Currently, all of our investment securities are classified as available-for-sale, except for one mutual fund classified as an equity security.
The fair value of the equity security was $3,425,000 and $3,297,000 at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Consistent with ASU 2016-01, equity securities are carried at fair value with the changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of income. Accordingly, the Company recognized an unrealized gain of $48,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to an unrealized gain of $101,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019.
Our available for sale investment securities holdings increased by $27,076,000 or 14.2% to $217,164,000 at December 31, 2020, compared to holdings of $190,088,000 at December 31, 2019. The carrying values of available-for-sale investment securities are adjusted for unrealized gains or losses as a valuation allowance and any gain or loss is reported on an after-tax basis as a component of other comprehensive income.
Total investment securities as a percentage of total assets decreased to 14.6% as of December 31, 2020 compared to 16.8% at December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, $147,795,000 of the investment securities were pledged to secure public deposits.
As of December 31, 2020, the total unrealized loss on debt securities that were in a loss position for less than 12 continuous months was $59,000 with an aggregate fair value of $11,362,000. The total unrealized loss on debt securities that were in a loss position for greater than 12 continuous months was $529,000 with an aggregate fair value of $36,082,000.
The following table summarizes the book value and fair value and distribution of our debt investment securities, which does not include equity securities, as of the dates indicated:
Debt Investment Securities Portfolio
At December 31, 2020, fourteen asset-backed securities, seven Small Business Administration pools, three corporate debts, one U.S. agency, and one collateralized mortgage obligations make up the total debt securities in an unrealized loss position for greater than 12 months. At December 31, 2020, seven asset backed securities and three U.S. agencies make up the total debt securities in a loss position for less than 12 months. Management periodically evaluates each available-for-sale investment security in an unrealized loss position to determine if the impairment is temporary or other than temporary. This evaluation encompasses various factors including, the nature of the investment, the cause of the impairment, the severity and duration of the impairment, credit ratings and other credit related factors such as third party guarantees and the volatility of the security’s fair value. Management has determined that no investment security is other than temporarily impaired. The unrealized losses are due primarily to interest rate changes and the Company does not intend to sell the securities and it is not likely that the Company will be required to sell the securities before the earlier of the forecasted recovery or the maturity of the underlying investment security. As of December 31, 2020, we did not have any investment securities that constituted 10% or more of the stockholders’ equity of any third-party issuer.
The following table summarizes the maturity and repricing schedule of our debt investment securities, which does not include equity securities, at their amortized cost and their weighted average yields at December 31, 2020:
Debt Investment Maturities and Repricing Schedule
Yields in the above table have been adjusted to a fully tax equivalent basis. Securities are reported at the earliest possible call, repricing or maturity date.
Loans
The following table sets forth the amount of total loans outstanding (including net deferred loan fees and costs) and the percentage distributions in each category, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Commercial real estate loans increased $54,329,000 in 2020 as compared to 2019, due to the increased demand by qualified borrowers in our serving area. Of the commercial real estate loans at December 31, 2020, 64% are non-owner occupied and 36% are owner occupied. Our commercial real estate loan portfolio is weighted towards term loans for which the primary source of repayment is cash flow from net operating income of the real estate property.
Commercial and industrial loans increased $214,302,000 in 2020 as compared to 2019, mainly due to the $210,822,000 in PPP loans outstanding at December 31, 2020 that were all funded during 2020 in response to the pandemic relief legislation. We have historically targeted well-established local businesses with strong guarantors that have proven to be resilient in periods of economic stress.
Our residential loan portfolio includes no sub-prime loans, nor is it our normal practice to underwrite loans commonly referred to as "Alt-A mortgages", the characteristics of which are loans lacking full documentation, borrowers having low FICO scores or collateral compositions reflecting high loan-to-value ratios. Substantially all of our residential loans are indexed to Treasury Constant Maturity Rates and have provisions to reset five years after their origination dates.
The following table summarizes our commercial real estate loan portfolio by the geographic location in which the property is located as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Construction and land loans are classified as commercial real estate loans and decreased $23.8 million in 2020 as compared to 2019. The table below shows an analysis of construction and land loans by type and location. Non-owner-occupied land loans of $5.3 million at December 31, 2020 included loans for lands specified for commercial development of $2.0 million and for residential development of $3.3 million, the majority of which are located in Stanislaus County.
Loan Maturities
The following table shows the contractual maturity distribution and repricing intervals of the outstanding loans in our portfolio, as of December 31, 2020. In addition, the table shows the distribution of such loans between those with variable or floating interest rates and those with fixed or predetermined interest rates. The large majority of the variable rate loans are tied to independent indices (such as the Wall Street Journal prime rate or a Treasury Constant Maturity Rate). Substantially all loans with an original term of more than five years have provisions for the fixed rates to reset, or convert to a variable rate, after one, three or five years and are therefore classified as a variable rate loan in the table below.
The majority of the properties taken as collateral are located in Northern California. We employ strict guidelines regarding the use of collateral located in less familiar market areas. Positive trends in Northern California real estate values, the low loan-to-value ratios in our commercial real estate portfolio, and the high percentage of owner-occupied properties further solidify our credit quality position.
Nonperforming Assets
Financial institutions generally have a certain level of exposure to credit quality risk and could potentially receive less than a full return of principal and interest if a debtor becomes unable or unwilling to repay. Since loans are the most significant assets of the Company and generate the largest portion of its revenues, the Company's management of credit quality risk is focused primarily on loan quality. Banks have generally suffered their most severe earnings declines due to customers' inability to generate sufficient cash flow to service their debts and/or downturns in national and regional economies which have brought about declines in overall property values. In addition, certain debt securities that the Company may purchase have the potential of declining in value if the obligor's financial capacity to repay deteriorates.
Nonperforming assets consist of loans on non-accrual status, loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest, loans restructured, where the terms of repayment have been renegotiated resulting in a reduction or deferral of interest or principal and OREO.
Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when they become 90 days past due, unless management believes the loan is adequately collateralized and in the process of collection. The past due loans may or may not be adequately collateralized, but collection efforts are continuously pursued. Loans may be restructured by management when a borrower has experienced some changes in financial status, causing an inability to meet the original repayment terms, and where we believe the borrower will eventually overcome those circumstances and repay the loan in full. OREO consists of properties acquired by foreclosure or similar means and which management intends to offer for sale.
The Company did not have any nonperforming loans at December 31, 2020, as compared to $1.1 million at December 31, 2019. The ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans was 0.0% and 0.15% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
In addition, the Company held one OREO property as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, a residential land property that was acquired through foreclosure that was written down to a zero balance because the public utilities have not been obtainable, thereby rendering these land lots unmarketable at this time.
Management believes that the reserve provided for nonperforming loans, together with the tangible collateral, were adequate as of December 31, 2020. See “Allowance for Loan Losses” below for further discussion. Except as disclosed above, as of December 31, 2020, management was not aware of any material credit problems of borrowers that would cause it to have serious doubts about the ability of a borrower to comply with the present loan payment terms. However, no assurance can be given that credit problems may exist that may not have been brought to the attention of management, or that credit problems may not arise in the future.
The following table provides information with respect to the components of our nonperforming assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. (The figures in the table are net of the portion guaranteed by the U.S. Government):
(1) During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, no interest income related to these loans was included in net income while on nonaccrual status. Additional interest income of approximately $62,000 would have been recorded during the year ended December 31, 2019, if these loans had been paid in accordance with their original terms.
(2) A “restructured loan” is one the terms of which were renegotiated to provide a concession because of deterioration in the financial position of the borrower.
Allowance for Loan Losses
In anticipation of credit risk inherent in our lending business, we set aside allowances through charges to earnings. Such charges are not only made for the outstanding loan portfolio, but also for off-balance sheet items, such as commitments to extend credits or letters of credit. The charges made for the outstanding loan portfolio are credited to the allowance for loan losses, whereas charges for off-balance sheet items are credited to the reserve for off-balance sheet items, which is presented as a component of other liabilities. The provision for loan losses is discussed in the section entitled “Provision for Loan Losses” above.
The balance of our allowance for loan losses is management's best estimate of the probable losses inherent in the portfolio. The ultimate adequacy of the allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control, including the real estate market, changes in interest rate and economic and political environments.
In recent years, the economic recovery has had a positive impact on the financial stability of our borrowers resulting in improvements in credit quality of our loan portfolio which has allowed us to reduce the reserve for loan losses as a percentage of gross loans. In 2020, the economy slipped into a recession following the COVID-19 pandemic which inevitability impacted the financial condition of certain borrowers. We responded by making qualitative risk-based discretionary adjustments in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic and corresponding economic stress. This adjustment combined with regular provisions corresponding to loan growth, resulted in an increase of $2,151,000 in the allowance for loan losses to $11,297,000 at December 31, 2020, as compared with $9,146,000 at December 31, 2019. In 2020, the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans decreased to 1.12% as of December 31, 2019, as compared to 1.22% as of December 31, 2019. This decrease as a percentage of total loans is due to the outstanding PPP loans that do not require a loan loss reserve as they are guaranteed by the federal government through the SBA program. Based on the current conditions of the loan portfolio, management believes that the $11,297,000 allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2020 is adequate to absorb losses inherent in our loan portfolio. No assurance can be given, however, that adverse economic conditions or other circumstances will not result in increased losses in the portfolio.
Diversification, low loan-to-values, strong credit quality and enhanced credit monitoring contribute to a reduction in the portfolio’s overall risk in recent years and help to offset the economic risk corresponding to the current COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to monitor the impact of the economic environment, and adjustments to the provision for loan loss will be made accordingly. During 2020, the Company recognized net loan charge-offs of $14,000 as compared to $84,000 in 2019.
Management reviews these conditions with our senior credit officers. To the extent that any of these conditions is evidenced by a specifically identifiable problem credit or portfolio segment as of the evaluation date, management’s estimate of the effect of such condition may be reflected as a specific allowance applicable to such credit or portfolio segment. Although management has allocated a portion of the allowance to specific loan categories, the adequacy of the allowance is considered in its entirety.
Our allowance for loan losses consisted of amounts allocated to three phases of our methodology for assessing loan loss allowances, as follows (see details of methodology for assessing allowance for loan losses in the section entitled “Critical Accounting Policies”):
The Components of the Allowance for Loan Losses
As stated previously in "Critical Accounting Policies," the overall allowance consists of a specific allowance for individually identified impaired loans, an allowance factor for categories of credits with similar characteristics and trends, and an allowance for changing environmental factors.
The first component, the specific allowance, results from the analysis of identified problem credits and the evaluation of sources of repayment including collateral, as applicable. Through management's ongoing loan grading process, individual loans are identified that have conditions that indicate the borrower may be unable to pay all amounts due under the contractual terms. These loans are evaluated individually by management and specified allowances for loan losses are established when the discounted cash flows of future payments or collateral value of collateral-dependent loans are lower than the recorded investment in the loan. Generally, with problem credits that are collateral-dependent, we obtain appraisals of the collateral at least annually. We may obtain appraisals more frequently if we believe the collateral value is subject to market volatility, if a specific event has occurred to the collateral (e.g. tentative map has been filed), or if we believe foreclosure is imminent. Impaired loan balances decreased from $1,103,000 at December 31, 2019 to a zero balance at December 31, 2020. The specific allowance totaled $680,000 at December 31, 2019, and zero as of December 31, 2020, as we charge off substantially all of our estimated losses related to specifically identified impaired loans as the losses are identified.
The second component, the allowance factor, is an estimate of the probable inherent losses in each loan pool stratified by major categories or loans with similar characteristics in our loan portfolio. This analysis encompasses segmenting and reviewing historical losses, loan grades by pool and current general economic and business conditions. Confirmation of the quality of our grading process is obtained by independent reviews conducted by consultants specifically hired for this purpose and by various bank regulatory agencies. This analysis covers our entire loan portfolio but excludes any loans that were analyzed individually for specific allowances as discussed above. There are limitations to any credit risk grading process. The number of loans makes it impractical to review every loan every quarter. Therefore, it is possible that in the future, some currently performing loans not recently graded will not be as strong as their last grading and an insufficient portion of the allowance will have been allocated to them. Grading and loan review often must be done without knowing whether all relevant facts are at hand. Troubled borrowers may deliberately or inadvertently omit important information from reports or conversations with lending officers regarding their financial condition and the diminished strength of repayment sources.
The total amount allocated for the second component is determined by applying loss estimation factors based on loss history to outstanding loans. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the allowance allocated by categories of credits totaled $4.5 million and $5.3 million, respectively.
The third component of the allowance for loan losses is an economic and qualitative component that is intended to absorb losses caused by portfolio trends, concentration of credit, growth, and economic trends, as stated previously in "Critical Accounting Policies". At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the general valuation allowance, including the economic component, totaled $6.8 million and $3.1 million, respectively. The increase is due in part to the qualitative risk-based adjustments pertaining to inherent risk associated with the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. While published economic data indicates that the economy is recovering from a recession cycle prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is uncertain that the recovery cycle will continue for any definite period of time. In response to this, we have been proactive in evaluating reserve percentages for economic and other qualitative loss factors used to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. The increase to the third component of the allowance for loan losses reflected such evaluation.
The table below summarizes, for the periods indicated, loan balances at the end of each period, the daily averages during the period, changes in the allowance for loan losses arising from loans charged off, recoveries on loans previously charged off, additions to the allowance and certain ratios related to the allowance for loan losses:

Other Earning Assets
For various business purposes, we make investments in earning assets other than the interest-earning securities and loans discussed above. The primary other earning assets held by the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, includes the cash surrender value of the BOLI policies, Federal Home Loan Bank stock and Federal Reserve Bank stock. During 2019, we purchased 4 new life insurance policies on certain directors and employees for a total investment of $5 million. During 2018, we committed to invest $5 million in a low-income housing tax credit fund (“LIHTC”) to promote our participation in CRA activities, which had an unfunded commitment of $1,425,000 as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we held another LIHTC investment that we’ve participated in since 2006, for which the original investment was $1 million, and there were no unfunded commitments as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. For both LIHTC investments, we receive the return in the form of tax credits and tax deductions over a period of approximately 15 years. In 2017, we made a $1 million commitment as a limited partner, to a small business private equity partnership to promote our participation in CRA activities. Returns will be received in the form of dividends from the general partner. As of December 31, 2020, we have remaining commitments to fund an additional $470,000 on this investment.
The balances of other earning assets as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 were as follows:
Deposits and Other Sources of Funds
Deposits
Total deposits at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $1,367,809,000 and $1,019,929,000, respectively, representing an increase of $347,880,000 or 34.1% in 2020. The average deposits for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $254,121,000 or 26.3% to $1,218,56,000 compared to $964,444,000 at December 31, 2019.
Deposits are the Company’s primary source of funds. Due to strategic emphasis by management, core deposits (based on definition provided by FDIC’s Uniform Bank Performance Report) increased by $350.1 million or 35.0% in 2020 to $1.35 billion at December 31, 2020. The percentage of core deposits to total deposits increased slightly to 98.8% at December 31, 2020 as compared to 98.2% at December 31, 2019. The average rate paid on time deposits in denominations of over $250,000 was 0.28% and 0.47% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The composition and cost of the Company's deposit base are important components in analyzing the Company's net interest margin and balance sheet liquidity characteristics, both of which are discussed in greater detail in other sections herein. See “Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin” for further discussion.
The Company's liquidity is impacted by the volatility of deposits or other funding instruments or, in other words, by the propensity of that money to leave the institution for rate-related or other reasons. Deposits can be adversely affected if economic conditions in California and the Company's market area in particular, continue to weaken. Potentially, the most volatile deposits in a financial institution are jumbo certificates of deposit, meaning time deposits with balances that equal or exceed $250,000, as customers with balances of that magnitude are typically more rate-sensitive than customers with smaller balances.
The following tables summarize the distribution of average daily deposits and the average daily rates paid for the periods indicated:
Distribution of Average Daily Deposits
The scheduled maturities of our time deposits in denominations of more than $250,000 at December 31, 2020 are as follows:
Maturities of Time Deposits over $250,000
(Dollars in Thousands)
Because our client base is comprised primarily of commercial and industrial accounts, individual account balances are generally higher than those of consumer-oriented banks. Three of our clients carry deposit balances of more than 1% of our total deposits, none of which had a deposit balance of more than 3% of total deposits at December 31, 2020. The Company had no brokered deposits as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
FHLB Borrowings
Although deposits are the primary source of funds for our lending and investment activities and for general business purposes, we may obtain advances from the FHLB as an alternative to retail deposit funds. We had no outstanding balances as of December 31, 2020 but did advance $50 million during the second quarter of 2020 in anticipation of PPP loan fundings, which was fully paid off by July 2020. The average balance of FHLB advances outstanding in 2020 was $10.8 million for which we paid an average interest rate of 0.32%. We had no outstanding balances as of December 31, 2019 or at any time during 2019. See “Liquidity Management” below for the details on the FHLB borrowings program.
Return on Equity and Assets
The following table sets forth certain information regarding our return on equity and assets for the periods indicated:
Deferred Compensation Obligations
We maintain a nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plan for certain key management personnel. Under this plan, participating employees may defer compensation, which will entitle them to receive certain payments upon retirement, death, or disability. The plan provides for payments commencing upon retirement and reduced benefits upon early retirement, disability, or termination of employment. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, our aggregate payment obligations under this plan totaled $10.6 million and $9.9 million, respectively.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
During the ordinary course of business, we provide various forms of credit lines to meet the financing needs of our customers. These commitments, which represent a credit risk to us, are not represented in any form on our balance sheets.
As of December 31, 2020, and 2019, we had commitments to extend credit of $145.7 million and $164.7 million, respectively. Obligations under standby letters of credit, included in total commitments to extend credit, were $2.9 million and $3.1 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and there were no obligations under commercial letters of credit for either period.
The effect on our revenues, expenses, cash flows and liquidity from the unused portion of the commitments to provide credit cannot be reasonably predicted because there is no guarantee that the lines of credit will be used. For more information regarding our off balance sheet arrangements, see Note 13- Commitments and Other Contingencies- to our 2020 year-end consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this report.
Contractual Obligations
The following chart summarizes certain contractual obligations of the Company as of December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands):
As permitted or required under California law and to the maximum extent allowable under that law, we have certain obligations to indemnify our current and former officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was serving, at our request in such capacity. These indemnification obligations are valid as long as the director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, our best interests, and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these indemnification obligations is unlimited; however, we have a director and officer insurance policy that mitigates our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. We believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification obligations is minimal.
Liquidity and Asset/Liability Management
Management seeks to ascertain optimum and stable utilization of available assets and liabilities as a vehicle to attain our overall business plans and objectives. In this regard, management focuses on measurement and control of liquidity risk, interest rate risk and market risk, capital adequacy, operation risk and credit risk.
Liquidity
Liquidity to meet borrowers’ credit and depositors’ withdrawal demands is provided by maturing assets, short-term liquid assets that can be converted to cash and the ability to attract funds from depositors. Additional sources of liquidity may include institutional deposits, advances from the FHLB and other short-term borrowings, such as federal funds purchased.
Since our deposit growth strategy emphasizes core deposit growth, we have avoided relying on brokered deposits as a consistent source of funds. The Company had no brokered deposits as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
As a secondary source of liquidity, we rely on advances from the FHLB to supplement our supply of lendable funds and to meet deposit withdrawal requirements. Advances from the FHLB are typically secured by a portion of our loan portfolio and stock issued by the FHLB. The FHLB determines limitations on the amounts of advances by assigning a percentage to each eligible loan category that will count towards the borrowing capacity. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had no FHLB advances outstanding and had sufficient collateral to borrow an additional $317.6 million and $275.2 million, respectively. In addition, the Company had lines of credit with its correspondent banks to purchase overnight federal funds totaling $70 million and $30 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. No advances were made on these lines of credit as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
The Company’s liquidity depends primarily on dividends paid to it as the sole shareholder of the Bank. The Bank’s ability to pay dividends to the Company may depend on whether the Bank will be in a position to pay dividends based on regulatory requirements and the performance of the Bank.
Maintenance of adequate liquidity requires that sufficient resources be available at all time to meet our cash flow requirements. Liquidity in a banking institution is required primarily to provide for deposit withdrawals and the credit needs of its customers and to take advantage of investment opportunities as they arise. Liquidity management involves our ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without incurring significant loss, and to raise cash or maintain funds without incurring excessive additional cost. For this purpose, we maintain a portion of our funds in cash and cash equivalents, loans and securities available for sale. Our liquid assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019 totaled approximately $336.6 million and $241.0 million, respectively. Our liquidity level measured as the percentage of liquid assets to total assets was 22.3% and 21.0% at December 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
Capital Resources and Capital Adequacy Requirements
In the past two years, our primary source of capital has been internally generated operating income through retained earnings. At December 31, 2020, total shareholders’ equity increased to $129.7 million, representing an increase of $17.1 million from December 31, 2019. The increase was due to net income of $13.7 million recorded to retained earnings, and other comprehensive income of $5.3 million, net of income taxes, due to the positive effect that declining treasury yields had on the unrealized market value adjustment of our available for sale investment portfolio during 2020. Also, retained earnings was reduced by the common stock dividend payments totaling $2.3 million during 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had no material commitments for capital expenditures.
We are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger regulatory actions that could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements and operations. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, we must meet specific capital guidelines that rely on the quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Our capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. (See “Description of Business-Regulation and Supervision-Capital Adequacy Requirements” in this report for exact definitions and regulatory capital requirements.)
As of December 31, 2020, we were qualified as a “well capitalized institution” under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. The following table presents the regulatory minimums for well-capitalized institutions, compared to the Bank’s capital ratios as of the dates specified:
(1) The “Regulatory Minimum” thresholds in the table above are reflected on a fully phased-in basis, which occurred in January 2019.
