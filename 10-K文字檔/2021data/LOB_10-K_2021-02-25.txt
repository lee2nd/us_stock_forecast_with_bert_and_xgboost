MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Overview
The following presents management’s discussion and analysis (MD&A”) of the more significant factors that affected the Company's financial condition as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and results of operations for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Results of operations for the periods included in this review are not necessarily indicative of results to be obtained during any future period.
Dollar amounts in tables are stated in thousands, except for per share amounts.
Nature of Operations
Live Oak Bancshares, Inc. is a financial holding company and a bank holding company headquartered in Wilmington, North Carolina, incorporated under the laws of North Carolina in December 2008. The Company conducts business operations primarily through its commercial bank subsidiary, Live Oak Banking Company. The Bank was incorporated in February 2008 as a North Carolina-chartered commercial bank. The Bank specializes in lending and deposit related services to small businesses nationwide. The Bank identifies and extends lending to credit-worthy borrowers both within specific industries, also called verticals, through expertise within those industries, and more broadly to select borrowers outside of those industries. A significant portion of the loans originated by the Bank are guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) under the 7(a) Loan program and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) Rural Energy for America Program (“REAP”), Water and Environmental Program (“WEP”) and Business & Industry (“B&I”) loan programs.
In 2018, the Company formed Canapi Advisors, LLC for the purpose of providing investment advisory services to a series of funds focused on providing venture capital to new and emerging financial technology companies. In 2019, Live Oak Clean Energy Financing LLC (“LOCEF”) became a subsidiary of the Bank. LOCEF was formed in November 2016 as a subsidiary of the Company for the purpose of providing financing to entities for renewable energy applications. In 2018, the Bank formed Live Oak Private Wealth, LLC, a registered investment advisor that provides high-net-worth individuals and families with strategic wealth and investment management services, and on April 1, 2020, it acquired Jolley Asset Management, LLC to broaden service offerings for existing high-net-worth individuals and families, attract new clients from an expanded footprint and benefit from economies of scale. In 2017, the Bank entered into a joint venture, Apiture LLC (“Apiture”), with First Data Corporation for the purpose of creating next generation technology for financial institutions. In addition to the Bank, the Company owns Live Oak Ventures, Inc., formed in August 2016 for the purpose of investing in businesses that align with the Company's strategic initiative to be a leader in financial technology; Live Oak Grove, LLC, formed in February 2015 for the purpose of providing Company employees and business visitors an on-site restaurant location at the Company’s Wilmington, North Carolina headquarters; and Government Loan Solutions, Inc. (“GLS”), a management and technology consulting firm that specializes in the settlement, accounting, and securitization processes for government guaranteed loans, including loans originated under the SBA 7(a) loan program and USDA-guaranteed loans. In 2019, 504 Fund Advisors, LLC (“504FA”) exited as the advisor to The 504 Fund, and the Company dissolved this legal entity.
The Company generates revenue primarily from net interest income and secondarily through origination and sale of government guaranteed loans. Income from the retention of loans is comprised principally of interest income. The Company elects to account for certain loans under the fair value option with interest reported in interest income and changes in fair value reported in the net (loss) gain on loans accounted for under the fair value option line item of the consolidated statements of income. Income from the sale of loans is comprised of loan servicing revenue and revaluation of related servicing assets along with net gains on sales of loans. Offsetting these revenues are the cost of funding sources, provision for loan and lease credit losses, any costs related to foreclosed assets and other operating costs such as salaries and employee benefits, travel, professional services, advertising and marketing and tax expense. The Company also has less routinely generated gains and losses arising from its financial technology investments in its fintech segment, as discussed more fully later in this section under the caption “Results of Segment Operations.”
Recent Developments
The COVID-19 pandemic in the United States continues to have a lingering impact on the economy, the banking industry and the Company, all subject to a high degree of uncertainty. While it is still not possible to know the full universe or extent of these impacts as of the date of this filing, we are disclosing potentially material items of which we are currently aware.
Financial position and results of operations
Relating to our December 31, 2020 financial condition and results of operations, COVID-19 had, and continues to have, impacts on the allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) on loans and leases, loans carried at fair value, loan servicing asset revaluation, net gains on sales of loans and net interest income. However economic forecasts and broader markets did begin to show signs of improvement in the latter part of 2020 and in some cases somewhat reverse pandemic effects recorded earlier in the year. With the pandemic induced economic turmoil of 2020, the ACL and resulting provision for loan and lease credit losses were most significantly impacted by negative economic forecasts (exacerbated by the new current expected credit losses (“CECL”) standard effective January 1, 2020) combined with charge-offs related to COVID-19 while loans accounted for under the fair value were negatively impacted by similar conditions. Improving market conditions in the second half of 2020, also influenced by pandemic response programs, had positive effects on loan fair values. With the ongoing monitoring of effects continuing to emerge in certain pandemic-at-risk verticals combined with the risk that payment deferrals and those being made by the SBA for borrowers under its programs may be skewing actual indications of ability to repay, total credit related reserves continued to grow but at a slower pace due to the above mentioned improving economic forecasts during the latter part of 2020. Refer to the discussion of the ACL and loans at fair value in Notes 3 and 10, respectively, of the note to consolidated financial statements as well as further discussion below in MD&A. Also impacted by improving market conditions was the Company’s valuation of the loan servicing asset as discussed in Note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and net gains on sales of loans, both of which are further discussed below in MD&A. The secondary market continued to improve during the last half of 2020 which also began to somewhat offset earlier negative COVID-19 adjustments for loans carried at fair value and the loan servicing asset valuation. The net interest margin was negatively impacted by significant rate cuts in response to stimulus efforts combined with heightened levels of liquidity earlier in the year as a part of pandemic preparedness, however by year end improvements began to emerge as the deposit portfolio started to reprice and a substantial portion of excess liquidity was utilized to fund significant loan demand, while Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) lending had a positive impact on net interest margin as discussed more fully below in MD&A. Should economic conditions worsen, the Company could experience further increases in the ACL and negative fair value marks and record additional credit or market related loss expense. It is also possible that the Company’s asset quality measures could worsen at future measurement periods if there is a significant resurgence of COVID-19 cases or the pandemic’s effects are prolonged.
While there has been a recovery in secondary market pricing, the income from gain on sale of loans in future periods could be reduced due to COVID-19 and the termination of pandemic response programs. Negative impacts began to be felt in the latter part of March and early April 2020 with loan sales executed at that time as secondary market conditions began to weaken. At this time, the Company is unable to project the materiality of such impacts but anticipates that the breadth of the economic impact could impact gains in future periods.
Interest income could be further reduced due to COVID-19. In accordance with guidance from banking regulators, the Company has worked and continues to work with COVID-19 affected borrowers to help defer their payments, interest, and fees. In addition to regulatory relief on deferrals from banking regulators, six months of payment relief was available through the first quarter of 2021 from the SBA for certain loans guaranteed by that agency pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”). While interest and fees will still accrue to interest, should eventual credit losses on these loans with deferred payments emerge, interest income and fees accrued would need to be reversed. In such a scenario, interest income in future periods could be negatively impacted. At this time, we are unable to project the materiality of such an impact but anticipate that the breadth of the economic impact may affect our borrowers’ ability to repay in future periods.
Capital and liquidity
As of December 31, 2020, all of the Company’s capital ratios, and the Bank’s capital ratios, were in excess of all minimum regulatory requirements. While the Company believes that capital is sufficient to withstand an extended economic recession brought about by COVID-19, reported and regulatory capital ratios could be adversely impacted by further credit losses. The Company relies on cash on hand as well as dividends from the Bank to service any debt at the Company. If our capital deteriorates such that the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Company for an extended period of time, the Company may not be able to service its debt.
The Company maintains access to multiple sources of liquidity. Wholesale funding markets have remained open to the Company, but rates for short term funding have recently been volatile and the secondary market for guaranteed loans has shown reactionary and varying responses to the changing economic environment. The Company increased its levels of deposits and borrowings earlier in the year, as discussed further in MD&A. If funding costs are elevated for an extended period of time, it could have an adverse effect on the Company’s net interest margin. If an extended recession causes large numbers of the Company’s deposit customers to withdraw their funds, the Company might become more reliant on volatile or more expensive sources of funding.
The Federal Reserve created the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (“PPPLF”) to help provide financing for the origination of PPP loans. The PPPLF extends loans to banks that have loaned money to small businesses under the PPP, discussed in more detail below. Amounts borrowed are non-recourse and have a 100% advance rate equal to the principal amount of PPP loans pledged as security. In addition, loans financed under the PPPLF have a neutral impact on regulatory leverage capital ratios. The maturity date of a borrowing under the PPPLF is equal to the maturity date of the PPP loan pledged to secure the borrowing and would be accelerated (i) if the underlying PPP loan goes into default and is transferred to the SBA to realize on the SBA guarantee or (ii) to the extent that any loan forgiveness reimbursement is received from the SBA. Borrowings under the PPPLF bear interest at a rate of 0.35%, and there are no fees paid by the Company. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had outstanding borrowings of $1.53 billion from the PPPLF.
Lending operations and accommodations to borrowers
With the establishment of the PPP administered by the SBA, the Company has implemented new loan programs and systems using its technology platform while participating in assisting its customers and other small businesses in need of resources through the program. PPP loans earn interest at 1% and currently have a two-year or five-year contractual term depending on the origination date. For the earlier loans with a two-year term there is an option to extend to five years if agreed upon by the borrower and lender. The Company expects that some portion of these loans will ultimately be forgiven by the SBA in accordance with the terms of the program. As of December 31, 2020, the Company carried 9,990 PPP loans on its balance sheet representing a book balance of $1.53 billion in originations and $29.6 million in net deferred fees, to be amortized and recognized in interest income over the remaining lives of the loans. The Company recognized $27.9 million of interest income in 2020 related to amortization of net PPP fees. As of February 22, 2021, the Company has secured funding from the SBA for 1,620 new PPP loans representing approximately $230 million in 2021 originations. Loans funded through the PPP are fully guaranteed by the SBA, subject to the terms and conditions of the program. Should those circumstances change, the Company could be required to record additional credit loss expense through earnings.
With the passage of the CARES Act on March 27, 2020, the SBA was making six months of principal and interest payments on all fully disbursed SBA 7(a) and SBA Express loans in regular servicing status that closed by September 25, 2020. In addition, with regulatory guidance to work with borrowers during this unprecedented situation, the Company has also mobilized to provide a payment deferral program when needed by customers that are adversely affected by the pandemic. Depending on the demonstrated need of the client, the Company is deferring either the full loan payment or the principal component of the loan payment for 60 or 90 days. In accordance with interagency guidance issued in March 2020, these short-term deferrals are not considered troubled debt restructurings. After 60 or 90 days, borrowers may apply for an additional deferral. In the absence of other intervening factors, such short-term modifications made on a good faith basis are not categorized as a troubled debt restructuring, nor are loans granted payment deferrals related to COVID-19 placed on non-accrual (provided the loans were not past due or on non-accrual status prior to the deferral). At December 31, and September 30, 2020, the Company estimated that as a percentage of total loans and leases at amortized cost, excluding PPP loans, 20% and 63%, respectively, of its loans were receiving the six months of payments from the SBA and that 11% and 2%, respectively, of its loans had a payment deferral in place. The increase in loans on payment deferral during the fourth quarter was largely a product of the expiration of the SBA’s payment assistance around the end of 2020 for loans with continued pandemic related difficulties. The Company estimated that 48% of its loans and leases at amortized cost, excluding PPP loans, were receiving payments from the SBA and that 3%, had a payment deferral in place as of February 22, 2021. Compared to December 31, 2020, the increase in loans receiving payments from the SBA and decrease in loans on payment deferral was the combined impact of borrowers emerging from deferral needs in conjunction with the effects of the Economic Aid Act discussed below. On October 2, 2020, the SBA began approving PPP forgiveness applications and remitting forgiveness payments to PPP lenders for PPP borrowers. As of February 22, 2021, the Company has received $499.1 million in PPP forgiveness from 3,366, or 31% of total PPP loans originated in 2020 by count.
On September 5, 2020, the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act (the “new Act”) was signed into law and made significant changes to the PPP to provide additional relief for small businesses. The new Act increased flexibility for small businesses that have been unable to rehire employees due to lack of employee availability or have been unable to operate as normal due to COVID-19 related restrictions. It extended the period that businesses have to use PPP funds to qualify for loan forgiveness to 24 weeks, up from 8 weeks under the original rules. The new Act also relaxed the requirements that loan recipients must adhere to in order to qualify for loan forgiveness. In addition, the new Act extended the payment deferral period for PPP loans until the date when the amount of loan forgiveness is determined and remitted to the lender. For PPP recipients who do not apply for forgiveness, the loan deferral period is 10 months after the applicable forgiveness period ends.
On December 27, 2020 the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act (Economic Aid Act) was enacted which allows the SBA to make payments of up to $9,000 per month for up to six months of principal and interest payments on certain fully disbursed SBA 7(a) and SBA 504 loans in regular servicing status based upon the origination date. In addition this legislation increased the 75% guarantee on many SBA 7(a) loans to 90%, among other things.
Credit
While most industries have and will continue to experience adverse impacts as a result of COVID-19, the Company has $439.3 million in total unguaranteed exposure in six verticals considered to be “at-risk” of significant impact: hotels, wine and craft beverage, educational services, entertainment centers, fitness centers, and quick service restaurants, each comprising $134.8 million or 5.2%, $104.1 million or 4.0%, $94.2 million or 3.7%, $55.3 million or 2.1%, $30.0 million or 1.2%, and $20.9 million or 0.8% of total unguaranteed loans and leases (all at amortized cost, inclusive of loans carried at fair value) as of December 31, 2020, respectively.
The Company continues to work with customers directly affected by COVID-19 and is prepared to offer short-term assistance in accordance with regulatory guidelines. As a result of the uncertain economic environment caused by COVID-19, the Company is engaging in more frequent communication with borrowers in an effort to better understand their situation and the challenges faced and circumstances evolve, which the Company anticipates will enable it to respond proactively as needs and issues arise.
Executive Summary
Following is a summary of the Company's financial highlights and events for 2020:
•
Loans and leases held for sale and investment increased by $2.73 billion, or 75.9%, to $6.32 billion at the end of 2020 as a result of over $2.69 billion in record loan originations from traditional platforms in addition to $1.76 billion in PPP originations during the year.
•
Combined net interest income and loan servicing revenue increased by $53.2 million, or 31.6%, to $221.3 million in 2020, $32.9 million of which was related to PPP loans.
•
Guaranteed loans eligible for sale increased by $763 million, or 82.8%, as a result of robust government guaranteed loan origination volume.
•
Net gains on sales of loans increased $20.4 million, or 70.6%, due to an overall increase in sales volume, the mix of loans sold and higher secondary market premiums.
•
Investment securities available-for-sale increased $210.1 million, or 38.9%, due to availability of surplus liquidity from pandemic readiness efforts.
•
Noninterest income from the fintech investments increased $9.0 million, or 369.6%, largely related to the third quarter $13.7 million non-cash gain resulting from the increase in the observable fair market value of the Company’s investment in Greenlight Financial Technology, Inc. (“Greenlight”), partially mitigated by the Company’s pro rata portion of income tax expense of $7.8 million arising from Apiture’s conversion from a partnership to corporation.
•
Total nonperforming unguaranteed loans and leases as a percentage of total loans and leases held for investment increased from 0.40% at the end of 2019 to 0.46% at the end of 2020.
•
Net charge-offs as a percentage of average held for investment loans and leases carried at historical cost, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, were 0.44% and 0.10%, respectively. This increase was largely related to the reclassification of fifteen hotel loans from held for investment to held for sale during the third quarter.
•
Provision for loan and lease credit losses increased $25.4 million, or 167.3%, largely due to COVID-19 pandemic related effects and exacerbated by the adoption of CECL.
•
Net loss on the valuation adjustment for loans accounted for under the fair value option increased by $20.5 million, or 276.6%, from a net gain of $7.4 million in 2019 to a net loss of $13.1 million in 2020, also largely influenced by pandemic effects.
•
Total deposits rose by 35.2% to $5.71 billion at the end of 2020 driven by funding needs for PPP and other significant loan origination efforts during the year.
•
Borrowings under the Federal Reserve’s Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (“PPPLF”), with a 0.35% interest rate, increased $1.54 billion to help fund PPP loans and complement the defensive strategy earlier in the year to build liquidity due to the uncertainty of the effects of COVID-19.
•
Income tax expense decreased $17.6 million, resulting in a net tax benefit of $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was largely the result of tax benefits arising from the vesting of approximately 2.5 million restricted stock unit awards with market price conditions and a tax benefit due to the enactment of the CARES Act.
•
Reported net income increased by 230.2% from 2019 to $59.5 million as discussed in the opening to the section titled “Results of Operations.”
Business Outlook
Below is a discussion of management’s current expectations regarding Company performance over the near-term based on market conditions, the regulatory environment and business strategies as of the time the Company filed this Report. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in these forward-looking statements. See “Important Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in this Report for more information on forward-looking statements.
The Company's results for 2020 demonstrated a continuation of strong underlying financial performance and solid growth momentum. Management continues to focus on building recurring revenue streams, promoting change within the financial technology industry, and building out selected existing verticals while adding new verticals to the Company's business model. Management anticipates that the Company's held-for-sale and held-for-investment loan portfolios will continue to grow as a result of healthy origination volumes and higher levels of loan retention that are intended to promote long-term recurring revenue and profitability, including the continued pursuit of potential opportunities in conventional lending outside of SBA or other government guarantee programs.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Statements included in this management's discussion and analysis include non-GAAP financial measures and should be read along with the accompanying tables, which provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of non-GAAP measures is presented at the conclusion of this Item 7.
Management believes that non-GAAP financial measures provide additional useful information that allows readers to evaluate the ongoing performance of the Company without regard to certain transactional activities. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of performance or financial condition as reported under GAAP, and investors should consider the Company's performance and financial condition as reported under GAAP and all other relevant information when assessing the performance or financial condition of the Company. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results or financial condition as reported under GAAP. Management’s non-GAAP measures are not necessarily comparable to similar named measures represented by other companies, as they may be calculated differently.
Results of Operations
Years ended December 31, 2020 vs. 2019
The Company reported net income available to common shareholders totaling $59.5 million, or $1.43 per diluted share, for 2020 compared to $18.0 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, for 2019.
This increase in net income was primarily attributable to the following items:
•
Increase in net interest income of $54.6 million, or 39.0%, predominately driven by significant growth in total loan and lease portfolios which was accentuated by the origination of $1.76 billion in PPP loans during the second and third quarters of 2020;
•
Net gains on sales of loans increased $20.4 million, or 70.6%;
•
Equity security investments gains increased $11.4 million, or 322.1%, largely due to a $13.7 million non-cash gain resulting from the increase in the observable fair market value of the Company’s investment in Greenlight arising from orderly transactions in Greenlight’s securities; and
•
A decrease in income tax expense of $17.6 million. This decrease was largely the result of the vesting of restricted stock unit awards and a tax benefit of $3.7 million due to the enactment of the CARES Act which allows the carryback of certain net operating losses to each of the five taxable years preceding the taxable year of such losses.
Other key factors partially offsetting the year-over-year increase in net income were composed of the following:
•
An increase in the provision for loan and lease credit losses of $25.4 million, or 167.3%;
•
The net loss on the valuation adjustment for loans accounted for under the fair value option increased by $20.5 million, or 276.6%, from a net gain of $7.4 million in 2019 to a net loss of $13.1 million in 2020; and
•
Increased salaries and employee benefits of $21.9 million, or 24.2%, as the Company continued to invest in its workforce to support growth and a variety of initiatives combined with $7.2 million in expense in the second quarter of 2020 for a performance bonus pool that was available to all employees other than executive officers and $4.1 million in payroll related expense associated with the fourth quarter accelerated vesting of approximately 2.5 million restricted stock unit awards with market price conditions.
Years ended December 31, 2019 vs. 2018
The Company reported net income available to common shareholders totaling $18.0 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, for 2019 compared to $51.4 million, or $1.24 per diluted share, for 2018.
This decrease in net income was primarily attributable to the following items:
•
The strategic shift in the latter part of 2018 to hold substantially more of its eligible-for-sale production on balance sheet resulted in lower net income in the near-term by significantly decreasing net gains on sales of loans by $46.2 million, or 61.4%. The volume of guaranteed loan sales in 2019 declined to $340.4 million compared to $945.2 million in 2018;
•
The provision for loan and lease losses increased $9.7 million primarily due to significant portfolio growth combined with an increase in criticized and classified loans and leases;
•
Increased salaries and employee benefits of $13.2 million, or 17.1% largely due to a reversal of $4.5 million in accrued incentive compensation in the latter part of 2018 combined with ongoing investment in workforce to support growth and a variety of initiatives;
•
The flow-through loss from investments accounted for under the equity method totaled $7.9 million, largely due to the Company’s ownership in Apiture, LLC, compared to $386 thousand for 2018; and
•
Income tax expense increased $10.8 million. This increase was largely the result of planned reductions in solar panel leasing activity for 2019 which negatively impacted the annual effective tax rate.
Other key factors partially offsetting the year-over-year decline in net income were composed of the following:
•
Increased net interest income of $32.0 million, or 29.7%, predominately driven by significant growth in the combined held for sale and held for investment loan and lease portfolios along with higher investment security holdings; and
•
The net gain on the valuation adjustment for loans accounted for under the fair value option increased by $12.4 million, or 246.9%, from a net loss of $5.0 million in 2018 to a net gain of $7.4 million in 2019.
Net Interest Income and Margin
Net interest income represents the difference between the revenue that the Company earns on interest-earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The Company’s net interest income depends upon the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates that the Company earns or pays on them, respectively. Net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as “volume changes.” It is also affected by changes in yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and other borrowed funds, referred to as “rate changes.” As a bank without a branch network, the Bank gathers deposits over the Internet and in the community in which it is headquartered. Due to the nature of a branchless bank and the relatively low overhead required for deposit gathering, the rates the Bank offers are generally above the industry average.
Years ended December 31, 2020 vs. 2019
For 2020, net interest income increased $54.6 million, or 39.0%, to $194.7 million compared to $140.1 million for 2019. This increase was principally due to the significant growth in the held for investment loan and lease portfolios reflecting the Company's ongoing initiative to grow recurring revenue sources and strengthen liquidity. This increase over 2019 was further enhanced by the above-mentioned origination of PPP loans in the second and third quarters of 2020. Accordingly, average interest earning assets increased by $2.62 billion, or 68.6%, to $6.44 billion for 2020, compared to $3.82 billion for 2019, while the yield on average interest earning assets decreased 149 basis points to 4.48%. The cost of funds on interest bearing liabilities for 2020 decreased 90 basis points to 1.48%, and the average balance of interest bearing liabilities increased by $2.66 billion, or 72.1%, over 2019. The decrease in cost of interest bearing liabilities was due to deposits repricing at lower rates combined with borrowings from the PPPLF used to help fund PPP loans, with a 0.35% interest rate. The increase in average interest bearing liabilities was largely impacted by strategically heightened levels of liquidity in 2020 related to COVID-19 risks and uncertainties and funding sources for significant loan originations. As indicated in the rate/volume table below, the increase in interest earning asset volume more than offset lower yields, outpacing the higher volume and lower levels of cost declines of interest bearing liabilities, resulting in increased interest income of $60.4 million and increased interest expense of $5.8 million for 2020 compared to 2019. For 2019 compared to 2020, net interest margin decreased from 3.67% to 3.03%, respectively, principally due to reductions in the Prime Rate used for quarterly adjusting loans combined with the lower interest yield on PPP loans and higher average liquidity through 2020.
Years ended December 31, 2019 vs. 2018
For 2019, net interest income increased $32.0 million, or 29.7%, to $140.1 million compared to $108.0 million in 2018. This increase was principally due to the significant growth in the combined held for sale and held for investment loan and lease portfolios along with higher investment security holdings reflecting the Company's ongoing initiative to grow recurring revenue sources and fortify its liquidity profile. Average interest earning assets rose by $853.6 million, or 28.8%, to $3.82 billion for 2019 compared to $2.96 billion for 2018, while the yield on average interest earning assets rose by 48 basis points to 5.97% for 2019 versus 5.49% for 2018. A substantial portion of the Company's loan portfolio are variable rate loans that adjust regularly in accordance with changes in designated benchmark indices. The cost of funds on interest bearing liabilities for 2019 increased 46 basis points to 2.38%, and the average balance in interest bearing liabilities increased by $843.1 million, or 29.7% during the same period. As indicated in the rate/volume table below, the increase in interest bearing liabilities and corresponding cost of funds was outpaced by the positive effects of the increased volume of interest earning assets, resulting in increased interest income of $65.3 million versus increased interest expense of $33.3 million for 2019. For 2019 compared to 2018, net interest margin increased from 3.64% to 3.67%. This increase in margin for the year was largely impacted by the cumulative impact of Federal Reserve rate cuts in the latter part of 2019 that favorably impacted deposit rates combined with the delayed repricing timing of the Company’s variable rate loans.
Average Balances and Yields. The following table presents information regarding average balances for assets and liabilities, the total dollar amounts of interest income and dividends from average interest-earning assets, the total dollar amount of interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities, and the resulting average yields and costs. The yields and costs for the periods indicated are derived by dividing the income or expense by the average balances for assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods presented. Loan fees are included in interest income on loans.
(1)
Average loan and lease balances include non-accruing loans and leases.
Rate/Volume Analysis. The following table sets forth the effects of changing rates and volumes on net interest income. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by current period volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior period rate). The total column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to changes in both rate and volume that cannot be segregated have been allocated proportionally based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.
Provision for Loan and Lease Credit Losses
The provision for loan and lease credit losses represents the amount necessary to be charged against the current period’s earnings to maintain the allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) on loans and leases at a level that is appropriate in relation to the estimated losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio.
Losses inherent in loan relationships are mitigated if a portion of the loan is guaranteed by the SBA or USDA. A typical SBA 7(a) loan carries a 75% guarantee while USDA guarantees range from 50% to 90% depending on loan size, which serve to reduce the risk profile of these loans. The Company believes that its focus on compliance with regulations and guidance from the SBA and USDA are key factors to managing this risk.
Years ended December 31, 2020 vs. 2019
For 2020, the provision for loan and lease credit losses was $40.7 million compared to $15.2 million in 2019, an increase of $25.4 million. The Company adopted the new current expected credit losses (“CECL”) standard effective January 1, 2020 and accordingly determined to use forecasted levels of unemployment as a primary economic variable in forecasting future expected losses. The majority of the provision for 2020 was due to the effect of negative economic forecasts related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the growing loan and lease portfolio, significant charge-offs during the year and model refinements in recognition of loss experience on non-mature verticals. See below discussion of charge-offs for more information. Approximately $23.5 million of the 2020 provision was estimated to be based upon the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Loans and leases held for investment at historical cost were $4.33 billion as of December 31, 2020, increasing by $2.53 billion, or 140.2%, compared to December 31, 2019. This growth was largely fueled by $1.76 billion in PPP loan originations in the second and third quarters of 2020. Excluding PPP loan originations and net unearned fees on those loans, the balance in loans and leases held for investment at historical cost was $2.83 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $1.03 billion, or 57.0%, over December 31, 2019. This growth, outside of PPP activity in the third quarter of 2020, was fueled by robust origination volumes combined with retention of substantially more loans on the balance sheet.
Net charge-offs for loans and leases carried at historical cost were $15.3 million, or 0.44% of average loans and leases held for investment, carried at historical cost, for 2020, compared to $1.4 million, or 0.10%, for 2019. The increase in net charge-offs during 2020 was largely driven by the reclassification of fifteen hotel loans in the third quarter from held for investment to held for sale. These loans, aggregating $81.2 million in net investment, were reclassified as available for sale due to negative trends observed from management’s ongoing analysis of COVID-19 impacts and were marked to the lower of cost or fair value upon reclassification with the write down of $9.8 million reflected in charge-offs. The existing ACL on these loans at the time of charge-off was $3.4 million with the remaining $6.4 million requiring an additional provision for loan and lease losses. Net charge-offs are a key element of historical experience in the Company's estimation of the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases.
In addition, nonperforming loans and leases not guaranteed by the SBA or USDA, excluding $5.4 million and $6.7 million accounted for under the fair value option at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, totaled $20.1 million, which was 0.46% of the held for investment loan and lease portfolio carried at historical cost at December 31, 2020, compared to $7.2 million, or 0.40% of loans and leases held for investment at December 31, 2019. Nonperforming loans and leases carried at historical cost which are not guaranteed by the SBA or USDA were 0.71% of the historical cost portion of the held for investment loan and lease portfolio, excluding PPP loans, at December 31, 2020.
Years ended December 31, 2019 vs. 2018
For 2019, the provision for loan and lease losses was $15.2 million, an increase of $9.7 million, or 173.7%, compared to 2018. The increase in the provision for loan and lease losses compared to the prior year was primarily the result of a materially growing loan and lease portfolio through robust loan and lease originations and higher balance sheet retention rates combined with an increase in criticized and classified loans and leases.
Net charge-offs for loans and leases carried at historical cost were $1.4 million, or 0.10% of average loans and leases held for investment, carried at historical cost, on an annualized basis for 2019, compared to net charge-offs of $1.1 million, or 0.18% for 2018. Net charge-offs are a key element of historical experience in the Company's estimation of the allowance for loan and lease losses.
In addition, at December 31, 2019, nonperforming loans and leases not guaranteed by the SBA or USDA, excluding $6.7 million and $10.4 million accounted for under the fair value option at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, totaled $7.2 million, which was 0.40% of the held-for-investment loan and lease portfolio compared to $4.1 million, or 0.44%, of loans and leases held for investment at December 31, 2018.
Noninterest Income
Noninterest income is principally comprised of net gains from the sale of SBA and USDA-guaranteed loans along with servicing revenue and related revaluation of the servicing asset. Revenue from the sale of loans depends upon the volume, maturity structure and rates of underlying loans as well as the pricing and availability of funds in the secondary markets prevailing in the period between completed loan funding and closing of sale. In addition, the loan servicing revaluation is significantly impacted by changes in market rates and other underlying assumptions such as prepayment speeds and default rates. Net (loss) gain on loans accounted for under the fair value option is also significantly impacted by changes in market rates, prepayment speeds and inherent credit risk. Other less common elements of noninterest income include less routine gains and losses on investments.
The following table shows the components of noninterest income and the dollar and percentage changes for the periods presented.
Years ended December 31, 2020 vs. 2019
For 2020, noninterest income increased by $22.5 million, or 35.4%, compared to 2019. The increase from the prior year is primarily the result of a $20.5 million increase in net gains on sales of loans combined with net gains on equity securities discussed above, a net positive increase in the loan servicing asset revaluation of $6.6 million, management fee income earned by Canapi Advisors increasing by $4.6 million and a $6.0 million increase in other noninterest income largely comprised of $2.7 million in revenue resulting from the sale of services from co-developed technology for processing PPP loans and $2.2 million in financial planning fees earned by Live Oak Private Wealth. Offsetting the increases in noninterest income in 2020 was the aforementioned net loss on the valuation adjustment related to loans measured at fair value which increased by $20.5 million and increased losses on equity method investments of $6.8 million, largely the product of the Company’s pro-rata portion of tax expense arising from Apiture’s conversion from a partnership to a corporation.
The tables below reflect loan and lease production, sales of guaranteed loans and the aggregate balance in guaranteed loans sold that are being serviced. These components are key drivers of the Company's noninterest income.
(1)
This represents the outstanding principal balance of guaranteed loans serviced, as of the last day of the applicable period, which have been sold into the secondary market.
Changes in various components of noninterest income are discussed in more detail below.
Loan Servicing Revenue: While portions of the loans that the Bank originates are sold and generate gain on sale revenue, servicing rights for those sold portions are retained by the Bank. In exchange for continuing to service sold loans, the Bank receives fee income represented in loan servicing revenue equivalent to 1.0% of the outstanding balance of SBA loans sold and 0.40% of the outstanding balance of USDA loans sold. In addition, the standard cost (adequate compensation) for servicing sold loans is approximately 0.40% of the balance of the loans sold, which is included in the loan servicing revaluation computations. Unrecognized servicing revenue above or below the standard cost to service is reflected in a net servicing asset recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. Revenues associated with the servicing of loans are recognized over the expected life of the loan through the income statement, and the servicing asset is reduced as this revenue is recognized. For 2020, loan servicing revenue decreased $1.4 million, or 5.1%, to $26.6 million as compared to 2019. The small change in servicing revenue for 2020 has been a result of a relatively static year over year trend in sold loans serviced as well as a decline in the weighted average servicing fee resulting from the growth of the USDA sold and serviced portfolio at approximately 0.40%. At December 31, 2020, the outstanding balance of guaranteed loans sold in the secondary market was $2.82 billion compared to $2.75 billion at December 31, 2019.
Loan Servicing Revaluation: The Company revalues its serviced loan portfolio at least quarterly. The revaluation considers the amortization of the portfolio, current market conditions for loan sale premiums, and current prepayment speeds. For 2020, there was a net negative loan servicing revaluation adjustment of $10.0 million compared to a net negative adjustment of $16.6 million for 2019. The net positive increase in the revaluation from 2019 to 2020 was primarily a result of slower prepayment speeds and more favorable market conditions.
In consideration of the sensitivity of servicing rights as discussed above and in Note 5 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements, the following table is provided as of December 31, 2020 reflecting the effect on fair value due to hypothetical changes in yield curve rates.
Net Gains on Sale of Loans: For 2020, net gains on sales of loans increased $20.5 million, or 70.6%, compared to 2019. The volume of guaranteed loans sold increased $202.2 million, or 59.4%, in 2020 to $542.6 million from $340.4 million in 2019. The average net gain on guaranteed loan sales increased from $84.8 thousand to $85.1 thousand, per million sold, in 2019 and 2020, respectively. The increase in net gains on sale of loans is due to the combined effect of an overall increase in sales volume, the mix of loans sold and higher secondary market premiums. The volume of sales in 2020 was largely a product of heightened levels of guaranteed loans eligible for sale during the year.
Net (Loss) Gain on Loans Accounted for Under the Fair Value Option: For 2020, the net loss on loans accounted for under the fair value option increased $20.5 million, or 276.6%, compared to 2019. The carrying amount of loans accounted for under the fair value option at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $851.5 million ($36.1 million classified as held for sale and $815.4 million classified as held for investment) and $840.7 million ($16.2 million classified as held for sale and $824.5 million classified as held for investment), respectively, an increase of $10.8 million, or 1.3%. The 2020 net loss on loans accounted for under the fair value option was estimated to be approximately $10.4 million related to the severity of ongoing developments of the COVID-19 pandemic. The magnitude of COVID-19 related impacts on loan fair value adjustments first half of 2020 combined with similar factors influencing the provision for loan and lease credit losses was dampened by improving market conditions.
Years ended December 31, 2019 vs. 2018
For 2019, noninterest income decreased by $32.7 million, or 34.0%, compared to 2018. The decrease from the prior year is primarily the result of the aforementioned strategic decision made in the latter part of 2018 to sell fewer loans, resulting in net gains on sales of loans declining to $29.0 million for 2019, compared to $75.2 million for 2018, a reduction of $46.2 million, or 61.4%. The flow-through loss from investments accounted for under the equity method increased $7.5 million for 2019, compared to 2018. Also impacting the overall decrease in noninterest income was a decline in title insurance income of $2.8 million during 2019, compared to 2018, due to the sale of the title insurance business in third quarter of 2018. Partially offsetting the overall decrease in noninterest income was a $12.4 million, or 247.0%, decrease in the loss loans accounted for under the fair value option principally due to improving market conditions, such as increased premiums, combined with an increase in net gains on equity security investments of $3.3 million and an increase in solar panel lease income of $1.7 million.
Changes in various components of noninterest income are discussed in more detail below.
Loan Servicing Revenue: While portions of the loans that the Bank originates are sold and generate gain on sale revenue, servicing rights for those sold portions are retained by the Bank. In exchange for continuing to service sold loans, the Bank receives fee income represented in loan servicing revenue equivalent to 1.0% of the outstanding balance of SBA loans sold and 0.40% of the outstanding balance of USDA loans sold. In addition, the standard cost (adequate compensation) for servicing sold loans is approximately 0.40% of the balance of the loans sold, which is included in the loan servicing revaluation computations. Unrecognized servicing revenue above the standard cost to service is reflected in a servicing asset recorded on the balance sheet. Revenues associated with the servicing of loans are recognized over the expected life of the loan through the income statement, and the servicing asset is reduced as this revenue is recognized. For the year ended December 31, 2019, loan servicing revenue decreased $1.1 million, or 3.7%, to $28.0 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, as a result of the declining balance of the serviced portfolio. At December 31, 2019, the outstanding balance of guaranteed loans sold in the secondary market was $2.75 billion compared to $3.05 billion at December 31, 2018.
Loan Servicing Revaluation: The Company revalues its serviced loan portfolio at least quarterly. The revaluation considers the amortization of the portfolio, current market conditions for loan sale premiums, and current prepayment speeds. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, there was a negative loan servicing revaluation of $16.6 million and $21.2 million, respectively.
Net Gains on Sale of Loans: For the year ended December 31, 2019, net gains on sales of loans of $29.0 million, decreased $46.2 million, or 61.4%, compared to 2018. This decrease was primarily due to the lower volume of guaranteed loans sold in 2019, decreasing $604.8 million, or 64.0%, from $945.2 million in 2018 to $340.4 million in 2019. The average net gain on sale for 2019 was higher at $84.8 thousand of revenue for each $1 million in loans sold, compared to $80.9 thousand of revenue for each $1 million sold for 2018. The year over year increase in average gains was influenced by the mix of loans sold by the Company and continued strength of market conditions for the purchase of guaranteed loans.
Noninterest Expense
Noninterest expense comprises all operating costs of the Company, such as employee related costs, travel, professional services, advertising and marketing expenses, exclusive of interest and income tax expense.
The following table shows the components of noninterest expense and the related dollar and percentage changes for the periods presented.
Years ended December 31, 2020 vs. 2019
Total noninterest expense for 2020 increased $27.8 million, or 16.8%, compared to 2019. The increase in noninterest expense was predominately driven by increased personnel cost, data processing expense, and FDIC insurance.
Salaries and employee benefits: Total personnel expense for 2020 increased by $21.9 million, or 24.2%, compared to 2019. While personnel expense is carefully managed, the year over year increase is principally due to the Company’s commitment to and investment in its workforce to support growth and a variety of initiatives. The year over year increase was influenced by $7.2 million in expense for a performance bonus pool that was available to all employees other than executive officers during the second quarter of 2020 and $4.1 million in payroll related expense associated with the fourth quarter accelerated vesting of approximately 2.5 million restricted stock unit awards with market price conditions. Total full-time equivalent employees increased from 612 at December 31, 2019 to 630 at December 31, 2020. Salaries and employee benefits expense included $14.7 million of stock-based compensation for 2020, compared to $11.7 million for 2019. Expenses related to the employee stock purchase program, stock grants, stock option compensation and restricted stock expense are all considered stock-based compensation.
Travel & Advertising and marketing expenses: For 2020, travel & advertising and marketing expenses in aggregate decreased $5.9 million, or 45.9%. This decrease was the result of certain operational adaptations due to the impact of COVID-19.
Data processing expense: Total data processing expense for 2020 increased by $3.1 million, or 33.2%, compared to 2019. The increase over 2019 was predominantly driven by third party costs incurred in internal software development and with additional software subscriptions to help maximize operational efficiencies.
FDIC insurance: For 2020, FDIC insurance increased $4.0 million compared to 2019 due to higher required premiums.
Years ended December 31, 2019 vs. 2018
Total noninterest expense for 2019 increased $12.2 million, or 8.0%, compared to 2018. The increase in noninterest expense was largely driven by salaries and employee benefits. Changes in various components of noninterest expense are discussed below.
Salaries and employee benefits: Total personnel expense for 2019 increased by $13.2 million, or 17.1%, compared to 2018. This increase is largely due to a reversal of $4.5 million in accrued incentive compensation in the latter part of 2018 due to not meeting internal performance metrics for that year combined with ongoing investment in workforce to support growth and a variety of initiatives. While personnel expense is carefully managed, the Company continues to invest in human capital to support a variety of initiatives by the Company, including growing loan production and financial services technology. Total full-time equivalent employees increased from 498 at December 31, 2018 to 612 at December 31, 2019. Salaries and employee benefits expense included $11.7 million and $9.2 million of stock-based compensation expense in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Expenses related to the employee stock purchase program, stock grants, stock option compensation and restricted stock expense are all considered stock-based compensation.
Travel expense: Travel expense decreased $2.2 million, or 24.4%, compared to 2018. This decrease was principally due to a reduction in repairs and maintenance costs associated with an older aircraft that was sold during the first quarter of 2019, higher deferred travel costs as more loans were retained, and general improvements in operational efficiency.
Professional services expense: For 2019, total professional services expense increased $2.0 million, or 40.6%, compared to 2018. This increase was driven by legal, accounting, and consulting fees incurred to support various strategic initiatives, such as the Company’s investments in Apiture and Canapi Advisors, LLC.
Data processing expense: Total data processing expense decreased $2.7 million, or 22.9%, compared to 2018. The decrease is primarily the result of the expiration of software development services provided by Apiture directly to the Company at the end of 2018 combined with the capitalization of certain software development costs during 2019.
Equipment expense: Equipment expense increased $2.6 million, or 19.0%, compared to 2018. Primary factors contributing to this increase were the depreciation of solar panels arising from operating lease activities and a new aircraft placed in service in the third quarter of 2019.
Other loan origination and maintenance expense: Other loan origination and maintenance expense increased $3.3 million, or 55.4%, compared to 2018. This increase was due principally to expenses associated with the repurchase of certain guaranteed loans in the portfolio during the third quarter of 2019 along with increases in the ongoing guarantee fees arising from holding a higher volume of loans on balance sheet.
Title insurance closing services expense: Expenses associated with title insurance closing services decreased $912 thousand, or 100.0%, driven by the exit from the title insurance business during the third quarter of 2018.
Impairment expense on goodwill and other intangibles, net: During the third quarter of 2018, the Company incurred a one-time impairment expense of $2.7 million on goodwill and other intangibles associated with the sale of Reltco, Inc.
Results of Segment Operations
Years ended December 31, 2020 vs. 2019
The Company’s operations are managed along two primary operating segments” Banking and Fintech. A description of each business and the methodologies used to measure financial performance is described in Note 16. Segments in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. Net income (loss) by operating segment is presented below:
Banking
Net income increased $27.8 million, or 93.7%, compared to 2019. The increase was primarily the result of increased net interest income, non-interest income and a decrease in income tax expense.
Net interest income increased $55.3 million, or 39.6%, compared to 2019. See the analysis of net interest income included in the above section captioned “Net Interest Income and Margin” as it is predominantly related to the Banking segment.
See the analysis of provision for loan and lease credit losses included in the above section captioned “Provision for Loan and Lease Credit Losses” as it is entirely related to the Banking segment.
Noninterest income increased $13.5 million, or 21.0%, compared to 2019. This increase was largely comprised of net gains on sales of loans increasing $20.4 million, or 70.6% combined with a net positive increase in the loan servicing asset revaluation of $6.6 million, or 39.9%. See the analysis of these categories of noninterest income included in the above section captioned “Noninterest Income” for additional discussion.
Noninterest expense increased $29.3 million, or 19.3% compared to 2019. See the analysis of these categories of noninterest expense included in the above section captioned “Noninterest Expense” for additional discussion.
Income tax expense decreased $14.0 million, or 205.4%, compared to 2019. See the below section captioned “Income Tax Expense.”
Fintech
Net loss decreased by $6.3 million, or 76.6%, compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily the result of increased non-interest income.
Noninterest income increased $9.0 million compared to 2019, or 369.6%, compared to 2019. This significant increase was largely due to the earlier discussed $13.7 million non-cash gain resulting from the increase in the observable fair market value of the Company’s investment in Greenlight combined with an increase of $4.6 million, or 264.7%, in Canapi’s management fee income. Partially offsetting the increase in noninterest income during 2020 was the Company’s pro rata portion of income tax expense of $7.8 million arising from Apiture’s conversion from a partnership to a corporation.
Noninterest expense decreased $1.6 million, or 22.2% compared to 2019. This decrease was largely due to a significant reduction in legal related expenses associated with the formation of Canapi in the prior year.
Income tax expense increased $4.2 million, or 345.4%, compared to 2019, consistent with the segment’s increase in net income before taxes.
Years ended December 31, 2019 vs. 2018
Banking
Net income for 2019 decreased $35.7 million, or 54.6%, compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily the result of a higher provision for loan and lease losses, lower non-interest income, higher noninterest expense and higher levels of income tax expense.
Net interest income increased $31.8 million, or 29.5%, compared to 2018. See the analysis of net interest income included in the above section captioned “Net Interest Income and Margin” as it is predominantly related to the Banking segment.
See the analysis of provision for loan and lease credit losses included in the above section captioned “Provision for Loan and Lease Credit Losses” as it is entirely related to the Banking segment.
Noninterest income decreased $27.6 million, or 30.2%, compared to 2018. This decrease was largely the result of intentionally lower net gains on sales of loans decreasing $46.2 million, or 61.4%. See the analysis of these categories of non-interest income included in the above section captioned “Noninterest Income” for additional discussion.
Noninterest expense increased $21.6 million, or 16.6% compared to 2018. See the analysis of these categories of noninterest expense included in the above section captioned “Noninterest Expense” for additional discussion.
Income tax expense increased $8.5 million compared to 2018. See the below section captioned “Income Tax Expense.”
Fintech
Net loss for 2019 increased by $7.3 million, compared to 2018. The increase was primarily the result of increased noninterest expenses.
Noninterest income decreased $2.1 million, or 531.1%, compared to 2018. This decrease was largely due to pro rata losses related to the Company’s equity method investments.
Noninterest expense increased $6.5 million compared to 2018. This decrease was largely due to legal and other startup expenses associated with the formation of Canapi.
Income tax benefit increased $1.2 million compared to 2018, consistent with the segment’s decrease in net income before taxes.
Income Tax Expense/Benefit
Years ended December 31, 2020 vs. 2019
Income tax benefit in 2020 was $12.2 million compared to a net income tax expense in 2019 of $5.4 million. The income tax benefit in 2020 was principally the product of vesting of restricted stock unit awards with market price conditions during the fourth quarter combined with the tax impact of enactment of the CARES Act on March 27, 2020. Upon vesting, the fair value of the above mentioned awards exceeded the total compensation cost recognized by the Company for book purposes, which resulted in the recognition of a tax benefit of $22.1 million. The Company also recorded a tax benefit of $3.7 million due to the CARES Act, which allows the carryback of certain net operating losses to each of the five taxable years preceding the taxable year of such losses.
Years ended December 31, 2019 vs. 2018
For 2019 and 2018, there was an income tax expense of $5.4 million and benefit of $5.4 million, respectively, and the Company's effective tax rates were 23.1% and (11.7)%, respectively. The negative effective rate for 2018 was largely a product of significant investments in renewable energy assets which generate investment tax credits. For 2019, investment tax credits were less of a driver for the Company’s effective tax rate.
The Company invested $5.9 million and $70.2 million in renewable energy assets that generated $1.7 million and $20.3 million in investment tax credits in 2019 and 2018, respectively.
See Note 9. Income Taxes for more information.
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
December 31, 2020 vs. 2019
Total assets at December 31, 2020 were $7.87 billion, an increase of $3.06 billion, or 63.6%, compared to total assets of $4.81 billion at December 31, 2019. The growth in total assets was principally driven by the following:
•
Cash and cash equivalents, comprised of cash and due from banks and federal funds sold, increased $96.9 million largely as a product of increased levels of borrowings, deposits and loan sales used to fund planned PPP and other loan originations in 2020;
•
Increased investment securities available-for-sale by $210.1 million. This increase in investment securities was due to availability of excess surplus liquidity, discussed above related to pandemic readiness; and
•
Growth in loans and leases held for sale and held for investment of $2.73 billion resulting from strong origination activity in 2020, including $1.76 billion in PPP loans. Additionally, the Company originated a record of $2.69 billion loans and leases in 2020 excluding PPP loans.
Cash and cash equivalents, comprised of cash and due from banks and federal funds sold, was $318.3 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $96.9 million, or 43.8%, compared to $221.4 million at December 31, 2019. As mentioned above, this increase largely reflects funding for significant loan growth efforts during the year.
Total investment securities increased $210.1 million during 2020, from $540.0 million at December 31, 2019, to $750.1 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of 38.9%. The Company increased its investment securities position during 2020 largely as a part of improving returns on excess liquidity and meeting investment asset-liability plans. At December 31, 2020, the investment portfolio was comprised of U.S. government agency, U.S. government-sponsored enterprise mortgage-backed securities and municipal bonds.
Loans and leases held for sale increased $209.0 million, or 21.6%, during 2020, from $966.4 million at December 31, 2019, to $1.18 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily the result of strong loan originations in 2020.
Loans and leases held for investment increased $2.52 billion, or 95.8%, during 2020, from $2.63 billion at December 31, 2019, to $5.15 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily the result of the above-mentioned loan originations in 2020, and all PPP loans are classified as held for investment.
Premises and equipment, net, decreased $19.8 million, or 7.1%, during 2020 which was primarily driven by increased levels of depreciation of facilities and infrastructure to accommodate Company growth and solar panels to meet leasing obligations in prior periods. Also impacting premises and equipment was the decision to sell two aircraft in the year that were carried at an aggregate value of $19.2 million with a deposit on a single replacement aircraft of $19.1 million. The decision to sell these aircraft resulted in them being reclassified out of premises and equipment to other assets as held for sale assets carried at the lower of cost or market value. Upon reclassification to held for sale the Company recognized impairment charges of $1.3 million to mark the aircraft to their estimated fair value at that time. Management’s decision to sell two aircraft and replace with one was based upon the determination that the older aircraft were ineffective in efficiently serving the needs of an expanding nationwide customer base.
Other assets increased $73.2 million, or 46.2%, from $158.6 million at December 31, 2019 to $231.8 million at December 31, 2020. This increase was due to a variety of items, principally comprised of a $21.4 million increase in accrued interest receivable largely due to significantly higher levels of interest earning assets combined with the deferral of payments on PPP loans, the earlier discussed $13.7 million increase in the carrying value of the Company’s investment in Greenlight, $10.4 million in increased receivables from the SBA for guarantee recoveries, $8.9 million for one of the two aircraft discussed above remaining unsold at year end, $7.9 million in net tax receivable and deferred tax assets reclassified from a net liability position in the prior year, $7.9 million in new investments and $4.0 million in new intangibles added as a result of the acquisition of Jolley Asset Management, LLC (as discussed more fully in Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies under the subheading Business Combination in the notes to the consolidated financial statements).
Total deposits were $5.71 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $1.49 billion, or 35.2%, from $4.23 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase in deposits was largely driven by the PPP and other significant loan origination efforts during the year.
Borrowings increased to $1.54 billion at December 31, 2020 from $14 thousand at December 31, 2019. This increase was related to $1.74 billion in new borrowings through the PPPLF in the second and third quarters of 2020. These PPPLF borrowings were used to help fund PPP loans and complement the defensive strategy earlier in the year to build liquidity due to the uncertainty of the effects of COVID-19.
Shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2020 was $567.9 million as compared to $532.4 million at December 31, 2019. The tangible book value per share (a non-GAAP measure, see “Non-GAAP Measures” below for a description and reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure) was $13.28 at December 31, 2020 compared to $13.20 at December 31, 2019. Average equity to average assets was 8.1% for 2020 compared to 12.2% for 2019. The increase in shareholders’ equity for 2020 was principally the result of net income of $59.5 million, stock-based compensation expense of $14.7 million, other comprehensive income of $9.8 million and stock option exercises of $3.1 million. Partially offsetting the increase in shareholders’ equity was $49.2 million in cash paid in lieu of stock for employee tax obligations in settlement of vested stock grants, principally related to the approximately 2.5 million awards with market price conditions vesting in the fourth quarter discussed earlier and $4.9 million in dividends.
During 2020, 1,807,774 shares of Class B common stock (non-voting) were converted to Class A common stock (voting) under private sales. The conversion decreased the value of Class B common stock (non-voting) and increased the value of Class A common stock (voting) by $19.1 million.
December 31, 2019 vs. 2018
Total assets at December 31, 2019 were $4.81 billion, an increase of $1.14 billion, or 31.2%, compared to total assets of $3.67 billion at December 31, 2018. This increase was principally driven by the following:
•
Increased investment securities available-for-sale of $159.6 million which was driven by the Company’s strategic plan to enhance liquidity and improve asset-liability repricing mix; and
•
Growth in loan and leases held for sale and held for investment of $1.08 billion resulting from strong originations and higher levels of balances being retained to support the Company's strategic plan to hold more loans.
Cash and cash equivalents were $223.5 million at December 31, 2019, a decrease of $93.3 million, or 29.4%, compared to $316.8 million at December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily the result of increased levels of loans held on books combined with the Company’s maximization of returns on liquid assets by redeployment of funds into higher-yielding available-for-sale securities.
Total investment securities increased $159.6 million during 2019, from $380.5 million at December 31, 2018 to $540.0 million at December 31, 2019, an increase of 41.9%. The Company began enhancing its investment securities position early in 2019 as part of its strategy to improve the returns of an enhanced liquidity profile and improve asset-liability repricing mix. At December 31, 2019, the investment portfolio was comprised of US treasury and government agency securities, mortgage-backed securities and municipal bonds.
Loans held for sale increased $279.1 million, or 40.6%, during 2019, from $687.4 million at December 31, 2018 to $966.4 million at December 31, 2019. This increase reflected the impact of a significantly lower volume of loan sales combined with strong origination activity during 2019.
Loans and leases held for investment increased $801.9 million, or 43.9%, during 2019, from $1.83 billion at December 31, 2018 to $2.63 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily the result of $2.00 billion in loan and lease origination activities during 2019 combined with the late 2018 strategic shift to retain higher levels of loans on the balance sheet.
Premises and equipment increased $16.6 million, or 6.3%, during 2019, from $262.5 million at December 31, 2018 to $279.1 million at December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily driven by construction of new facilities and infrastructure to accommodate Company growth.
Foreclosed assets increased $4.5 million, or 413.0%, during 2019 from $1.1 million at December 31, 2018 to $5.6 million at December 31, 2019. The increase in foreclosed assets arose primarily from four relationships. The underlying loans were subject to an SBA guarantee and the total current estimated exposure to the Company is considered negligible for these more recent foreclosures.
Servicing assets decreased $12.3 million, or 25.8%, during 2019 from $47.6 million at December 31, 2018 to $35.4 million at December 31, 2019 due to the reduced level of loan sales during the year combined with amortization of the outstanding balance of guaranteed loans sold. At December 31, 2019, the outstanding balance of government guaranteed loans sold in the secondary market was $2.75 billion compared to $3.05 billion at December 31, 2018. See the preceding Noninterest Income section under the subheading “Loan Servicing Revaluation” for more information.
Operating leases right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities were additions to the balance sheet pursuant to the adoption of the new lease standard (ASU No. 2016-02) effective January 1, 2019. These balance sheet accounts reflect the Company’s rights and obligations created by almost all leases in which it is a lessee with remaining terms of more than 12 months. See Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 4. Leases of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on the adoption of this new standard.
Total deposits were $4.23 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $1.08 billion, or 34.3%, from $3.15 billion at December 31, 2018. The increase in deposits was driven by the combined success of deposit gathering campaigns to support the growth in loan and lease originations and balance sheet management initiatives.
Other liabilities increased $25.0 million, or 96.6%, during 2019, from $25.8 million at December 31, 2018 to $50.8 million at December 31, 2019. The increase in other liabilities was largely driven by a $16.3 million increase in unfunded investment commitments to a series of new funds advised by Canapi Advisors, increased accruals for incentive compensation of $6.2 million and an increased deferred tax liability of $5.7 million.
Shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2019 was $532.4 million as compared to $493.6 million at December 31, 2018. The book value per share was $13.20 at December 31, 2019 and average equity to average assets was 12.2% for 2019, compared to a book value per share of $12.29 at December 31, 2018 and average equity to average assets of 13.8% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in shareholders’ equity is principally the result of net income to common shareholders of $18.0 million, other comprehensive income of $13.4 million and stock-based compensation expense of $11.7 million, partially offset by $4.8 million in dividends.
Loans Held for Sale & Serviced Portfolio
Any loan or portion of a loan that the Company has the intent and ability to sell is classified as held for sale. The average age of the held for sale portfolio as of December 31, 2020 was 13.5 months from origination date. Less than 25% of the current held for sale portfolio is older than two years. The majority of held for sale loans over one year old are composed of construction loans. Construction loans typically have extended build out periods that inherently result in longer lead times between origination and the ultimate sale date. Approximately 30.0% of the held for sale portfolio is aged between one and two years.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the cumulative total outstanding principal balance of loans sold since May 2007 totaled $3.20 billion and $2.97 billion, respectively. The Company generally continues to service loans after the date of sale. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the total outstanding principal of loans and leases, including those serviced for others, was $9.57 billion and $6.57 billion, respectively.
Loan and Lease Maturity
As of December 31, 2020, $6.49 billion, or 67.8%, of the total outstanding principal of loans and leases, including those serviced for others, were variable rate loans that adjust at specified dates based on the prime lending rate or other variable indices. As of December 31, 2020, $4.27 billion, or 44.6%, of total outstanding principal of loans and leases were variable rate loans that adjust on either a calendar monthly or calendar quarterly basis using the prime lending rate or other variable indices.
At December 31, 2020, 62.3%, or $4.0 billion, of the combined held for sale and held for investment loan and lease portfolio was composed of variable rate loans.
At December 31, 2020, $2.07 billion, or 40.1%, of the held for investment balance matures in less than five years. Loans and leases maturing in greater than five years total $3.09 billion of the total $5.16 billion. The variable rate portion of the total held for investment loans and leases, excluding PPP loans, is 81.4%, which reflects the Company’s strategy to minimize interest rate risk through the use of variable rate products.

Excludes net deferred (fees) costs
Asset Quality
Management considers asset quality to be of primary importance. A formal loan review function, independent of loan origination, is used to identify and monitor problem loans. This function reports directly to the Audit & Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.
Nonperforming Assets
The Bank places loans and leases on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days past due as to principal or interest payments, or prior to that if management has determined based upon current information available to them that the timely collection of principal or interest is not probable. When a loan or lease is placed on nonaccrual status, any interest previously accrued as income but not actually collected is reversed and recorded as a reduction of loan or lease interest and fee income. Typically, collections of interest and principal received on a nonaccrual loan or lease are applied to the outstanding principal as determined at the time of collection of the loan or lease.
Troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) occur when, because of economic or legal reasons pertaining to the debtor’s financial difficulties, debtors are granted concessions that would not otherwise be considered. Such concessions would include, but are not limited to, the transfer of assets or the issuance of equity interests by the debtor to satisfy all or part of the debt, modification of the terms of debt or the substitution or addition of debtor(s).
Nonperforming assets and TDRs, excluding loans measured at fair value, at December 31, 2020 were $82.5 million, which represented a $40.6 million, or 96.9%, increase from December 31, 2019. These nonperforming assets, at December 31, 2020 were comprised of $46.1 million in nonaccrual loans and leases and $4.2 million in foreclosed assets. Of the $82.5 million of nonperforming assets and TDRs, $43.1 million carried an SBA guarantee, leaving an unguaranteed exposure of $39.3 million in total nonperforming assets and TDRs at December 31, 2020. This represents an increase of $27.1 million, or 221.8%, from an unguaranteed exposure of $12.2 million at December 31, 2019.
The following table provides information with respect to nonperforming assets and troubled debt restructurings, excluding loans measured at fair value, at the dates indicated.

Excludes loans measured at fair value.
Total nonperforming assets and troubled debt restructurings, including loans measured at fair value, at December 31, 2020 were $153.2 million, which represented a $42.1 million, or 37.9%, increase from December 31, 2019. These nonperforming assets, at December 31, 2020 were comprised of $85.4 million in nonaccrual loans and leases and $4.2 million in foreclosed assets. Of the $153.2 million of nonperforming assets and TDRs, $97.7 million carried an SBA guarantee, leaving an unguaranteed exposure of $55.5 million in total nonperforming assets and TDRs at December 31, 2020. This represents an increase of $28.3 million, or 103.9%, from an unguaranteed exposure of $27.2 million at December 31, 2019.
See the below discussion related to the change in potential problem and individually evaluated loans and leases for management’s overall observations regarding growth in total nonperforming loans and leases.
As a percentage of the Bank’s total capital, nonperforming loans and leases, excluding loans measured at fair value, represented 8.8% at December 31, 2020, compared to 4.4% at December 31, 2019. Adjusting the ratio to include only the unguaranteed portion of nonperforming loans and leases at historical cost to reflect management’s belief that the greater magnitude of risk resides in this portion, the ratios at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 were 3.8% and 1.5%, respectively.
As of December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, potential problem (also referred to as criticized) and classified loans and leases, excluding loans measured at fair value, totaled $311.4 million and $129.1 million, respectively. The following is a discussion of these loans and leases. Risk Grades 5 through 8 represent the spectrum of criticized and classified loans and leases. For a complete description of the risk grading system used by the Company, see “Credit Quality Indicators” in Note 3 to the notes to consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2020, the portion of criticized and classified loans and leases guaranteed by the SBA or USDA totaled $168.9 million resulting in unguaranteed exposure risk of $142.5 million, or 8.2% of total held for investment unguaranteed exposure carried at historical cost. This compares to the December 31, 2019 portion of criticized and classified loans and leases guaranteed by the SBA or USDA which totaled $65.8 million resulting in unguaranteed exposure risk of $63.3 million, or 5.4% of total held for investment unguaranteed exposure carried at historical cost. As of December 31, 2020, loans and leases carried at historical cost within the following verticals comprise the largest portion of the total potential problem and classified loans and leases: Educational Services at 15.3%, Wine and Craft Beverage at 14.3%, Hotels at 13.6%, Entertainment Centers at 12.5%, Healthcare at 10.3%, Fitness Centers at 7.2%, Self Storage at 6.4% and Veterinary at 4.5%. As of December 31, 2019, loans and leases carried at historical cost within the following verticals comprise the largest portion of the total potential problem and classified loans and leases: Healthcare at 20.8%, Hotels at 14.7%, Wine and Craft Beverage at 14.3%, Self Storage at 8.4%, Veterinary at 7.1%, Government Contracting at 6.1%, and Educational Services at 5.7%. Other than Hotels and Government Contracting which are a part of the Company’s Specialty Lending division, all of the above listed verticals are within the Company’s Small Business Banking division. Two Government Contracting relationships were charged off in the first nine months of 2020 which resulted in a reduction in individually evaluated loans for this vertical. The majority of the increase in potential problem and classified loans and leases was comprised of a relatively small number of borrowers largely concentrated in the Company’s more mature verticals. Furthermore, the Company believes that its underwriting and credit quality standards have continued to tighten with emphasis on new production in pandemic resilient verticals and increased monitoring of existing loans in pandemic susceptible verticals as the impacts and uncertainties COVID-19 continue to evolve. With this emphasis, systemic issues have begun to appear within the Hotel, Wine and Craft Beverage, Fitness Centers, Educational Services, and Entertainment Center verticals due to stress related to the COVID-19 pandemic and contributed to the increase in criticized and classified loans and leases.
Loans and leases that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls are generally not individually evaluated for the purpose of estimating the allowance for credit losses. The Bank generally considers an “insignificant period of time” from payment delays to be a period of 90 days or less, unless the borrower was not past due at the time of a modification as a part of a COVID-19 assistance program. The Bank would consider a modification for a customer experiencing what is expected to be a short-term event that has temporarily impacted cash flow. This could be due, among other reasons, to illness, weather, impact from a one-time expense, slower than expected start-up, construction issues or other short-term issues. In all cases, credit personnel will review the request to determine if the customer is stressed and how the event has impacted the ability of the customer to repay the loan or lease long term. At December 31, 2020, the Company had $272.3 million in modified unguaranteed loans and leases for borrowers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. These modifications were primarily short-term payment deferrals generally no more than six-months in duration and accordingly are not considered troubled debt restructurings. As of February 22, 2021, the Company’s modified unguaranteed loans and leases for borrowers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic was approximately $74.3 million, a decrease from December 31, 2020 due to borrowers beginning to emerge from deferral needs.
Management endeavors to be proactive in its approach to identify and resolve problem loans and leases and is focused on working with the borrowers and guarantors of these loans and leases to provide loan and lease modifications when warranted. Management implements a proactive approach to identifying and classifying loans and leases as special mention (also referred to as criticized), Risk Grade 5. At December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, Risk Grade 5 loans and leases, excluding loans measured at fair value, totaled $237.5 million and $89.5 million, respectively. The increase in Risk Grade 5 loans and leases, exclusive of loans measured at fair value, during 2020 was principally confined to eight verticals: Educational Services ($37.9 million or 25.6%), Entertainment Centers ($26.1 million or 17.6%), Fitness Centers ($18.4 million or 12.4%), Wine and Craft Beverage ($17.4 million or 11.8%), Senior Care ($11.9 million or 8.1%), Hotels ($8.9 million or 6.0%), and Self Storage ($7.8 million or 5.3%). Other than Hotels, which are a part of the Company’s Specialty Lending division, all of the above listed verticals are within the Company’s Small Business Banking division. At December 31, 2020, approximately 100.0% of loans and leases classified as Risk Grade 5 are performing with no current payments past due more than 30 days. While the level of nonperforming assets fluctuates in response to changing economic and market conditions, in light of the relative size and composition of the loan and lease portfolio and management’s degree of success in resolving problem assets, management believes that a proactive approach to early identification and intervention is critical to successfully managing a small business loan portfolio. In conjunction with this, management believes that volumes of delinquencies may not be an accurate depiction of the borrower’s repayment abilities under the current pandemic induced circumstances due to payments being made by the SBA on behalf of borrower with loans under its programs. This payment assistance commenced in the first quarter and continued for six months. As government payment assistance began to expire toward the end of 2020, borrowers with continuing difficulties arising from the pandemic were provided additional relief through payment deferrals.
Management monitors these borrowers closely and has observed improving financial conditions. Management expects most will be able to resume making regular payments in early 2021.
Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Leases
See Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for a description of the methodologies used to estimate the allowance for credit losses prior to and after the adoption of ASC 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, on January 1, 2020.
The ACL of $28.2 million at December 31, 2019 increased by $24.1 million, or 85.3%, to $52.3 million at December 31, 2020. The ACL, as a percentage of loans and leases held for investment at historical cost amounted to 1.2% at December 31, 2020 and 1.6% at December 31, 2019. Excluding PPP loans and related reserves, the ACL, as a percentage of loans and leases held for investment at historical cost amounted to 1.8% at December 31, 2020. As mentioned earlier, the Company adopted the new CECL standard effective January 1, 2020. Upon adoption, the Company recorded a $1.3 million decrease in the ACL. In implementing CECL, the Company accordingly determined to use forecasted levels of unemployment as a primary economic variable in forecasting future expected losses. Based upon the severity of ongoing developments resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, combined with the effects of the above discussed increased levels of loan originations, significant charge-offs and model refinements in recognition of loss experience on non-mature verticals, as addressed more fully in the Provision for Loan and Lease Credit Losses section of Results of Operations, the Company’s allowance for credit losses on loans and leases increased significantly in 2020.
Actual past due held for investment loans and leases, inclusive of loans measured at fair value, have increased by $15.1 million since December 31, 2019. Total loans and leases 90 or more days past due increased $22.8 million, or 58.4%, compared to December 31, 2019. The increase was comprised of a $16.3 million and $6.6 million increase in the unguaranteed and guaranteed portions, respectively, of past due loans compared to December 31, 2019 and was the result of a small number of relationships across fourteen industries but primarily concentrated within the Hotel, Entertainment Center, Wine and Craft Beverage and Self-Storage verticals. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, total held for investment unguaranteed loans and leases past due as a percentage of total held for investment unguaranteed loans and leases, inclusive of loans measured at fair value, was 1.1% and 1.7%, respectively. Total unguaranteed loans and leases past due were comprised of $23.1 million carried at historical cost, an increase of $15.1 million, and $6.3 million measured at fair value, a decrease of $5.4 million as of December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019. Management continues to actively monitor and work to improve asset quality. Management believes the ACL of $52.3 million at December 31, 2020 is appropriate in light of the risk inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. Management’s judgments are based on numerous assumptions about current and expected events that it believes to be reasonable, but which may or may not be valid, including but not limited to factors related to the above mentioned SBA delinquency effect and pandemic-susceptible verticals. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that management’s ongoing evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio in light of changing economic conditions and other relevant circumstances will not require significant future additions to the ACL, thus adversely affecting the Company’s operating results. Additional information on the ACL is presented in Note 3. Loans and Leases Held for Investment and Credit Quality of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.

Investment Securities
Investment securities totaled $750.1 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $210.1 million, or 38.9%, compared to $540.0 million at December 31, 2019. The large increase in the investment portfolio for 2020 was primarily related to a strategic initiative to deploy the Bank’s excess cash position that arose from Q2 2020 efforts to safeguard liquidity, in the early stages of the global pandemic, as well as from the pledging of the PPP loans to the Federal Reserve PPPLF. This also included purchases of $57.8 million in mortgage-backed securities for purposes of complying with the Community Reinvestment Act and purchases of $237.0 million in mortgage-backed securities and $102.3 million in collateralized mortgage obligations to increase yield and duration.
The investment securities portfolio consists entirely of available-for-sale securities. The Company purchases securities for the investment securities portfolio to manage interest rate risk, ensure a stable source of liquidity and to provide a steady source of income in excess of cost of funds.
At December 31, 2020, the duration of the overall available-for-sale securities portfolio was approximately 4.63 years.
The following table sets forth the stated maturities and weighted average yields of investment securities at December 31, 2020. Certain mortgage related securities have adjustable interest rates and will reprice annually within the various maturity ranges. These repricing schedules are not reflected in the tables below.
At December 31, 2020, the Company had 97.4% of its total investment securities portfolio in mortgage-backed securities, compared with 93.2% at December 31, 2019. The Company has continued to purchase mortgage-backed securities in order to obtain a favorable yield versus cash alternatives while still maintaining a low risk profile within the investment portfolio.
Deposits
The following table sets forth the composition of deposits.
Deposits increased to $5.71 billion at December 31, 2020 from $4.23 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $1.48 billion, or 35.2%. This increase was primarily due to the growth of the Company’s customer base in the savings and time deposit products, enhanced by a nationwide marketing campaign with attractive rates and additional wholesale funding. The $250.1 million increase in interest-bearing checking during 2020 was related to wholesale funding obtained for the PPP loan disbursements to small businesses. The $2.1 million decrease in interest-bearing checking during 2019 was related to the remaining wind-down of the Company’s trust operations that primarily occurred in 2018. Noninterest-bearing deposits increased $23.3 million, or 44.9%, during 2020, and interest-bearing deposits increased $1.46 billion, or 35.0%, during the same period. The growth in deposits during 2019 and 2018 was primarily in savings and time deposits, offset by a strategic initiative to reduce the Company’s wholesale money market funds. Long-term wholesale funding contributed to the time deposit increases.
At December 31, 2020, the aggregate balance of uninsured time deposit accounts totaled $67.2 million. At December 31, 2020, 71.7% of uninsured time deposit accounts were scheduled to mature within one year. The maturity profile of uninsured time deposits at December 31, 2020 is as follows:
Borrowings
Total borrowings increased $1.54 billion at December 31, 2020 from December 31, 2019 as a result of the following:
In April 2020, the Company entered into the Federal Reserve Bank's Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility ("PPPLF"). Under the PPPLF, advances must be secured by pledges of loans to small businesses originated by the Company under the U.S. Small Business Administration's 7(a) loan program titled the Paycheck Protection Program. The PPPLF accrues interest at thirty-five basis points and matures at various dates equal to the maturity date of the PPPLF collateral pledged to secure the advance, ranging from April 1, 2022 to August 12, 2025, and will be accelerated on and to the extent of any 7(a) loan forgiveness reimbursement by the SBA for any PPPLF collateral or the date of purchase by the SBA from the borrower of any PPPLF collateral. On the maturity date of each advance, the Company repays the advance plus accrued interest. This $1.53 billion borrowing was fully advanced at December 31, 2020.
In September 2020, the Company renewed a revolving line of credit originally issued in 2017. The line of credit is unsecured and accrues interest at 30-day LIBOR plus 1.15% for a term of 13 months, with an interest rate cap of 4.25% and an interest rate floor of 2.75%. Payments are interest only with all principal and accrued interest due on October 10, 2021. The terms of this loan require the Company to maintain minimum capital and debt service coverage ratios. The $50.0 million line of credit was fully advanced at March 31, 2020. The Company made a principal paydown of $45.0 million on May 28, 2020 and $12 thousand on September 20, 2020. There was an additional advance and curtailment netting to $9.5 million on December 29, 2020. There is $14.5 million outstanding and $35.5 million of available credit remaining at December 31, 2020.
In October 2017, the Company entered into a financing lease of $19 thousand with an unaffiliated equipment lease company, secured by fitness equipment which is included in premises and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet. Payments are principal and interest due monthly starting December 15, 2017 over a term of 60 months. At the end of the lease term there is a $1.00 bargain purchase option. As of January 1, 2019, this borrowing was revised in accordance with ASU 2016-02. At December 31, 2020, the remaining balance is $9 thousand.
Liquidity Management
Liquidity management refers to the ability to meet day-to-day cash flow requirements based primarily on activity in loan and deposit accounts of the Company’s customers. Liquidity is immediately available from four major sources: (a) cash on hand and on deposit at other banks; (b) the outstanding balance of federal funds sold; (c) the market value of unpledged investment securities; and (d) availability under lines of credit, FHLB advances, and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. A primary tool in the Company’s liquidity management process is the utilization of a Volatile Liability Coverage Ratio (“VLCR”) model to stress outflows in various scenarios with targeted days of liquidity coverage. The VLCR model output is then used by management to ensure adequate liquidity sources are available during those future periods. At December 31, 2020, the total amount of these four liquidity source items was $3.06 billion, or 38.8% of total assets, an increase of 14.1% of total assets from $1.19 billion, or 24.7% of total assets, at December 31, 2019.
Loans and other assets are funded primarily by loan sales, wholesale deposits and core deposits. To date, an increasing retail deposit base and a stable amount of brokered deposits have been adequate to meet loan obligations, while maintaining the desired level of immediate liquidity. Additionally, an investment securities portfolio is available for both immediate and secondary liquidity purposes.
At December 31, 2020, none of the investment securities portfolio was pledged to secure public deposits or pledged to retail repurchase agreements, leaving $750.1 million available to be pledged as collateral.
Asset/Liability Management and Interest Rate Sensitivity
One of the primary objectives of asset/liability management is to maximize the net interest margin while minimizing the earnings risk associated with changes in interest rates. One method used to manage interest rate sensitivity is to measure, over various time periods, the interest rate sensitivity positions, or gaps. This method, however, addresses only the magnitude of timing differences and does not address earnings or market value. Therefore, management uses an earnings simulation model to prepare, on a regular basis, earnings projections based on a range of interest rate scenarios to more accurately measure interest rate risk.
