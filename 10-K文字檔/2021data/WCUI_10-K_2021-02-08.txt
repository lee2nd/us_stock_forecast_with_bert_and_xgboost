Background
Wellness Center USA, Inc. (“WCUI” or the “Company”) was incorporated in June 2010 under the laws of the State of Nevada. We initially engaged in online sports and nutrition supplements marketing and distribution. We subsequently expanded into additional businesses within the healthcare and medical sectors through acquisitions, including Psoria-Shield Inc. (“PSI”) and StealthCo Inc. (“SCI”), d/b/a Stealth Mark, Inc.
The Company currently operates in two business segments: (i) distribution of targeted Ultra Violet (“UV”) phototherapy devices for dermatology and sanitation purposes; and (ii) authentication and encryption products and services. The segments are conducted through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, PSI and SCI.
Results of Operations for the year ended September 30, 2020 compared to the year ended September 30, 2019
Revenue and Cost of Goods Sold
Revenue for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 was $5,000 and $33,375, respectively. The decrease in 2020 was due to the decrease in sales at the Authentication and Encryption segment, as there were no sales at the Medical Device segment for either year.
Cost of sales for the year ended September 30, 2019 was $20,025. There was no cost of sales for the year ended September 30, 2020. Gross profit for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, was $5,000 and $13,350, respectively. The gross profit decrease in 2020 was primarily due to the decrease in sales.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 was $1,926,594 and $1,779,934, respectively. The increase in operating expenses in 2020 was due to the increase in operating expenses at the Medical Device segment and at the corporate segment, offset by the decrease in operating expenses at SCI. The increase in expenses at the corporate segment primarily related to the increase in stock compensation expenses and the fair value of common stock issued for services, and lease settlement expenses. Stock compensation expenses and the fair value of common stock issued for services totaled to $583,064 and $379,954 during the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in expenses at the Medical Device segment primarily related to the increase in employee and contract labor related costs.
Other Expenses
Other income during the year ended September 30, 2020 consisted of $4,000 from a U.S. government grant relating to COVID-19 and $56,840 from the write-off of long outstanding accounts payable. Other expenses during the year ended September 30, 2020 consisted of $507,265 relating to the cost of the modification of terms of stock warrants, $22,680 relating to the cost of the modification of terms of stock options, $43,815 of financing costs and $67,861 of interest expense, totaling to a net expense of $580,781. Other expenses during the year ended September 30, 2019 consisted of $72,078 of amortization of debt discount, $182,064 of financing costs and $25,298 of interest expense, totaling to $279,440.
Net Loss
Our net loss for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 was $2,502,375 and $2,046,024, respectively. The increase in the net loss in 2020 was due to the increase in operating expenses and total other expenses.
Segment Information
Reportable segments are components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available and that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company’s reportable segments are based on products and services, geography, legal structure, management structure, or any other manner in which management disaggregates a company.
The Company operates in the following business segments:
(i) Medical Devices: which stems from PSI, its wholly-owned subsidiary acquired on August 24, 2012, a developer, manufacturer, marketer and distributer of targeted Ultra Violet (“UV”) phototherapy devices for the treatment of skin diseases and for sanitation purposes.
(ii) Authentication and Encryption Products and Services: which stems from StealthCo, its wholly-owned subsidiary formed on March 18, 2014, which has engaged in the business of selling, licensing or otherwise providing certain authentication and encryption products and services since acquisition of certain assets from SMI on April 4, 2014.
The detailed segment information of the Company is as follows:
There was no revenue or cost of sales for the Medical Devices segment for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Going Concern
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company has not yet generated significant revenues and has incurred recurring net losses. During the year ended September 30, 2020, the Company incurred a net loss of $2,502,375 and used cash in operations of $1,004,993, and had a shareholders’ deficit of $2,229,545 as of September 30, 2020. In addition, $396,250 of notes payable to officers and shareholders and $92,334 of payroll taxes are past due. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company’s ability to raise additional funds and implement its strategies. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.
In addition, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on the Company’s September 30, 2020 financial statements, has raised substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
At September 30, 2020, the Company had cash on hand in the amount of $51,320. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company attaining and maintaining profitable operations in the future and raising additional capital soon to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Since inception, we have funded our operations primarily through equity and debt financings and we expect to continue to rely on these sources of capital in the future. During the year ended September 30, 2020, the Company received $1,003,166 through short-term loans and contributions of capital by a joint venture partner.
No assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing or cause substantial dilution for our stock holders, in case of equity financing.
Comparison of years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019
As of September 30, 2020, we had $51,320 in cash, negative working capital of $2,199,340 and an accumulated deficit of $27,603,611.
As of September 30, 2019, we had $53,147 in cash, negative working capital of $1,085,556 and an accumulated deficit of $25,362,287.
Cash flows used in operating activities
During the year ended September 30, 2020, we used cash from operating activities of $1,004,993, compared to $1,219,313 used in the year ended September 30, 2019. During the year ended September 30, 2020, we incurred a net loss of $2,502,375 and had non-cash expenses of $1,560,722, compared to a net loss of $2,046,024 and non-cash expenses of $700,153 during the year ended September 30, 2019.

Patents, Trademarks, Franchises, Concessions, Royalty Agreements, or Labor Contracts
PSI received FDA clearance for the Psoria-Light on February 11, 2011 (no. K103540) and was granted permission to affix the CE mark for the Psoria-Light in the fourth quarter of 2011.
PSI’s founder and past president filed a provisional patent application covering certain aspects of the technology that we intend to utilize in the development and commercialization of the Psoria-Light, including handheld ergonomics, emitter platform and LED arrangements, methods for treatment site detection, cooling methods, useful information displays, collection of digital images and graphical correlation to quantitative metrics, and base console designs. Two non-provisional patent applications were submitted claiming the prior filing date of the initial provisional application.
The first non-provisional application describes a unique distance sensor located at the tip of the Psoria-Light hand-piece, which detects the treatment site based on a projected field. The sensor can detect electrolytic/conductive surfaces, such as human skin, without requiring any physical or direct electrical contact. Further, the unique sensor can sense the treatment site at any point about the tip of the hand-piece and without causing any attenuation of the therapeutic UV light output.
The second non-provisional application describes the integration and use of a digital camera in the Psoria-Light, including the location of the digital camera and how and when it is used to conveniently correspond to real-life treatment routines, how images are displayed and captured to memory, and how the images are arranged in patient records are illustrated. Additionally, the second non-provisional application describes the inclusion of clinician defined variables, such as health-related quality of life scores, and their placement into a graphical arrangement relative to treatment site images.
Both the initial provisional patent application and the two non-provisional patent applications are owned by PSI’s past president, who has granted PSI the sole and exclusive, worldwide, paid-up, royalty-free, perpetual license under the initial provisional patent application, any non-provisional patent applications filed by him covering the technology described in the initial provisional patent application, and associated know-how, technical data, and improvements to develop and commercialize the Psoria-Light.
PSI’s past president filed a second provisional patent application containing concepts for the improvement of microelectronics packages and thermal management solutions, the improvement of handheld phototherapy devices in general (either used on humans, animals, or plants, or used on inanimate objects), and replacement of laser therapy devices with LED devices. PSI was granted the sole and exclusive, worldwide, paid-up, royalty-free, perpetual license under this second provisional patent application, any non-provisional patent applications covering the technology described in the second provisional patent application, and associated know-how, technical data, and improvements to develop and commercialize the Psoria-Light.
