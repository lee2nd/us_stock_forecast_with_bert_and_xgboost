Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation
The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this report. This discussion contains, in addition to historical information, forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report. We disclaim any obligation to update information contained in any forward-looking statement.
General
We presently sell our ancillary gaming products in the United States but contemplate selling and leasing our products worldwide, in the future. Although the Company has obtained the license for the manufacturing, sale, marketing and licensing of the four roulette patents, the Company has not developed or manufactured any products for license, lease or sale to casinos as of yet. Although the Company is licensed to manufacturer patented roulette wheels and tables, it has no intention of doing so now or in the foreseeable future. The licensed games will not be available for sale on our website until approved by the applicable Gaming Control Board.
The Company has not, as of yet, arranged for any lines of credit, and we have no commitments, written or oral, from officers, directors or shareholders to provide the Company with advances, loans or other funding for our operations.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America required management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, based on historical experience, and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
From time to time new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard setting bodies that may have an impact on the Company’s accounting and reporting. The Company believes that such recently issued accounting pronouncements and other authoritative guidance for which the effective date is in the future will not have an impact on its accounting or reporting or that such impact will not be material to its financial position, results of operations and cash flows when implemented.
Results of Operations
Year ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the year ended December 31, 2019
Revenues
The Company did not generate revenues for the years ending December 31, 2020 and 2019.
General and Administrative Expenses
During the year ended December 31, 2020, general and administrative expenses were $70,208, consisting primarily of professional fees and stock compensation expense, as compared to $33,701 for year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $36,507 was primarily due to professional fees and stock compensation expense.
Interest Expense
During the year ended December 31, 2020, interest expense was $19,088 as compared to $9,169 for year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $9,919 was primarily due to an increase in accrued interest due to additional proceeds from third parties and amortization of debt discount.
Net Loss
Our net loss was $81,174 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to a loss of $42,870 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is primarily due to the reasons referred to above.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, we had a stockholders’ deficit of $144,757 and negative working capital of $139,022 compared to stockholders’ deficit of $238,056 and negative working capital of $238,056 at December 31, 2019. Cash was $65,176 as of December 31, 2020, as compared to $3,113 at December 31, 2019. This decrease in our working capital was primarily attributable to the increase of cash of $62,063, the decrease in accrued interest due of $1,465, the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $1,771, an increase in convertible notes of $5,735 and a decrease in notes payable - other of $43,973. The net loss for the year ended 2020 was primarily due to professional fees of $55,984 and finance costs of $12,000.
Net cash used in operations during 2020 was $23,937 compared with $31,570 used in operations during 2019. Cash used in operations during 2019 was primarily due to the net loss in the period and changes in accrued interest.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $86,000 in 2020 and $34,673 in 2019, which was the result of proceeds from convertible notes payable and notes payable.
Going Concern
Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion regarding our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company generated minimal revenues, has experienced recurring net operating losses since inception and had negative working capital of $139,022 and stockholders’ deficit of $144,757 at December 31, 2020. Because of these factors, among others, our auditors have issued a going concern opinion on our audited financial statements that raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty. We will need to raise funds or implement our business plan to continue operations.
The Company’s present plans, the realization of which cannot be assured, to overcome these difficulties include, but are not limited to, among other things, additional capital resources. Management’s plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking equity and/or debt financing. Through capital influx from third party investors, the Company plans to spend on marketing for all current products to generate revenues, enter into license and royalty agreements with its patented products, as well as seek acquisitions that generate cash flows. However management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans.
