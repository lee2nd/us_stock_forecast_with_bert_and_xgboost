ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact, including without limitation, statements containing the words “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates” and similar words, constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. From time to time we may make other forward-looking statements. Investors are cautioned that such forward-looking statements are subject to an inherent risk that actual results may materially differ as a result of many factors, including the risks discussed from time to time in this report, including the risks described under “Risk Factors” in any filings we have made with the SEC.
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities, certain disclosures at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates affecting the financial statements have been prepared on the basis of he most current and best available information. However, actual results from the resolution of such estimates and assumptions may vary from those used in the preparation of the financial statements.
Background
The Company was formed in Nevada in August 30, 2002 as IntelSource Group, Inc. and began operations in 2003. In 2007, IntelSource Group, Inc. merged with ElectroMedical Technologies, LLC. The Company began acting as Electro Medical Technologies, LLC, an Arizona limited liability company on November 9, 2010 after the merger with ElectroMedical Technologies, LLC, a Nevada Company. The Company converted to a corporation in the State of Delaware on August 23, 2017.
Electromedical Technologies is a bioelectronics manufacturing and marketing company. We offer U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared medical devices for pain management.
Bioelectronics is a developing field of “electronic” medicine, which uses electrical impulses over the body’s neural circuitry to try to alleviate pain, without drugs. The human body is controlled by electrical signals sent through the nervous system, which can become distorted after accidents or as a result of disease. The field of bioelectronic medicine aims to safely correct irregularities in the nervous system by modifying the electrical language of the body related to pain relief.
Our mission is to improve global wellness for people suffering from various painful conditions by relieving chronic and acute pain using energy, frequency and vibration as an alternative to pharmaceuticals; and one day, read and modifies electrical signals passing along nerves in the body, to restore long-term health.
Additionally, we have a corporate goal to offer the public effective alternatives to addictive pain -relieving drugs, such as opioids. According to the Society of Actuaries, opioid overdose deaths are now the single largest factor slowing the growth in U.S. life expectancy and has led to stagnation or decreases in life expectancy three years in a row for the first time since 1915-1918, when the country was facing World War I and the Spanish flu pandemic. The U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported that, from 1999 through 2017, nearly 400,000 have died from overdoses from prescription or illicit opioids. It is our aim to offer effective alternatives to pain management.
Results of Operations
Overview and Financial Condition
Going Concern
The Company sustained continued operating losses during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The Company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations, in which it has not been successful, and/or obtaining additional financing from its shareholders or other sources, as may be required.
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern; however, the above conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to do so. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets, or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result, should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
Management is endeavoring to commence revenue-generating operations. While priority is on generating cash from operations through the sale of the Company’s products, management is also seeking to raise additional working capital through various financing sources, including the sale of the Company’s equity and/or debt securities, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If such financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue our business as desired and our operating results will be adversely affected. In addition, any financing arrangement may have potentially adverse effects on us and/or our shareholders. Debt financing (if available and undertaken) will increase expenses, must be repaid regardless of operating results and may involve restrictions limiting our operating flexibility. If we issue equity securities to raise additional funds, the percentage ownership of our existing shareholders will be reduced and the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the current holders of our shares of Common Stock.
Results of Operations
The following table sets forth the audited results of our operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Operating Results
January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020 Compared to January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019
Our sales totaled $737,958 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $829,737 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease is primarily related to a decrease in units sold, partially offset by an increase in average selling price. In 2020, the COVID -19 pandemic had an impact on worldwide manufacturing and supply and affected our ability to replenish inventory. In addition, we were not able to attend trade shows.
Cost of sales and gross margins for the year ended December 31, 2020 and for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $194,384 and 74% and $238,516 and 71%, respectively. Our cost of sales consists of the cost of materials and distribution expenses. The increase in gross margin is primarily attributed to an increase in average selling price including pricing to certain distributors and the release and sale of previously written off inventory. Cost of sales and gross margins are affected by product mix as well as the mix in the level of sales between commissioned agents and distributors.
The following table sets forth the operating expenses for the years ended December 31,2020 and 2019:
The following table sets forth the stock- based compensation expense included in the above operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll related expenses, commissions, consulting and professional fees, sales and marketing, research and development and other operating expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $3,710,262 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $2,259,848 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $1,450,414 or about 64%. The change is primarily due to increases in stock-based compensation expense of $1,421,569, consulting and professional fees of $204,118, marketing costs of $183,787, research and development costs of $31,600 and other operating expenses of $45,277, partially offset by decreases in payroll related costs of $394,558 and commissions of $41,379. The increase in stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2020, includes $2,213,128 related to third party agreements for financial advisory services. Stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes $492,563 related to the sale by the Company’s CEO of 693,750 shares of common stock to certain employees at par value, $151,557 related to third party agreements for financial advisory and marketing services and $157,168 related to outstanding stock options.
The increase in consulting and professional fees relates primarily to costs associated with operating as a public company.
The decrease in payroll related expenses is primarily related to the Company CEO’s signing bonus of $500,000 in conjunction with the October 2019 employment agreement and a decrease in medical insurance premiums and expenses related to a 2019 termination, partially offset by an increase in CEO salary. CEO compensation increased beginning in October 2019. The decrease in commissions is related to a decrease in sales as well as a promotion in the 2019 period that did not occur in 2020.
Other expense increased by $629,324 primarily due to an increase in interest expense of $714,777 and a decrease in the change in fair value of the KISS liability- related party of $13,114, partially offset by a decrease in value of derivative liabilities of $71,413. The increase interest expense includes $684,901 related to the amortization of debt discount and $39,285 accrued on the convertible promissory notes entered into during the year ended December 31, 2020.
As a result of the foregoing, we recorded a net loss of $3,871,724 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a net loss of $1,744,399 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in net loss is primarily attributed to the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, increase in interest expense and decreased gross profit.
January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019 Compared to January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018
Our sales totaled $829,737 for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $675,383 for the year ended December 31, 2018. Refocused sales and marketing efforts after the 2018 Reg A+ offering contributed to the increase, also resulting in an increase in units sold. In addition, the Company experienced a shortage of inventory in the last two months of 2018. The Company is continuing in its efforts to increase its sales but there is no guarantee that it will be able to do so.
Cost of sales and gross margins for the year ended December 31, 2019 and for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $238,516 and 71% and $168,716 and 75%, respectively. Our cost of sales consists of the cost of materials and distribution expenses. The decrease in gross margin is primarily attributed to a decrease in average selling price including pricing to certain distributors. Cost of sales and gross margins are affected by product mix as well as the mix in the level of sales between commissioned agents and distributors.
Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll, commissions, professional fees, sales and marketing, research and development and other operating expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $2,259,848 for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $787,370 for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $1,472,478 or about 187%. The change is primarily due to stock-based compensation expense of $801,287, $112,000 in CEO salary and a $500,000 signing bonus in conjunction with the newly signed employment agreement with the Company’s CEO.
As a result of the foregoing, we recorded a net loss of $1,744,339 for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to a net loss of $1,950,417 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in net loss is primarily attributed to the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, offset by the change in fair value of the related party Kiss Liability and increased gross profit.
Other expense consisted primarily of interest expense and change in fair value of the related party convertible note. The Company had net other expense of $1,669,714 for the year ended December 31, 2018, which includes $86,463 of interest expense and $1,586,805 of expense related to the fair market value adjustment to the Company’s KISS liability-related party. Interest expense increased by approximately $33,000 in 2018 from $53,707 to $86,463. In November 2018, the Company entered into an agreement with a key supplier, whereby the Company exchanged 247,565 shares of restricted common stock at a price of $0.71 per share as payment in full for the outstanding amount due the supplier of $175,771. The amount due the supplier included finance fees of approximately $29,000.
As a result of the foregoing, we recorded a net loss of $1,950,417 for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to a net loss of $510,412 for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
During the year ended December 31, 2020, our cash and cash equivalents increased by $264,913 reflecting net proceeds from financing activities of $1,601,573, partially offset by cash used in operations of $1,336,660. At December 31, 2020, the Company had a working capital deficit of $1,371,966 and cash on hand of $264,913.

Cash flows used in operating activities totaled $1,336,660 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to cash flows used of $280,772 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in cash flows used in operating activities is primarily the result of increased costs related to public Company operations, including costs associated with the Company’s S-1 filing, increased marketing efforts and a decrease in gross profit as well as cash outflows for inventory deposits.
Financing Activities
Cash flows provided from financing activities totaled $1,601,573 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $280,772 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The cash flows provided in the 2020 period are primarily the result of the following cash inflows:

$155,900 in net proceeds from government debt
$39,500 in net proceeds from PPP loan
$13,567 for the net issuance of common stock
These cash inflows were partially offset by debt repayments totaling $65,094
In February and March 2021, holders of convertible promissory notes converted principal and accrued interest totaling $184,900 into 1,019,113 shares of common stock.
In February 2021, the Company issued 1,100,000 shares of common stock to the Company’s CEO as compensation expense.
In February 2021, the Company issued 1,084,120 shares of common stock in conjunction with various financial advisory consulting agreements.
Pursuant to a financing commitment, on February 8, 2021 the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with a third party for the sale of convertible promissory notes in the principal amount totaling $1,000,000 and at a purchase price of 950,000. The first closing occurred upon the execution of the material definitive agreement in the face amount of $500,000, for a purchase price of $475,000. The second closing is in the face amount of $250,000 for a purchase price of $237,500, which was received on March 5, 2021, and the third closing in the face amount of $250,000 for a purchase price of $237,500. The notes mature 1 year from issuance. The lender has the right to convert the debt into fully paid and non- assessable shares of common stock at a price equal to the lower of $0.40 per share or at a price equal to 70% of the outstanding share price. Conversions are subject to adjustments due to stock dividends, stock splits, rights offerings or combinations, recapitalizations and reorganizations. Interest will accrue at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum, simple interest, in each case to the extent that the note and the principal amount and any unpaid accrued interest has not been converted into conversion shares (as defined) prior to the maturity date. Interest shall commence accruing on the issuance date and be computed on the basis of a 365-day year. In the event that any amount due hereunder is not paid as and when due, such amounts shall accrue interest at the rate of 22% per year, simple interest, non-compounding, until paid. The Company shall issue irrevocable transfer agent instructions reserving 15,471,894 shares of common stock for conversions under the note. In conjunction with the note the Company issued a warrant to purchase 2,500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $0.40 per share. The warrant expires on February 8, 2026. The Company is determining the accounting impact of this transaction on the financial statements.
On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern” and on March 10, 2020, declared it to be a pandemic. Actions taken around the world to help mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 include restrictions on travel, and quarantines in certain areas, and forced closures for certain types of public places and businesses. COVID-19, and actions taken to mitigate it, have had and are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on the economies and financial markets of many countries, including the geographical area in which the Company operates. While it is unknown how long these conditions will last and what the complete financial effect will be to the company, COVID-19 has had an adverse effect on our business, including our supply chains and distribution systems. While we are taking diligent steps to mitigate disruptions to our supply chain, we are unable to predict the extent or nature of these impacts at this time to our future financial condition and results of operations.
