Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report contain forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the section of this Annual Report titled “Risk Factors,” our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company with a pipeline of novel biologic therapeutic candidates, developed using our protein engineering expertise and proprietary single domain antibody, or sdAb, platform. Our sdAb platform allows us to pursue validated targets with clinical promise, but where other antibody and biologic based approaches have failed. Highly modular, our sdAbs can be combined with precise valencies and multiple specificities, creating therapeutic candidates designed to be capable of enhanced cell signaling, conditional activation or combined synergistic functions.
We currently have four programs in ongoing clinical trials, with the most advanced expected to initiate a registration-enabling trial in mid-2021. Three of these programs are for the treatment of various cancers, and one for the treatment of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency, or AATD. Our most advanced therapeutic candidate, INBRX-109, is a tetravalent death receptor 5, or DR5, agonist currently being evaluated in patients diagnosed with difficult-to-treat cancers, such as chondrosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, mesothelioma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. We plan to submit an amended Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, for INBRX-109 during March 2021. We expect to initiate a registration-enabling trial evaluating INBRX-109 in patients diagnosed with conventional chondrosarcoma around mid-2021. INBRX-106 is a hexavalent OX40 agonist, currently being investigated as a single agent and in combination with Keytruda, in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Both INBRX-109 and INBRX-106 programs are designed to achieve target agonism through precise control of therapeutic valency. INBRX-105 is a conditional 4-1BB agonist, currently being investigated in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors, as a single agent and initiating in combination with Keytruda during the second quarter of 2021. Our fourth program, INBRX-101, is an optimized, recombinant alpha 1 antitrypsin, or AAT, augmentation therapy for AATD. We anticipate additional data releases from all four of our clinical programs in 2021.
We have developed a diverse pipeline of therapeutic candidates that are specifically designed to leverage the power of our core sdAb platform and protein engineering expertise, as shown below:
INBRX-109 INBRX-106 INBRX-105 INBRX-101

Advancing INBRX-109 into registration-enabling randomized Phase 2 trials is contingent upon the FDA’s approval of the Company’s IND amendment, which is planned to be submitted in March 2021.
Since our inception, we have had significant operating losses. Our net loss for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $76.1 million and $51.4 million, respectively. During August 2020, we completed an initial public offering of our common stock, or our IPO, in which we sold 8,050,000 shares of common stock at an offering price of $17.00 per share. Proceeds from the IPO, net of underwriting discounts, commissions and offering costs, were $125.9 million. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $145.4 million and cash and cash equivalents of $128.7 million. Since our inception, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to therapeutic drug discovery and development, conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, enabling manufacturing activities in support of our therapeutic candidates, hiring to support our research and development activities and financial reporting capabilities, establishing our intellectual property portfolio, and raising capital to support and expand these activities. Our primary use of cash has been to fund operating expenses, which consist primarily of research and development expenditures, and to a lesser extent, general and administrative, or G&A, expenditures. Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay these expenses, as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses. We expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect our research and development expenses, G&A expenses and capital expenditures will continue to increase. In particular, we expect our expenses and losses to increase as we continue our development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our therapeutic candidates (especially as we move more candidates from preclinical to clinical development as well as study candidates in later stages of clinical development), and begin to commercialize any approved products, if ever. We also expect our expenses and losses to increase as we hire additional personnel and incur increased accounting, audit, legal, regulatory, compliance, and director and officer insurance costs and as we incur increased costs from investor and public relations expenses associated with operating as a public company. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on the timing of our clinical trials and our expenditures on other research and development activities.
Based upon our current business plan, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next 12 months from the issuance date of this report. To date, we have not had any therapeutics approved for sale and have not generated any revenue
from the commercial sale of approved therapeutic products. We do not expect to generate any revenue from therapeutic product sales unless and until we, or our collaboration partners, successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our therapeutic candidates, which we expect will take a number of years. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our therapeutic candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. As a result, until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through equity offerings, debt financings or other capital sources, including strategic licensing and collaboration or other similar agreements. However, there can be no assurance as to the availability or terms upon which such finances or capital might be available in the future. If we are unable to secure adequate additional funding, we will need to reevaluate our operating plan and may be forced to make reductions in spending, extend payment terms with suppliers, liquidate assets where possible, delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs, or relinquish rights to our intellectual property on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose. These actions could materially impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.
We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of any of our therapeutic candidates, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We currently rely on a limited number of third-party contract manufacturers for all of our required raw materials, antibodies, and other biologics for our preclinical research, clinical trials, and if and when applicable, commercial product, and employ internal resources to manage our manufacturing relationships with these third parties.
License and Collaboration Agreements
Celgene Agreement
On July 1, 2013, we entered into a license agreement with Celgene, as amended on November 23, 2018, or the Celgene Agreement, pursuant to which we granted Celgene an exclusive, global license for the development, manufacture and commercialization of our proprietary CD47 binding domain, or the Celgene Licensed Intellectual Property. Per the terms of the Celgene Agreement, Celgene is operationally and financially responsible for the development, manufacturing and commercialization activities of Celgene Licensed Intellectual Property and any additional related antibodies covered by the Celgene Agreement.
As payment for the license granted in the Celgene Agreement, we may be eligible to receive development and regulatory milestones of an aggregate of $934.1 million, assuming the achievement of all potential milestones in the Celgene Agreement, as well as percentage tiered royalties based on future worldwide sales, with rates ranging between the high single-digits and low teens, subject to potential reduction when and if comparable third party products attain certain levels of competitive market share (on a country-by-country basis) and, subject to certain limitations, payments to third parties for third-party intellectual property rights. We are obligated to pay 2% of future amounts received under the Celgene Agreement to advisors who assisted us with the negotiations and other matters in connection with the Celgene Agreement.
WuXi Agreement
Pursuant to the WuXi Agreement, we agreed, for three years and subject to certain conditions, to exclusively use WuXi to manufacture our therapeutic candidates for which we plan to first initiate clinical studies outside of China. Under the WuXi Agreement, WuXi and certain of its affiliates will provide biologics development and manufacturing services on a project-by-project basis.
Per the terms of the WuXi Agreement, we will own all intellectual property created, developed or reduced to practice by WuXi in the course of providing services to us; provided that, certain intellectual property created or developed by WuXi may be owned exclusively by WuXi if this intellectual property (i) relates to generally applicable experimental methods, (ii) relates to generally applicable manufacturing processes, developed solely at WuXi’s expense, or (iii) is derivative of WuXi’s pre-existing intellectual property.
Per the terms of the WuXi Agreement, fees will be mutually agreed upon on a project-by-project basis. We also may be eligible to receive discounts in the low- to mid-single digits for certain projects and services per the terms of the WuXi Agreement.
bluebird bio Agreements
On December 20, 2018, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with bluebird to research, develop and commercialize CAR T-cell therapies using our proprietary sdAb platform. Under the terms of this license agreement we will provide bluebird the exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize certain cell therapy products containing sdAbs directed to various cancer targets. In January 2019, we received a $7.0 million payment and pursuant to the license agreement, we are entitled to receive developmental milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $51.5 million per therapeutic, as well as percentage tiered royalties on future product sales with rates in the mid-single digits.
On June 9, 2020, we entered into the 2020 bluebird Agreement with bluebird, pursuant to which we granted to bluebird exclusive worldwide rights to develop binders and cell therapy products containing sdAbs directed to specified targets, consisting of two initial programs and up to an additional 8 programs. Inhibrx retains all rights to the specific sdAbs outside of the cell therapy field. We received a non-refundable upfront option fee of $0.2 million in connection with each of the two initial programs, or $0.4 million in aggregate, and we are entitled to an upfront option fee for each additional program. We also granted to bluebird an option to acquire an exclusive license with respect to all binders and cell therapy products developed under the 2020 bluebird Agreement, which entitles us to additional fees upon exercise of the option. We are also entitled to receive certain developmental milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $51.5 million per therapeutic, as well as percentage tiered royalties on future product sales with rates in the mid-single-digits.
Other Collaboration Agreements
In addition to these contracts, we have entered into strategic collaborations with other third parties, including Chiesi, Phylaxis (as defined below), Transcenta, and Elpiscience. For more information regarding these agreements, refer to Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.
Components of Results of Operations
Revenue
To date, all of our revenue has been derived from licenses with collaboration partners and grant awards. We have not generated any revenue from the commercial sale of approved therapeutic products, and we expect our revenue for the next several years will be derived primarily from payments under our current and any future grant awards and agreements with our collaboration partners.
Operating Expenses
Research and Development
To date, our research and development expenses have related primarily to research activities, including our discovery efforts, and preclinical and clinical development and the manufacturing of our therapeutic candidates. Research and development expenses are recognized as incurred and payments made prior to the receipt of goods or services to be used in research and development are capitalized until the goods or services are received. We do not track our internal research and development expenses on a program-by-program basis as they primarily relate to personnel, early research and consumable costs, which are deployed across multiple projects under development.
Research and development expenses consist primarily of:
•External expenses, consisting of:
•expenses incurred in connection with the preclinical development of our programs;
•clinical trials of our therapeutic candidates, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants and contract research organizations, or CROs;
•expenses associated with manufacturing our contract development and manufacturing therapeutic candidates including under agreements with contract development and manufacturing organizations, or CDMOs; and
•other external expenses, such as laboratory services related to our discovery and development programs and other shared services, and
•Internal expenses, consisting of:
•salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel engaged in research and development functions;
•facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for depreciation and amortization, rent and maintenance of facilities; and
•other internal expenses, such as laboratory supplies and other shared research and development costs.
We expect that research and development expense will continue to increase over the next several years as we continue development of our therapeutic candidates currently in clinical stage development, support our preclinical programs, and continue to discover new therapeutic candidates, as well as increase our headcount. In particular, clinical development of our therapeutic candidates, as opposed to preclinical development, generally has higher development costs, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. Moreover, the costs associated with our CDMOs to manufacture our therapeutic candidates and future commercial products is also much more costly as compared to early stage preclinical development. We cannot determine with certainty the timing of initiation, the duration or the completion costs of current or future preclinical studies and clinical trials of our therapeutic candidates due to the inherently unpredictable nature of preclinical and clinical development. Preclinical and clinical development timelines, the probability of success and development costs can differ materially from expectations. We anticipate that we will make determinations as to which therapeutic candidates to pursue and how much funding to direct to each therapeutic candidate on an ongoing basis in response to the results of ongoing and future preclinical studies and clinical trials, regulatory developments and our ongoing assessments as to each therapeutic candidate’s commercial potential. We will need substantial additional capital in the future to support these efforts. In addition, we cannot forecast which therapeutic candidates may be subject to future collaborations, when such arrangements will be secured, if at all, and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements.
Our clinical development costs may vary significantly based on factors such as:
•per patient trial costs;
•the number of trials required for approval;
•the number of sites included in the trials;
•the countries in which the trials are conducted
•the length of time required to enroll eligible patients;
•the number of patients that participate in the trials;
•the number of doses that patients receive;
•the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients;
•potential additional safety monitoring requested by regulatory agencies;
•the duration of patient participation in the trials and follow-up;
•the cost and timing of manufacturing of our therapeutic candidates;
•the phase and development of our therapeutic candidates;
•the efficacy and safety profile of our therapeutic candidates; and
•uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
General and Administrative
G&A expenses consist primarily of:
•salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel engaged in G&A functions;
•expenses incurred in connection with accounting and audit services, legal services, business development and investor relations as well as consulting expense under agreements with third parties, such as consultants and contractors; and
•facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for depreciation and amortization, rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and supplies.
We expect our G&A expenses will continue to increase over the next several years as we incur increased accounting, audit, legal, regulatory, compliance, director and officer insurance costs as well as investor and public relations expenses associated with operating as a public company and as we increase our headcount.
Other Income (Expense)
Other income (expense) consists primarily of interest expense on our debt from Oxford and, prior to conversion, interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount related to the 2019 Note and the 2020 Notes. Other income (expense) also consists of gains or losses on the change in fair value of derivative liabilities, and gains or losses on the change in fair value of warrant liabilities.
Results of Operations
Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
The following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations for each of the periods indicated (in thousands, except percentages):
License Fee Revenue
License fee revenue increased by $3.7 million to $12.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 from $9.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The $12.8 million of license fee revenue recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily consisted of $7.4 million related to our option agreement with Chiesi, $2.0 million related to a milestone earned under our contract with Elpiscience, $2.0 million related to our agreements with Phylaxis (as defined below), and $0.4 million related to our option and license agreement with bluebird. The $9.1 million of license fee revenue recorded during the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted primarily of $7.0 million recorded as revenue from bluebird following the transfer of an exclusive license, $1.1 million recognized as revenue related to our option agreement with Chiesi, and $1.0 million upon completion of a milestone event from Transcenta.
Grant Revenue
Grant revenue decreased by $4.0 million to $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 from $4.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. Grant revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted of $0.1 million earned under our grant with the DoD which was completed in September 2020. Grant revenue during the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted of $3.1 million from CARB-X, $0.9 million from the NIH, and $0.2 million from the DoD. During 2019, we completed all work under our CARB-X and NIH grants.
Research and Development Expense
The following table sets forth the primary external and internal research and development expenses (in thousands, except percentages):
Research and development expense increased by $25.6 million to $73.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 from $47.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The overall increase in research and development expense was primarily due to the following factors:
•contract manufacturing expense increased by $30.6 million, which was primarily attributable to work performed by our CDMO partners for the formulation and manufacturing of our INBRX-101 and INBRX-109 therapeutic candidates;
•clinical trial expense increased by $1.8 million, which was primarily attributable to increased CRO costs from the progression of our Phase 1 Trials;
•preclinical expense decreased by $7.8 million, which was primarily attributable to the completion of preclinical development of our four clinical programs as they progress through the pipeline;
•personnel-related expense increased by $1.7 million, which was primarily attributable to an overall increase in our headcount, certain salary adjustments, and additional stock-based compensation expense from existing and new option grants, as well as an increase in R&D executive bonuses during the year ended December 31, 2020;
•facilities expense increased by $0.9 million, which was primarily attributable to additional rent payments under an amended lease which commenced in January 2020; and
•other research and development expense decreased by $1.6 million, which was primarily attributable to a decrease in the purchase of lab supplies as we progressed our four main programs into clinical trials.
G&A Expense
G&A expense increased by $0.5 million to $6.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 from $6.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. Personnel-related expenses increased by $0.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, due to increased headcount during the period, as well as certain salary adjustments, G&A executive bonus increases, and additional stock-based compensation expense from existing and new option grants during the year ended December 31, 2020. Facilities expense increased by $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2019 due to increased rent expense under our amended building lease which commenced in January 2020.
Abandoned Offering Costs
In August 2020, we successfully completed an IPO, and offset all costs against the proceeds earned. Therefore, no abandoned IPO costs were incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we abandoned our contemplated IPO and wrote off all related IPO costs for a total of $2.8 million.
Other Income (Expense)
Interest expense, net. Interest expense, net, increased by $5.1 million to $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, $7.8 million of the total interest expense was related to accrual of interest and amortization of debt discounts on the 2019 Note and the 2020 Notes through their conversion date, in addition to $2.2 million of debt discounts on the 2019 Note and the 2020 Notes accelerated upon the conversion in August 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2019, $5.2 million of the total interest expense was related to the 2019 Note, which was issued in May 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, $0.9 million of the total interest expense was related to the Amended 2020 Loan Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2019, $0.7 million of the total interest expense was related to the loan and security agreement, as amended, or the 2015 Loan Agreement with Oxford, which was paid in full in March 2020.
Other income, net. Other income, net, was comparable for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the prior year.
Change in fair value of warrant liabilities. During the third quarter of 2020, we issued warrants to Oxford, which were classified as liabilities at their fair value. Following our IPO, the warrants were remeasured and reclassified into equity. The change in fair value of approximately $24,000 upon the remeasurement was reflected as the change in fair value of warrant liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Change in fair value of derivative liabilities. The change in fair value of derivative liabilities of $2.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the decrease in fair value of the derivative liabilities on the 2019 Note and the 2020 Note to zero. The change in fair value of the derivative liabilities was assessed to be zero during the second quarter of 2020 due to the expected conversion of the notes via an embedded conversion feature which did not meet the definition of a derivative. The 2019 Note and the 2020 Notes later converted during the third quarter of 2020 and the derivative liabilities were extinguished. The change in fair value of the derivative liability of $1.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 related to the increase in fair value of the derivative liability on the 2019 Note after its establishment in May 2019.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense decreased by $0.9 million to approximately $3,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was due to foreign income tax expense incurred during 2019 related to payments received from Chiesi and Transcenta. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we have applied a 100% valuation allowance against our federal deferred tax assets since it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Loss on Equity Method Investment
During the third quarter of 2020, we entered into a joint venture an entity affiliated with ArrowMark Partners, Phylaxis BioScience, LLC, or Phylaxis, and received a 10% equity interest in the company. Upon receipt of the equity interest, we established an equity method investment at fair value. The loss on equity method investment during the year ended December 31, 2020 of $0.5 million consists of our share of losses from our investment in Phylaxis, which reduced our equity investment to zero.
Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Condition
Sources of Liquidity
In August 2020, we completed our IPO of 8,050,000 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $17.00 per share, which included the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase 1,050,000 additional shares of our common stock. Our aggregate net proceeds from the offering were $125.9 million, net of underwriting discounts, commissions and offering costs.
Prior to the IPO, other sources of capital raised to fund our operations were comprised of the sale of equity securities, payments received from commercial partners for licensing rights to our therapeutic candidates under development and grants, borrowings under loan and security agreements with Oxford including $10.0 million of gross proceeds borrowed under the 2020 Loan Agreement in July 2020, and proceeds from the sale and issuance of the 2019 Note and the 2020 Notes.
Funding Requirements
As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $128.7 million. Based upon our current operating plans, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months from the issuance date of this report. Our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could deplete our capital resources sooner than we expect. Additionally, the process of conducting preclinical studies and testing product candidates in clinical trials is costly, and the timing of progress and expenses in these studies and trials is uncertain.
Our future liquidity and capital funding requirements will depend on numerous factors, including:
•the outcome, costs and timing of preclinical studies and clinical trials for our current or future therapeutic candidates;
•whether and when we are able to obtain regulatory approval to market any of our therapeutic candidates;
•our ability to successfully commercialize any therapeutic candidates that receive regulatory approval;
•the emergence and effect of competing or complementary therapeutics or therapeutic candidates;
•our ability to maintain, expand and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio, including the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make, or that we may receive, in connection with the licensing, filing, prosecution, defense and enforcement of any patents or other intellectual property rights;
•our ability to retain our current employees and the need and ability to hire additional management and scientific and medical personnel;
•the terms and timing of any strategic licensing, collaboration or other similar agreement that we have or may establish;
•our ability to repay, refinance or restructure our indebtedness when payment is due, including in the event such indebtedness is accelerated;
•the valuation of our capital stock; and
•the continuing or future effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related uncertainties on capital and financial markets.
We will continue to require additional funding in order to complete the development of our therapeutic candidates and commercialize our therapies, if approved. Until such time, if ever, in which we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to continue to fund our operations and capital funding needs through potential future equity offerings, debt financings or other capital sources, including strategic licensing, collaboration, or other similar arrangement. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed, on favorable terms or at all. If we are unable to secure adequate additional funding, we will need to reevaluate our operating plan and may be forced to make reductions in spending, extend payment terms with suppliers, liquidate assets where possible, delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs, or relinquish rights to our intellectual property on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose. These actions could materially impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.
Cash Flow Summary
The following table sets forth a summary of the net cash flow activity for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):
Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities was $48.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 and consisted primarily of a net loss of $76.1 million, adjusted for non-cash items including accretion on our debt discount and the non-cash portion of interest expense related to our debt of $10.2 million, stock-based compensation expense of $5.0 million, depreciation and amortization of $1.0 million, non-cash lease expense of $1.4 million, a change in fair value of derivative liabilities of $2.7 million, and a loss on equity method investments of $0.5 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities also contributed to the cash used in operating activities, primarily related to increases in accounts payable of $10.4 million and to accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $8.5 million due to an overall higher volume of clinical and development activities, and a decrease in prepaid expenses of $0.7 million. These were offset in part by a decrease in operating lease liability of $1.3 million and a decrease in deferred revenue of $5.6 million as a result of the recognition of $7.4 million of previously deferred revenue related to our option agreement with Chiesi and the addition of $2.3 million of deferred revenue related to our agreements with Phylaxis, adjusted for $0.5 million of non-cash deferred revenue related to the equity interest in Phylaxis.
Net cash used in operating activities was $32.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 and consisted primarily of a net loss of $51.4 million, adjusted for non-cash items such as accretion on our debt discount and non-cash interest of $5.5 million, stock-based compensation expense of $4.0 million, write off of expenses related to offerings contemplated in early 2019 of $2.8 million, non-cash lease expense of $1.4 million, depreciation and amortization of $1.2 million, and change in fair value of derivative liabilities of $1.0 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities also contributed to the cash used in operating activities, primarily related to an increase in deferred revenue of $8.9 million related to a new agreement and an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $1.1 million due to an overall higher volume of preclinical and clinical activity, offset in part by a decrease in accounts payable of $3.5 million, a decrease in operating lease liability of $1.0 million, and an increase in prepaid expenses of $0.7 million related to payments made during 2019.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $1.4 million and $1.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and was related to capital purchases, including laboratory equipment and leasehold improvements for our facility in La Jolla, California.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $166.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 and consisted primarily of the gross proceeds of $136.9 million from our IPO, offset in part by $11.0 million of costs associated with the offering, gross proceeds of $15.0 million from the sale and issuance of the 2020 Notes, and net proceeds of $29.9 million from the Amended 2020 Loan Agreement, consisting of $30.0 million in principal, net of $0.1 million in lender fees, further offset in part by $0.8 million of costs associated with the debt issuance. These proceeds were offset in part by the repayment of $3.6 million of principal and final payments on our 2015 Loan Agreement. During 2020, we also received $1.9 million in borrowings from the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP Loan, which was subsequently repaid in full with principal payments of $1.9 million.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $43.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and consisted primarily of the gross proceeds of $40.0 million from the sale and issuance of the 2019 Note and gross proceeds of $12.0 million from the issuance of convertible preferred shares, offset in part by the payment of costs associated with the sale and issuance of the 2019 Note of $2.5 million. Additionally, net cash used in financing also included the repayment of debt principal of $6.2 million.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies
Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, market and other conditions, and various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact us in the future, the estimation process is, by its nature, uncertain given that estimates depend on events over which we may not have control. If market and other conditions change from those that we anticipate, our consolidated financial statements may be materially affected. In addition, if our assumptions change, we may need to revise our estimates, or take other corrective actions, either of which may also have a material effect in our consolidated financial statements. We review our estimates, judgments, and assumptions used in our accounting practices periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period in which they are deemed to be necessary. We believe that these estimates are reasonable; however, our actual results may differ from these estimates.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report, we believe that the following critical accounting policies and estimates have a higher degree of inherent uncertainty and require our most significant judgments:
Revenue Recognition
To date, we have generated revenue from our collaboration and licensing agreements with partners, as well as from grants from the NIH, the CDMRP funded through the DoD, and from private not-for-profit organizations including CARB-X. Billings to customers or payments received from customers are included in deferred revenue on the balance sheet until all revenue recognition criteria are met.
We recognize revenue when, or as, the promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements we conclude are within the scope of Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASC Topic 606, we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligation(s) in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation(s) in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the performance obligation(s) are satisfied. At contract inception, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract, assess whether each promised good or service is distinct and identifies those that are performance obligations. We recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied.
Collaboration and License Agreements
We enter into collaborative agreements with partners that typically include one or more of the following: (i) license fees; (ii) nonrefundable up-front fees; (iii) payments for reimbursement of research costs; (iv) payments associated with achieving specific development, regulatory, or commercial milestones; and (v) royalties based on specified percentages of net product sales, if any. At the initiation of an agreement, we analyze each unit of account within the contract to determine if the counterparty is a customer in the context of the unit of account, in which case we apply the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure requirements of ASC Topic 606. If a unit of account does not represent a transaction with a customer, it represents an arrangement with a collaborator subject to guidance under ASC Topic 808, Collaborative Arrangements, or ASC Topic 808. We early adopted Accounting Standards
Update, or ASU, 2018-18, Collaborative Arrangements (Topic 808): Clarifying the Interaction between Topic 808 and Topic 606 upon implementation of ASC Topic 606. The standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
In applying the principles of ASC Topic 606, we consider a variety of factors in determining the appropriate estimates and assumptions under these arrangements, such as whether the elements are distinct performance obligations, whether there are observable stand-alone prices, and whether any licenses are functional or symbolic. We evaluate each performance obligation to determine if it can be satisfied and recognized as revenue at a point in time or over time. Typically, license fees and non-refundable upfront fees are considered fixed, while milestone payments are identified as variable consideration which must be evaluated to determine if it is constrained and, therefore, excluded from the transaction price.
As of December 31, 2020, all collaboration and license revenue was within the scope of ASC Topic 808 and/or ASC Topic 606 and recognized accordingly.
See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information on our collaboration and license agreements.
Research and Development and Clinical Trial Accruals
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include the cost of compensation and related expenses, as well as expenses for third parties who conduct research and development on our behalf, pursuant to development and consulting agreements in place. Clinical trial costs, including costs associated with third-party contractors, are a significant component of research and development expense. We expense research and development costs based on work performed. In determining the amount to expense, management relies on estimates of total costs based on contract components completed, the enrollment of subjects, the completion of trials and other events. If applicable, costs incurred related to the purchase of in-process research and development for early-stage products or products that are not commercially viable and ready for use, or have no alternative future use, are charged to expense in the period incurred. Costs incurred related to the licensing of products that have not yet received regulatory approval to be marketed, or that are not commercially viable and ready for use, or have no alternative future use, are charged to expense in the period incurred.
Derivative Liabilities
Prior to their conversion upon the consummation of our IPO, the 2019 Note and the 2020 Notes contained embedded features that provided multiple settlement alternatives. Certain of these settlement features provided the noteholders the right to a fixed number of our shares upon conversion of the note. Other settlement features provide the noteholders the right or the obligation to receive cash or a variable number of shares upon our completion of a capital raising transaction, change of control, qualified IPO or default. We evaluated each settlement alternative within the 2019 Note and the 2020 Notes under ASC 815-15, Embedded Derivatives and ASC 815-40, Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity and determined to account for certain settlement features as redemption features meeting the requirements for separate accounting as a single, compound derivative instrument.
These embedded derivatives were accounted for as liabilities at their estimated fair value as of the date of issuance, and then subsequently remeasured to fair value as of each balance sheet date, with the related remeasurement adjustment being recognized as a component of change in fair value of derivative liabilities in the consolidated statements of operations. The aggregate outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest to date under the 2019 Note and the 2020 Notes automatically converted and settled into shares of our common stock immediately prior to the completion of our IPO at a fixed conversion price based on a specified valuation.
Fair Value of Stock-Based Awards and Stock-Based Compensation Expense
We recognize compensation costs related to stock-based awards, including stock options, under our 2017 Employee, Director and Consultant Equity Incentive Plan to certain of our employees and certain members of our board of directors. The grant date fair value of the stock-based awards is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective awards.
We estimate the grant date fair value, and the resulting stock-based compensation, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the use of subjective assumptions to determine the fair value of stock-based awards. These assumptions include:
•Fair Value of Common Stock-Our board of directors determines the fair value of each share of underlying common stock based on the closing price of our common stock as reported by the applicable trading market on the date of the grant. Our board of directors intended all options granted to be exercisable at a price per share not less than the per share fair value of our common stock underlying those options on the grant date.
•Expected Term-We estimate the expected term of our stock options granted to employees and non-employee directors using the simplified method, whereby, the expected term equals the average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option. We utilize this method as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term.
•Expected Volatility-Due to the lack of company specific historical and implied volatility data, we based our estimate of expected volatility on the estimate and expected volatilities of a guideline group of publicly traded companies. For these analyses, we select companies with comparable characteristics to ours including enterprise value, risk profiles, and with historical share price information sufficient to meet the expected life of the stock-based awards. We compute the historical volatility data using the daily closing prices for the selected companies’ shares during the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of our stock-based awards. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available.
•Risk-Free Interest Rate-For the determination of the risk-free interest rates we utilize the U.S. Treasury yield curve for instruments in effect at the time of measurement with a term commensurate with the expected term assumption.
•Expected Dividend-The expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero as we have never paid dividends and do not have current plans to pay any dividends on our common stock.
Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value and ultimately how much stock-based compensation expense is recognized. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for information regarding certain of the specific assumptions we used in applying the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the estimated fair value of our stock options granted in the periods discussed.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recorded for temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the tax rates expected to be in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
We follow the provisions of accounting for uncertainty in income taxes which prescribes a model for the recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, and provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, disclosure and transition.
We have not completed a formal study to determine if any ownership changes within the meaning of IRC Section 382 and 383 have occurred. It is possible that we have already incurred ownership changes and may incur additional ownership changes in the future. If an ownership change has occurred, our ability to use our NOL or tax credit carryforwards may be restricted, which could require us to pay federal or state income taxes earlier than would be required if such limitations were not in effect.
JOBS Act Accounting Election
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to take advantage
of this extended transition period and, as a result, will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies.
