Overview
Midland States Bancorp, Inc. is a diversified financial holding company headquartered in Effingham, Illinois. Its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Midland States Bank, has branches across Illinois and in Missouri, and provides a full range of commercial and consumer banking products and services, business equipment financing, merchant credit card services, trust and investment management, and insurance and financial planning services. As of December 31, 2020, we had $6.87 billion in assets, $5.10 billion of deposits and $621.4 million of shareholders’ equity.
Our strategic plan is focused on building a performance-based, customer-centric culture, seeking accretive acquisitions, creating revenue diversification, achieving operational excellence and maintaining a robust enterprise-wide risk management program. Over the past several years, we have grown organically and through a series of acquisitions, with an over-arching focus on enhancing shareholder value and building a platform for scalability. Most recently, in July 2019, the Company completed its acquisition of HomeStar and its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, HomeStar Bank. In February 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of Alpine and its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Alpine Bank. Additional information on recent acquisitions is presented in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Our principal lines of business include traditional community banking and wealth management. Our traditional community banking business primarily consists of commercial and retail lending and deposit taking. Our wealth management group provides a comprehensive suite of trust and wealth management products and services, and has grown to $3.48 billion of assets under administration as of December 31, 2020.
Our principal business activity has been lending to and accepting deposits from individuals, businesses, municipalities and other entities. We have derived income principally from interest charged on loans and leases and, to a lesser extent, from interest and dividends earned on investment securities. We have also derived income from noninterest sources, such as: fees received in connection with various lending and deposit services; wealth management services; commercial FHA mortgage loan servicing; residential mortgage loan originations and sales; and, from time to time, gains on sales of assets. Our principal expenses include interest expense on deposits and borrowings, operating expenses, such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expenses, data processing costs, professional fees and other noninterest expenses, provisions for credit losses and income tax expense.
Material Trends and Developments
Community Banking. We believe the most important trends affecting community banks in the United States over the foreseeable future will be related to heightened regulatory capital requirements, increasing regulatory burdens generally, including the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations promulgated and to be promulgated thereunder, and net interest margin compression. We expect that community banks will face increased competition for lower cost capital as a result of regulatory policies that may offer larger financial institutions greater access to government assistance than is available for smaller institutions, including community banks. We expect that troubled community banks will continue to face significant challenges when attempting to raise capital. We also believe that heightened regulatory capital requirements will make it more difficult for even well-capitalized, healthy community banks to grow in their communities. We believe these trends will favor community banks that have sufficient capital, a diversified business model and a strong deposit franchise, and we believe we possess these characteristics.
We also believe that increased regulatory burdens will have a significant adverse effect on smaller community banks, which often lack the personnel, experience and technology to efficiently comply with new regulations in a variety of areas in the banking industry, including in the areas of deposits, lending, compensation, information security and overdraft protection. We believe the increased costs to smaller community banks from a more complex regulatory environment, coupled with challenges in the real estate lending area, present attractive acquisition opportunities for larger community banks that have already made significant investments in regulatory compliance and risk management and can acquire and quickly integrate these smaller institutions into their existing platform. Furthermore, we believe that, as a result of our significant operational investments and our experience acquiring other institutions and quickly integrating them into our organization, we are well positioned to capitalize on the challenges facing smaller community banks.
We continue to believe we have significant opportunities for further growth through additional acquisitions of banks, branches, wealth management firms and trust departments of community banks, selective de novo opportunities, continued expansion of our wealth management operations, the hiring of commercial banking and wealth management professionals from other organizations and organic growth within our existing branch network. We also believe we have the necessary experience, management and infrastructure to take advantage of these growth opportunities.
Credit Reserves. One of our key operating objectives has been, and continues to be, maintenance of an appropriate level of reserve protection against estimated losses in our loan portfolio. In 2020, our provision for credit losses on loans was $43.1 million compared to $17.0 million in 2019 and $9.4 million in 2018.
Effective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted CECL. The CECL model requires a reporting entity to estimate credit losses expected over the “life” of an asset, or pool of assets. The estimate of expected credit losses will consider historical information, current information, and the reasonable and supportable forecasts of future events and circumstances, as well as estimates of prepayments. The allowance for credit losses ("ACL") on loans and related provision for credit losses on loans was modeled under the provisions of CECL for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, as opposed to the incurred loss model for periods prior to January 1, 2020.
Regulatory Environment. As a result of regulatory changes, including the Dodd-Frank Act and the Basel III Rule, we expect to be subject to more restrictive capital requirements, more stringent asset concentration and growth limitations and new and potentially heightened examination and reporting requirements. We also expect to face a more challenging environment for customer loan demand due to the increased costs that could be ultimately borne by borrowers, and to incur higher costs to comply with these new regulations. This uncertain regulatory environment could have a detrimental impact on our ability to
manage our business consistent with historical practices and cause difficulty in executing our growth plan. See Item 1A - "Risk Factors-Legal, Accounting and Compliance Risks” and Item 1 - "Business-Supervision and Regulation.”
Impact of COVID-19. The progression of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States has had an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, and is expected to have a complex and significant adverse impact on the economy, the banking industry and our Company in future fiscal periods, all subject to a high degree of uncertainty.
Effects on Our Market Areas. Our commercial and consumer banking products and services are delivered primarily in Illinois and Missouri, where individual and governmental responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have led to a broad curtailment of economic activity beginning March 2020. Both Illinois and Missouri were subject to stay-at-home orders and limitations on business activity beginning in March 2020, with economic and social activity reopening in a phased-in approach since May 2020. These measures have had, and current measures continue to have, a lasting impact on the economies of and the customers located in these states. Each state's reopening plans remain subject to roll back, depending on public health developments. The Bank and its branches have remained open during these orders because banking is deemed an essential business, although it has suspended lobby access at its branches since March 17, 2020, and the lobbies remain closed.
Each state has experienced a dramatic increase in unemployment levels as a result of the curtailment of business activities. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate in Illinois (on a seasonally adjusted basis) was 4.2% in March 2020, increased to 17.2% in April 2020 and was 7.6% in December 2020 (based on preliminary estimates). The unemployment rate in Missouri (on a seasonally adjusted basis) was 3.9% in March 2020, increased to 10.2 % in April 2020 and was 5.8% in December 2020 (based on preliminary estimates), according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Policy and Regulatory Developments. Federal, state and local governments and regulatory authorities have enacted and issued a range of policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the following:
•The Federal Reserve decreased the range for the federal funds target rate by 0.50% on March 3, 2020, and by another 1.0% on March 16, 2020, reaching its current range of 0.0 - 0.25%.
•On March 27, 2020, President Trump signed the CARES Act, which established a $2.0 trillion economic stimulus package, including cash payments to individuals, supplemental unemployment insurance benefits and a $349.0 billion loan program administered through the SBA, referred to as the PPP. The Bank participates as a lender in the PPP. After the initial $349.0 billion in funds for the PPP was exhausted, an additional $310.0 billion in funding for PPP loans was authorized. In addition, on December 27, 2020, President Trump signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, a $900.0 billion COVID-19 relief package that includes an additional $284.5 billion in PPP funding, and Congress is in the process of negotiating additional stimulus bills and other actions in response to COVID-19.
•In addition, the CARES Act, as extended by the Coronovirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act (a part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021), provides financial institutions the option to temporarily suspend certain requirements under GAAP related to TDRs for a limited period of time to account for the effects of COVID-19.
•On April 7, 2020, federal banking regulators issued a revised Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions, which, among other things, encouraged financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations because of the effects of COVID-19, and stated that institutions generally do not need to categorize COVID-19-related modifications as TDRs and that the agencies will not direct supervised institutions to automatically categorize all COVID-19 related loan modifications as TDRs.
•On April 9, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced additional measures aimed at supporting small and midsized business, as well as state and local governments impacted by COVID-19. The Federal Reserve announced the Main Street Business Lending Program, which establishes two new loan facilities intended to facilitate lending to small and midsized businesses: (1) the Main Street New Loan Facility ("MSNLF"), and (2) the Main Street Expanded Loan Facility ("MSELF"). MSNLF loans are unsecured term loans originated on or after April 8, 2020, while MSELF loans are provided as upsized tranches of existing loans originated before April 8, 2020. The combined size of the program is authorized up to $600.0 billion. The Main Street Business Lending Program terminated on January 8, 2021.
•In addition to the policy responses described above, the federal bank regulatory agencies, along with their state counterparts, have issued a stream of guidance in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and have taken a number of unprecedented steps to help banks navigate the pandemic and mitigate its impact. These include, without limitation: requiring banks to focus on business continuity and pandemic planning; adding pandemic scenarios to
stress testing; encouraging bank use of capital buffers and reserves in lending programs; permitting certain regulatory reporting extensions; reducing margin requirements on swaps; permitting certain, otherwise prohibited, investments in investment funds; issuing guidance to encourage banks to work with customers affected by the pandemic and encourage loan workouts; and providing credit under the CRA for certain pandemic-related loans, investments and public service. Moreover, because of the need for social distancing measures, the agencies revamped the manner in which they conducted periodic examinations of their regulated institutions, including making greater use of off-site reviews. The Federal Reserve also issued guidance encouraging banking institutions to utilize its discount window for loans and intraday credit extended by its Reserve Banks to help households and businesses impacted by the pandemic and announced numerous funding facilities. The FDIC has also acted to mitigate the deposit insurance assessment effects of participating in the PPP and the Federal Reserve’s PPP Liquidity Facility and Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility.
Effects on Our Business. The COVID-19 pandemic and the specific developments referred to above have had and will continue to have a significant impact on our business. In particular, we anticipate that a significant portion of the Bank’s borrowers in the hotel, restaurant, ground transportation, long-term healthcare and retail industries will continue to endure significant economic distress, which has caused, and will continue to cause, them to draw on their existing lines of credit and adversely affect their ability to repay existing indebtedness, and is expected to adversely impact the value of collateral. These developments, together with economic conditions generally, are also expected to impact our commercial real estate portfolio, particularly with respect to real estate with exposure to these industries, our equipment leasing business and loan portfolio, our consumer loan business and loan portfolio, and the value of certain collateral securing our loans. As a result, we anticipate that our financial condition, capital levels and results of operations will be adversely affected, as described in further detail below.
Our Response. We have taken numerous steps in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the following:
•To protect the health and safety of our employees and customers, we instituted the following measures:
◦On March 17, 2020, we closed our banking center lobbies but continued to serve clients by appointment or through our drive-up lanes. As of December 31, 2020, our banking center lobbies remained closed.
◦On March 23, 2020, we closed our corporate offices, effectively leveraging our investments in technology to transition to working remotely. As of December 31, 2020, these offices remained closed.
•To meet the financial needs of our customers, we have instituted the following measures:
◦The Company has granted requests for payment deferrals on loans related to the impact of COVID-19 on such borrowers. At December 31, 2020, loans totaling $209.1 million are currently on deferral, the majority of which are for principal and interest for a period of 90 days. Deferrals of $82.6 million related to the hotel and motel industry and $44.1 million related to transit and ground transportation account for 61% of our deferrals at December 31, 2020. Loan deferrals decreased from $898.4 million, or 18.6% of total loans at June 30, 2020 to 4.1% at December 31, 2020. We are continuing to work with our customers to address their specific needs.
◦The Bank participates, as a lender, in the PPP and began taking applications on the first day of the program. At December 31, 2020, we had $184.4 million of PPP loans outstanding to 1,541 customers. Income recognized on PPP loans totaled $7.1 million in 2020, including loan origination fees of $5.2 million. The resulting yield of 3.99% is lower than yields on the remainder of our loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2020, $155.6 million of loans had been submitted to the SBA to process loan forgiveness, of which $93.2 million were forgiven.
Additional Factors Affecting Comparability
Each factor listed below affects the comparability of our results of operations and financial condition in 2020, 2019 and 2018, and may affect the comparability of financial information we report in future fiscal periods.
FHLB Advance Prepayments. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company pre-paid $114.2 million of FHLB advances with a weighted average interest rate of 2.10% and maturity dates ranging from 2021 to 2024. As a result, we paid prepayment fees of $4.9 million in that quarter.
Facilities Optimization Plan. On September 3, 2020, the Company announced a series of planned branch and corporate office reductions as part of its ongoing efforts to enhance efficiencies and financial performance. The Company closed 13 branches, or 20% of its branch network, and vacated approximately 23,000 square feet of corporate office space between September 3, 2020 and December 31, 2020. The Company estimates that the branch and corporate office reductions will result in annual cost savings of approximately $5.0 million in future periods. Additionally, the Company plans to renovate and upgrade five other branches to reduce the size of and better utilize those facilities to serve retail and commercial customers.
These renovations and upgrades are expected to cost approximately $4.0 million. The Company estimates that these renovations and upgrades will result in annual cost savings of approximately $1.0 million beginning in 2022. As a result of this plan, we recorded $12.7 million of asset impairment on existing banking facilities and $0.8 million in other related charges. We had $4.2 million of facility-related assets classified as held for sale in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2020.
In 2019, the Company closed one facility and consolidated two additional facilities as a result of the acquisition of HomeStar. In addition, the Company planned to consolidate three other existing facilities in other areas of its footprint, one of which closed in 2019 and the remaining two facilities closed in January 2020. Consequently, in 2019, the Company recorded $3.2 million of asset impairment on banking facilities to be closed.
Sale of Commercial FHA Origination Platform. On August 28, 2020, the Company announced that it had completed the sale of its commercial FHA origination platform to Dwight Capital, a nationwide mortgage banking firm headquartered in New York. The Bank continues to service Love Funding’s current servicing portfolio of approximately $3.50 billion.
Capital Raising Transactions. On September 20, 2019, the Company issued, through a private placement, $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of subordinated notes, which were structured into two tranches: $72.75 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2029, and $27.25 million aggregate principal amount of 5.50% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2034. On January 13, 2020, the Company completed its offer to exchange all $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of subordinated notes for substantially identical subordinated notes that were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, in satisfaction of the Company’s obligations under a registration rights agreement entered into with the purchasers of the subordinated notes in the private placement transaction. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to repay a $30.0 million senior term loan and is using the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes.
Preferred Stock Repurchase. On July 29, 2019, the Company redeemed, in whole, the shares of Series H preferred stock. The price paid by the Company for such shares was equal to $1,000 per share plus any unpaid dividends.
Recent Acquisitions. On July 17, 2019, the Company completed its acquisition of HomeStar and its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, HomeStar Bank, which operated five full-service banking centers in northern Illinois. The Company acquired $366.3 million in assets, including $211.1 million in loans, and assumed $321.7 million in deposits.
On February 28, 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of Alpine and its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Alpine Bank, which operated 19 locations principally in and around the Rockford, Illinois area. The Company acquired $1.24 billion in assets, including $786.2 million in loans, and assumed $1.11 billion in deposits.
Purchased Loans. Our net interest margin benefits from accretion income associated with purchase accounting discounts established on the purchased loans included in our acquisitions. Effective January 1, 2020, PCI loans were reclassified as purchased credit deteriorated ("PCD") loans, and due to this change, accretion income will decrease in future periods. Our reported net interest margins for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were 3.40%, 3.69% and 3.76%, respectively. Accretion income associated with accounting discounts established on loans acquired totaled $7.7 million, $12.6 million and $13.4 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, increasing the reported net interest margins by 13, 22,and 24 basis points for each respective period.
Results of Operations
For discussion of the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared with the year ended December 31, 2018, refer to Item 7 of the Company’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 28, 2020, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Overview. The COVID-19 pandemic, the adoption of CECL, the FHLB advance prepayments and our facilities optimization plan had a significant impact on our net income for the year ended December 31, 2020. The following table sets forth condensed income statement information of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:
In 2020, we generated net income of $22.5 million, or diluted earnings per common share of $0.95, compared to net income of $55.7 million, or diluted earnings per common share of $2.26 in 2019. Earnings in 2020 declined primarily due to a $27.4 million increase in provision for credit losses, a $14.0 million decrease in noninterest income and an $8.4 million increase in noninterest expense. These results were partially offset by a $9.3 million increase in net interest income and a $7.2 million decrease in income tax expense. These are discussed in further detail below.
Net Interest Income and Margin. Our primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is the difference between interest income from interest-earning assets (primarily loans and securities) and interest expense of funding sources (primarily interest-bearing deposits and borrowings). Net interest income is influenced by many factors, primarily the volume and mix of interest-earning assets, funding sources, and interest rate fluctuations. Noninterest-bearing sources of funds, such as demand deposits and shareholders’ equity, also support earning assets. The impact of the noninterest-bearing sources of funds is captured in net interest margin, which is calculated as net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Net interest margin is presented on a tax-equivalent basis, which means that tax-free interest income has been adjusted to pretax-equivalent income, assuming a federal income tax rate of 21% for 2020 and 2019.
As described above, one of the factors that impacts net interest income is interest rate fluctuations. The Federal Reserve decreased the target federal funds interest rate by 25 basis points in each of August 2019, September 2019 and October 2019. In addition, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve decreased the target federal funds interest rate by a total of 150 basis points in March 2020. These decreases impact the comparability of net interest income between 2019 and 2020.
In 2020, net interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, was $200.9 million with a tax-equivalent net interest margin of 3.40% compared to net interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, of $191.9 million and tax-equivalent net interest margin of 3.69% in 2019.
Average Balance Sheet, Interest and Yield/Rate Analysis. The following table presents average balance sheet information, interest income, interest expense and the corresponding average yields earned and rates paid for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. The average balances are principally daily averages and, for loans, include both performing and nonperforming balances. Interest income on loans includes the effects of discount accretion and net deferred loan origination costs accounted for as yield adjustments.
(1)Interest income and average rates for tax-exempt loans and securities are presented on a tax-equivalent basis, assuming a statutory federal income tax rate of 21%. Tax-equivalent adjustments totaled $1.8 million, $2.0 million and $2.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
(2)Average loan balances include nonaccrual loans. Interest income on loans includes amortization of deferred loan fees, net of deferred loan costs.
(3)Net interest margin during the periods presented represents: (i) the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets and the interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, divided by (ii) average interest-earning assets for the period.
Interest Rates and Operating Interest Differential. Increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates. The following table shows the effect that these factors had on the interest earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest incurred on our interest-bearing liabilities. The effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in volume by the previous period’s average rate. Similarly, the effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in average rate by the previous period’s volume. Changes which are not due solely to volume or rate have been allocated proportionally to the change due to volume and the change due to rate.
Interest Income. Interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, decreased $4.9 million to $246.7 million in 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to a decrease in the yields on most earning asset categories. The yield on earning assets decreased 66 basis points to 4.17% from 4.83%. The decrease in yield on earning assets was primarily due to the impact of lower market interest rates due to the Federal Reserve's decreases in the target federal funds interest rate, the impact of PPP loan yields and a reduction in accretion income associated with accounting discounts established on loans acquired, which totaled $7.7 million and $12.6 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Average earning assets increased to $5.91 billion in 2020 from $5.20 billion in 2019. The increases were primarily in loans and cash investments, which increased $489.0 million and $188.2 million, respectively. During the second quarter of 2020, the Company originated and funded $313.1 million of PPP loans. Income recognized on this portfolio totaled $7.1 million in 2020, including loan origination fees of $5.2 million, resulting in a yield on PPP loans of 3.99%, which amount is lower than yields on the remainder of our loan portfolio. The increase in average loan balances was primarily the result of PPP loans and continued growth in our equipment finance loan and lease and consumer loan portfolios.
Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased $14.0 million to $45.8 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased to 1.00% in 2020 compared to 1.43% for the prior year primarily due to lower rates as a result of the Federal Reserve Bank's reduction in rates.
Interest expense on deposits decreased to $21.5 million in 2020 from $34.2 million in 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in rates paid on deposits. Average balances of interest-bearing deposit accounts increased $353.1 million, or 10.8%, to $3.63 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in volume was primarily attributable to an increase of $311.8 million from our Insured Cash Sweep (“ICS”) product offering and from commercial customers due to PPP-related fund inflows. With the increase in these deposits, we were able to replace, in part, wholesale funds through the intentional decrease in brokered time deposits which, in addition to lower market rates, resulted in a lower average rate paid on deposits.
Interest expense on subordinated debt increased $2.3 million to $9.7 million for 2020 due primarily to the issuance of $100.0 million of subordinated debt in September 2019. The increase was partially offset by the redemption of $16.5 million of subordinated debt during the fourth quarter of 2019 and an additional $7.3 million in the first quarter of 2020. In turn, the reported cost of funds for subordinated debt decreased 47 basis points to 5.73% for 2020.
Provision for Credit Losses on Loans. The provision for credit losses on loans totaled $43.1 million in 2020 compared to $17.0 million in 2019. The higher provision for credit losses on loans was driven by higher net charge-offs, primarily in the first quarter of 2020, and by the implementation of CECL, which uses an economic forecast that now includes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Continued loan growth in future periods, a decline in our current level of recoveries, a decline in our loans' credit quality, or an increase in charge-offs could result in an increase in provision expense. Additionally, with the adoption of CECL beginning on January 1, 2020, provision expense may become more volatile due to changes in CECL model assumptions or credit quality, macroeconomic factors and conditions and loan composition, which drive the allowance for credit losses on loans.
Noninterest Income. The following table sets forth the major components of our noninterest income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:
Commercial FHA revenue. On August 28, 2020, the Company announced that it had completed the sale of its commercial FHA origination platform to Dwight Capital, a nationwide mortgage banking firm headquartered in New York. The Bank continues to service Love Funding’s current servicing portfolio of approximately $3.50 billion. Commercial FHA revenue for 2020 was $6.0 million, a decrease of $9.3 million compared to 2019. The decline in revenue is attributable to the sale of the loan origination platform in August resulting in a decline in interest rate locks. Interest rate lock commitments were $199.2 million in 2020, with 47% representing loan modifications which result in lower gain premiums than new originations. In 2019, interest rate lock commitments were $307.9 million, 1% of which were loan modifications.
Residential mortgage banking revenue. Residential mortgage banking revenue for 2020 totaled $9.8 million, compared to $2.9 million in 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in production as the decrease in the 10-year treasury rate stimulated a significant increase in mortgage activity. Loans originated in 2020 totaled $321.9 million, with 59% representing refinance transactions versus purchase transactions. Loans originated during the prior year totaled $156.8 million with 33% representing refinance transactions.
Service charges on deposit accounts. Service charges on deposit accounts were $8.6 million for 2020, a decline of $2.4 million from 2019. The decrease in revenue was attributable, primarily, to a decline in overdraft-related fees due to decreased business activities as a result of COVID-19.
Impairment of Commercial Mortgage Servicing Rights. Impairment of commercial mortgage servicing rights was $12.3 million for 2020 compared to $2.1 million for 2019. Loans serviced for others totaled $3.50 billion and $4.08 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The impairment resulted from loan prepayments due to borrowers refinancing their loans in this low rate environment, coupled with a reduction in the assumed earnings rates related to escrow and replacement reserves.
Other noninterest income. The decrease of $1.2 million in other noninterest income primarily reflected a decrease in bridge loan fees from Love Funding in 2020 compared to 2019.
Noninterest Expense. The following table sets forth the major components of noninterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:
Salaries and employee benefits. Salaries and employee benefits expense for 2020 totaled $85.6 million, compared to $91.9 million in 2019. The Company employed 904 employees at December 31, 2020 compared to 1,100 employees at December 31, 2019. The reduction in staff was primarily due to a reduction of 50 full-time employee positions announced in January 2020, the sale of our commercial FHA loan origination platform in August 2020 and the closure of 13 banking facilities in December 2020. Bonus expense was less in 2020 compared to 2019 due to anticipated financial results not meeting established thresholds for these annual awards.
Occupancy and equipment expense. The $1.3 million decrease in expense was primarily due to the Company operating fewer offices in 2020 compared to 2019. The Company closed six offices in the third quarter of 2019 related to our branch network consolidation plan as a result of the HomeStar acquisition. In the third quarter of 2020, we vacated the Love Funding offices as a result of the sale of the commercial FHA loan origination platform, and in December 2020, we closed 13 branches and vacated approximately 23,000 square feet of corporate office space. At December 31, 2020, the Company operated 52 full-service banking centers.
Data processing fees. The $1.3 million increase in data processing fees during 2020, as compared to 2019, was primarily the result of our continuing investments in technology to better serve our growing customer base.
Professional fees. The $1.5 million decrease in professional fees in 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily the result of legal and consulting expenses incurred during the second and third quarters of 2019 related to the acquisition of HomeStar.
Loss on mortgage servicing rights held for sale. The Company recognized losses of $1.7 million on mortgage servicing rights held for sale in 2020 compared to a gain of $0.5 million in 2019. Market disruption as a result of COVID-19 resulted in a decreased demand by potential acquirers and a resulting decrease in value.
Impairment on facilities optimization. In the third quarter of 2020, the Company announced it would close or consolidate 13 branches, or 20% of its branch network, and vacate approximately 23,000 square feet of corporate office space by the end of 2020. As a result of this plan, we recorded $12.8 million of asset impairment on existing banking facilities. In 2019, the Company recorded $3.6 million of asset impairment on six banking facilities related to our branch network consolidation plan as a result of the HomeStar acquisition.
FHLB advances prepayment fees. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company pre-paid $114.2 million of FHLB advances with a weighted average interest rate of 2.10% and maturity dates ranging from 2021 to 2024. As a result, we paid prepayment fees of $4.9 million.
Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense was $9.5 million in 2020 compared to $16.7 million in 2019. Effective tax rates for 2020 and 2019 were 29.6% and 23.0%, respectively. The significant increase in the effective tax rates resulted from Love Funding's asset sale in the third quarter of 2020, as goodwill of $10.9 million was derecognized and was not deductible for tax purposes, generating tax expense of $3.0 million.
Financial Condition
Assets. Total assets increased to $6.87 billion at December 31, 2020, as compared to $6.09 billion at December 31, 2019.
Loans. The loan portfolio is the largest category of our assets. The following table presents the balance and associated percentage of each major category in our loan portfolio at December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016:
Total loans increased $701.9 million to $5.10 billion at December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019. The loan growth was primarily reflected in our commercial loan portfolio, which increased $630.4 million from $1.06 billion at December 31, 2019 to $1.69 billion at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, PPP loans totaled $184.4 million, all of which were included in our commercial loan portfolio. Advances on our HUD warehouse lines of credit increased $219.2 million to $273.3 million at December 31, 2020, which are included in our commercial loan portfolio. We also continued to see loan growth from our equipment financing business, which is booked in the commercial loans and lease financing portfolios. Consumer loans increased $156.0 million as a result of our relationship with GreenSky. These increases were offset in part by payoffs and repayments in the residential real estate portfolio. We anticipate that loan growth will remain slow in the future for our commercial real estate and consumer loan portfolios as a result of COVID-19 and the related decline in economic conditions in our market areas.
Outstanding loan balances increased due to new loan originations, advances on outstanding commitments and loans acquired as a result of acquisitions of other financial institutions, net of amounts received for loan payments and payoffs,
charge-offs of loans and transfers of loans to other real estate owned. The following table shows the fair values of the loans acquired during the years presented and the net growth or attrition of the acquired loans during the periods presented:
The principal categories of our loan portfolio are discussed below:
Commercial loans. We provide a mix of variable and fixed rate commercial loans. The loans are typically made to small- and medium-sized manufacturing, wholesale, retail and service businesses for working capital needs, business expansions and farm operations. Commercial loans generally include lines of credit and loans with maturities of five years or less. The loans are generally made with business operations as the primary source of repayment, but may also include collateralization by inventory, accounts receivable and equipment, and generally include personal guarantees.
Commercial real estate loans. Our commercial real estate loans consist of both real estate occupied by the borrower for ongoing operations and non-owner occupied real estate properties. The real estate securing our existing commercial real estate loans includes a wide variety of property types, such as owner occupied offices, warehouses and production facilities, office buildings, hotels, mixed-use residential and commercial facilities, retail centers, multifamily properties and assisted living facilities. Our commercial real estate loan portfolio also includes farmland loans. Farmland loans are generally made to a borrower actively involved in farming rather than to passive investors.
Construction and land development loans. Our construction and land development loans are comprised of residential construction, commercial construction and land acquisition and development loans. Interest reserves are generally established on real estate construction loans.
Residential real estate loans. Our residential real estate loans consist of loans for the purchase of residential properties that generally do not qualify for secondary market sale.
Consumer loans. Our consumer loans include direct personal loans, indirect automobile loans, lines of credit and installment loans originated through home improvement specialty retailers and contractors. Personal loans are generally secured by automobiles, boats and other types of personal property and are made on an installment basis.
Lease financing. Our equipment leasing business provides financing leases to varying types of businesses, nationwide, for purchases of business equipment and software. The financing is secured by a first priority interest in the financed asset and generally requires monthly payments.
The following table shows the contractual maturities of our loan portfolio and the distribution between fixed and adjustable interest rate loans at December 31, 2020:
Loan Quality
We use what we believe is a comprehensive methodology to monitor credit quality and prudently manage credit concentration within our loan portfolio. Our underwriting policies and practices govern the risk profile and credit and geographic concentration for our loan portfolio. We also have what we believe to be a comprehensive methodology to monitor these credit quality standards, including a risk classification system that identifies potential problem loans based on risk characteristics by loan type as well as the early identification of deterioration at the individual loan level.
Analysis of the Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans. The following table allocates the allowance for credit losses on loans, or the allowance, by loan category:
(1)Information presented prior to December 31, 2020 was modeled under the incurred loss model.
(2)Represents the percentage of the allowance to total loans in the respective category.
As discussed in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements, our policies and procedures related to accounting for credit losses changed on January 1, 2020 in connection with the adoption of a new accounting standard update as codified in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 326 (“ASC 326”) Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. The amount of the allowance represents management's best estimate of current expected credit losses on loans considering available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument. Relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. While historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses, adjustments to historical loss information may be made for differences in current portfolio-specific risk characteristics, environmental conditions or other relevant factors. While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ultimate adequacy of our allowance accounts is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control, including the performance of our portfolios, the economy, changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward classification of assets.
For each loan pool, we measure expected credit losses over the life of each loan utilizing a combination of models which measure (i) probability of default, which is the likelihood that loan will stop performing/default, (ii) loss given default, which is the expected loss rate for loans in default, (iii) assumed prepayment speed, which is the likelihood that a loan will prepay or pay-off prior to maturity, and (iv) exposure at default , which is the estimated outstanding principal balance of the loans upon default. We continue to evaluate our level of reserves in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The following table provides an analysis of the allowance for credit losses on loans, provision for credit losses on loans and net charge-offs for the years indicated:
Individual loans considered to be uncollectible are charged off against the allowance. Factors used in determining the amount and timing of charge-offs on loans include consideration of the loan type, length of delinquency, sufficiency of collateral value, lien priority and the overall financial condition of the borrower. Collateral value is determined using updated appraisals and/or other market comparable information. Recoveries on loans previously charged off are added to the allowance. Net charge-offs to average loans were 0.50% and 0.23% for 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Nonperforming Loans. The following table sets forth our nonperforming assets by asset categories as of the dates indicated. Nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans, loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest and loans modified under troubled debt restructurings. Deferrals related to COVID-19 are not included as TDRs as of December 31, 2020. The balances of nonperforming loans reflect the net investment in these assets, including deductions for purchase discounts. Purchased credit impaired loans were not reported as nonperforming loans in periods prior to January 1, 2020. Effective January 1, 2020, PCI loans were reclassified as PCD loans as a result of the adoption of CECL, and due to this change, are included in nonperforming loans.
We did not recognize interest income on nonaccrual loans during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 while they were in nonaccrual status. Additional interest income that we would have recognized on these loans had they been current in accordance with their original terms was $3.3 million, $2.2 million and $1.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We recognized interest income on commercial and commercial real estate loans modified under troubled debt restructurings of $70,000 in 2020, $117,000 in 2019 and $97,000 in 2018.
We utilize an asset risk classification system in compliance with guidelines established by the Federal Reserve as part of our efforts to improve asset quality. In connection with examinations of insured institutions, examiners have the authority to identify problem assets and, if appropriate, classify them. There are three classifications for problem assets: “substandard,” “doubtful,” and “loss.” Substandard assets have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full questionable and there is a high probability of loss based on currently existing facts, conditions and values. An asset classified as loss is not considered collectable and is of such little value that continuance of booking the asset is not warranted.
We use a ten grade risk rating system to categorize and determine the credit risk of our loans. Potential problem loans include loans with a risk grade of 7, which are "special mention," and loans with a risk grade of 8, which are "substandard" loans that are not considered to be nonperforming. These loans generally require more frequent loan officer contact and receipt of financial data to closely monitor borrower performance. Potential problem loans are managed and monitored regularly through a number of processes, procedures and committees, including oversight by a loan administration committee comprised of executive officers and other members of the Bank's senior management team. Additionally, the Company initiated a re-evaluation of the accuracy of loan grades assigned to its commercial loan portfolio during the second quarter of 2020. Effects as a result of the pandemic may continue, potentially resulting in additional loans being identified.
The following table presents the recorded investment of potential problem commercial loans by loan category at the dates indicated:
(1)Includes only those 8-rated loans that are not included in nonperforming loans.
Commercial real estate loans with a risk rating of 7 or 8 increased to $250.2 million as of December 31, 2020, compared to $84.7 million as of December 31, 2019, primarily due to COVID-19 related loan deferral requests. As requests were evaluated, loan risk ratings were adjusted as necessary. Loan modifications related to the hotel industry totaled $82.6 million with risk rating downgrades applied to $76.7 million of those loans.
Investment Securities. Our investment strategy aims to maximize earnings while maintaining liquidity in securities with minimal credit risk. The types and maturities of securities purchased are primarily based on our current and projected liquidity and interest rate sensitivity positions.
The following table sets forth the book value and percentage of each category of investment securities at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. The book value for investment securities classified as available for sale is equal to fair market value.
The following table sets forth the book value, maturities and weighted average yields for our investment portfolio at December 31, 2020. The book value for investment securities classified as available for sale is equal to fair market value.
(1)Weighted average yield for tax-exempt securities are presented on a tax-equivalent basis assuming a federal statutory income tax rate of 21%.
The table below presents the credit ratings for our investment securities classified as available for sale, at fair value, at December 31, 2020:
Operating Lease Right-of-Use Asset. Operating lease ROU assets totaled $9.2 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $14.2 million at December 31, 2019. The Company terminated or impaired $4.1 million ROU assets related to its facilities optimization plan and sale of its commercial FHA origination platform.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill was $161.9 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $171.8 million at December 31, 2019. Goodwill represents the excess of consideration paid in an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. The $9.9 million decrease in 2020 primarily resulted from goodwill derecognized as a result of the sale of our commercial FHA origination platform in the third quarter of 2020.
Our other intangible assets, which consist of core deposit and trust relationship intangibles, were $28.4 million and $34.9 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in other intangibles was due to amortization expense of $6.5 million.
Liabilities. Total liabilities increased to $6.25 billion at December 31, 2020 compared to $5.43 billion at December 31, 2019.
Deposits. We emphasize developing total client relationships with our customers in order to increase our retail and commercial core deposit bases, which are our primary funding sources. Our deposits consist of noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing demand, savings and time deposit accounts.
Total deposits increased $556.8 million to $5.10 billion at December 31, 2020, as compared to December 31, 2019. The increase primarily resulted from organic deposit growth of $140.4 million in commercial deposits, $122.6 million in retail deposits, $154.1 million in servicing deposits and $152.7 million in our ICS product. Commercial deposit growth included increases from PPP funds deposited. The growth was partially offset by the intentional reduction of $26.7 million in brokered time deposits. At December 31, 2020, total deposits were comprised of 28.8% of noninterest-bearing demand accounts, 57.9% of interest-bearing transaction accounts and 13.3% of time deposits. At December 31, 2020, brokered time deposits totaled $23.1 million, or 0.5% of total deposits, compared to $49.7 million, or 1.1% of total deposits, at December 31, 2019.
The following table summarizes our average deposit balances and weighted average rates for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:
The following table sets forth the maturity of time deposits of $250,000 or more and brokered deposits as of December 31, 2020:
Short-Term Borrowings. In addition to deposits, we use short-term borrowings, such as federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, as a source of funds to meet the daily liquidity needs of our customers and fund growth in earning assets. Short-term borrowings were $69.0 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $82.0 million at December 31, 2019. The decrease was driven by customers migrating to a new deposit product. The weighted average interest rate on our short-term borrowings was 0.12% and 0.67% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
FHLB Advances and Other Borrowings. FHLB advances and other borrowings totaled $779.2 million and $493.3 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As mentioned previously, the Company pre-paid $114.2 million of FHLB advances with a weighted average interest rate of 2.10% and maturity dates ranging from 2021 to 2024. At year-end, the Company borrowed an additional $200.0 million from the FHLB as a result of advances on its HUD warehouse lines. These borrowings were at a rate of 0.25% with terms of less than 30 days. The weighted average cost of the FHLB borrowings was 1.32% at December 31, 2020.
Operating Lease Liabilities. Operating lease liabilities totaled $12.0 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $15.4 million at December 31, 2019. Operating lease obligations of $2.1 million were assumed by the buyer in the sale of our commercial FHA origination platform.
Capital Resources and Liquidity Management
Capital Resources. Shareholders’ equity is influenced primarily by earnings, dividends, issuances and redemptions of common stock and changes in accumulated other comprehensive income caused primarily by fluctuations in unrealized holding gains or losses, net of taxes, on available-for-sale investment securities.
Shareholders’ equity decreased $40.5 million to $621.4 million at December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019. The Company generated net income of $22.5 million during 2020 and had an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of $4.0 million. Offsetting these increases to shareholders’ equity were $25.0 million of dividends to
common shareholders and $39.6 million in common stock repurchases. In addition, the Company recorded a $7.2 million reduction to retained earnings related to the adoption of CECL effective January 1, 2020.
On August 6, 2019, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $25.0 million of its common stock, which amount was increased to $50.0 million on March 11, 2020 by an amendment approved by the Board of Directors. On December 2, 2020, the Company announced that the Board had extended the term of the repurchase program from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021. At the time of the extension, the program had approximately $6.4 million of remaining repurchase authority. Stock repurchases under the program may be made from time to time on the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in any manner that complies with applicable securities laws, at the discretion of the Company. The timing of purchases and the number of shares repurchased under the program are dependent upon a variety of factors including price, trading volume, corporate and regulatory requirements and market condition. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. As of December 31, 2020, $43.4 million, or 2,472,736 shares of the Company’s common stock, had been repurchased under the program.
Liquidity Management. Liquidity refers to the measure of our ability to meet the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, while at the same time meeting our operating, capital and strategic cash flow needs, all at a reasonable cost. We continuously monitor our liquidity position to ensure that assets and liabilities are managed in a manner that will meet all short-term and long-term cash requirements. We manage our liquidity position to meet the daily cash flow needs of customers, while maintaining an appropriate balance between assets and liabilities to meet the return on investment objectives of our shareholders.
Integral to our liquidity management is the administration of short-term borrowings. To the extent we are unable to obtain sufficient liquidity through core deposits, we seek to meet our liquidity needs through wholesale funding or other borrowings, including our ability to borrow from the FHLB, on either a short- or long-term basis.
Securities sold under agreements to repurchase, which are classified as secured borrowings, generally mature within one to four days from the transaction date. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are reflected at the amount of cash received in connection with the transaction, which represents the amount of the Bank’s obligation. The Bank may be required to provide additional collateral based on the fair value of the underlying securities. Investment securities with a carrying amount of $76.5 million and $87.4 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, were pledged for securities sold under agreements to repurchase.
The Company had available lines of credit of $54.4 million and $21.6 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, from the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The lines are collateralized by a collateral agreement with respect to a pool of commercial real estate loans totaling $68.1 million and $24.3 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. There were no outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
The Company has the option of obtaining additional liquidity by participating in the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (“Facility”). Under the Facility, the Company can pledge its PPP loans to the Federal Reserve Bank as collateral for available advances. PPP loans pledged as collateral to secure extensions of credit under the Facility will be valued at the principal amount of the PPP loan. No loans have been pledged under the Facility as of December 31, 2020.
At December 31, 2020, the Company had available federal funds lines of credit totaling $20.0 million, which were unused.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had capacity to borrow $334.0 million and $481.0 million, respectively, from the FHLB. The Company’s advances from the FHLB are collateralized by a blanket collateral agreement of qualifying mortgage and home equity line of credit loans and certain commercial real estate loans totaling $1.86 billion and $1.94 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The Company is a corporation separate and apart from the Bank and, therefore, must provide for its own liquidity. The Company’s main source of funding is dividends declared and paid to us by the Bank. There are statutory, regulatory and debt covenant limitations that affect the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Company. Management believed at December 31, 2020, that these limitations will not impact our ability to meet our ongoing short-term cash obligations.
Regulatory Capital Requirements
We are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal and state banking regulators. Failure to meet regulatory capital requirements may result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines
and the regulatory framework for “prompt corrective action”, we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting policies.
In December 2018, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve, and the FDIC approved a final rule to address changes to credit loss accounting under GAAP, including banking organizations’ implementation of CECL. The final rule provides banking organizations the option to phase in over a three-year period the day-one adverse effects on regulatory capital that may result from the adoption of the new accounting standard. In March 2020, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve, and the FDIC published an interim final rule to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital stemming from the implementation of CECL. The interim final rule maintains the three-year transition option in the previous rule and provides banks the option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL’s effect on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology’s effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period (five-year transition option). The Company is adopting the capital transition relief over the permissible five-year period.
At December 31, 2020, the Company and the Bank exceeded the regulatory minimums and met the regulatory definition of well-capitalized.
The following table presents the Company and the Bank’s capital ratios and the minimum requirements at December 31, 2020:
(1)Total risk-based capital ratio, Common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio include the capital conservation buffer of 2.5%.
Contractual Obligations
The following table contains supplemental information regarding our total contractual obligations at December 31, 2020:
We believe that we will be able to meet our contractual obligations as they come due through the maintenance of adequate cash levels. We expect to maintain adequate cash levels through profitability, loan and securities repayment and
maturity activity and continued deposit gathering activities. We have in place various borrowing mechanisms for both short-term and long-term liquidity needs.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have limited off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
In the normal course of business, we enter into various transactions, which, in accordance with GAAP, are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. We enter into these transactions to meet the financing needs of our customers. These transactions include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in our consolidated balance sheets. Most of these commitments mature within two years and are expected to expire without being drawn upon. Standby letters of credit are included in the determination of the amount of risk-based capital that the Company and the Bank are required to hold.
We enter into contractual loan commitments to extend credit, normally with fixed expiration dates or termination clauses, at specified rates and for specific purposes. Substantially all of our commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards until the time of loan funding. We decrease our exposure to losses under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures. We assess the credit risk associated with certain commitments to extend credit and establish a liability for probable credit losses.
Standby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. In the event that the customer does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party, we would be required to fund the commitment. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount of the commitment. If the commitment is funded, we would be entitled to seek recovery from the customer. Our policies generally require that standby letter of credit arrangements contain security and debt covenants similar to those contained in loan agreements.
We guarantee the distributions and payments for redemption or liquidation of the trust preferred securities issued by our wholly owned subsidiary business trusts to the extent of funds held by the trusts. Although this guarantee is not separately recorded, the obligation underlying the guarantee is fully reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as junior subordinated debentures held by subsidiary trusts. The junior subordinated debentures currently qualify as Tier 1 capital under the Federal Reserve capital adequacy guidelines.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Market Risk. Market risk represents the risk of loss due to changes in market values of assets and liabilities. We incur market risk in the normal course of business through exposures to market interest rates, equity prices, and credit spreads. We are primarily exposed to interest rate risk as a result of offering a wide array of financial products to our customers and secondarily to price risk from investments in securities backed by mortgage loans.
Interest Rate Risk
Overview. Interest rate risk is the risk to earnings and value arising from changes in market interest rates. Interest rate risk arises from timing differences in the repricings and maturities of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities (reprice risk), changes in the expected maturities of assets and liabilities arising from embedded options, such as borrowers’ ability to prepay residential mortgage loans at any time and depositors’ ability to redeem certificates of deposit before maturity (option risk), changes in the shape of the yield curve where interest rates increase or decrease in a nonparallel fashion (yield curve risk), and changes in spread relationships between different yield curves, such as U.S. Treasuries and LIBOR (basis risk).
We actively manage interest rate risk, as changes in market interest rates may have a significant impact on reported earnings. Changes in market interest rates may result in changes in the fair market value of our financial instruments, cash flows, and net interest income. We seek to achieve consistent growth in net interest income and capital while managing volatility arising from shifts in market interest rates. Our Board of Directors’ Risk Policy and Compliance Committee oversees interest rate, as well as the establishment of risk measures, limits, and policy guidelines for managing the amount of interest rate and mortgage price risk and its effect on net interest income and capital. Responsibility for measuring and the management of interest rate risk resides with Corporate Treasury. Our Risk Policy and Compliance Committee meets quarterly to monitor the level of interest rate risk sensitivity to ensure compliance with the board of directors’ approved risk limits.
Interest rate risk management is an active process that encompasses monitoring loan and deposit flows complemented by investment and funding activities. Effective management of interest rate risk begins with understanding the dynamic
characteristics of assets and liabilities and determining the appropriate interest rate risk posture given business forecasts, management objectives, market expectations, and policy constraints.
An asset sensitive position refers to a balance sheet position in which an increase in short-term interest rates is expected to generate higher net interest income, as rates earned on our interest-earning assets would reprice upward more quickly than rates paid on our interest-bearing liabilities, thus expanding our net interest margin. Conversely, a liability sensitive position refers to a balance sheet position in which an increase in short-term interest rates is expected to generate lower net interest income, as rates paid on our interest-bearing liabilities would reprice upward more quickly than rates earned on our interest-earning assets, thus compressing our net interest margin.
Income Simulation and Economic Value Analysis. Interest rate risk measurement is calculated and reported to the Risk Policy and Compliance Committee at least quarterly. The information reported includes period-end results and identifies any policy limits exceeded, along with an assessment of the policy limit breach and the action plan and timeline for resolution, mitigation, or assumption of the risk.
We use two approaches to model interest rate risk: Net Interest Income at Risk (“NII at Risk”) and Economic Value of Equity (“EVE”). Under NII at Risk, net interest income is modeled utilizing various assumptions for assets, liabilities, and derivatives. EVE measures the period end market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities and the change in this value as rates change. EVE is a period end measurement.
NII at risk uses net interest income simulation analysis which involves forecasting net interest earnings under a variety of scenarios including changes in the level of interest rates, the shape of the yield curve, and spreads between market interest rates. The sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates is measured using numerous interest rate scenarios including shocks, gradual ramps, curve flattening, curve steepening as well as forecasts of likely interest rates scenarios. Modeling the sensitivity of net interest earnings to changes in market interest rates is highly dependent on numerous assumptions incorporated into the modeling process. To the extent that actual performance is different than what was assumed, actual net interest earnings sensitivity may be different than projected. The assumptions used in the models are our best estimates based on studies conducted by the treasury group. The treasury group uses a data warehouse to study interest rate risk at a transactional level and uses various ad-hoc reports to continuously refine assumptions. Assumptions and methodologies regarding administered rate liabilities (e.g., savings accounts, money market accounts and interest-bearing checking accounts), balance trends, and repricing relationships reflect our best estimate of expected behavior and these assumptions are reviewed periodically.
We also have longer-term interest rate risk exposure, which may not be appropriately measured by earnings sensitivity analysis. The Risk Policy and Compliance Committee uses EVE to study the impact of long-term cash flows on earnings and on capital. EVE involves discounting present values of all cash flows of on and off-balance sheet items under different interest rate scenarios. The discounted present value of all cash flows represents our EVE. The analysis requires modifying the expected cash flows in each interest rate scenario, which will impact the discounted present value. The amount of base-case measurement and its sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve allow us to measure longer-term repricing and option risk in the balance sheet.
The following table shows NII at Risk at the dates indicated:
We report NII at Risk to isolate the change in income related solely to interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The NII at Risk results included in the table above reflect the analysis used quarterly by management. It models
−100, +100 and +200 basis point parallel shifts in market interest rates, implied by the forward yield curve over the next twelve months. We were within Board policy limits for the +100 and +200 and the -100 basis point scenarios at December 31, 2020.
Tolerance levels for risk management require the continuing development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within approved levels as we adjust the balance sheet. NII at Risk reported at December 31, 2020, projected that our earnings exhibited decreased sensitivity at −100 basis point scenario to changes in interest rates compared to December 31, 2019.
The following table shows EVE at the dates indicated:
The EVE results included in the table above reflect the analysis used quarterly by management. It models immediate −100, +100 and +200 basis point parallel shifts in market interest rates.
The EVE reported at December 31, 2020 projected that as interest rates increase, the economic value of equity position will increase, and as interest rates decrease, the economic value of equity position will decrease. When interest rates rise, fixed rate assets generally lose economic value; the longer the duration, the greater the value lost. The opposite is true when interest rates fall.
We were within board policy limits for the +100 and +200 basis point scenarios at December 31, 2020 and out of compliance for the -100 basis point scenario. The Bank is reviewing strategies to bring this position into policy compliance.
Price Risk. Price risk represents the risk of loss arising from adverse movements in the prices of financial instruments that are carried at fair value and are subject to fair value accounting. We have price risk from mortgage-backed securities, derivative instruments, and equity investments.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under current circumstances, results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Accounting policies, as described in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, are an integral part of our financial statements. A thorough understanding of these accounting policies is essential when reviewing our reported results of operations and our financial position. We believe that the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below require us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes in these estimates that are likely to occur from period to period, or using different estimates that we could have reasonably used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
Investment Securities. Investment securities generally must be classified as equity, held to maturity, available for sale or trading. The Company classifies its debt investment securities as available for sale or held to maturity at the time of purchase. Investments in stock of a publicly traded company or in mutual funds are classified as equity securities. Held-to-maturity securities are principally debt securities that we have both the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity. Trading securities
are held primarily for sale in the near term to generate income. Securities that do not meet the definition of equity, trading or held to maturity are classified as available for sale.
The classification of investment securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on these securities. Unrealized gains and losses on equity securities and trading securities flow directly through earnings during the periods in which they arise. Trading, equity and investment securities available for sale are measured at fair value each reporting period. Unrealized gains and losses on investment securities available for sale are recorded as a separate component of shareholders’ equity (accumulated other comprehensive income or loss) and do not affect earnings until realized or it is determined that a credit loss exists. If a credit loss exists, an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an ACL is recorded in other comprehensive income.
The fair values of investment securities are generally determined by various pricing models. We evaluate the methodologies used to develop the resulting fair values. We perform a quarterly analysis on the pricing of investment securities to ensure that the prices represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value. Our procedures include initial and ongoing review of pricing methodologies and trends. We seek to ensure prices represent a reasonable estimate of fair value through the use of broker quotes, current sales transactions from our portfolio and pricing techniques, which are based on the net present value of future expected cash flows discounted at a rate of return market participants would require. Significant inputs used in internal pricing techniques are estimated by type of underlying collateral, estimated prepayment speeds where applicable and appropriate discount rates. As a result of this analysis, if we determine there is a more appropriate fair value, the price is adjusted accordingly.
When the level and volume of trading activity for certain securities has significantly declined or when we believe that pricing is based in part on forced liquidation or distressed sales, we estimate fair value based on a combination of pricing information and an internal model using a discounted cash flow approach. We make certain significant assumptions in addition to those discussed above related to the liquidity risk premium, specific nonperformance and default experience in the collateral underlying the security. The values resulting from each approach are weighted to derive the final fair value for each security trading in an inactive market.
The fair value of investment securities is a critical accounting estimate. Changes in fair value estimates that occur from period to period, or the use of different estimates that could have been reasonably used in the current period, could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans. The allowance for credit losses on loans represents management’s estimate of all expected credit losses over the expected contractual life of our loan portfolio. The accounting policy related to the allowance for credit losses on loans is considered to be critical as this policy involves considerable subjective judgment and estimation by management. As discussed in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, our policy related to the allowance for credit losses on loans changed on January 1, 2020 in connection with the adoption of CECL. The allowance for credit losses on loans is a contra-asset valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected. The amount of the allowance represents management's best estimate of current expected credit losses considering available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the loan. Relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. While historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses, adjustments to historical loss information may be made for differences in current portfolio-specific risk characteristics, environmental conditions or other relevant factors.
We utilize a probability of default/loss given default methodology in in combination with qualitative factors in to determine expected future credit losses for performing loans. This method, a form of migration analysis, combines the estimated probability of loans experiencing default events and the losses ultimately associated with the loans experiencing those defaults. The probability of default is the risk that the borrower will be unable or unwilling to repay its debt in full or on time. Probability of default is generally associated with financial characteristics such as inadequate cash flow to service debt, declining revenues or operating margins, high leverage, declining or marginal liquidity, and the inability to successfully implement a business plan. The loss given default component is the percentage of defaulted loan balance that is ultimately charged off. Multiplying one by the other gives the Company its loss rate, which is then applied to the loan portfolio balance to determine expected future losses. The model utilizes linear regression analysis to develop default rates based on forecasted macroeconomic variables that correlate to and are predictive of losses. The selected variables were evaluated based on regression analysis output to determine the statistical fit of the variables used to forecasted expected credit losses. Qualitative factors include items such as changes in lending policies or procedures, asset specific risks, the impact of COVID-19 on customers' operations and economic uncertainty in forward-looking forecasts.
The allowance represents management’s best estimate, but significant downturns in circumstances relating to loan quality and economic conditions could result in a requirement for additional allowance. Likewise, an upturn in loan quality and improved economic conditions may allow a reduction in the required allowance. In either instance, unanticipated changes could have a significant impact on results of operations. The expense for credit loss recorded through earnings is the amount necessary to maintain the allowance for credit losses at the amount of expected credit losses inherent within the loans held for investment portfolio. The amount of expense and the corresponding level of allowance for credit losses for loans are based on our evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio based on historical loss experience, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and other significant qualitative and quantitative factors.
Goodwill. For acquisitions, we are required to record the assets acquired, including identified intangible assets such as goodwill, and the liabilities assumed at their fair value. These often involve estimates based on third party valuations, such as appraisals, or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques that may include estimates of attrition, inflation, asset growth rates, or other relevant factors. The carrying value of goodwill recorded must be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, as well as on an interim basis if events or changes indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss must be recognized for any excess of carrying value over fair value of the goodwill. The determination of fair values is based on valuations using management’s assumptions of future growth rates, future attrition, discount rates, multiples of earnings or other relevant factors. Changes in these factors, as well as downturns in economic or business conditions, could have a significant adverse impact on the carrying value of goodwill and could result in impairment losses affecting our financial statements as a whole and our banking subsidiary in which the goodwill resides.
In the second quarter of 2020, the Company performed a Step 1 impairment analysis of its goodwill, as an unprecedented decline in economic conditions triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant decline in stock market valuations, including our stock price. These events indicated that goodwill may be impaired. As a result of the analysis, we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired. The Company performed its required annual impairment test as of August 31, 2020, accelerating its annual measurement date from the previous date of September 30. The Company concluded that its estimated fair value was greater than its book value and impairment of goodwill was not required. No events or circumstances since the August 31, 2020 annual impairment test were noted that would indicate it was more likely than not a goodwill impairment exists.
On a quarterly basis, we will continue to evaluate our qualitative assessment assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, including: (1) forecasted revenues, expenses, and cash flows; (2) current discount rates; (3) our market capitalization; (4) observable market transactions and multiples; (5) changes to the regulatory environment; and (6) the nature and amount of government support that has been and is expected to be provided in the future. A prolonged economic downturn or deterioration in the economic outlook may lead management to conclude that an interim quantitative impairment test of our goodwill is required prior to the annual impairment test conducted on August 31.
Loan Servicing Rights. On a periodic basis, the Company sells residential mortgage loans, commercial FHA mortgage loans and SBA loans in the secondary market. Loan servicing rights resulting from us retaining the right to service the loans sold are carried at the lower of the initial capitalized amount, net of accumulated amortization, or estimated fair value. Loan servicing rights are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income.
The Company periodically evaluates its mortgage servicing rights asset for impairment. Impairment is assessed based on the fair value of net servicing cash flows at each reporting date using estimated prepayment speeds of the underlying loans serviced and stratifications based on the risk characteristics of the underlying loans. The fair value of our servicing rights is estimated by using a cash flow valuation model which calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows, taking into consideration expected mortgage loan prepayment rates, discount rates, servicing costs, replacement reserves and other economic factors which are estimated based on current market conditions.
Determining the fair value of our loan servicing rights for impairment assessment purposes is considered a critical accounting estimate, as it requires significant judgment and the use of subjective measurements. Changes in these estimates and assumptions are possible and may have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
Deferred Income Taxes. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes as prescribed by GAAP. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. If current available information raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance is established. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Accounting for deferred income taxes is a critical accounting estimate because we exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets. Management’s determination of the realization of deferred tax assets is based upon management’s
judgment of various future events and uncertainties, including the timing and amount of future income, reversing temporary differences which may offset, and the implementation of various tax plans to maximize realization of the deferred tax asset. These judgments and estimates are inherently subjective and reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period, which would negatively affect earnings.
