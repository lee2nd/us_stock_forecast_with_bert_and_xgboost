Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those set forth under the section titled “Risk Factors,” and other documents we file with the SEC. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of future results.
Special Note Regarding Smaller Reporting Company Status
As a result of having been a “smaller reporting company” (as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act), we are allowed and have elected to omit certain information, including three years of year-to-year comparisons and tabular disclosure of contractual obligations, from this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; however, we have provided all information for the periods presented that we believe to be appropriate and necessary.
Overview
We have put in place a business model in which we may derive future income from licensing and selling natural bioactive ingredients that may be derived from or are initially based on the algae cultures. We expect that these planned new products will likely be sold to much larger, better-financed animal, food, dietary supplement and medical food manufacturers. The anticipated income streams are to be generated from a) royalties and advances for licensed natural bioactive ingredients, and b) a toll on bulk sales of such ingredients. These bulk ingredients will likely be made by contracted ingredient manufacturers and then sold by us to animal food, dietary supplement and medical food processors and/or name-brand marketers. Further, we expect to license our bioactive molecules as lead compounds or templates for synthetic variants intended for therapeutic applications.
For our Wellmetrix, subsidiary, the Board and management agreed to halt active product development and instead focus on prospective out-licensing of the existing IP, consisting of a patent and several patents pending. An ongoing commitment to patent prosecution and maintenance of the existing patent has been approved by the Board.

Net Sales
ZIVO had no sales during the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
For Wellmetrix, we had $20,000 and $-0- of service revenue during the 12 months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Wellmetrix service revenue related to a study design for a pre-clinical trial.
Cost of Sales.
We had no cost of sales during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses were $1,948,423 for the 12 months ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $4,076,439 for the comparable prior period. The approximate $2,128,000 decrease in general and administrative expense during 2020 is due primarily to the following: a reduction in of $2,089,000 in salary expense ($2,249,000 non-cash decrease due to stock options issued to employees offset by an increase in headcount resulting in a cash expense increase of $160,000 versus the prior period), and a reduction in travel expense of $63,000; partially offset by an increase of $72,000 in insurance expense, and office/rent expense increase of $3,000.
Professional and Consulting Expenses
Professional and consulting expenses were $2,872,339 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $1,968,878 for the comparable prior period. The approximate $903,000 increase in professional and consulting expense during 2020 is mainly due to the following: an increase in Director Fees of $1,048,000 (the non-cash portion of Director Fees in 2020 was $1,249,000 for the issuance of 11,500,000 warrants for the purchase of common stock compared to the 2019 issuance of 2,500,000 warrants for the purchase of common stock valued at $193,000, a difference of $1,056,000), cash director fees were $8,000 lower in 2020, an increase of $90,000 in accounting fees, an increase of $156,000 in legal fees, and an increase in filing and listing fees of $29,000, partially offset by a decrease of $274,000 in financial consulting fees (of which a net non-cash value is $172,000 represented by a value of $438,000 relating to warrants issued in 2020 for 3,300,000 shares of common stock offset by a value of $760,000 relating to warrants issued in 2019 for 8 million shares of common stock), a decrease of $141,000 in investment banking fees, and a decrease of $5,000 in investor relations fees.
Research and Development Expenses
For the 12 months ended December 31, 2020, we incurred $3,754,913 on R&D expenses, as compared to $2,307,033 for the comparable period in 2019.
Of these expenses, approximately $3,609,000 and $2,206,000 for the 12 months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, are costs associated with research relating to ZIVO. Of these costs in 2020, $1,492,000 are a non-cash charge relating to stock options granted to employees involved with R&D. Subject to the availability of funding, our R&D costs will grow as we work to complete the research in the development of natural bioactive compounds for use as dietary supplements and food ingredients, as well as biologics for medicinal and pharmaceutical applications in humans and animals. The Company’s scientific efforts are focused on the metabolic aspects of oxidation and inflammation, with a parallel program to validate and license products for healthy immune response. The decrease of $89,000 of cash expenses from the prior period is due to the reduced availability of cash during this period.
With respect to our Wellmetrix, subsidiary, we incurred $146,000 and $101,000 in R&D expenses for the 12 months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The R&D effort to date has centered on optimizing dry chemistry, developing lower-cost alternatives for the proprietary analyzer device, negotiating and collaborating with offshore manufacturers and assembling the FDA pre-submission package for product classification and approval. The increase of $45,000 from the prior period is due to reinitiating certain limited projects for R&D. As noted above, the Company has halted active product development and instead is focusing on prospective out-licensing of the existing IP, consisting of a patent and several patents pending.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We have incurred significant net losses each year since our inception and as of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $99 million. We anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for at least the next few years.
We have funded our operations principally through the sales of equity and convertible debt securities. As of February 25, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $299,000.
During the 12 months ended December 31, 2020, we incurred negative cash flows from operations of $2,588,415. As of December 31, 2020, we had a working capital deficiency of $11,226,099 and a stockholders’ deficiency of $11,310,614. Although we recently received funding from the proceeds from the execution of a License Co-Development Participation Agreement and from sales of shares of the Company’s common stock, we have a near term need for additional capital.
Cash Flows from Operating Activities. During the 12 months ended December 31, 2020, our operating activities used $2,588,415 in cash, a decrease of cash used of $1,118,882 from the comparable prior period. The approximate $1,120,000 decrease in cash used by operating activities was primarily attributable to the following (all of which are approximated): a $2,404,000 decrease in net loss, a decrease in non-cash expenses of $1,485,000 (an increase of stock and warrants issued for services of $77,000, offset by a decrease in amortization of debt issuance costs of $1,188,000, a decrease in amortization of bond discount of $375,000), and $201,000 of changes made up of an increase in deferred revenue of $1,837,000 offset by a decrease in accrued liabilities - $866,000, a decrease in prepaid expenses/deposits - $9,000 and a decrease in accounts payable - $763,000.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities. During the 12 months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no investing activities.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities. During the 12 months ended December 31, 2020, our financing activities generated approximately $2,380,000, a decrease of approximately $1,285,000 from the comparable prior period. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities was due to an decrease in proceeds of approximately $2,249,000 from the sale of common stock, $152,000 from the exercise of warrants, partially offset by an increase in cash from financing activities of $898,000 from proceeds of sale of common stock warrants as part of License Co-Development Participation Agreements (see Note 10 - Deferred Revenue - Participation Agreements), $122,000 from the proceeds of loan payable, and $97,000 from proceeds of loans payable from a related party.
We raised a limited amount of capital during 2019 and 2020, and we continue to experience a shortage of capital, which is materially and adversely affecting our ability to run our business. As noted above, we have been largely dependent upon external sources for funding. We have in the past had difficulty in raising capital from external sources. We are still heavily reliant upon external financing for the continuation of our R&D program.
We estimate that we would require approximately $4 million in cash over the next 12 months in order to fund our basic operations, excluding our R&D initiatives. Based on this cash requirement, we have a near term need for additional funding. Historically, we have had substantial difficulty raising funds from external sources. If we are unable to raise the required capital, we will be forced to curtail our business operations, including our R&D activities. The following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):

COVID-19 STATEMENT
The Company is carefully monitoring the effects the COVID-19 global pandemic is having on its operations. The COVID-19 pandemic and other outbreaks have resulted in and may continue to result in delays in or the suspension of product development activities, regulatory work streams, R&D activities and other important commercial functions. The Company is also dependent upon third parties for the production and growth of our proprietary algae strains. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the Company has experienced, and may continue to experience additional disruptions that could severely impact the business and planned trials, including:
·diversion of CRO resources away from the conduct of studies, including the diversion of available test sites supporting the conduct of clinical trials;
·changes in local regulations as part of a response to the COVID-19 which may require changes to the way in which trials are conducted and may result in unexpected costs; and
·delays in necessary interactions with academic researchers at universities, life science research labs, ethics committees and other important agencies and contractors due to limitations in employee resources or forced furlough of government employees.
Further, prolonged government disruptions, global pandemics and other natural disasters or geopolitical actions, including related to the COVID-19 pandemic, could affect the Company’s ability to access the public markets and obtain necessary capital in order to properly capitalize and continue our operations. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the expectation was that there would be forward moment with the production of our algal biomass, validation and purification. However, these were temporarily suspended and/or delayed, and many continue in diminished capacity.
Seasonality
Based on our implemented business model, anticipated income streams will be generated from the following:
a)For ZIVO, (i) royalties and advances for licensed natural bioactive ingredients, isolated natural compounds and synthetic variants thereof, and (ii) bulk sales of such ingredients.
b)For our Wellmetrix, subsidiary, the Board and management agreed to halt active product development and instead focus on prospective out-licensing of the existing IP, consisting of a patent and several patents pending. An ongoing commitment to patent prosecution and maintenance of the existing patent has been approved by the Board.
We do not anticipate that these will be affected by seasonality.
Staffing
We have conducted all of our activities since inception with a minimum level of qualified staff. We currently do not expect a significant increase in staff.
Off-Balance Sheet arrangements
We have no off-Balance Sheet arrangements that would create contingent or other forms of liability.
