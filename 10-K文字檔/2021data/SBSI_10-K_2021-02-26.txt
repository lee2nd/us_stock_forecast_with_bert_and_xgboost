ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis provides a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 and financial condition as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. All share data has been adjusted to give retroactive recognition to any applicable stock splits and stock dividends.
CAUTIONARY NOTICE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
Our accounting and reporting estimates conform with U.S. GAAP and general practices within the financial services industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We consider our critical accounting policies to include the following:
Allowance for Losses on Loans. With the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, the allowance for credit losses on loans is estimated and recognized upon origination of the loan based on expected credit losses. ASU 2016-13 replaced the previous incurred loss model which incorporated only known information as of the balance sheet date. The CECL model uses historical experience and current conditions for homogeneous pools of loans, and reasonable and supportable forecasts about future events. When determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses on our loan portfolio, our commercial construction and real estate loans, commercial loans and municipal loans utilize the probability of default/loss given default discounted cash flow approach. These loans are assigned to pools based upon risk factors including the loan type and structure, collateral type, leverage ratio, refinancing risk and origination quality, among others. Our consumer construction real estate loans, 1-4 family residential loans and our loans to individuals use a loss rate approach and are assigned to pools based upon risk factors including loan types, origination year and credit scores. Loans evaluated collectively in a pool are monitored to ensure they continue to exhibit similar risk characteristics with other loans in a pool. If a loan does not share similar risk characteristics with other loans, expected credit losses for that loan are evaluated individually.
We have purchased certain loans that as of the date of purchase have experienced more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination. Management evaluates these loans against a probability threshold to determine if substantially all of the contractually required payments will be received. With the adoption of ASU 2016-13, PCD loans are recorded at the purchase price plus an allowance for credit losses which becomes the PCD loan's initial amortized cost. The non-credit related discount or premium, the difference between the initial amortized cost and the par value, will be amortized into interest income over the life of the loan. Any further changes to the allowance for credit losses are recorded through provision expense. All PCD loans are evaluated based upon product type within the underlying segment.
Acquired loans that are not deemed credit deteriorated at acquisition are initially measured at fair value as of the acquisition date. Additionally, an allowance is recorded with a corresponding charge to credit loss expense as of the reporting date. The difference between the acquisition date fair value and the contractual amounts due at the acquisition date represents the fair value adjustment. Fair value adjustments may be discounts (or premiums) to a loan’s cost basis and are accreted (or amortized) to interest income over the loan’s remaining contractual life using the level yield method.
Refer to “Part II - Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans”, “Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies” and “Note 5 - Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses” to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for a detailed description of our estimation process and methodology related to the allowance for loan losses.
Allowance for Credit Losses - AFS Securities. With the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, for AFS debt securities in an unrealized loss position where management (i) has the intent to sell or (ii) where it will more-likely-than-not be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis, we write the security down to fair value through income. For those AFS debt securities that do not meet either of these criteria, management assesses whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. Management assesses the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, industry and/or geographic conditions, credit ratings as well as other indicators at the individual security level. If a credit loss is determined to exist, the present value of discounted cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of discounted cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit loss is recorded, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost. Any impairment that is not recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in comprehensive income. Any future changes in the allowance for credit losses is recorded as provision for (reversal of) credit losses.
Allowance for Credit Losses - HTM Securities. With the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, expected credit losses on HTM securities are measured on a collective basis by major security type, when similar risk characteristics exist. Risk characteristics for segmenting HTM debt securities include issuer, maturity, coupon rate, yield, payment frequency, source of repayment, bond payment structure, and embedded options. Upon assignment of the risk characteristics to the major security types, management may further evaluate the qualitative factors associated with these securities to determine the expectation of credit losses, if any.
Refer to “Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies” and “Note 4 - Securities” to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for a detailed description of our estimation process and methodology related to the allowance for credit losses on securities.
Estimation of Fair Value. The estimation of fair value is significant to a number of our assets and liabilities. In addition, GAAP requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments as a part of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Fair values for securities are volatile and may be influenced by a number of factors, including market interest rates, prepayment speeds, discount rates and the shape of yield curves. Fair values for most investments and MBS are based on
quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on the quoted prices of similar instruments or estimates from independent pricing services. Where there are price variances outside certain ranges from different pricing services for specific securities, those pricing variances are reviewed with other market data to determine which of the price estimates is appropriate for that period. Fair values for our derivatives are based on measurements that consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, credit information and the derivatives’ terms and conditions, among other things. We validate prices supplied by such sources by comparison to one another.
Defined Benefit Pension Plan. The obligations and related assets, if applicable, of our defined benefit pension plans and our nonfunded supplemental retirement plan are presented in “Note 10 - Employee Benefits” to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. Entry into the Plan by new employees was frozen effective December 31, 2005. On June 18, 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors approved changes to the Plan and Restoration Plan to freeze all future benefit accruals and accrual of benefit service, including consideration of compensation increases, effective December 31, 2020. Effective December 31, 2006, employee benefits under the Acquired Plan were frozen by Omni. In addition, no new participants may be added to the Acquired Plan. Assets in the Plan and Acquired Plan, which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments, are valued using observable market quotations. Obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by independent actuaries and through the use of a number of assumptions that are reviewed by management. Key assumptions in measuring the obligations of the plans include the discount rate and the estimated future return on assets in the Plan and Acquired Plan. The rate of salary increases is another key assumption used in measuring the Plan and Restoration Plan obligations but will no longer be applicable after December 31, 2020, due to the freeze of benefits. The rate of salary increases is not required to measure the obligations of the Acquired Plan since the benefits are frozen.
In determining the discount rate, we utilized a cash flow matching analysis to determine a range of appropriate discount rates for our defined benefit pension and restoration plans. In developing the cash flow matching analysis, we constructed a portfolio of high quality noncallable bonds (rated AA- or better) to match as close as possible the timing of future benefit payments of the plans at December 31, 2020. Based on this cash flow matching analysis, we were able to determine an appropriate discount rate.
The expected long-term rate of return assumption reflects the average return expected based on the investment strategies and asset allocation of the assets invested to provide for the liabilities of the Plan and the Acquired Plan. We considered broad equity and bond indices, long-term return projections, and actual long-term historical performance when evaluating the expected long-term rate of return assumption. Material changes in pension benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions. Future annual amounts could be impacted by changes in the number of participants in the plans, changes in the level of benefits provided, changes in the discount rates, changes in the expected long-term rate of return, changes in the level of contributions to the plans and other factors.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Certain non-GAAP measures are used by management to supplement the evaluation of our performance. These include the following fully taxable-equivalent measures: Net interest income (FTE), net interest margin (FTE) and net interest spread (FTE), which include the effects of taxable-equivalent adjustments using a federal income tax rate of 21% for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, to increase tax-exempt interest income to a tax-equivalent basis. Interest income earned on certain assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. As such, these tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than taxable investments.
Net interest income (FTE), net interest margin (FTE) and net interest spread (FTE). Net interest income (FTE) is a non-GAAP measure that adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments and is not permitted under GAAP in the consolidated statements of income. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income, and that it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is our net interest income. Net interest margin (FTE) is the ratio of net interest income (FTE) to average earning assets. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is our net interest margin. Net interest spread (FTE) is the difference in the average yield on average earning assets on a tax-equivalent basis and the average rate paid on average interest bearing liabilities. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is our net interest spread.
These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered alternatives to GAAP-basis financial statements and other bank holding companies may define or calculate these non-GAAP measures or similar measures differently. Whenever we present a non-GAAP financial measure in an SEC filing, we are also required to present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and reconcile the differences between the non-GAAP financial measure and such comparable GAAP measure.
In the following table we present the reconciliation of net interest income to net interest income adjusted to a fully taxable-equivalent basis assuming a 21% marginal tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, for interest earned on tax-exempt assets such as municipal loans and investment securities (dollars in thousands), along with the calculation of net interest margin (FTE) and net interest spread (FTE).
(1) These amounts are presented on a fully taxable-equivalent basis and are non-GAAP measures.
Management believes adjusting net interest income, net interest margin and net interest spread to a fully taxable-equivalent basis is a standard practice in the banking industry as these measures provide useful information to make peer comparisons. Tax-equivalent adjustments are reported in the respective earning asset categories as listed in the “Average Balances with Average Yields and Rates” tables under Results of Operations.
OVERVIEW
COVID-19
During March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 a global pandemic in response to the rapidly growing outbreak of the virus. COVID-19 significantly impacted local, national and global economies due to stay-at-home orders and social distancing guidelines. In compliance with social distancing guidelines issued by federal, state and local governments, we initially closed all of our grocery store branches. As stay-at-home orders were issued by local governments in our market areas to combat the spread of the virus, we closed all traditional lobbies and wealth management and trust offices to walk-in customers, however, most of these traditional locations were offering certain services by appointment only. All other banking services were available to customers through our drive-thrus, ATMs/ITMs and automated telephone, internet and mobile banking products. After careful consideration and implementation of additional safety precautions, all locations were reopened on June 1, 2020. We have since made adjustments to select branch hours and openings, and we continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 situation. Approximately 45% of our workforce has remote working capabilities.
COVID-19 significantly disrupted supply chains, business activity and the overall economic and financial markets. These disruptions have and are likely to continue to result in a decline in demand for banking products or services, including loans and deposits which could impact our future financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic affects our business, operations and financial condition, as well as our regulatory capital and liquidity ratios and credit ratings, is highly uncertain and unpredictable and depends on, among other things, new information that may emerge concerning the scope, duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, actions taken by governmental authorities and other parties in responses to the pandemic, the scale of the distribution and public acceptance of any vaccines for COVID-19 and the effectiveness of such vaccines in stemming or stopping the spread of COVID-19. The adverse impact on the markets in which we operate and on our business, operations and financial condition is expected to remain elevated until the pandemic subsides.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CARES Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act provided an estimated $2.2 trillion to address the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and stimulate the economy by supporting individuals and businesses through loans, grants, tax changes, and other types of relief. The CARES Act also included provisions to encourage financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers. As an SBA lender, we were well positioned to assist business customers in accessing funds available through the PPP implemented in April. At December 31, 2020, we had $214.8 million of approved PPP loans outstanding. On December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid Act was signed into law. This second coronavirus relief package granted additional funds for a new round of PPP loans. Additionally, it expands the eligibility for loans and allows certain businesses to request a second loan. The SBA began accepting applications for the second round of PPP loans on January 13, 2021. As of February 23, 2021, we had funded $55 million of additional PPP loans under this second round of PPP loans.
Additionally, we are assisting both our consumer and commercial borrowers that may be experiencing financial hardship due to COVID-19 related challenges. As of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding loans with payment deferrals, generally for up to three months, totaling $47.2 million, a decrease from $326.0 million reported in our second quarter earnings release in July 2020. As of February 23, 2021, we had outstanding loans with payment deferrals totaling $2.5 million. The decrease in the COVID-19 modified loans are the result of the loans coming out of the deferral periods and resuming performance. The largest category of remaining deferrals include 1-4 family residential loans.
OPERATING RESULTS
During the year ended December 31, 2020, our net income increased $7.6 million, or 10.2%, to $82.2 million, from $74.6 million for the same period in 2019. The increase was primarily driven by the $17.5 million increase in net interest income, the $7.4 million increase in noninterest income, partially offset by the $15.1 million increase in the provision for credit losses after adopting CECL and the $4.0 million increase in noninterest expense. Earnings per diluted common share increased $0.27, or 12.3%, to $2.47 for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $2.20 for the same period in 2019. The increase in the provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to the economic environment related to COVID-19 and the resulting impact on the economic assumptions used in the CECL model.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, our net income increased $0.4 million, or 0.6%, to $74.6 million, from $74.1 million for the same period in 2018. The increase was largely driven by increases in interest income of $11.6 million and net gain on the sale of AFS securities of $2.6 million, as well as the decrease in provision for loan losses of $3.3 million, partially offset by a $13.9 million increase in interest expense and a $3.1 million increase in income tax expense. Earnings per diluted common share increased $0.09, or 4.3%, to $2.20 for year ended December 31, 2019, from $2.11 for the same period in 2018.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Our total assets increased $259.3 million, or 3.8%, to $7.01 billion at December 31, 2020 from $6.75 billion at December 31, 2019. Our securities portfolio increased by $202.8 million, or 8.1%, to $2.70 billion, compared to $2.49 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase in our securities portfolio was comprised of an increase of $843.9 million in investment securities, partially offset by a decrease of $641.1 million in MBS as we realigned our portfolio in response to the impact of COVID-19 on the financial markets. The decrease in MBS was partially due to increased prepayments resulting from the lower interest rate environment. Our FHLB stock decreased $24.8 million, or 49.6%, to $25.3 million from $50.1 million at December 31, 2019, primarily due to decreases in the amount of FHLB stock we were required to hold in relation to our FHLB borrowings.
Loans increased $89.6 million, or 2.5%, to $3.66 billion at December 31, 2020 from $3.57 billion at December 31, 2019. The net increase in our loan portfolio was comprised of increases of $155.6 million of commercial loans, $45.5 million of commercial real estate loans and $25.1 million of municipal loans, partially offset by decreases of $67.6 million of 1-4 family residential loans, $63.0 million of construction loans, and $6.0 million of loans to individuals. The increase in commercial loans is due entirely to $214.8 million of PPP loans as of December 31, 2020. Loans held for sale increased $3.3 million, or 864.8%, to $3.7 million at December 31, 2020 from $383,000 at December 31, 2019.
Our nonperforming assets at December 31, 2020 increased $31,000, or 0.2%, to $17.5 million and represented 0.25% of total assets, compared to $17.4 million, or 0.26% of total assets, at December 31, 2019. Nonaccruing loans increased $2.8 million, or 55.4%, to $7.7 million, and the ratio of nonaccruing loans to total loans increased to 0.21% at December 31, 2020, compared to 0.14% at December 31, 2019. Restructured loans were $9.6 million at December 31, 2020, a decrease of 19.7%, from $12.0 million at December 31, 2019. OREO decreased to $106,000 at December 31, 2020 from $472,000 at December 31, 2019.
Our deposits increased $229.6 million, or 4.9%, to $4.93 billion at December 31, 2020 from $4.70 billion at December 31, 2019, which was comprised of an increase of $314.7 million in noninterest bearing deposits, partially offset by a decrease of $85.1 million in interest bearing deposits. The increase was largely driven by PPP loan disbursements and stimulus checks deposited during the second quarter of 2020. Brokered deposits decreased $232.8 million, or 62.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Total FHLB borrowings decreased $140.2 million, or 14.4%, to $832.5 million at December 31, 2020 from $972.7 million at December 31, 2019.
Our total shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2020 increased 8.8%, or $70.7 million, to $875.3 million, or 12.5% of total assets, compared to $804.6 million, or 11.9% of total assets, at December 31, 2019. The increase in shareholders’ equity was the result of net income of $82.2 million, other comprehensive income of $64.8 million, stock compensation expense of $3.0 million, common stock issued under our dividend reinvestment plan of $1.4 million and net issuance of common stock under employee stock plans of $1.3 million. These increases were partially offset by cash dividends paid of $43.2 million, the repurchase of $31.0 million of our common stock and a reduction to beginning retained earnings of $7.8 million for a cumulative-effect adjustment related to the adoption of CECL.
Economic conditions were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020; however, Texas still outperformed the nation in 2020, and our Fort Worth and Austin market areas have continued to perform generally better than many other parts of the country. Texas continues to experience economic growth due to in-migration from other states and company relocation from other states. Economists predict vaccines will drive strong economic growth in the second half of 2021.
Key financial indicators management follows include, but are not limited to, numerous interest rate sensitivity and interest rate risk indicators, credit risk, operations risk, liquidity risk, capital risk, regulatory risk, competition risk, yield curve risk, U.S. agency MBS prepayment risk and economic risk indicators.
BALANCE SHEET STRATEGY
We utilize wholesale funding and securities to enhance our profitability and balance sheet composition by determining acceptable levels of credit, interest rate and liquidity risk consistent with prudent capital management. This balance sheet strategy consists of borrowing a combination of long- and short-term funds from the FHLB or the brokered funds market. These funds are invested primarily in U.S. agency MBS and long-term municipal securities. Although U.S. agency MBS often carry lower yields than traditional mortgage loans and other types of loans we make, these securities generally (i) increase the overall quality of our assets because of either the implicit or explicit guarantees of the U.S. Government, (ii) are more liquid than individual loans and (iii) may be used to collateralize our borrowings or other obligations. While the strategy of investing a portion of our assets in U.S. Agency MBS and municipal securities has historically resulted in lower interest rate spreads and margins, we believe the lower operating expenses and reduced credit risk, combined with the managed interest rate risk of this strategy, have enhanced our overall profitability for many years. At this time, we utilize this balance sheet strategy with the goal of enhancing overall profitability by maximizing the use of our capital.
Risks associated with the asset structure we maintain include a lower net interest rate spread and margin when compared to our peers, changes in the slope of the yield curve, which can reduce our net interest rate spread and margin, increased interest rate risk, the length of interest rate cycles, changes in volatility or spreads associated with the MBS and municipal securities, the unpredictable nature of MBS prepayments and credit risks associated with the municipal securities. See “Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business” in this report for a discussion of risks related to interest rates. Our asset structure, net interest spread and net interest margin require us to closely monitor our interest rate risk. An additional risk is the change in fair value of the AFS securities portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates. Significant increases in interest rates, especially long-term interest rates, could adversely impact the fair value of the AFS securities portfolio, which could also significantly impact our equity capital. Due to the unpredictable nature of MBS prepayments, the length of interest rate cycles and the slope of the interest rate yield curve, net interest income could fluctuate more than simulated under the scenarios modeled by our ALCO and described under “
