Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including those described in the section titled “Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements.” Our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those set forth under the section titled “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this report.
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company leveraging our proprietary technology platform to design and develop a pipeline of novel oral biologic product candidates to treat autoimmune, inflammatory, metabolic, and other diseases. Our proprietary technology platform allows us to exploit existing natural cellular trafficking pathways to facilitate the active transport of diverse therapeutic payloads across the IE barrier. Active transport is an efficient mechanism that uses the cell’s own machinery to transport materials across the IE barrier. We believe that our ability to exploit this mechanism is a key differentiator of our approach. We are developing oral biologic product candidates in patient-friendly dosage forms that are designed for either targeting local GI tissue or entering systemic circulation to precisely address the relevant biology of a disease. We are building a portfolio of oral product candidates based on our technology platform including our most advanced product candidate, AMT-101, a GI-selective oral fusion of IL-10 and our proprietary carrier molecule that has completed a Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with UC. We have initiated Phase 2 clinical trials of AMT-101 in UC and related inflammatory indications. Our second product candidate, AMT-126, is a GI-selective oral fusion of IL-22 and our proprietary carrier molecule currently in development for diseases related to IE barrier function defects driven by activation of the innate immune system. We submitted a CTA for AMT-126 in December 2020 and began dosing healthy volunteers in a Phase 1a clinical trial for AMT-126 in February 2021. Our technology platform enables us to design and develop various oral biologic therapeutic modalities, such as peptides, proteins, full-length antibodies, antibody fragments, and RNA therapeutics, with potentially significant advantages over existing marketed and development-stage drugs.
Since the date of our incorporation in Delaware on November 21, 2016, we have devoted substantial resources to research and development activities, including research activities such as drug discovery, preclinical studies, and clinical trials as well as development activities such as the manufacturing of clinical and research material, establishing and maintaining our intellectual property portfolio, hiring personnel, raising capital, and providing general and administrative support for these operations.
We do not currently have any products approved for sale, and we have not generated any revenue from product sales. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability, if ever, will depend on the successful development of one or more of our product candidates which we expect will take a number of years. Given our stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities. We intend to build a commercial infrastructure to support sales of our product candidates. We expect to manage sales, marketing and distribution through internal resources and third-party relationships. While we may commit significant financial and management resources to commercial activities, we may also consider collaborating with one or more pharmaceutical companies to enhance our commercial capabilities.
Manufacturing of protein therapeutics is a complex process and represents a critical path to creating oral biologic therapeutics and a key component of our long-term success. We have spent significant resources to date on developing our current manufacturing processes and know-how to produce sufficient supply and optimize functionality. We have activated a new facility located in South San Francisco where we manufacture clinical drug supply. While we have successfully manufactured AMT-101 and AMT-126 clinical drug supply at our internal facility, we may need to scale our manufacturing operations to manufacture sufficient quantity needed to advance any of our product candidates in preclinical studies and clinical trials. Accordingly, we will be required to make significant investments to expand our manufacturing facilities in the future, and our efforts to scale our internal manufacturing capabilities are subject to risks.
In addition, even after the completion of our in-house manufacturing facility, we expect to continue to rely on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if any of our product candidates obtain marketing approval. We also rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to package, label, store and distribute our product candidates, as well as for our commercial products if marketing approval is obtained. We believe that this strategy allows us to maintain a more efficient infrastructure by eliminating the need for us to invest in our own manufacturing facilities, equipment and personnel while also enabling us to focus our expertise and resources on the development of our product candidates.
Since the date of our incorporation, we have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred a net loss of $66.6 million and used $58.9 million of cash in operations. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $139.4 million and do not expect positive cash flows from operations in the foreseeable future. We expect to continue to incur significant and increasing losses for the foreseeable future, and our net losses may fluctuate significantly from period to period, depending on the timing of and expenditures on our planned research and development activities.
To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the private placements of convertible preferred stock and the issuance of common stock upon the completion of our IPO. We completed our IPO in June 2020 and received net proceeds of approximately $160.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs, net of offering costs of $0.2 million paid in 2019.
We expect our expenses will increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities, as we:
▪
advance product candidates through preclinical studies and clinical trials;
▪
pursue regulatory approval of product candidates;
▪
continue to invest in our technology platform;
▪
seek marketing approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;
▪
implement operational, financial and management information systems;
▪
hire additional personnel;
▪
buildout and expand our in-house manufacturing capabilities;
▪
continue to operate as a public company;
▪
expand our pipeline of product candidates;
▪
obtain, maintain, expand, and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and
▪
establish a sales, marketing, and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any product candidate for which we may obtain marketing approval and related commercial manufacturing build-out.
As a result, we will require substantial additional capital to develop our product candidates and fund operations for the foreseeable future. Until such time as we can generate sufficient revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations and licensing arrangements. We may be unable to raise additional funds or to enter into such agreements or arrangements on favorable terms, or at all. Our failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, and could force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our drug development or future commercialization efforts. We may also be required to grant rights to develop and market drug candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. The amount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors including the pace and results of our development efforts. We cannot assure you that we will ever be profitable or generate positive cash flow from operating activities.
Based on our current operating plan, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and investments will be sufficient to fund our planned operations through at least the next 12 months. We have based this projection on assumptions that may be inaccurate and as a result, we may utilize our capital resources sooner than we expect.
COVID-19
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we could experience disruptions that severely impact our business. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic could result in delays to our clinical trials and preclinical studies for numerous reasons including difficulties in enrolling patients or healthy volunteers, diversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials, delays in receiving regulatory authorities to initiate clinical trials, and delays in receiving supplies to conduct clinical trials and preclinical studies. As of December 31, 2020, we were not aware of any contingencies and no estimates were recorded on our financial statements. In addition, future developments from the COVID-19 pandemic are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.
Components of Results of Operations
Revenue
We have not generated any revenue from product sales or otherwise and do not expect to generate any revenue for the foreseeable future.
Operating Expenses
We classify operating expenses into two main categories: (i) research and development expenses and (ii) general and administrative expenses.
Research and Development Expenses
Our research and development expenses consist primarily of external and internal expenses incurred in connection with our research activities and development programs.
These expenses include, but are not limited to:
External expenses, consisting of:
▪
clinical trials-expenses associated with CROs for managing and conducting clinical trials and sample analysis;
▪
materials-expenses associated with laboratory supplies and other materials;
▪
preclinical studies-expenses associated with preclinical studies performed by vendors;
▪
contract manufacturing-expenses associated with manufacturing clinical trial materials including under agreements with CDMOs and other vendors; and
▪
other research and development-expenses associated with consulting and other external expenses.
Internal expenses, consisting of:
▪
personnel-personnel expenses including salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense; and
▪
equipment, depreciation, and facility-expenses associated with service and repair of equipment, equipment depreciation, and allocated facility costs for research and development occupied space.
To date, the vast majority of these expenses have been incurred to advance our most advanced product candidate, AMT-101. We expect that significant additional spending will be required to progress AMT-101 through the remainder of the clinical development phases. These expenses will primarily consist of expenses for the administration of clinical studies as well as manufacturing costs for clinical material supply.
In addition, we have incurred minimal expenses in connection with our second product candidate, AMT-126, including expenses for internal animal studies and preclinical studies performed at contract research organizations. We expect that significant additional spending will be required as we progress AMT-126 through clinical trials. We have also incurred minimal expenses to expand our development pipeline and for general discovery research. We expect
spending for these early-stage research and development activities to increase for the foreseeable future. We deploy our personnel, equipment, and facility resources across all our research and development activities.
Research and development expenses are recognized as they are incurred. If deposits are required by external vendors, the non-current portion of the deposit is included as a prepaid expense until the related services are provided.
At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing, and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of, and obtain regulatory approval for, any of our product candidates. We expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly in the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in research and development activities related to developing our product candidates, as our product candidates advance into later stages of development, as we begin to conduct larger clinical trials, as we seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, and incur expenses associated with hiring additional personnel to support our research and development efforts. The process of conducting the necessary clinical research to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming, the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain, and we may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our product candidates.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs (including salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense) for personnel in executive, finance, accounting, corporate development, and other administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include legal fees, professional fees paid for accounting, auditing, consulting, tax, and investor relations services, insurance costs, and facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, and public company expenses such as costs associated with compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC and those of the Nasdaq Stock Market.
We expect that our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase significantly in the foreseeable future as additional administrative personnel and services are required to manage these functions of a public company and as our pipeline of product candidates expands.
Interest Income, Net and Other Expense, Net
Interest income, net and other expense, net primarily consists of interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and investments, realized gain and loss on investments, interest expense from capital lease obligations, and net losses on foreign currency transactions related to third-party contracts with foreign-based vendors.
Results of Operations
Comparisons of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses were $53.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $24.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The overall increase in research and development expenses was primarily related to higher expenses associated with clinical trials, preclinical studies, materials, compensation, contract manufacturing and facilities related expenses. In particular, clinical, preclinical and materials expenses increased primarily due to progressing our most advanced product candidate, AMT-101, through the completion of Phase 1 studies, initiating AMT-101 Phase 2 studies, and progressing AMT-126 through the initiation of AMT-126 Phase 1 studies. The following table sets forth the primary external and internal research and development expenses for the periods presented below (in thousands).
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses were $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily related to an increase of $3.4 million in personnel and administrative costs due to an increase in headcount and an increase of $4.9 million in professional fees.
Interest Income, Net
Interest income, net was comparable for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the year ended December 31, 2019.
Other Income, Net
Other income, net was $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. For both fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020, Other income, net primarily consists of realized gains on foreign currency transactions.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of December 31, 2020 will be sufficient to fund our current operating plan through at least the next 12 months.
Since the date of our incorporation, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from operations. We anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. Our operations have been financed primarily by net proceeds from sales of our convertible preferred stock and common stock through our IPO. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $139.4 million. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $129.9 million.
Future Funding Requirements
To date, we have not generated any revenue. We do not expect to generate any meaningful revenue unless and until we obtain regulatory approval and commercialize any of our product candidates, and we do not know when, or if at all, that will occur. We will continue to require additional capital to develop our product candidates and fund operations for the foreseeable future. Our primary uses of cash are to fund our operations, which consist primarily of research and development expenses related to our programs, and to a lesser extent, general and administrative expenses. We expect our expenses to continue to increase in connection with our ongoing activities as we continue to advance our product candidates. In addition, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.
We may seek to raise capital through public equity or debt financings, collaborative agreements or other arrangements with other companies, or through other sources of financing. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategies. We anticipate that we will need to raise substantial additional capital, the requirements of which will depend on many factors, including:
▪
the progress, costs, trial design, results of and timing of our various clinical trials of AMT-101;
▪
the progress, costs and results of our research pipeline;
▪
the willingness of the FDA, EMA, or other regulatory authorities to accept our AMT-101 clinical trials, as well as data from our completed and planned clinical trials and preclinical studies and other work, as the basis for review and approval of AMT-101 for various indications;
▪
the outcome, costs and timing of seeking and obtaining FDA, EMA, and any other regulatory approvals;
▪
the number and characteristics of drug candidates that we pursue;
▪
our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of our drug candidates;
▪
our need to expand our research and development activities;
▪
the costs associated with manufacturing our product candidates, including building-out and expanding our own manufacturing facilities, and establishing commercial supplies and sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities;
▪
the costs associated with securing and establishing commercialization;
▪
the costs of acquiring, licensing, or investing in businesses, drug candidates, and technologies;
▪
our ability to maintain, expand, and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio, including the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make, or that we may receive, in connection with the licensing, filing, prosecution, defense, and enforcement of any patents or other intellectual property rights;
▪
our need and ability to retain key management and hire scientific, technical, business, and medical personnel;
▪
the effect of competing drugs and drug candidates and other market developments;
▪
the timing, receipt, and amount of sales from our potential products;
▪
our need to implement additional internal systems and infrastructure, including financial and reporting systems;
▪
the economic and other terms, timing of and success of any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements which we may enter in the future; and
▪
the effects of the recent disruptions to and volatility in the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide from the COVID-19 pandemic.
If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders will experience dilution. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we may be subject to covenants that restrict our operations including limitations on our ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay dividends, repurchase our common stock, make certain investments, and engage in certain merger, consolidation or asset sale transactions. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders. If we are unable to raise
additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, reduce, or terminate some or all of our development programs and clinical trials. We may also be required to sell or license to others the rights to our product candidates in certain territories or indications that we would prefer to develop and commercialize ourselves. In addition, our ability to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and the recent disruptions to and volatility in the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Summary Statement of Cash Flows
The following table sets forth the primary sources and uses of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash for the periods presented below (in thousands):
Cash Used in Operating Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in operating activities was $58.9 million, which consisted of a net loss of $66.6 million, offset by a net increase of $2.9 million in our net operating assets and liabilities and $4.8 million in non-cash charges. The net increase in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to net increases of $3.5 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a decrease of $0.5 million in other assets, partially offset by a net decrease of $1.1 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets. The non-cash charges primarily consisted of stock-based compensation expense of $3.1 million and depreciation of $1.8 million, partially offset by net accretion of discounts on investments of $0.1 million.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash used in operating activities was $27.0 million, which consisted of a net loss of $28.0 million and a net decrease of $0.1 million in our net operating assets and liabilities, offset by $1.1 million in non-cash charges. The net decrease in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $0.6 million and an increase in other assets of $0.5 million, partially offset by a decrease of $1.0 million in accrued expenses. The non-cash charges primarily consisted of depreciation of $0.7 million and stock-based compensation expense of $0.5 million.
Cash Used in Investing Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash used in investing activities was $109.3 million related primarily to the purchase of investments of $188.2 million, the purchase of property and equipment of $5.3 million, offset by the sales and maturities of investments of $84.2 million.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in investing activities was $22.1 million related primarily to the purchase of investments of $20.6 million, the purchase of property and equipment of $2.1 million, offset by the sales and maturities of investments of $0.6 million.
Cash Provided by or Used in Financing Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by financing activities was $161.3 million, consisting primarily of net proceeds of $160.8 million received from the issuance of common stock in our IPO and proceeds received from the stock option exercises of $0.6 million, offset by principal payments for the capital lease of $0.1 million.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, cash provided by financing activities was $41.6 million, consisting primarily of net proceeds received from the issuance of convertible preferred stock.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands):
(1)
Payments due for our headquarters and manufacturing facility
(2)
Payments due for certain laboratory equipment
Total minimum future lease payments of approximately $47.2 million for a lease that has not commenced as of December 31, 2020 is not included in the table above or in the lease liability in financial statements, as we do not yet have control of the underlying asset. The lease is expected to commence in October 2021 with a base lease term of eight years.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.
Critical Accounting Policies, Significant Judgments and Use of Estimates
Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The economic uncertainty in the current environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could limit our ability to accurately make and evaluate our estimates and judgments. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management’s judgments and estimates.
While our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report, we believe that the following critical accounting policies are most important to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses are charged to expense as incurred. Research and development expenses include personnel and labor costs related to clinical trials, preclinical studies, contract manufacturing and facilities for laboratory space used for research and development activities.
Accrued Research and Development Expenses
We record accruals for estimated costs of research, preclinical and manufacturing development within accrued expenses in our balance sheets which are significant components of research and development expenses. A substantial portion of our ongoing research and development activities is conducted by third-party service providers, including CROs and CDMOs. Our contracts with the CROs and CDMOs generally include fees such as initiation fees, reservation fees, costs related to animal studies and safety tests, verification run costs, materials and reagents expenses,
taxes, etc. The financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations, which vary from contract to contract and may result in payment flows that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided to us under such contracts. We accrue the costs incurred under agreements with these third parties based on estimates of actual work completed in accordance with the respective agreements. We determine the estimated costs through discussions with internal personnel and external service providers as to the progress, or stage of completion or actual timeline of the services and the agreed-upon fees to be paid for such services.
If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we adjust accrued expenses or prepaid expenses accordingly, which impact research and development expenses. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have not been any material adjustments to our prior estimates of research and development expenses.
Stock-Based Compensation Expense
We account for stock-based compensation expense by measuring and recognizing compensation expense for all share-based awards made to employees and non-employees based on estimated grant-date fair values. We use the straight-line method to allocate compensation cost to reporting periods over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. We recognize actual forfeitures by reducing the stock-based compensation expense in the same period as the forfeitures occur. We estimate the fair value of share-based awards to employees and non-employees using the Black-Scholes option-pricing valuation model. The Black-Scholes model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including fair value of common stock, expected term, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividend yield, which are described in greater detail below.
Estimating the fair value of equity-classified awards as of the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model is affected by assumptions regarding a number of complex variables. Changes in the assumptions can materially affect the fair value and ultimately how much stock-based compensation expense is recognized. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop. These inputs are as follows:
•
Fair value of common stock-Prior to our IPO, as there has been no public market for our common stock, the fair value of our common stock was determined by our board of directors based in part on valuations of our common stock prepared by a third-party valuation firm. Subsequent to our IPO, the fair value of our common stock is determined based upon the closing market price on the date of grant.
•
Expected term-The expected term represents the period that our options granted are expected to be outstanding and is determined using the simplified method (based on the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term). We have very limited historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns and post-vesting employment termination behavior for our stock option grants.
•
Expected volatility-Since we do not have enough trading history for our common stock, the expected volatility was estimated based on the average volatility for comparable publicly traded biopharmaceutical companies over a period equal to the expected term of the stock option grants. The comparable companies were chosen based on their similar size, life cycle stage, or area of specialty. We will continue to apply this process until enough historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available.
•
Risk-free interest rate-The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of the options.
•
Expected dividend yield-We have never paid dividends on our common stock and have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock. Therefore, we used an expected dividend yield of zero.
For options granted to non-employee consultants, the fair value of these options is also measured using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model reflecting the same assumptions as applied to employee options in each of the reported periods, other than the expected term which is assumed to be the remaining contractual life of the option.
We will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility, expected terms, and interest rates utilized for our stock-based compensation expense calculations on a prospective basis.
