Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those in such forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed in “Forward-Looking Statements” and elsewhere in this report.
Overview
We are a leading provider of in-store and digital advertising solutions to CPG manufacturers, retailers, shopper marketing agencies and brokerages. We believe our products and services are attractive to our clients because of our speed to market, ability to customize our solutions down to store level and the results our solutions deliver. Our leadership and employees have extensive industry knowledge, including direct experience through former positions at CPG manufacturers and retailers. We provide marketing solutions to CPG manufacturers spanning from some of the largest multinationals to new and emerging brands.
We face increasingly intense competition for the marketing expenditures of CPG manufacturers for in-store signage. We have observed increased competition in growing and maintaining our network of retailers into which we are authorized to sell solutions as competitors continue to purchase new or extend exclusive arrangements with retailers for that purpose. New product investments by large and emerging CPG manufacturers give us optimism that our product portfolio is relevant to our clients.
Over the past several years, we have significantly expanded our offered solutions and have developed a portfolio designed to more holistically meet the needs of our clients and execution partners which has diversified our portfolio. Our focus on portfolio diversification resulted in our 2020 non-POPS solutions revenue growing 11% versus 2019. We remain committed to further refining and enhancing our solutions and broadening our retailer relationships.
Sale of our Custom Print Business
In August 2020, we sold our custom print business to an existing strategic partner. This divestiture has allowed us to focus on our core business, selling product solutions to CPGs. The custom print business was not material to our operations as a whole and did not represent a strategic shift and therefore is not presented as a discontinued operation. The sale price was $300,000 resulting in a gain on the sale of $195,000. We received $200,000 of cash and recorded a short-term receivable of $75,000 and a long-term receivable of $25,000. In addition to the initial sale price, we are eligible to receive up to $100,000 in additional payments to the extent net sales by the custom print business during the first year after closing exceeds a threshold amount. Due to the contingent nature of the earn-out, no gain has been recognized as part of the recorded gain.
Impacts and Potential Future Impacts of COVID-19 on Our Business
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly and adversely impacted our operations and the operations of our CPG customers and retailers as a result of quarantines, illnesses, and travel and logistics restrictions and it is likely to continue to adversely affect our business indefinitely. While we have continued to operate and maintain our continuity with our clients by working remotely, the retail landscape in which CPG manufacturers and retailers operate has changed substantially, as has our ability to execute programs due to both limited access to our retailers and reduced levels of staffing with our execution partners. The financial impact of COVID-19 for 2020 was significant. A significant number of programs originally slated for execution in the second quarter were cancelled. Our future bookings may be negatively impacted until the COVID-19 pandemic moderates. Factors deriving from the COVID-19 response that have impacted or we believe are likely to negatively impact sales and operating results in the future include, but are not limited to: reduced or delayed levels of CPG spending; reduced levels of staffing with our execution partners; limitations on the ability of our employees to perform their work due to illness caused by the pandemic or local, state, or federal orders requiring employees to remain at home; and limitations on the ability of our customers to pay us on a timely basis. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience adverse impacts on our business as a result of any economic recession or depression that has occurred or may occur in the future. Therefore, we cannot reasonably estimate the full extent of the impact on our results of operation and financial condition but it could be material and last for an extended period of time. We continue to monitor our liquidity, including frequent cost and spending assessments and reductions across our organization.
We will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers and shareholders. While we are unable to determine or predict the nature, duration or scope of the overall impact the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources, we believe that it is important to share where our company stands today, how our response to COVID-19 is progressing and how our operations and financial condition may change as the fight against COVID-19 progresses.
Results of Operations
The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in the Company’s Statements of Operations as a percentage of total net sales.
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31,
Net Sales. Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased 19.5% to $17,669,000, compared to $21,954,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Service revenues. Service revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased 15.5% to $17,091,000, compared to $20,229,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a $4,065,000, or 34.5%, decrease in POPS revenue, partially offset by a $927,000, or 11.0%, increase in non-POPS revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the POPS revenue was significantly lower due to decreases in the number of signs placed and average price per sign due to existing competitive pressures and the absence of a significant retailer for the full year. We believe the COVID-19 pandemic also significantly impacted both POPS and non-POPS revenue. COVID-19 has resulted in both reduced and delayed spending on our programs by CPG manufacturers. We will continue to have increased pressure on our POPS business heading into 2021, including the expiration in April 2021 of our 10-year selling agreement with News America Marketing.
Product revenues. Product revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased 66.5% to $578,000, compared to $1,725,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the August 2020 sale of the custom print business. We do not expect product revenues will be significant in future periods.
Gross Profit. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased 36.1% to $3,043,000, compared to $4,761,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Gross profit as a percentage of total net sales decreased to 17.2% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 21.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Service revenues. Gross profit from service revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased 33.0% to $2,998,000, compared to $4,473,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to a decrease in POPS solution sales as gross profit is highly dependent on sales levels due to the relatively fixed nature of a portion of payments to retailers, combined with the decrease in average price per sign.
Gross profit as a percentage of service revenues decreased to 17.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 22.1% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the factors described above.
Product revenues. Gross profit from product sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased 84.4% to $45,000, compared to $288,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the August 2020 sale of the custom print business, which represented the bulk of this business.
Gross profit as a percentage of product sales decreased to 7.8% for 2020, compared to 16.7% for 2019. The decrease was primarily due to decreased sales volume and changes in the mix of customers and products sold.
Impairment Loss - Services. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2020 was also negatively impacted as a result of an impairment loss resulting from the impairment charge of $159,000 on the value of the Company’s selling agreement with News America, a long-lived asset. The impairment charge is described further in Item 8, footnote 1. There was no impairment loss impacting gross profit during the year ended December 31, 2019.
Operating Expenses
Selling. Selling expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased 8.2% to $2,877,000, compared to $2,658,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to increased staff related expenses. Selling expenses as a percentage of total net sales increased to 16.3% in 2020, compared to 12.1% in 2019, primarily due to decreased sales, in addition to the increases in costs and expenses described above.
Marketing. Marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased 57.6% to $1,015,000, compared to $2,394,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily the result of decreased staffing and variable staff related expenses and due to decreased consulting expenses. Marketing expenses as a percentage of total net sales decreased to 5.7% in 2020, compared to 10.9% in 2019, primarily due to the factors described above, partially offset by decreased sales.
General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased 18.7% to $3,947,000, compared to $3,324,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to expenses relating to the litigation with News America, partially offset by decreased staffing and reduced stock-based compensation. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net sales increased to 22.3% in 2020, compared to 15.1% in 2019, primarily due to decreased sales, in addition to the increases in expense described above.
Gain on sale. Gain on sale for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $195,000 as a result of the sale of our custom print business. There was no gain on sale during the year ended December 31, 2019.
Impairment Loss. There was no impairment loss included in operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2020. The impairment loss of $2,014,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 was driven by a long-lived asset impairment charge which is described further in Item 8, footnote 1.
Other Income. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased to $110,000, compared to $142,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Income Taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $191,000, compared to an income tax benefit of $466,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The effective tax rate was 4.3% and 8.5% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The primary differences between the Company’s December 31, 2020 and 2019 effective tax rates and the statutory federal rates are expenses related to stock-based compensation in the amounts of $152,000 and $172,000, respectively, nondeductible meals and entertainment of $8,000 and $32,000, respectively, and a change in the Company’s valuation allowance against its deferred assets of $875,000 and $769,000, respectively. The effective tax rate fluctuates between periods based on the level of permanent differences and other discrete items relative to the level of pre-tax loss for the period.
Net Loss. For the reasons stated above, the net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $4,300,000 compared to a net loss of $5,021,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company has financed its operations with proceeds from stock sales and sales of its services and products. At December 31, 2020, working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $8,694,000 compared to $11,395,000 at December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, cash and cash equivalents decreased $382,000 from $7,510,000 at December 31, 2019, to $7,128,000 at December 31, 2020.
Operating Activities: Net cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1,580,000. Net loss of $4,300,000, plus non-cash adjustments of $718,000, plus changes in operating assets and liabilities of $2,002,000 resulted in the $1,580,000 of cash used in operating activities. The non-cash adjustments included of depreciation and amortization expense, impairment loss, gain on sale of business, changes in allowance for doubtful accounts, and stock-based compensation expense. The largest component of the change in operating assets and liabilities was accounts receivable, which decreased $2,041,000 from December 31, 2019, as a result of lower sales in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 compared to 2019, as well as expected fluctuations based on business and market conditions. In the normal course of business, our accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and deferred revenue will fluctuate depending on the level of revenues and related business activity, as well as billing arrangements with customers and payment terms with retailers.
Investing Activities: Net cash provided by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $139,000. The Company sold its custom print business for $300,000 resulting in a gain on the sale of $195,000. The Company received $200,000 of cash and recorded a short-term receivable of $75,000 and a long-term receivable of $25,000. Purchases of property and equipment of $61,000 in 2020 decreased in comparison to 2019 due to completion of a technology system project in the first half of 2019. With the commencement of outsourcing of most information technology and printing operations, the Company anticipates minimal purchases of property and equipment for that purpose in 2021. The Company does not anticipate significant cash outlays for leasehold improvements in connection with new facility leases anticipated in the first part of 2021.The monthly payments under the new leases are anticipated to be significantly less than the monthly payments under expiring leases. During December 2020, in connection with the outsourcing of most printing operations, the Company sold property and equipment with a net book value of $230,000, for $195,000, resulting in a loss on sale of $35,000. The proceeds were in the form of receivables due in four equal amounts due in June and December 2021 and June and December 2022.
Financing Activities: Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1,059,000, which primarily related to proceeds received from our PPP loan.
On April 22, 2020, Company entered into the PPP Loan in the principal amount of $1,054,000, which was disbursed by Alerus Financial, N.A. (“Lender”). In accordance with the requirements of the CARES Act, the Company used the proceeds from the loan exclusively for qualified expenses under the PPP, including payroll costs, rent and utility costs. Subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, on January 29, 2021, the SBA approved our application for forgiveness of the full amount due, including accrued interest. Accordingly, for the quarter ending March 31, 2021, the principal amount plus accrued interest, which was $1,061,000 at December 31, 2020, will be eliminated with a gain on debt extinguishment included in other income.
We believe that based upon current business conditions and plans, our existing cash balance and future cash generated from operations will be sufficient for our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. During the preparation of these financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales, costs and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, impairment of long-lived assets, income taxes, and stock-based compensation expense. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The results of our analysis form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and the impact of such differences may be material to our financial statements.
We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements:
Revenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue from Insignia In-Store Signage Solutions ratably over the period of service, which is typically a two-to-four-week display cycle. Revenue from non-POPS solutions is recognized with a mix of over-time and point in time recognition dependent on type of service performed. Revenue that has been billed and not yet recognized is reflected as deferred revenue on the Company’s balance sheet.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. An allowance is established for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable. The Company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due, the Company’s previous loss history, the customer’s current ability to pay its obligation to the Company, the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole and other relevant facts and circumstances. Unexpected changes in the aforementioned factors could result in materially different amounts.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of its long-lived assets for impairment indicators. If indicators of impairment are present, we evaluate the carrying value of the assets in relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying assets to assess recoverability of the assets. The estimates of these future cash flows are based on assumptions and projections believed by management to be reasonable and supportable. They require management’s subjective judgments and take into account assumptions about revenue and expense growth rates. Impaired assets are then recorded at their estimated fair market value.
In 2011, we paid News America Marketing In-Store, L.L.C. (“News America”) $4,000,000 in exchange for a 10-year arrangement to sell signs with price into News America’s network of retailers as News America’s exclusive agent. The $4,000,000 was being amortized over the 10-year term of the arrangement. In 2019, we accelerated the amortization based on the anticipated recovery period over the remaining term of the contract due to the loss of a significant retailer. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, the impact of COVID-19 was determined to be a triggering event requiring an impairment review of long-lived assets. As of March 31, 2020, the Company determined the asset was impaired based upon continued revenue declines driven by changes in market conditions due to COVID-19 within the stores covered by the agreement. As a result, an impairment of $159,000 was recognized as of March 31, 2020. We also shortened the remaining useful life of the underlying asset from March 31, 2021 to December 31, 2020 and recorded remaining amortization expense on a straight-line basis over the remainder of 2020. Amortization expense without the impairment was $158,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The net carrying amount of the selling arrangement was recorded within other assets on the Company’s balance sheet as of December 31, 2019.
In 2019, the Company identified indicators of impairment due to the 2019 operating loss, cash flows used in operations and the excess of the book value of the Company compared to its market capitalization, which became a significant difference during the last two months of 2019. Due to these indicators of impairment, the Company completed an impairment analysis on its long-lived assets by first reviewing the expected undiscounted cash flows compared to the carrying value over the primary asset’s remaining useful life to determine if further impairment testing was required. The Company prepared an undiscounted cash flow analysis related to its selling agreement which is a separate asset group and as the undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying value, no further impairment testing was required. For the property and equipment asset group, the undiscounted cash flows were less than carrying value and therefore, a fair value assessment was required to determine the amount of the impairment. Due to the nature of the primary asset (internally developed software), the most readily available fair market value related to the asset is the market capitalization of the Company which is considered a level 1 measurement (quoted market price). After allocating the Company’s market capitalization to its working capital, there was no remaining value to allocate to long-lived assets which included the internally developed software recently placed in service. The Company utilized other level 3 inputs to determine the fair value of other tangible long-lived assets, including appraised values of production tooling, machinery and equipment. As a result, the Company recorded a long-lived asset impairment charge totaling $2,014,000 during the 4th quarter of 2019.
At December 31, 2020, the remaining balance of long-lived assets on the Company’s balance sheet was $75,000.
Income Taxes. Deferred income taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities given the provisions of enacted tax laws. Deferred income tax provisions and benefits are based on changes to the assets or liabilities from year to year. In providing for deferred taxes, the Company considers tax regulations of the jurisdictions in which it operates, estimates of future taxable income, and available tax planning strategies. If tax regulations, operating results or the ability to implement tax-planning strategies vary, adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities may be required. Valuation allowances are recorded related to deferred tax assets based on the “more likely than not” criteria.
The Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority.
Stock-Based Compensation Expense. The Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all stock-based payments at fair value. Restricted stock awards and restricted stock units are valued at the closing market price of the Company’s stock on the date of the grant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the weighted average fair value of options and employee stock purchase plan rights. The determination of fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as by assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. The expected terms of the options and employee stock purchase plan rights are based on evaluations of historical and expected future employee exercise behavior. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury rates at the date of grant with maturity dates approximately equal to the expected life at grant date. Volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company’s stock. The Company has not historically issued any dividends beyond the one-time dividends declared in 2011 and 2016 and does not expect to in the future. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of the grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from estimates.
If factors change and the Company employs different assumptions in the valuation of grants in future periods, the compensation expense that the Company records may differ significantly from what it has recorded in the current period.
New Accounting Pronouncements
There are no new accounting pronouncement that were effective for the year ended December 31, 2020 that had a significant impact on the Company and there are no new accounting pronouncements effective in the future that are expected to have a material impact in future years.
Off-Balance Sheet Transactions
None.
