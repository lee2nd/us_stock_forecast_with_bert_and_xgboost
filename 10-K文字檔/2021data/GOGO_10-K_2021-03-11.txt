Item 7.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. You should read this discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
On December 1, 2020, we completed the previously announced sale of our commercial aviation (“CA”) business to a subsidiary of Intelsat Jackson Holdings S.A. (“Intelsat”) for a purchase price of $400 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments (the “Transaction”). As a result, all periods presented in our consolidated financial statements and other portions of this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been conformed to present the CA business as discontinued operations.
The statements in this discussion regarding industry outlook, our expectations regarding our future performance, liquidity and capital resources and other non-historical statements in this discussion are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described under “Risk Factors” in this report. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements.
Our fiscal year ends December 31 and, unless otherwise noted, references to years or fiscal are for fiscal years ended December 31. See “- Results of Operations.”
Company Overview
Gogo is the world’s largest provider of broadband connectivity services for the business aviation market.

To accomplish our mission, we design, build and operate dedicated air-to-ground (“ATG”) networks, engineer, install and maintain in-flight systems of proprietary hardware and software, and deliver customizable connectivity and wireless entertainment services and global support capabilities to our aviation partners. Our services include satellite-based voice and data services made available through strategic partnerships with satellite providers.
Our chief operating decision maker evaluates performance and business results for our operations, and makes resource and operating decisions, on a consolidated basis. As such, we do not present segment information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant decline in international and domestic business aviation travel, which materially and adversely affected our business in 2020. Beginning in March 2020, our business saw a sharp decrease in flight activity, as well as an increase in requests for account suspensions and decreases in new plan activations. Though we continue to see strong signs of recovery from the lows we experienced in mid-April 2020, we expect COVID-19 to continue to negatively impact our business and we are unable to predict how long or with what degree of severity that impact will continue. The impact of the pandemic has varied across different parts of our customer base - for example corporate flight departments, charter operators and commercial aircraft (under the ATG Network Sharing Agreement) - and we expect the pace of recovery to vary by customer type also.
Factors and Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations
We believe that our operating and business performance is driven by various factors that affect the business aviation industry, including trends affecting the travel industry and trends affecting the customer bases that we target, as well as factors that affect wireless Internet service providers and general macroeconomic factors. Key factors that may affect our future performance include:
•
costs associated with the implementation of, and our ability to implement on a timely basis our technology roadmap, including upgrades to and installation of the ATG technologies we currently offer, Gogo 5G, and any other next generation or other new technology;
•
our ability to manage issues and related costs that may arise in connection with the implementation of our technology roadmap, including technological issues and related remediation efforts and failures or delays on the part of antenna and other equipment developers and providers, some of which are single source;
•
our ability to license additional spectrum and make other improvements to our network and operations as technology and user expectations change;
•
the number of aircraft in service in our markets, including consolidations or changes in fleet size by one or more of our large-fleet customers;
•
the economic environment and other trends that affect both business and leisure aviation travel, including the impact of COVID-19 on restrictions on and demand for air travel, as well as disruptions to supply chains and installations;
•
the extent of our customers’ adoption of our products and services, which is affected by, among other things, willingness to pay for the services that we provide, the quality and reliability of our products and services, changes in technology and competition from current competitors and new market entrants;
•
our ability to engage suppliers of equipment components and network services on a timely basis and on commercially reasonable terms;
•
changes in laws, regulations and interpretations affecting telecommunications services, including those affecting our ability to maintain our licenses for ATG spectrum in the United States, obtain sufficient rights to use additional ATG spectrum and/or other sources of broadband connectivity to deliver our services, expand our service offerings and manage our network; and
•
changes in laws, regulations and policies affecting our business or the business of our customers and suppliers, including changes that impact the design of our equipment and our ability to obtain required certifications for our equipment.
Key Business Metrics
Our management regularly reviews financial and operating metrics, including the following key operating metrics, to evaluate the performance of our business and our success in executing our business plan, make decisions regarding resource allocation and corporate strategies, and evaluate forward-looking projections.
•
ATG aircraft online. We define ATG aircraft online as the total number of business aircraft for which we provide ATG services as of the last day of each period presented. This number excludes aircraft receiving ATG service as part of the ATG Network Sharing Agreement with Intelsat.
•
Satellite aircraft online. We define satellite aircraft online as the total number of business aircraft for which we provide satellite services as of the last day of each period presented.
•
Average monthly connectivity service revenue per ATG aircraft online. We define average monthly connectivity service revenue per ATG aircraft online as the aggregate ATG connectivity service revenue for the period divided by the number of months in the period, divided by the number of ATG aircraft online during the period (expressed as an average of the month end figures for each month in such period). Revenue share earned from the ATG Network Sharing Agreement with Intelsat is excluded from this calculation.
•
Average monthly service revenue per satellite aircraft online. We define average monthly service revenue per satellite aircraft online as the aggregate satellite service revenue for the period divided by the number of months in the period, divided by the number of satellite aircraft online during the period (expressed as an average of the month end figures for each month in such period).
•
Units sold. We define units sold as the number of ATG or satellite units for which we recognized revenue during the period.
•
Average equipment revenue per ATG unit sold. We define average equipment revenue per ATG unit sold as the aggregate equipment revenue from all ATG units sold during the period, divided by the number of ATG units sold.
•
Average equipment revenue per satellite unit sold. We define average equipment revenue per satellite unit sold as the aggregate equipment revenue earned from all satellite units sold during the period, divided by the number of satellite units sold.
Key Components of Consolidated Statements of Operations
As a result of the Transaction, all periods presented in this Form 10-K have been conformed to present the CA business as a discontinued operation. We report the financial results of discontinued operations separately from continuing operations to distinguish the financial impact of disposal transactions from ongoing operations. The results of operations and cash flows of a discontinued operation are restated for all comparative periods presented. Refer to Note 2, “Discontinued Operations,” to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
The following briefly describes certain key components of revenue and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of operations.
Revenue:
We generate two types of revenue: service revenue and equipment revenue.
Service revenue primarily consists of monthly subscription and usage fees paid by aircraft owners and operators for telecommunication, data, and in-flight entertainment services. Service revenue is recognized as the services are provided to the customer. Beginning December 2020, service revenue includes revenue earned from the ATG Network Sharing Agreement with Intelsat.
Equipment revenue primarily consists of proceeds from the sale of ATG and satellite connectivity equipment and entertainment equipment. Equipment revenue is generally recognized when the equipment is shipped to OEMs and dealers.
Cost of Revenue:
Cost of service revenue consists of ATG network costs, satellite provider service costs, transaction costs and costs related to network operations.
Before closing the Transaction, we operated two divisions - business aviation (“BA”) and commercial aviation (“CA”). In January 2019, BA assumed responsibility for operating and maintaining our ATG network and was allocated the majority of the ATG network costs incurred in fiscal year 2019. In January 2020, we adopted a new allocation methodology for the ATG network costs utilizing pricing and usage for each of CA and BA. This allocation methodology has been applied retrospectively to prior periods presented as the CA business is reported in
discontinued operations. Since the completion of the Transaction, we ceased allocating ATG network costs to the divested CA business.
Cost of equipment revenue primarily consists of the costs of purchasing component parts used in the manufacture of our equipment and the production, installation, technical support and quality assurance costs associated with the equipment sales.
Engineering, Design and Development Expenses:
Engineering, design and development expenses include the costs incurred to design and develop our technologies and products and to obtain and maintain FAA and other regulatory certifications. This includes the design, development and integration of our ATG ground networks and airborne line replaceable units, the design and development of products and enhancements thereto, and program management activities. Engineering, design and development expenses also include costs associated with enhancements to existing products.
Sales and Marketing Expenses:
Sales and marketing expenses consist of costs associated with activities related to customer sales (including sales commissions), digital marketing and lead generation, advertising and promotions, product management, trade shows and customer service support for end users.
General and Administrative Expenses:
General and administrative expenses include personnel and related operating costs of the business support functions, including finance and accounting, legal, human resources, administrative, information technology, facilities and executive groups.
Depreciation and Amortization:
Depreciation expense includes expense associated with the depreciation of our network equipment, office equipment, furniture, fixtures and leasehold improvements, which is recorded over their estimated useful lives. Amortization expense includes the amortization of our finite-lived intangible assets on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to ten years depending on the assets being amortized.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related exposures. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In some instances, we could reasonably use different accounting estimates, and in some instances actual results could differ significantly from our estimates. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected.
We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and that they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates. For a discussion of our significant accounting policies to which many of these critical estimates relate, see Note 3, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to our consolidated financial statements.
We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, indefinite-lived intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates.
Note that these critical accounting policies and estimates relate solely to our continuing operations. The accounting policies related to our discontinued operations are discussed in Note 2, “Discontinued Operations,” to our consolidated financial statements.
Revenue Recognition:
We account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”). We determine revenue recognition through the following steps:
•
Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;
•
Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;
•
Determination of the transaction price;
•
Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
•
Recognition of revenue as we satisfy the performance obligations.
See Note 5, “Revenue Recognition,” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
We sell airborne telecommunications equipment to OEMs and dealers, who purchase the equipment based on their planned production or aftermarket sales, or in some cases based on specific orders made by aircraft owners and operators. These distribution partners resell the equipment and install the equipment for the aircraft owners and operators. Revenue for equipment sales to distribution partners is recognized upon shipment of equipment after an executed contract, purchase order or other documented agreement has been received and control of the equipment has transferred.
We also provide connectivity, entertainment and voice services to the owners and operators of business aircraft for a monthly subscription fee or a usage-based fee. These services are typically contracted for a one-year period and automatically renew unless cancelled at the end of the service period. Revenue is recognized on a monthly basis as services are provided.
In all cases, we evaluate whether a contract exists as it relates to collectability of the contract. Once a contract is deemed to exist, we evaluate the transaction price and deliverables under the contract.
A limited number of contracts contain multiple equipment and service deliverables. For these contracts, we account for each distinct good or service as a separate performance obligation. We allocate the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation using the relative standalone selling price, which is based on the actual selling price for any good or service sold separately to a similar class of customer.
Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets:
We account for our indefinite-lived intangible assets in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 350-40, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350-40”).
Our indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of our FCC spectrum licenses. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever events indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. We perform our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. We assess qualitative factors to determine the likelihood of impairment. Our qualitative analysis includes, but is not limited to, assessing the changes in macroeconomic conditions, regulatory environment, industry and market conditions or events, such as COVID-19, financial performance versus budget and any other events or circumstances specific to the FCC licenses. If it is more likely than not that the fair value of the
FCC spectrum licenses is greater than the carrying value, no further testing is required. Otherwise, we apply the quantitative impairment test method. We determined that the income approach, utilizing the Greenfield method, is the most appropriate way to value our indefinite-lived assets.
For the Greenfield method we estimate the value of our FCC spectrum licenses by calculating the present value of the cash flows of a hypothetical new market participant whose only assets are such licenses to determine the fair value of the FCC licenses. It includes all necessary costs and expenses to build the company’s infrastructure during the start-up period, projected revenue, and cash flows once the infrastructure is completed. Since there is limited corroborating data available in the marketplace that would demonstrate a market participant’s experience in establishing an “air-to-ground” business, we utilize our historic results and future projections as the underlying basis for the application of the Greenfield method. We follow the traditional discounted cash flow method, calculating the present value of a new market participant’s estimated debt free cash flows, based on our historical weighted average cost of capital adjusted to reflect the cost of capital for a new market participant.
Our impairment calculations contain uncertainties, including the impact of COVID-19, because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future projected cash flows and estimated growth rates and discount rates, as well as new market participant assumptions. Estimates of future projected cash flows used in connection with the discounted cash flow analysis were consistent with the plans and estimates that we used to manage the business, including estimates of the impact of COVID-19, although there was inherent uncertainty in these estimates.
Our annual assessment as of October 1, 2020 indicated no impairment. We are continuously monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact. If the negative impact of the pandemic exceeds management’s estimates, we could incur material impairment charges in future periods.
See Note 8, “Intangible Assets,” to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
Stock-Based Compensation Expense:
We account for stock-based compensation expense in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 708, Compensation-Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”).
We account for stock-based compensation expense based on the grant date fair value of the award for awards deemed to be equity awards. For awards deemed to be liability awards, we recognize stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award at each reporting date. We recognize this cost as an expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the estimated fair value of stock options. Critical inputs into the Black-Scholes option-pricing model include: the annualized volatility of our common stock; the expected term of the option in years; the grant date fair value of our common stock; the option exercise price; the risk-free interest rate; and the annual rate of quarterly dividends on the stock, which are estimated as follows:
•
Volatility. Beginning in 2020, we calculated volatility based exclusively on our own common stock. In prior years, we had not been a public company long enough to calculate volatility based exclusively on our own common stock, and thus calculated the expected volatility as of each grant date based on a weighting of our own common stock and reported data for a peer group of publicly traded companies for which historical information was available.
•
Expected Term. The expected term of the stock options is determined based upon the simplified approach, allowed under SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110, which assumes that the stock options will be exercised evenly from vesting to expiration, as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. As we obtain data associated with future exercises, the expected term of future grants will be adjusted accordingly.
•
Fair Value of Our Common Stock. The fair value of our common stock underlying the stock options and other stock-based awards was valued by reference to the publicly traded closing price of our common stock on the grant date.
•
Option Exercise Price. The option exercise price was determined based on the publicly traded closing price of our common stock on the date of grant.
•
Risk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected term of the options for each option group.
•
Dividend Yield. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we use an expected dividend yield of zero.
If any of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model changes significantly, stock-based compensation expense for future awards may differ materially from the expense recognized for awards previously granted. The inputs that create the most sensitivity in our option valuation are the volatility and expected term.
See Note 14, “Stock-Based Compensation,” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Results of Operations
The following table sets forth, for the periods presented, certain data from our consolidated statements of operations. The information contained in the table below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes.
Consolidated Statements of Operations Data
(in thousands)
Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Revenue:
Revenue and percent change for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows (in thousands, except for percent change):
Revenue decreased to $269.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared with $309.0 million for the prior year, due to decreases in service and equipment revenue.
Service revenue decreased to $212.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared with $221.9 million for the prior year, primarily due to ATG deactivations and suspensions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Average monthly service revenue per ATG unit online decreased to $2,951 during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared with $3,113 for the prior year.
Equipment revenue decreased to $57.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared with $87.1 million for the prior year, primarily due to decreases in the number of ATG and satellite units sold related to the COVID-19 pandemic. 667 ATG units were sold during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared with 909 units for the prior year.
We expect service and equipment revenue to increase in the future as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic dissipates and additional ATG aircraft come online.
Cost of Revenue:
Cost of service revenue and percent change for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows (in thousands, except for percent change):
Cost of service revenue increased to $45.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared with $42.1 million for the prior year, primarily due to an increase in allocated ATG network costs. Following the completion of the Transaction, ATG network costs are no longer shared with the divested CA business.
We expect cost of service revenue to increase over time, primarily due to service revenue growth and increasing ATG network costs associated with Gogo 5G.
Cost of equipment revenue decreased to $39.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared with $51.7 million for the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in equipment revenue.
We expect that our cost of equipment revenue will vary with changes in equipment revenue and unit sold.
Engineering, Design and Development Expenses:
Engineering, design and development expenses decreased to $25.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared with $26.0 million for the prior year, due to a decrease in personnel, travel costs and miscellaneous other costs resulting from cost controls implemented by management, primarily in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.
We expect engineering, design and development expenses to remain flat or increase slightly as a percentage of service revenue in the near term, driven by Gogo 5G development costs, and decrease as a percentage of service revenue over the long term as the level of investment decreases and revenue increases.
Sales and Marketing Expenses:
Sales and marketing expenses decreased to $15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared with $21.2 million for the prior year, primarily due to decreased personnel and advertising expenses and cost controls implemented by management in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.
We expect sales and marketing expenses to remain relatively flat as a percentage of service revenue.
General and Administrative Expenses:
General and administrative expenses decreased slightly to $54.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared with $54.6 million for the prior year.
We expect general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of service revenue over time as we identify efficiencies and drive down costs and as the business grows given the fixed cost nature of this category.
Depreciation and Amortization:
Depreciation and amortization expense decreased to $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared with $16.7 million for the prior year, primarily due to certain ATG network assets becoming fully depreciated.
We expect that our depreciation and amortization expense will increase in the future as we launch our Gogo 5G network.
Other (Income) Expense:
Other (income) expense and percent change for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows (in thousands, except for percent change):
Total other expense decreased to $125.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared with $184.5 million for the prior year, primarily due to the loss on extinguishment of debt that occurred in 2019.
Absent a debt refinancing in 2021, we expect our interest expense to increase due to the higher average debt outstanding resulting from the issuance of the 2020 Additional Notes in November 2020. See Note 9, “Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Income Taxes:
The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 0.3%, as compared with (0.6%) for the prior year. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was not significant primarily due to the recording of a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets.
We expect our income tax provision to increase in future periods to the extent we become profitable.
Discontinued Operations:
Loss from discontinued operations increased to $201.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared with a loss of $57.5 million for the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in revenue and $47.4 million of charges related to the impairment of long-lived assets, partially offset by the $38.0 million gain on sale of discontinued operations.
Revenue decreased 55.7% as compared with the prior year, primarily as a result of the negative impact of COVID-19 on commercial air travel. Additionally, results for the year ended December 31, 2020 included charges of $47.4 million and $10.7 million related to the impairment of long-lived assets and provisions for expected credit losses, respectively, while no such charges were incurred in the prior year. These changes were partially offset by declines in cost of service revenue, cost of equipment revenue, engineering, design and development expenses and general and administrative expenses, primarily due to the cost control measures implemented in 2020 in response to the impact of COVID-19 on the CA business.
Upon the closing of the Transaction on December 1, 2020, we received initial gross proceeds of $386.3 million, which reflects the $400.0 million purchase price, adjusted for cash, debt, transaction expenses and working
capital. The final purchase price remains subject to change due to customary post-closing purchase price adjustment procedures set forth in the purchase and sale agreement between Gogo and Intelsat, that are not yet complete. In February 2021, Intelsat delivered a draft closing statement that would reduce the working capital portion of the purchase price computation by $9.4 million, which would result in Gogo returning to Intelsat $9.4 million of the initial gross proceeds. Gogo is reviewing Intelsat’s draft closing statement in accordance with the terms of the purchase and sale agreement. As this post-closing purchase price adjustment is not yet finalized and therefore represents a contingent gain, $9.4 million has been recorded as a deferred gain on sale included within Accrued liabilities. As a result, we have recognized within Other (income) expense a pretax gain on sale of $38.0 million, computed as the $386.3 million of initial gross proceeds less (i) the potential $9.4 million post-closing purchase price adjustment, (ii) the carrying value of the assets and liabilities transferred in the Transaction and (iii) Transaction-related costs.
See Note 2, “Discontinued Operations,” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018
Revenue:
Revenue and percent change for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in thousands, except for percent change):
Revenue increased to $309.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $290.2 million for the prior year, due to an increase in service revenue offset in part by a decrease in equipment revenue.
Service revenue increased to $221.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $196.4 million for the prior year, primarily due to more customers subscribing to our ATG service. The number of ATG aircraft online increased 8.5% to 5,669 as of December 31, 2019, as compared with 5,224 as of December 31, 2018. Average monthly service revenue per ATG unit online increased to $3,113 during the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $3,027 for the prior year.
Equipment revenue decreased to $87.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $93.8 million for the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in sales of ATG equipment.
Cost of Revenue:
Cost of service revenue and percent change for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in thousands, except for percent change):
Cost of service revenue increased to $42.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $37.1 million for the prior year, primarily due to a Federal Universal Service fund charge.
Cost of equipment revenue decreased to $51.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $55.4 million for the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in equipment revenue.
Engineering, Design and Development Expenses:
Engineering, design and development expenses increased to $26.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $18.5 million for the prior year, due to the incurrence of 5G development costs in 2019.
Sales and Marketing Expenses:
Sales and marketing expenses decreased to $21.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $24.4 million for the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in personnel-related expenses.
General and Administrative Expenses:
General and administrative expenses decreased to $54.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $57.9 million for the prior year, primarily due to decreases in legal and personnel-related expenses.
Depreciation and Amortization:
Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $14.4 million for the prior year, primarily due to an increase in amortization of capitalized software.
Other (Income) Expense:
Other (income) expense and percent change for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in thousands, except for percent change):
Total other expense was $184.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $138.2 million for the prior year, due to a larger loss on extinguishment of debt and increased interest expense due to higher average debt levels outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the prior year. See Note 9, “Long Term Debt and Other Liabilities,” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the loss on extinguishment of debt. See Note 10, “Interest Costs,” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our interest expense.
Income Taxes:
The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 was (0.6%), as compared with 6.0% for the prior year. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was not significant primarily due to the recording of a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets.
Discontinued Operations:
Loss from discontinued operations decreased to $57.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with a loss of $109.6 million for the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in revenue of $76.9 million, more than offset by a $126.4 million reduction in operating expenses.
Revenue decreased 12.7% as compared with the prior year, driven by a decline in equipment revenue due to fewer installations of CA equipment on airline partners’ aircraft and the transition of one airline to a different business model in January 2018 that increased equipment revenue by $45.4 million for the year-ended December 31, 2018. The reduction in operating expenses was driven by a reduction in cost of equipment revenue related to the reduced equipment revenue discussed above, as well as decreased engineering, design and development expenses related to programs and personnel, and decreased sales and marketing expenses related to personnel.
See Note 2, “Discontinued Operations,” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Non-GAAP Measures
In our discussion below, we discuss Adjusted EBITDA, as defined below, which is a non-GAAP financial measurement. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA for business planning purposes, including managing our business and measuring our performance against internally projected results of operations. This supplemental performance measure also provides another basis for comparing period-to-period results by excluding potential differences caused by non-operational and unusual or non-recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA may vary from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP; when analyzing our performance with Adjusted EBITDA, investors should (i) evaluate each adjustment in our reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measure, and the explanatory footnotes regarding those adjustments, and (ii) use Adjusted EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative to, net loss attributable to common stock as a measure of operating results.
Definition and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures
EBITDA represents net loss attributable to common stock before interest expense, interest income, income taxes and depreciation and amortization expense.
Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for (i) stock-based compensation expense included in the results of continuing operations, (ii) the results of discontinued operations, including stock-based compensation expense and the gain on the sale of CA, and (iii) loss on extinguishment of debt. Our management believes that the use of Adjusted EBITDA eliminates items that management believes have less bearing on our operating performance, thereby highlighting trends in our core business which may not otherwise be apparent. It also provides an assessment of controllable expenses, which are indicators management uses to determine whether current spending decisions need to be adjusted in order to meet financial goals and achieve optimal financial performance.
We believe that the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense from Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate given the significant variation in expense that can result from using the Black-Scholes model to determine the fair value of such compensation. The fair value of our stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes model and varies based on fluctuations in the assumptions used in this model, including inputs that are not necessarily directly related to the performance of our business, such as the expected volatility, the risk-free interest rate and the expected term of the options. Therefore, we believe that the exclusion of this cost provides a clearer view of the operating performance of our business. Further, stock option grants made at a certain price and point in time do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time. While we believe that investors should have information about any dilutive effect of outstanding options and the cost of that compensation, we also believe that stockholders should have the ability to consider our performance using a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes these costs and that management uses to evaluate our business.
We believe it is useful for an understanding of our operating performance to exclude the results of our discontinued operations because they are not part of our ongoing operations.
We believe it is useful for an understanding of our operating performance to exclude the loss on extinguishment of debt from Adjusted EBITDA because of the non-recurring nature of this activity.
We also present Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure because we believe that this measure provides investors, securities analysts and other users of our financial statements with important supplemental information with which to evaluate our performance and to enable them to assess our performance on the same basis as management.

Material limitations of Non-GAAP measures
Although EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are measurements frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA each have limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for, or more meaningful than, amounts determined in accordance with GAAP.
Some of these limitations include:
•
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect interest income or expense;
•
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect cash requirements for our income taxes;
•
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect depreciation and amortization, which are significant and unavoidable operating costs given the level of capital expenditures needed to maintain our business;
•
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect non-cash components of employee compensation;
•
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the results of discontinued operations;
•
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the loss on extinguishment of debt, which was significant in certain periods; and
•
since other companies in our or related industries may calculate these measures differently from the way we do, their usefulness as comparative measures may be limited.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We have historically financed our growth and cash needs primarily through the issuance of common stock, non-convertible debt, senior convertible preferred stock, convertible debt, term facilities and cash from operating
activities. We continually evaluate our ongoing capital needs in light of increasing demand for our services, capacity requirements, evolving user expectations regarding the in-flight connectivity experience, evolving technologies in our industry and related strategic, operational and technological opportunities. We actively consider opportunities to raise additional capital in the public and private markets utilizing one or more of the types of capital raising transactions through which we have historically financed our growth and cash needs, as well as other means of capital raising not previously used by us.
We are also currently considering undertaking a comprehensive refinancing of our existing indebtedness in the near-term in order to better align our capital structure with our business, following consummation of the Transaction, and reduce our annual interest expense. Such financing activity may take the form of one or more forms of indebtedness, including, but not limited to, secured or unsecured bonds, term loans and revolving credit facilities. Our ability to execute on any financing transaction will depend upon our future operating performance, the availability of credit generally, economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.
See the disclosure below under the heading “Debt Instruments” for the definitions of the debt and convertible debt instruments to which we refer in this section, as well as the indentures and other agreements that govern them.
As detailed in Note 9, “Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities,” in April 2019 and May 2019, we entered into financing transactions that extended the maturity of our senior secured indebtedness to 2024 and generated funds sufficient to repay, repurchase or retire our 2020 Convertible Notes (all of which we have repurchased). In August 2019, we entered into the ABL Credit Facility, which provides for a revolving line of credit of up to $30.0 million, subject to borrowing base availability, and includes letter of credit and swingline sub-facilities. The ABL Credit Agreement provides that the revolving line of credit may be increased by up to an additional $30.0 million under certain circumstances. Since March 2020, in order to enhance our liquidity in response to the uncertainty in the global markets resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we have made certain drawings and repayments under the revolving ABL Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2020, no amounts were outstanding under the ABL Credit Facility and $21.9 million remained available for borrowing under the terms of the agreement that would allow for the company to meet the “payment conditions” criteria as described in the agreement. Our intent is to continue to access the capital markets to refinance our future debt obligations on an as-needed basis.
Excluding the impact of our IPO, our prior credit facility, the 2022 Convertible Notes, the 2020 Convertible Notes, the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, the 2022 Senior Secured Notes and the ABL Credit Facility, to date we have not generated positive cash flows. Additionally, as disclosed elsewhere in this report, the extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business and our financial and operational performance will depend on future developments, including the duration, spread and severity of the outbreak, the timetable for administering and efficacy of vaccines, the duration and geographic scope of related travel advisories and restrictions and the extent of the impact of COVID-19 on overall demand for commercial and business aviation travel, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. If the recent recovery observed in the BA business does not continue, our liquidity and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. See “Risk Factors─Risks Related to our Business─The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures implemented to combat it have had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business.”
As of December 31, 2020, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $435.3 million. Based on our current plans, including the measures taken in our response to COVID-19 and the proceeds received in connection with the closing of the Transaction, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents and cash flows provided by operating activities and access to the ABL credit facility will be sufficient to meet our operating obligations, including our capital expenditure requirements, for the next twelve months.
The 2024 Indenture and the ABL Credit Agreement contain covenants that limit the ability of GIH and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness. Further, market conditions and/or our financial performance may limit our access to additional sources of equity or debt financing, or our ability to pursue potential strategic alternatives. As a result, we may be unable to finance the growth of our business to the extent that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and cash generated through operating activities prove insufficient or we are unable to raise additional financing through the issuance of additional equity, permitted incurrences of debt by us or by GIH and its subsidiaries, or the pursuit of potential strategic alternatives.
Cash Flows
The following table presents a summary of our cash flow activity for the periods set forth below (in thousands):
Following is a discussion of the year-over-year changes in cash flow activities.
Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities from continuing operations:
The following table presents a summary of our cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations for the periods set forth below (in thousands):
For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $4.5 million, as compared with cash used in operating activities from continuing operations of $12.9 million for the prior year. The principal contributors to the increase in operating cash flows were:
•
A $38.7 million increase in cash flows related to operating assets and liabilities resulting from:
o
An increase in cash flows primarily due to the following:
▪
Changes in accrued interest due to changes in the timing of payments as compared to the prior year;
▪
Changes in accounts receivable due primarily to the timing of collections and a decrease in revenue as a result of COVID-19; and
▪
Changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due primarily to the timing of payments.
o
Partial offsets to the above due to a decrease in cash flows resulting from changes in contract assets primarily due to additional promotional sales programs in the current year as compared to the prior year.
•
Partially offset by a $21.3 million change in net loss and non-cash charges and credits, as noted above under “-Results of Operations.”
For the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities from continuing operations was $12.9 million, as compared with cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations of $1.9 million for the prior year. The principal contributors to the decrease in operating cash flows were:
•
A $21.4 million decrease in cash flows related to changes in operating assets and liabilities resulting from:
o
A decrease in cash flows due to the following:
▪
Changes in accrued interest due to the timing of payments as compared to the prior year; and
▪
Changes in accounts receivable primarily due to the timing of collections.
o
Partial offsets to the above due to increases in cash flows resulting from changes in inventories primarily due to decreased equipment purchases and an increase in equipment revenue during 2019 as compared with 2018.
•
Partially offset by a $6.6 million change in net loss and non-cash charges and credits, primarily due to an increased net loss in 2019 as compared to 2018 driven by an increase in loss on extinguishment of debt, as noted above under “-Results of Operations.”
Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities from continuing operations:
Cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, while cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations was $32.9 million and $162.8 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Investing activities are comprised of capital expenditures related to software development, data center upgrades and cell site construction. Additionally, cash used in investing activities from continuing operations includes net changes in our short-term investments consisting of a cash inflow of $39.3 million and $173.5 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.
Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities from continuing operations:
Cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $44.5 million, primarily due to the $51.8 million of proceeds from the issuance of 2020 Additional Notes, offset by the repurchase of convertible notes, payments on finance leases and stock-based compensation activity.
Cash used in financing activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $2.8 million, primarily due to the redemption of our outstanding 2022 Senior Secured Notes (including the make-whole premium payable under the indenture governing the 2022 Senior Secured Notes) for a redemption price totaling $741.4 million, the repurchase of $159.5 million of outstanding 2020 Convertible Notes and the payment of $23.0 million of deferred financing costs associated with the issuance of the Initial Notes and the 2019 Additional Notes, offset in part by $920.7 million of gross proceeds from the issuance of the Initial Notes and the 2019 Additional Notes.
Cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $29.7 million, primarily due to the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes with gross proceeds of $237.8 million, offset in part by $200.4 million of payments to repurchase 2020 Convertible Notes (comprised of $199.9 million of outstanding principal and $0.5 million of fees) and $8.1 million of debt issuance costs.
Net cash provided by (used in) discontinued operations:
Cash provided by discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $220.1 million as compared to cash used by discontinued operations of $30.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $250.4 million change was primarily due to a $464.0 million increase in cash provided by investing activities offset by a $214.1 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities. The increase in cash provided by investing activities was due to the $386.3 million of proceeds received in the Transaction and a $79.9 million decrease in capital expenditures due to the impact of COVID-19 on the installation of CA equipment on airline partners’ aircraft. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities was due to a $133.1 million increase in net loss and non-cash charges and credits, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19, and an $81.0 million decrease in cash flows related to operating assets and liabilities primarily due to changes in accounts receivable, inventory, deferred lease proceeds and accrued liabilities, offset in part by changes in accounts payable and contract assets.
Cash used by discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $30.3 million as compared to cash used by discontinued operations of $207.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $177.3 million change was primarily due to a $161.1 million increase in cash provided by operating activities and a $14.5 million increase in cash provided by investing activities. The increase in cash flows from operating activities was due to a $105.2 million increase in cash flows related to changes in operating assets and liabilities, resulting primarily from changes in inventory and accounts receivable, and a $56.0 million decrease in net loss and non-cash charges and credits, as noted above under “-Results of Operations.” The increase in cash provided by investing activities was due to a decrease in capital expenditures for the installation of CA equipment on airline partners’ aircraft.
Capital Expenditures
Our business requires significant capital expenditures, primarily for technology development, equipment and capacity expansion. For the periods presented in this report, capital expenditures for our former CA business, presented as discontinued operations, included the significant purchase of airborne equipment related to the roll out and/or upgrade of service to our former airline partners’ fleets. Capital spending for continuing operations for the periods presented in this report is associated with the expansion of our ATG network and data centers. We capitalized software development costs related to network technology solutions and new product/service offerings. We also capitalized costs related to the build-out of our office locations.
Capital expenditures for our continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $9.0 million and $6.5 million, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures in 2020 as compared with 2019 was primarily due to an increase in capitalized software.
We expect that our capital expenditures for our continuing operations will vary in the future depending on the timing of network-related capital expenditures as we build out Gogo 5G and further invest in capitalized software.
Capital expenditures for our continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $6.5 million and $10.6 million, respectively. The decrease in capital expenditures in 2019 as compared with 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in capitalized software.
Debt Instruments
Following is a discussion of the debt instruments we had in place as of December 31, 2020 and which we utilized during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
2024 Senior Secured Notes
On April 25, 2019 (the “Issue Date”), Gogo Intermediate Holdings LLC (“GIH”) (a wholly owned subsidiary of Gogo Inc.) and Gogo Finance Co. Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of GIH) (“Gogo Finance” and, together with GIH, the “Issuers”) issued $905 million aggregate principal amount of 9.875% senior secured notes due 2024 (the “Initial Notes”) under an indenture (the “Base Indenture”), dated as of April 25, 2019, among the Issuers, us, as guarantor, certain subsidiaries of GIH, as guarantors (the “Initial 2024 Subsidiary Guarantors” and, together with us,
the “Initial 2024 Guarantors”), and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”) and collateral agent (the “Collateral Agent”). On May 3, 2019, the Issuers, the Initial 2024 Guarantors and the Trustee entered into the first supplemental indenture (the “First Supplemental Indenture”) to increase the amount of indebtedness that may be incurred under Credit Facilities (as defined in the 2024 Indenture) by GIH or its subsidiaries that are 2024 Guarantors (as defined below) by $20 million in aggregate principal amount. On March 6, 2020, the Issuers, the Initial 2024 Guarantors, Gogo Air International GmbH (an indirect subsidiary of GIH) (“Gogo International”) and the Trustee entered into a second supplemental indenture (the “Second Supplemental Indenture”) to add Gogo International as a guarantor under the 2024 Indenture. On July 31, 2020, the Issuers, the Initial 2024 Guarantors, Gogo International and Gogo Inflight Internet Canada Ltd., Gogo ATG LLC and Gogo CA Licenses LLC (collectively, the “Additional Guarantors” and, together with the Initial 2024 Guarantors and Gogo International, the “2024 Guarantors”) and the Trustee entered into a third supplemental indenture (the “Third Supplemental Indenture”) to add the Additional Guarantors as guarantors under the 2024 Indenture. On November 9, 2020, the Company, the Issuers, the 2024 Guarantors and the Trustee entered into a fourth supplemental indenture (together with the Base Indenture, the First Supplemental Indenture, the Second Supplemental Indenture and the Third Supplemental Indenture, the “2024 Indenture”) to increase the amount of indebtedness under the Credit Facilities (as defined in the Base Indenture) that may be incurred by the Issuers or the Subsidiary Guarantors (as defined in the Base Indenture) by $50 million in aggregate principal amount.
On May 7, 2019, the Issuers issued an additional $20 million aggregate principal amount of 9.875% senior secured notes due 2024 (the “2019 Additional Notes”). On November 13, 2020, the Issuers issued an additional $50 million aggregate principal amount of 2024 Senior Secured Notes (the “2020 Additional Notes” and, together with the Initial Notes and the 2019 Additional Notes, the “2024 Senior Secured Notes”). The 2024 Senior Secured Notes were offered and sole in transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act. The Initial Notes were issued at a price equal to 99.512% of their face value, the 2019 Additional Notes were issued at a price equal to 100.5% of their face value, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of $920.7 million and the 2020 Additional Notes were issued at a price equal to 103.5% of their face value, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of $51.8 million. Additionally, we received approximately $0.1 million for interest that accrued from April 25, 2019 through May 7, 2019 with respect to the 2019 Additional Notes that was included in our interest payment on November 1, 2019.
The 2024 Senior Secured Notes are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by Gogo Inc. and all of GIH’s existing and future restricted subsidiaries (other than Gogo Finance), subject to certain exceptions. The 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the related guarantees are secured by second-priority liens on the ABL Priority Collateral (as defined below) and by first-priority liens on the Cash Flow Priority Collateral (as defined below), including pledged equity interests of the Issuers and all of GIH’s existing and future restricted subsidiaries guaranteeing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, except for certain excluded assets and subject to permitted liens. Upon the closing of the Transaction, certain subsidiaries were released from their guarantees under the 2024 Indenture, and certain of the ABL Priority Collateral and Cash Flow Priority Collateral were released.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the outstanding principal amount of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes was $975 million and $925 million, respectively, the unaccreted debt discount was $1.5 million and $3.9 million, respectively, and the net carrying amount was $973.5 million and $921.1 million, respectively.
We used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the Initial Notes and the 2019 Additional Notes to fund the redemption of all the outstanding 2022 Senior Secured Notes (as defined below) and to repurchase $159 million aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Convertible Notes (as defined below).
The 2024 Senior Secured Notes will mature on May 1, 2024. The 2024 Senior Secured Notes bear interest at a rate of 9.875% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on November 1, 2019.
We paid approximately $22.6 million of origination fees and financing costs related to the issuance of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, which have been accounted for as deferred financing costs. The deferred financing costs on our consolidated balance sheet are being amortized over the contractual term of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes using the effective interest method. Total amortization expense was $3.7 million and $2.3 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Amortization expense is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the balance of unamortized deferred
financing costs related to the 2024 Senior Secured Notes was $16.6 million and $19.7 million, respectively, and is included as a reduction to long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 10, “Interest Costs,” for additional information.
The 2024 Senior Secured Notes are the senior secured indebtedness of the Issuers and are:
•
effectively senior to (i) all of the Issuers’ existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and (ii) the Issuers’ indebtedness secured on a junior priority basis by the same collateral securing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes to the extent of the value of such collateral, including the obligations under the ABL Credit Facility (as defined below) to the extent of the value of the Cash Flow Priority Collateral;
•
effectively equal in right of payment with the Issuers’ existing and future (i) unsecured indebtedness that is not subordinated in right of payment to the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and (ii) indebtedness secured on a junior priority basis by the same collateral securing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, if any, in each case to the extent of any insufficiency in the collateral securing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes;
•
structurally senior to all of our existing and future indebtedness, including our 2022 Convertible Notes and 2020 Convertible Notes (each as defined below);
•
senior in right of payment to any and all of the Issuers’ future indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to the 2024 Senior Secured Notes;
•
structurally subordinated to all of the indebtedness and other liabilities of any non-2024 Guarantors (other than the Issuers); and
•
effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future indebtedness secured on a senior priority basis by the same collateral securing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes to the extent of the value of such collateral, including the obligations under the ABL Credit Facility to the extent of the value of ABL Priority Collateral.
Each guarantee is a senior secured obligation of such 2024 Guarantor and is:
•
effectively senior in right of payment to all existing and future (i) senior unsecured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such guarantee owned by such 2024 Guarantor and (ii) indebtedness secured on a junior priority basis by the same collateral securing the guarantee owned by such 2024 Guarantor to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the guarantee, including the obligations under the ABL Credit Facility to the extent of the value of the Cash Flow Priority Collateral;
•
effectively equal in right of payment with all existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness and indebtedness secured on a junior priority basis by the same collateral securing the guarantee owned by such 2024 Guarantor, if any, in each case to the extent of any insufficiency in the collateral securing such guarantee;
•
effectively subordinated to the obligations under the ABL Credit Facility of each 2024 Guarantor to the extent of the value of the ABL Priority Collateral owned by such 2024 Guarantor;
•
effectively senior in right of payment to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness, if any, of such 2024 Guarantor; and structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of any non-2024 Guarantor subsidiary.
The security interests in certain collateral may be released without the consent of holders of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes if such collateral is disposed of in a transaction that complies with the 2024 Indenture and related security agreements, and if any grantor of such security interests is released from its obligations with respect to the 2024 Senior Secured Notes in accordance with the applicable provisions of the 2024 Indenture and related security agreements. Under certain circumstances, GIH and the 2024 Guarantors have the right to transfer certain intellectual property assets that on the Issue Date constitute collateral securing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes or the guarantees to a restricted subsidiary organized under the laws of Switzerland, resulting in the release of such collateral. In addition, the 2024 Indenture permits indebtedness incurred under the ABL Credit Facility to be secured on a first-priority basis by certain of the same collateral that secures the 2024 Senior Secured Notes.
The Issuers may redeem the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to May 1, 2021, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes redeemed plus the make-whole premium set forth in the 2024 Indenture as of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the applicable redemption date.
On or after May 1, 2021, the 2024 Senior Secured Notes will be redeemable at the following redemption prices (expressed in percentages of principal amount), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant regular record date on or prior to the redemption date to receive interest due on an interest payment date), if redeemed during the twelve-month period commencing on May 1 of the following years:
In addition, at any time prior to May 1, 2021, the Issuers may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of 109.875% of the principal amount redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the date of redemption; provided, however, that 2024 Senior Secured Notes representing at least 50% of the principal amount of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes remain outstanding immediately after each such redemption.
The 2024 Indenture contains covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Issuers and the 2024 Subsidiary Guarantors and, in certain circumstances, our ability, to: incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions; make investments; create restrictions on the ability of GIH’s restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Issuers or make other intercompany transfers; create liens; transfer or sell assets; merge or consolidate; and enter into certain transactions with the Issuers’ affiliates.
The 2024 Indenture also provides that if we complete certain sales or transfers of assets, we are required to apply the Net Cash Proceeds (as defined in the Base Indenture) generated therefrom within 365 days to either permanently repay indebtedness, in accordance with the terms of the 2024 Indenture, or invest in property or non-current assets of a nature or type used in our, or a similar or related, business. If we do not so apply the Net Cash Proceeds from the Transaction by December 1, 2021, GIH will be required to make an offer to repurchase for cash an aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes equal to any Net Cash Proceeds not so applied as of such date, at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the payment date. As a result, we have classified $341 million of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes as short-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2020, representing the amount of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes potentially to be repurchased with the Net Cash Proceeds.
Most of these covenants, including the covenant related to the application of Net Cash Proceeds from certain sales or transfers of assets, will cease to apply if, and for as long as, the 2024 Senior Secured Notes have investment grade ratings from both Moody’s Investment Services, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s. If we or the Issuers undergo specific types of change of control accompanied by a downgrade in the rating of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes prior to May 1, 2024, GIH is required to make an offer to repurchase for cash all of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes at a repurchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the payment date. The 2024 Indenture provides for events of default, which, if any of them occur, would permit or require the principal, premium, if any, and interest on all of the then outstanding 2024 Senior Secured Notes issued under the 2024 Indenture to be due and payable immediately. As of December 31, 2020, no event of default had occurred.
ABL Credit Facility
On August 26, 2019, Gogo Inc., GIH and Gogo Finance (together GIH and Gogo Finance are referred to as the “Borrowers”) entered into a credit agreement (the “ABL Credit Agreement”) among the Borrowers, the other
loan parties party thereto, the lenders party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the “Administrative Agent”), and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as syndication agent, which provides for an asset-based revolving credit facility (the “ABL Credit Facility”) of up to $30 million, subject to borrowing base availability, and includes letter of credit and swingline sub-facilities.
Borrowing availability under the ABL Credit Facility is determined by a monthly borrowing base collateral calculation that is based on specified percentages of the value of eligible accounts receivable (including eligible unbilled accounts receivable) and eligible credit card receivables, less certain reserves and subject to certain other adjustments as set forth in the ABL Credit Agreement. Availability is reduced by issuance of letters of credit as well as any borrowings. As of December 31, 2020, the facility was undrawn and $21.9 million remained available for borrowing under the terms of the agreement that would allow for the company to meet the “payment conditions” criteria as described in our ABL Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2019, the facility was undrawn.
The final maturity of the ABL Credit Facility is August 26, 2022, unless the aggregate outstanding principal amount of our 2022 Convertible Notes (as defined below) has not, on or prior to December 15, 2021, been repaid in full or refinanced with a new maturity date no earlier than February 26, 2023, in which case the final maturity date shall instead be December 16, 2021.
Loans outstanding under the ABL Credit Facility bear interest at a floating rate measured by reference to, at the Borrowers’ option, either (i) an adjusted London inter-bank offered rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.50% to 2.00% per annum depending on a fixed charge coverage ratio, or (ii) an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.50% to 1.00% per annum depending on a fixed charge coverage ratio. Unused commitments under the ABL Credit Facility are subject to a per annum fee ranging from 0.25% to 0.375% depending on the average quarterly usage of the revolving commitments.
The obligations under the ABL Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Gogo Inc. and all of its existing and future subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions (collectively, the “ABL Guarantors”), and such obligations and the obligations of the ABL Guarantors are secured on a (i) senior basis by a perfected security interest in all present and after-acquired inventory, accounts receivable, deposit accounts, securities accounts, and any cash or other assets in such accounts and other related assets owned by each ABL Guarantor and the proceeds of the foregoing, subject to certain exceptions (the “ABL Priority Collateral”) and (ii) junior basis by a perfected security interest in substantially all other tangible and intangible assets owned by each ABL Guarantor (the “Cash Flow Priority Collateral”).
The ABL Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants. The negative covenants include restrictions on, among other things: the incurrence of additional indebtedness; the incurrence of additional liens; dividends or other distributions on equity; the purchase, redemption or retirement of capital stock; the payment or redemption of certain indebtedness; loans, guarantees and other investments; entering into other agreements that create restrictions on the ability to pay dividends or make other distributions on equity, make or repay certain loans, create or incur certain liens or guarantee certain indebtedness; asset sales; sale-leaseback transactions; swap agreements; consolidations or mergers; amendment of certain material documents; certain regulatory matters; Canadian pension plans; and affiliate transactions. The negative covenants are subject to customary exceptions and also permit dividends and other distributions on equity, investments, permitted acquisitions and payments or redemptions of indebtedness upon satisfaction of the “payment conditions.” The payment conditions are deemed satisfied upon Specified Availability (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) on the date of the designated action and Specified Availability for the prior 30-day period exceeding agreed-upon thresholds, the absence of the occurrence and continuance of any default and, in certain cases, pro forma compliance with a fixed charge coverage ratio of no less than 1.10 to 1.00.
The ABL Credit Agreement includes a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio test of no less than 1.00 to 1.00, which is tested only when Specified Availability is less than the greater of (A) $4.5 million and (B) 15.0% of the then effective commitments under the ABL Credit Facility, and continuing until the first day immediately succeeding the last day of the calendar month which includes the thirtieth (30th) consecutive day on which Specified Availability is in excess of such threshold so long as no default has occurred and is continuing and certain other conditions are met. As of December 31, 2020, Specified Availability had not fallen below the amount specified and
therefore the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio test was not applicable. Full availability under the ABL Credit Facility may be limited by our ability to comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio in future periods.
The ABL Credit Agreement provides for events of default, which, if any of them occurs, would permit or require the principal, premium, if any, and interest on all of the then outstanding obligations under the ABL Credit Facility to be due and payable immediately and the commitments under the ABL Credit Facility to be terminated.
On August 26, 2019, the Borrowers and the ABL Guarantors entered into an ABL collateral agreement (the “ABL Collateral Agreement”), in favor of the Administrative Agent, whereby the Borrowers and the ABL Guarantors granted a security interest in substantially all tangible and intangible assets of each Borrower and each ABL Guarantor, to secure all obligations of the Borrowers and the ABL Guarantors under the ABL Credit Agreement, and U.S. Bank National Association, as cash flow collateral representative, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as ABL agent, entered into a crossing lien intercreditor agreement (the “Intercreditor Agreement”) to govern the relative priority of liens on the collateral that secures the ABL Credit Agreement and the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and certain other rights, priorities and interests.
On November 30, 2020, the Issuers entered into a limited consent to the ABL Credit Agreement with the financial institutions listed on the signature pages thereof and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, pursuant to which the Lenders (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) provided consent to the consummation of the Transaction.
2022 Senior Secured Notes
On June 14, 2016, the Issuers issued $525 million aggregate principal amount of 12.500% senior secured notes due 2022 (the “Original 2022 Senior Secured Notes”) under an Indenture, dated as of June 14, 2016 (the “Original Indenture”), among the Issuers, us, as guarantor, certain subsidiaries of GIH, as guarantors (the “2022 Subsidiary Guarantors” and, together with us, the “2022 Guarantors”), and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee and as Collateral Agent. On January 3, 2017, the Issuers issued $65 million aggregate principal amount of additional 12.500% senior secured notes due 2022 (the “January 2017 Additional Notes”). The January 2017 Additional Notes were issued at a price equal to 108% of their face value resulting in gross proceeds of $70.2 million. On September 20, 2017, the Issuers, the 2022 Guarantors and the Trustee entered into the first supplemental indenture (the “Supplemental Indenture” and, together with the Original Indenture, the “Indenture”) to modify certain covenants, as discussed below. On September 25, 2017, the Issuers issued $100 million aggregate principal amount of additional 12.500% senior secured notes due 2022 (the “September 2017 Additional Notes”). The September 2017 Additional Notes were issued at a price equal to 113% of their face value resulting in gross proceeds of $113.0 million. Additionally, we received approximately $2.9 million for interest that accrued from July 1, 2017 through September 24, 2017, which was paid in our January 2018 interest payment. We refer to the Original 2022 Senior Secured Notes, the January 2017 Additional Notes and the September 2017 Additional Notes collectively as the “2022 Senior Secured Notes.”
On April 15, 2019, the Issuers elected to call for redemption in full all $690 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 2022 Senior Secured Notes in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. The redemption was conditioned, among other things, upon the incurrence of indebtedness in connection with the issuance of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes or from one or more other sources, in an amount satisfactory to the Issuers which condition was satisfied by the issuance of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes. On April 25, 2019, the Issuers irrevocably deposited, or caused to be irrevocably deposited, with the Trustee funds solely for the benefit of the holders of the 2022 Senior Secured Notes, cash in an amount sufficient to pay principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest on the 2022 Senior Secured Notes to, but not including, the date of redemption and all other sums payable under the Indenture. The Trustee executed and delivered an acknowledgement of satisfaction, discharge and release, dated as of April 25, 2019, among other documents, with respect to the satisfaction and discharge of the 2022 Senior Secured Notes. On May 15, 2019, the 2022 Senior Secured Notes were fully redeemed in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, and the amount deposited with the Trustee on April 25, 2019 was paid to the holders of the 2022 Senior Secured Notes. The make-whole premium paid in connection with the redemption was $51.4 million and we wrote off the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs of $9.1 million and the remaining debt premium of $11.7 million relating to the 2022 Senior Secured Notes in connection with the redemption thereof,
which together are included in the loss on extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019.
We paid approximately $15.9 million of aggregate origination fees and financing costs related to the issuance of the 2022 Senior Secured Notes which were accounted for as deferred financing costs. Additionally, we paid approximately $1.4 million of consent fees in connection with the Supplemental Indenture, which partially offset the net carrying value of the 2022 Senior Secured Notes. Total amortization expense was $0.9 million and $2.6 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Amortization expense is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. As noted above, the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs were written off as of May 15, 2019.
2022 Convertible Notes
On November 21, 2018, we issued $215.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 (the “2022 Convertible Notes”) in private offerings to qualified institutional buyers, including pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and in concurrent private placements. We granted an option to the initial purchasers to purchase up to an additional $32.3 million aggregate principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes to cover over-allotments, of which $22.8 million was subsequently exercised during December 2018, resulting in a total issuance of $237.8 million aggregate principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes. The 2022 Convertible Notes mature on May 15, 2022, unless earlier repurchased or converted into shares of our common stock under certain circumstances described below. Upon maturity, we have the option to settle our obligation through cash, shares of common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. We pay interest on the 2022 Convertible Notes semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on May 15, 2019.
The $237.8 million of proceeds received from the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes was initially allocated between long-term debt (the liability component) at $188.7 million and additional paid-in capital (the equity component) at $49.1 million, within the consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of the liability component was measured using rates determined for similar debt instruments without a conversion feature. The carrying amount of the equity component, representing the conversion option, was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the aggregate face value of the 2022 Convertible Notes. If we or the note holders elect not to settle the debt through conversion, we must settle the 2022 Convertible Notes at face value. Therefore, the liability component will be accreted up to the face value of the 2022 Convertible Notes, which will result in additional non-cash interest expense being recognized in the consolidated statements of operations through the 2022 Convertible Notes maturity date (see Note 8, “Interest Costs,” for additional information). The effective interest rate on the 2022 Convertible Notes, including accretion of the notes to par and debt issuance cost amortization, was approximately 13.6%. The equity component will not be remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the outstanding principal on the 2022 Convertible Notes was $237.8 million, the unaccreted debt discount was $22.7 million and $35.9 million, respectively, and the net carrying amount of the liability component was $215.1 million and $201.9 million, respectively.
We incurred approximately $8.1 million of issuance costs related to the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes, of which $6.4 million and $1.7 million were recorded to deferred financing costs and additional paid-in capital, respectively, in proportion to the allocation of the proceeds of the 2022 Convertible Notes. The $6.4 million recorded as deferred financing costs on our consolidated balance sheet is being amortized over the term of the 2022 Convertible Notes using the effective interest method. Total amortization expense was $1.8 million and $1.7 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Amortization expense is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the balance of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the 2022 Convertible Notes was $2.7 million and $4.5 million, respectively, and is included as a reduction to long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 8, “Interest Costs,” for additional information.
The 2022 Convertible Notes had an initial conversion rate of 166.6667 common shares per $1,000 principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $6.00 per share of our common stock. Upon conversion, we currently expect to settle in shares for the amount of the 2022
Convertible Notes then outstanding. We may elect to deliver cash in lieu of all or a portion of such shares. The shares of common stock subject to conversion are excluded from diluted earnings per share calculations under the if-converted method as their impact is anti-dilutive.
Holders may convert the 2022 Convertible Notes, at their option, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount at any time prior to January 15, 2022, but only in the following circumstances:
•
during any fiscal quarter beginning after the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2018, if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the last 30 consecutive trading days of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price of the 2022 Convertible Notes on each applicable trading day (the “Stock Price Condition”);
•
during the five-business day period following any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price for the 2022 Convertible Notes is less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate for the 2022 Convertible Notes on each such trading day (the “Notes Price Condition”); or
•
upon the occurrence of specified corporate events.
The Stock Price Condition was triggered for the period from October 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020. Regardless of whether any of the foregoing circumstances occurs, a holder may convert its 2022 Convertible Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at any time on or after January 15, 2022 until the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding May 15, 2022.
In addition, if we undergo a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes), holders may, subject to certain conditions, require us to repurchase their 2022 Convertible Notes for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes to be purchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, following a make-whole fundamental change, we will increase the conversion rate in certain circumstances for a holder who elects to convert its 2022 Convertible Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change.
2020 Convertible Notes
On March 3, 2015, we issued $340.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 (the “2020 Convertible Notes”) in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers, pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. We granted an option to the initial purchasers to purchase up to an additional $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2020 Convertible Notes to cover over-allotments, of which $21.9 million was subsequently exercised during March 2015, resulting in a total issuance of $361.9 million aggregate principal amount of 2020 Convertible Notes. We paid interest on the 2020 Convertible Notes semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year. Interest payments began on September 1, 2015. In November 2018, in connection with the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes, we repurchased $199.9 million outstanding principal amount of the 2020 Convertible Notes at par value. As a result of the repurchase, the carrying value of the 2020 Convertible Notes was adjusted by $17.9 million to face value and included in the loss on extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018.
On April 18, 2019, we commenced a cash tender offer (the “Tender Offer”) to purchase any and all of the outstanding 2020 Convertible Notes for an amount equal to $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount of 2020 Convertible Notes purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest from the last interest payment date on the 2020 Convertible Notes to, but not including, the date of payment for the 2020 Convertible Notes accepted in the Tender Offer. The Tender Offer expired on May 15, 2019, resulting in the purchase of $159.0 million of outstanding 2020 Convertible Notes. As a result of the Tender Offer, the carrying value of the 2020 Convertible Notes was adjusted by $8.5 million to face value and unamortized deferred financing costs of $0.6 million were expensed. These two items are included in the loss on extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019. During September 2019, we purchased an additional $0.5 million of outstanding 2020 Convertible Notes. The 2020 Convertible Notes matured on March 1, 2020.
The $361.9 million of proceeds received from the issuance of the 2020 Convertible Notes was initially allocated between long-term debt (the liability component) at $261.9 million and additional paid-in capital (the equity component) at $100.0 million, within the consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of the liability component was measured using rates determined for similar debt instruments without a conversion feature. The carrying amount of the equity component, representing the conversion option, was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the aggregate face value of the 2020 Convertible Notes. If we or the holders of 2020 Convertible Notes elected not to settle the debt through conversion, we were required to settle the 2020 Convertible Notes at face value. Therefore, the liability component was accreted up to the face value of the 2020 Convertible Notes, which resulted in additional non-cash interest expense being recognized in the consolidated statements of operations (see Note 8, “Interest Costs,” for additional information). The effective interest rate on the 2020 Convertible Notes, including accretion of the notes to par and debt issuance cost amortization, was approximately 11.5%.
As of December 31, 2019, the outstanding principal on the 2020 Convertible Notes was $2.5 million, the unamortized debt discount was zero, and the net carrying amount of the liability component was $2.5 million.
We incurred approximately $10.4 million of issuance costs related to the issuance of the 2020 Convertible Notes, of which $7.5 million and $2.9 million were recorded to deferred financing costs and additional paid-in capital, respectively, in proportion to the allocation of the proceeds of the 2020 Convertible Notes. The $7.5 million recorded as deferred financing costs on our consolidated balance sheet is being amortized over the term of the 2020 Convertible Notes using the effective interest method. Total amortization expense of the deferred financing costs was zero, $0.2 million and $1.4 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Amortization expense is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2019, the balance of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the 2020 Convertible Notes was zero. See Note 10, “Interest Costs,” for additional information.
The 2020 Convertible Notes had an initial conversion rate of 41.9274 common shares per $1,000 principal amount of 2020 Convertible Notes, which was equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $23.85 per share of our common stock. We had the option to elect to deliver cash in lieu of all or a portion of such shares. The shares of common stock subject to conversion were excluded from diluted earnings per share calculations under the if-converted method as their impact is anti-dilutive.
Forward Transactions
In connection with the issuance of the 2020 Convertible Notes, we paid approximately $140 million to enter into prepaid forward stock repurchase transactions (the “Forward Transactions”) with certain financial institutions (the “Forward Counterparties”), pursuant to which we purchased approximately 7.2 million shares of common stock for settlement on or around the March 1, 2020 maturity date for the 2020 Convertible Notes, subject to the ability of each Forward Counterparty to elect to settle all or a portion of its Forward Transactions early.
On December 11, 2019, we entered into an amendment to one of the Forward Transactions (the “Amended and Restated Forward Transaction”) to extend the expected settlement date with respect to approximately 2.1 million shares of common stock held by one of the Forward Counterparties, JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (the “2022 Forward Counterparty”), to correspond with the May 15, 2022 maturity date for the 2022 Convertible Notes. In the future, we may request that the 2022 Forward Counterparty modify the settlement terms of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction to provide that, in lieu of the delivery of the applicable number of shares of our common stock to us to settle a portion of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction in accordance with its terms, the 2022 Forward Counterparty would pay to us the net proceeds from the sale by the 2022 Forward Counterparty (or its affiliate) of a corresponding number of shares of our common stock in a registered offering (which may include block sales, sales on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, sales in the over-the-counter market, sales pursuant to negotiated transactions or otherwise, at market prices prevailing at the time of sale or at negotiated prices). Any such sales could potentially decrease (or reduce the size of any increase in) the market price of our common stock. The 2022 Forward Counterparty is not required to effect any such settlement in cash in lieu of delivery of shares of our common stock and, if we request that the 2022 Forward Counterparty effect any such settlement, it will be entered into in the discretion of the 2022 Forward Counterparty on such terms as may be mutually agreed upon at the time. As a result of the Forward Transactions, total shareholders’ equity within our
consolidated balance sheet was reduced by approximately $140 million. Between March 5-6, 2020, approximately 5.1 million shares of common stock were delivered to us in connection with the Forward Transactions. The approximately 2.1 million shares of common stock remaining under the Amended and Restated Forward Transactions are treated as retired shares for basic and diluted EPS purposes although they remain legally outstanding.
Restricted Cash
Our restricted cash balances were $0.5 million and $7.7 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The balance as of December 31, 2020 consisted of a letter of credit issued for the benefit of the landlord of our current office location in Broomfield, CO. The balance as of December 31, 2019 primarily consisted of letters of credit for office locations in Broomfield, CO, Chicago, IL and Bensenville, IL as well as cash restricted to repay the remaining balance of the 2020 Convertible Notes which matured in March 2020.
For additional information on the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, the ABL Credit Facility, the 2022 Senior Secured Notes, the 2022 Convertible Notes and the 2020 Convertible Notes, see Note 9, “Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities,” to our consolidated financial statements.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
The following table summarizes our contractual obligations (including those that require us to make future cash payments) as of December 31, 2020. The future contractual requirements include payments required for our operating leases and contractual purchase agreements (in thousands).
(1)
As of December 31, 2020, our outstanding purchase obligations represented obligations to vendors incurred in order to meet operational requirements in the normal course of business and related primarily to information technology, research and development, sales and marketing and production related activities.
(2)
See Note 9, “Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities,” to our consolidated financial statements for more information.
(3)
Amounts represent obligations to provide services for which we have already received cash from our customers.
(4)
Other long-term obligations consist of estimated payments (undiscounted) for our asset retirement obligations, network transmission services and monthly C$0.1 million payments to the licensor of our Canadian ATG spectrum license over the estimated 25-year term of the agreement, using the December 31, 2020 exchange rate. Other long-term obligations do not include $2.1 million of deferred tax liabilities due to the uncertainty of their timing.
Contractual Commitments: We have agreements with various vendors under which we have remaining commitments to purchase satellite-based systems, certifications and development services. Such commitments will become payable as we receive the equipment or certifications, or as development services are provided.
Leases and Cell Site Contracts: We have lease agreements relating to certain facilities and equipment, which are considered operating leases. See Note 17, “Leases,” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Indemnifications and Guarantees: In accordance with Delaware law, we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at our request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under this indemnification is uncertain and may be unlimited, depending upon circumstances. However, our Directors’ and Officers’ insurance does provide coverage for certain of these losses.
In the ordinary course of business, we may occasionally enter into agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to pay for the failure of performance of others, such as the use of corporate credit cards issued to employees. Based on historical experience, we believe that the risk of sustaining any material loss related to such guarantees is remote.
We have entered into a number of agreements pursuant to which we indemnify the other party for losses and expenses suffered or incurred in connection with any patent, copyright, or trademark infringement or misappropriation claim asserted by a third party with respect to our equipment or services. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is uncertain and is typically not limited by the terms of the agreements.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any obligations that meet the definition of an off-balance sheet arrangement which have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our results of operations.
