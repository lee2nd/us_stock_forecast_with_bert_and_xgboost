Background Overview
Nocopi Technologies, Inc. develops and markets specialty reactive inks for applications in the large educational and toy products market. We also develop and market technologies for document and product authentication, which we believe can reduce losses caused by fraudulent document reproduction or by product counterfeiting and/or diversion. We derive our revenues primarily from licensing our technologies on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis to licensees who incorporate our technologies into their product offering and from selling products incorporating our technologies to the licensees or to their licensed printers.
Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us” and other similar terms means Nocopi Technologies, Inc., a Maryland corporation.
Results of Operations
Our Company’s revenues are derived from (a) royalties paid by licensees of our technologies, (b) fees for the provision of technical services to licensees and (c) from the direct sale of (i) products incorporating our technologies, such as inks, security paper and pressure sensitive labels, and (ii) equipment used to support the application of our technologies, such as ink-jet printing systems. Royalties consist of guaranteed minimum royalties payable by our licensees in certain cases and additional royalties which typically vary with the licensee’s sales or production of products incorporating the licensed technology. Service fees and sales revenues vary directly with the number of units of service or product provided.
Our Company recognizes revenue on its lines of business as follows:
a.
License fees for the use of our technology and royalties with guaranteed minimum amounts are recognized at a point in time when the term begins;
b.
Product sales are recognized at the time of the transfer of goods to customers at an amount that our Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for these goods, which is at the time of shipment; and
c.
Fees for technical services are recognized at the time of the transfer of services to customers at an amount that our Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for the services, which is when the service has been rendered.
We believe that, as fixed cost reductions beyond those we have achieved in recent years may not be achievable, our operating results are substantially dependent on revenue levels. Because revenues derived from licenses and royalties carry a much higher gross profit margin than other revenues, operating results are also substantially affected by changes in revenue mix.
Both the absolute amount of our Company’s revenues and the mix among the various sources of revenue are subject to substantial fluctuation. We have a relatively small number of substantial customers rather than a large number of small customers. Accordingly, changes in the revenue received from a significant customer can have a substantial effect on our Company’s total revenue, revenue mix and overall financial performance. Such changes may result from a substantial customer’s product development delays, engineering changes, changes in product marketing strategies, production requirements and the like. We cannot predict whether COVID-19 will materially affect our licensing fees or the demand for our products in 2021 and beyond. In addition, certain customers have, from time to time, sought to renegotiate certain provisions of their license agreements and, when our Company agrees to revise such terms, revenues from the customer may be affected.
Comparison of the Years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Revenues for 2020 were $2,658,700, an increase of approximately 5%, or $121,300, from $2,537,400 in 2019.
Licenses, royalties and fees decreased in 2020 by approximately 6%, or $49,800, to $744,000 from $793,800 in 2019. The decrease in licenses, royalties and fees is due primarily to lower guaranteed licensing revenue of approximately $200,000 in the first six months of 2020 from one licensee in the entertainment and toy products market as a result of the adoption of ASU 214-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers in the second quarter of 2018.
Product and other sales increased by $171,100, or approximately 10%, to $1,914,700 in 2020 from $1,743,600 in 2019. The higher level of ink sales in 2020 compared to 2019 is due primarily to higher ink requirements of the licensed third-party printers used by the Company’s licensees in the entertainment and toy products market. Sales of ink to the licensed printers of its licensees in the entertainment and toy products market were approximately $222,900 higher in 2020 compared to 2019. Sales of security ink to the Company’s licensees in the retail receipt and document fraud market decreased by approximately $30,300 in 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to reduced demand related to COVID-19 closures of retail outlets during 2020.
Our Company derived $2,419,000, or approximately 91% of total revenues, from licensees and their licensed printers in the entertainment and toy products market in 2020 compared to $2,223,900, or approximately 88% of total revenues, in 2019. The increase in revenues from our licensees and their authorized printers in the entertainment and toy products market in 2020 compared to 2019 is due primarily to higher ink sales to the authorized printers of our Company’s licensees in the entertainment and toy products market in 2020 compared to 2019 offset in part by lower guaranteed licensing revenue of approximately $200,000 in the first six months of 2020 from one licensee in the entertainment and toy products market as a result of the adoption of ASU 214-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers in the second quarter of 2018. Our Company’s licensees in the entertainment and toy products market continue to develop new products for this market and improve their current offerings; however, their sales will be affected by marketplace reaction to the new and improved products, economic conditions that influence this market segment and the economy as a whole. Revenues that the Company derives from these licensees will be similarly affected. We cannot assure you that the marketing and product development activities of licensees in the entertainment and toy products market will produce increased revenues for the Company in future periods, nor can the timing of any potential revenue increases be predicted, particularly given the uncertain economic conditions currently being experienced worldwide as a result of COVID-19.
Our Company’s gross profit decreased to $1,535,000, or approximately 58% of revenues, in 2020 from $1,695,700, or approximately 67% of revenues, in 2019. The lower gross profit in 2020 compared to 2019 results primarily from lower licenses, royalties and fees due to the adoption of Topic 606 in 2018 along with significant increases in the price of certain raw materials related to the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 offset in part by higher gross revenues from product and other sales 2020 compared to 2019.
Licenses, royalties and fees have historically carried a higher gross profit than product sales, which generally consist of supplies or other manufactured products that incorporate the Company’s technologies or equipment used to support the application of its technologies. These items (except for inks which are manufactured by our Company) are generally purchased from third-party vendors and resold to the end-user or licensee and carry a lower gross profit than licenses, royalties and fees. The lower gross profit in 2020 compared to 2019 reflects lower gross revenues from licenses, royalties and fees offset in part by higher product and other sales in 2020 compared to 2019.
As the variable component of cost of revenues related to licenses, royalties and fees is a low percentage of these revenues and the fixed component is not substantial, period to period changes in revenues from licenses, royalties and fees can significantly affect both gross profit from licenses, royalties and fees as well as overall gross profit. Due primarily to the lower revenues in 2020 compared to 2019, the gross profit from licenses, royalties and fees decreased to approximately 70% of revenues from licenses, royalties and fees in 2020 from approximately 79% in 2019.
The gross profit, expressed as a percentage of revenues, of product and other sales is dependent on both the overall sales volumes of product and other sales and on the mix of the specific goods produced and/or sold. The gross profit from product and other sales decreased to approximately 53% of revenues in 2020 compared to approximately 61% of revenues 2019. The decrease in 2020 compared to 2019 is due to: a) a significant increase in the cost of raw materials utilized by our Company in the manufacture of certain of its products as a result of price increases related to the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on the availability and supply of these raw materials in 2020 compared to 2019 (we are not passing along these cost increases to our customers at this time); b) an unfavorable mix of products sold whereby the increases in purchases of our Company’s products by the licensed printers of its licensees in the entertainment and toy products market in 2020 compared to 2019 were of products manufactured by our Company whose raw material prices were most affected by shortages created by the COVID-19 pandemic and c) increased production salaries related to a staffing addition, higher duties and equipment depreciation in 2020 compared to 2019.
Research and development expenses were $173,500 in 2020 compared to $165,600 in 2019. The increase in 2020 compared to 2019 resulted primarily from higher salary expense in 2020 compared to 2019.
Sales and marketing expenses were $356,400 in 2020 compared to $329,900 in 2019. The increase in 2020 compared to 2019 is due primarily to higher commission expense on the higher level of revenues in 2020 compared to 2019.
General and administrative expenses increased to $526,100 in 2020 from $393,900 in 2019. The increase in 2020 compared to 2019 is due primarily to higher corporate relations and salary expenses in 2020 compared to 2019.
Other income (expenses) in 2020 and 2019 included interest on convertible debentures that were held by seven investors and interest income on invested funds.
Income taxes in 2020 and 2019 resulted from limitations placed on income tax net operating loss deductions by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
Our lower net income of $508,000 in 2020 compared to net income of $754,900 in 2019 resulted primarily from a lower gross profit on a lower level of licenses, royalties and fees, higher cost of revenues and higher operating expenses in 2020 compared to 2019 offset in part by the reversal of income taxes in the first quarter of 2020.
Our management does not believe that inflation and changing prices, with the exception of increases in the prices of certain raw materials that were most affected by shortages created by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, have had a significant effect on our revenues and results of operations during the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.
Plan of Operation, Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our Company’s cash increased to $1,362,800 at December 31, 2020 from $688,000 at December 31, 2019. During 2020, our Company generated $702,400 from its operating activities, received $11,000 upon the exercise of warrants and used $38,600 for capital expenditures.
Our Company’s revenues increased approximately 5% to $2,658,700 in 2020 from $2,537,400 in 2019 primarily as a result of higher sales of ink to the authorized printers of our Company’s licensees in the entertainment and toy products market offset in part by lower royalty revenues from two licensees in the entertainment and toy products market along with lower revenues from licensees in the anti-counterfeiting and anti-diversion technologies and products market reflecting the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on this market. Our Company’s gross profit decreased approximately 9% to $1,535,000 in 2020 from $1,695,700 in 2019 primarily as a result of price increases related to the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on the availability and supply of certain raw materials in 2020 compared to 2019, along with an unfavorable mix of products sold whereby the increases in purchases of our Company’s products by the licensed printers of our Company’s licensees in the entertainment and toy products market in 2020 compared to 2019 were of products manufactured by our Company whose raw material prices were most affected by shortages created by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Our Company’s total overhead expenses increased in 2020 compared to 2019, our Company’s net interest income increased in 2020 compared to 2019 and our Company’s income tax expense decreased in 2020 compared to 2019. As a result of these factors, our Company generated net income of $508,400 in 2020 compared to $754,900 in 2019. Our Company had positive operating cash flow of $702,400 in 2020. At December 31, 2020, our Company had working capital of $2,801,100 and stockholders’ equity of $3,453,100. For the full year of 2019, our Company had net income of $754,900 and had positive operating cash flow of $360,600. At December 31, 2019, our Company had working capital of $1,835,300 and stockholders’ equity of $2,789,700.
In November 2018, our Company negotiated a $150,000 revolving line of credit (“Line of Credit”) with a bank to provide a source of working capital, if required. The Line of Credit is secured by all the assets of our Company and bears interest at the bank’s prime rate for a period of one year and its prime rate plus 1.5% thereafter. The Line of Credit is subject to an annual review and quiet period. There have been no borrowings under the Line of Credit since its inception. We may need to obtain additional capital in the future to further support the working capital requirements associated with our existing revenue base and to develop new revenue sources. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining such additional capital, if needed. We continue to maintain a cost containment program including curtailment, where possible, of discretionary research and development and sales and marketing expenses.
Our plan of operation for the twelve months beginning with the date of this Annual Report consists of concentrating available human and financial resources to continue to capitalize on the specific business relationships our Company has developed in the entertainment and toy products market. This includes two licensees that have been marketing products incorporating the Company’s technologies since 2012. These two licensees maintain a significant presence in the entertainment and toy products market and are well known and highly regarded participants in this market. We anticipate that these two licensees will expand their current offerings that incorporate our technologies and will introduce and market new products that will incorporate our technologies available to them under their license agreements with our Company. We will continue to develop various applications for these licensees. We also plan to expand our licensee base in the entertainment and toy market. We currently have additional licensees marketing or developing products incorporating our technologies in certain geographic and niche markets of the overall entertainment and toy products market.
Our Company maintains its presence in the retail loss prevention market and believes that revenue growth in this market can be achieved through increased security ink sales to its licensees in this market. We will continue to adjust our production and technical staff as necessary and, subject to available financial resources, invest in capital equipment needed to support potential growth in ink production requirements beyond our current capacity. Additionally, we will pursue opportunities to market our current technologies in specific security and non-security markets. There can be no assurances that these efforts will enable our Company to generate additional revenues and positive cash flow.
Our Company has received, and may in the future seek, additional capital in the form of debt, equity or both, to support our working capital requirements and to provide funding for other business opportunities. Beyond the Line of Credit, we cannot assure you that if we require additional capital, that we will be successful in obtaining such additional capital, or that such additional capital, if obtained, will enable our Company to generate additional revenues and positive cash flow.
As previously stated, we generate a significant portion of our total revenues from licensees in the entertainment and toy products market. These licensees generally sell their products through retail outlets. In the future, such sales may be adversely affected by changes in consumer spending that may occur as a result of an uncertain economic environment in 2021 and beyond due to the COVID-19 virus and its effect on the global economy. As a result, our revenues, results of operations and liquidity may be negatively impacted.
Contractual Obligations
We conduct our operations in leased facilities under a non-cancelable operating lease expiring in 2024. Future minimum lease payments under this operating lease at December 31, 2020 are: $53,100 - 2021; $54,600 - 2022; $56,200 - 2023 and $18,900 - 2024. Total rental expense under operating leases was $53,300 in each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.
