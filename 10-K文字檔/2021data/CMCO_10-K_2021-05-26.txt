Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition
This section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
The Company is a leading worldwide designer, manufacturer and marketer of intelligent motion solutions, including motion control products, technologies, automated systems and services, that efficiently and ergonomically move, lift, position and secure materials. Our key products include hoists, crane components, precision conveyors, actuators, rigging tools, light rail workstations, and digital power and motion control systems. These are highly relevant, professional-grade solutions that solve customers’ critical material handling requirements.
Founded in 1875, we have grown to our current size and leadership position through organic growth and acquisitions. We developed our leading market position over our 146-year history by emphasizing technological innovation, manufacturing excellence and superior customer service. In addition, acquisitions significantly broadened our product lines and services and expanded our geographic reach, end-user markets and customer base. In accordance with our Blueprint for Growth 2.0 Strategy, we are simplifying the business utilizing our 80/20 process, improving our operational excellence, and ramping the growth engine by investing in new product development and a digital platform to grow profitably. Shareholder value will be enhanced by expanding EBITDA margins and return on invested capital ("ROIC").
Our revenue base is geographically diverse with approximately 47% derived from customers outside the U.S. for the year ended March 31, 2021. We believe this diversity balances the impact of changes that occur in local economies, as well as benefits the Company by providing access to growing emerging markets. We monitor both U.S. and Eurozone Industrial Capacity Utilization statistics as well as the ISM Production Index as indicators of anticipated demand for our products. In addition, we continue to monitor the potential impact of other global and U.S. trends including, industrial production, trade tariffs, raw material cost inflation, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and activity of end-user markets around the globe.
From a strategic perspective, we are investing in new products as we focus on our greatest opportunities for growth. We maintain a strong North American market share with significant leading market positions in hoists, lifting and sling chain, forged attachments, actuators, and digital power and motion control systems for the material handling industry. We seek to maintain and enhance our market share by focusing our sales and marketing activities toward select North American and global market sectors including general industrial, energy, automotive, heavy OEM, entertainment, and construction and infrastructure.
In March 2021, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Dorner. The acquisition of Dorner closed on April 7, 2021. Dorner, headquartered in Hartland, Wisconsin, is a leading automation solutions company providing unique, patented technologies in the design, application, manufacturing and integration of high-precision conveying systems. The acquisition of Dorner accelerates the Company’s shift to intelligent motion and serves as a platform to expand capabilities in advanced, higher technology automation solutions. Dorner is a leading supplier to the stable life sciences, food processing, and consumer packaged goods markets as well as the high growth industrial automation and e-commerce sectors. The addition of Dorner provides attractive complementary adjacencies including sortation and asynchronous conveyance systems.
Regardless of the economic climate and point in the economic cycle, we constantly explore ways to increase operating margins as well as further improve our productivity and competitiveness. We have specific initiatives to reduce quote lead-times, improve on-time deliveries, reduce warranty costs, and improve material and factory productivity. The initiatives are being driven by the implementation of our business operating system, CMBS. We are working to achieve these strategic initiatives through business simplification, operational excellence, and profitable growth initiatives. We believe these initiatives will enhance future operating margins.
Our principal raw materials and components purchases were approximately $255 million in fiscal 2021 (or 59% of Cost of product sold) and include steel, consisting of rod, wire, bar, structural, and other forms of steel; electric motors; bearings; gear reducers; castings; steel and aluminum enclosures and wire harnesses; electro-mechanical components and standard variable drives. These commodities are all available from multiple sources. We purchase most of these raw materials and components from a limited number of strategic and preferred suppliers under agreements which are negotiated on a company-wide basis through our global purchasing group. Generally, as we experience fluctuations in our costs, we reflect them as price increases to our customers with the goal of being margin neutral.
We operate in a highly competitive and global business environment. We face a variety of opportunities in those markets and geographies, including trends toward increasing productivity of the global labor force and the expansion of market
opportunities in Asia and other emerging markets. While we execute our long-term growth strategy, we are supported by our strong free cash flow as well as our liquidity position and flexible debt structure. Like many global companies, we have been, and continue to be, affected by COVID-19. During fiscal 2021, we took appropriate measures to generate positive operating income and protect the cash flow and liquidity of the Company. This included reducing our cost base, reducing working capital needs, and reducing capital expenditures. These measures helped contribute to positive operating income and strong cash flow throughout fiscal 2021 despite the impact of COVID-19.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Fiscal 2021 Compared to 2020
Fiscal 2021 sales were $649,642,000, a decrease of 19.7%, or $159,520,000 compared with fiscal 2020 sales of $809,162,000. Sales for the fiscal year were negatively impacted by $177,233,000 in decreased sales volume as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, offset by price increases which positively impacted sales by $8,566,000. Favorable foreign currency translation increased sales by $9,147,000.
Gross profit was $220,225,000 and $283,186,000 or 33.9% and 35.0% of net sales in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. The fiscal 2021 decrease in gross profit of $62,961,000 or 22.2% is the result of $62,797,000 in lower sales volume, $15,980,000 in decreased productivity and unfavorable manufacturing costs, and $382,000 received in the prior year from an insurance settlement which did not reoccur. These decreases were offset by $8,311,000 of price increases net of material inflation, $2,189,000 from a gain recorded for a building sold in China classified as Cost of products sold, $1,705,000 in decreased tariffs, $223,000 in decreased product liability costs, $207,000 in decreased severance costs, and $128,000 in lower costs incurred in fiscal 2021 to consolidate the Company's Ohio operations. The translation of foreign currencies had a $3,435,000 favorable impact on gross profit for the year ended March 31, 2021.
Selling expenses were $76,907,000 and $91,054,000, or 11.8% and 11.3% of net sales in fiscal years 2021 and 2020. Selling expense decreased primarily due to lower variable selling costs and cost measures put in place as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in fiscal 2021. Foreign currency translation had a $1,204,000 unfavorable impact on selling expenses.
General and administrative expenses were $76,035,000 and $77,880,000 or 11.7% and 9.6% of net sales in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was due to $1,674,000 in prior fiscal year factory closure and business realignment costs which did not reoccur in the current fiscal year, $1,452,000 in reduced bad debt expense, a $449,000 gain in general and administrative expenses as a result of the Company selling one of its owned manufacturing facilities in China, $409,000 in decreased medical expenses, and $356,000 in lower legal costs related to an insurance recovery legal action which was settled in fiscal 2021. A reduction in travel related business expenses and professional services in response to the COVID-19 pandemic further contributed to the reduction in general and administrative expenses. These decreases were offset by $4,161,000 of higher stock compensation expense, of which $1,981,000 was reversed in the prior fiscal year for shares that were forfeited upon the former Chief Executive Officer's resignation, offset by $418,000 in lower incentive compensation expense in the current fiscal year. $3,951,000 in Dorner acquisition costs also contributed to higher general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2021. Foreign currency translation had a $395,000 unfavorable impact on general and administrative expenses.
Research and development expenses were $12,405,000 and $11,310,000 in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. As a percentage of consolidated net sales, research and development expenses were 1.9% and 1.4% in fiscal 2021 and 2020. The increase in research and development expenses is primarily due to $525,000 in current year severance costs associated with a research and development facility closure and $307,000 in higher incentive compensation expense in fiscal 2021. Foreign currency translation had a $70,000 unfavorable impact on research and development expenses.
Amortization of intangibles remained relatively consistent at $12,623,000 and $12,942,000 in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, with the decrease related to certain intangible assets that are now fully amortized.
Interest and debt expense was $12,081,000 and $14,234,000 in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, and primarily related to a decrease in interest and debt expense on the Company's Term Loan due to lower average borrowings outstanding during the fiscal 2021 period.
Investment income of $1,693,000 and $891,000, in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to earnings on marketable securities held in the Company’s wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary and the Company's equity method investment in EMC, described in Note 7 to our March 31, 2021 consolidated financial statements.
Foreign currency exchange resulted in a loss of $941,000 and gain of $1,514,000 in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, as a result of foreign currency volatility related to foreign currency denominated sales and purchases and intercompany debt.
Other expense was $20,850,000 in fiscal 2021 and $839,000 in fiscal 2020. The increase primarily related to a $19,038,000 settlement charge as a result of the termination of one of the Company's U.S. pension plans, as described in Note 13 to our March 31, 2021 consolidated financial statements.
Income tax expense as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income tax expense was 9.6% and 22.7% in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. Typically these percentages vary from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% due to varying effective tax rates at the Company's foreign subsidiaries and the jurisdictional mix of income for these subsidiaries. In fiscal 2021 the tax rate was primarily reduced by 6.9 percentage points due to federal tax credits including research and development credits.
Fiscal 2020 Compared to 2019
Fiscal 2020 sales were $809,162,000, a decrease of 7.7%, or $67,120,000 compared with fiscal 2019 sales of $876,282,000. Sales for the year were negatively impacted by $34,195,000 in sales in the previous fiscal year from sold businesses and $32,951,000 in decreased sales volume, offset by $13,169,000 in price increases. Unfavorable foreign currency translation decreased sales by $13,143,000.
Gross profit was $283,186,000 and $304,997,000 or 35.0% and 34.8% of net sales in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. The fiscal 2020 decrease in gross profit of $21,811,000 or 7.2% is the result of $14,069,000 in decreased volume, $7,053,000 in gross profit from sold businesses, $3,461,000 in decreased productivity and unfavorable manufacturing costs, $1,327,000 in costs incurred to consolidate the Salem and Lisbon Ohio facilities, $778,000 in increased tariffs, $751,000 in increased severance costs, and $622,000 in increased product liability costs. These decreases were offset by $10,338,000 of price increases net of material inflation and $382,000 received from insurance settlement. The translation of foreign currencies had a $4,470,000 unfavorable impact on gross profit for the year ended March 31, 2020.
Selling expenses were $91,054,000 and $97,925,000 or 11.3% and 11.2% of net sales in fiscal years 2020 and 2019. Selling expenses from sold businesses decreased selling expenses by $1,468,000 in fiscal 2020. In addition, we had $804,000 in lower advertising expenses, $550,000 in reduced U.S. warehouse rent expense, $331,000 lower incentive compensation, and $453,000 in costs incurred to consolidate the Salem and Lisbon Ohio facilities classified as selling expense. These decreases were offset by $299,000 in fiscal 2020 severance costs. Additionally, foreign currency translation had a $1,765,000 favorable impact on selling expenses. The remainder of the decrease is due to lower sales volume.
General and administrative expenses were $77,880,000 and $83,567,000 or 9.6% and 9.5% of net sales in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. The fiscal 2020 decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to $7,540,000 of lower incentive compensation and stock compensation expense including $1,981,000 in stock compensation expense that was reversed in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 for shares that were forfeited upon our Chief Executive Officer's resignation, $1,564,000 from sold businesses, and a $697,000 net reduction in legal costs related to an insurance recovery legal action. The decrease in general and administrative expense was partially offset by $1,528,000 in increased bed debt expenses, $1,455,000 in costs incurred to close a plant in the Asia Pacific region and reorganize the business, $635,000 in tax professional services fees primarily related to a legal entity restructuring, $624,000 in increased medical and benefit expenses, $436,000 of occupancy costs for our center of excellence in North Carolina, and $352,000 in increased environmental costs. Foreign currency translation had a $1,036,000 favorable impact on general and administrative expenses.
Research and development expenses were $11,310,000 and $13,491,000 in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a percentage of consolidated net sales, research and development expenses were 1.4% and 1.5% in fiscal 2020 and 2019. The reduction in research and development expenses is largely due to lower professional services and other expenses. $277,000 of the decrease in research and development expenses is from sold businesses.
A net loss on sales of businesses in the amount of $176,000 was recorded as a result of a final working capital adjustment in the year ended March 31, 2020 from businesses that were sold in fiscal 2019.
Amortization of intangibles remained relatively consistent at $12,942,000 and $14,900,000 in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease is primarily related to foreign currency translation.
Interest and debt expense was $14,234,000 and $17,144,000 in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively, and primarily related to a decrease in interest and debt expense on the Company's Term Loan due to lower average borrowings outstanding during the fiscal 2020 period.
Investment income of $891,000 and $727,000, in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to earnings on marketable securities held in the Company’s wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary and the Company's equity method investment in EMC, described in Note 7 to our March 31, 2021 consolidated financial statements.
Foreign currency exchange resulted in a gain of $1,514,000 and loss of $843,000 in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively, as a result of foreign currency volatility related to foreign currency denominated sales and purchases and intercompany debt.
Other expense was $839,000 in fiscal 2020 and other income was $716,000 in fiscal 2019. This includes components of pension expense (all except service costs, described in Note 13 to our March 31, 2021 consolidated financial statements) and various non-operating income and expense related activities.
Income tax expense as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income tax expense was 22.7% and 19.5% in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. These percentages vary from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to varying effective tax rates at the Company's foreign subsidiaries, and the jurisdictional mix of taxable income for these subsidiaries.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash totaled $202,377,000, $114,700,000, and $71,343,000 at March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
Cash flow from operating activities
Net cash provided by operating activities was $98,890,000, $106,795,000, and $79,499,000 in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. In fiscal 2021, net income of $9,106,000 and non-cash adjustments to net income of $52,370,000 were the largest contributors to cash provided by operating activities. In addition, cash increased as a result of better working capital performance including a decrease in inventory of $20,659,000, a decrease in trade accounts receivable of $21,472,000, and an increase in trade accounts payable of $10,343,000. The increase in cash was partially offset by a decrease in accrued expenses and non-current liabilities of $10,806,000. The decrease in accrued expenses and non-current liabilities primarily consists of the fiscal 2020 annual incentive plan payments offset by fiscal 2021 incentive plan accruals, $1,316,000 in pension plan contributions net of $3,790,000 of plan assets returned to the Company on the termination of one of its U.S. pension plans, and $8,909,000 in cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities.
In fiscal 2020, net income of $59,672,000 and non-cash adjustments to net income of $51,188,000 contributed the most to cash provided by operating activities as well as a decrease in inventory of $15,752,000 and an increase in trade accounts payable of $8,110,000. The increase in cash was partially offset by a decrease in accrued expenses and non-current liabilities of 27,693,000. The net decrease in non-current liabilities is largely due to pension plan contributions of $10,967,000.
Cash flow from investing activities
Net cash (used) provided by investing activities was $(5,548,000), $(9,962,000), and $2,486,000 in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. In fiscal 2021, the most significant use of cash in investing activities was $12,300,000 in capital expenditures.
In fiscal 2020, the most significant use of cash provided by investing activities was $9,432,000 in capital expenditures.
Cash flow from by financing activities
Net cash used by financing activities was $10,189,000, $51,551,000, and $67,778,000 in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. In fiscal 2021, the most significant uses of cash were $4,450,000 in repayments on our Term Loan and dividends paid in the amount $5,733,000, offset by $820,000 in net inflows from stock related transactions, which includes proceeds of $1,973,000 from stock options exercised. The Company drew $25,000,000 on the Revolver during the three months ended June 30, 2020 and subsequently repaid the amount in full during the three months ended December 31, 2020 which resulted in no net impact on cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2021.
In fiscal 2020, the most significant uses of cash were $51,113,000 in repayments on our Term Loan and dividends paid in the amount of $5,670,000, offset by $5,232,000 in net inflows from stock related transactions, which included proceeds of $6,000,000 from stock options exercised.
We believe that our cash on hand, cash flows, and borrowing capacity under our New Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations and budgeted capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months. This belief is dependent upon successful execution of our current business plan and effective working capital utilization. No material restriction exists in accessing cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries. As of March 31, 2021, $111,021,000 of cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries. Subsequent to March 31, 2021, the Company's cash balance decreased by approximately $120,000,000 to fund the Dorner acquisition, however, the Company still believes cash on hand is sufficient to fund ongoing operations and budgeted capital expenditures for the next 12 months.
Debt - Key Terms as of March 31, 2021
On January 31, 2017 the Company entered into a Credit Agreement ("Credit Agreement") and $545,000,000 of debt facilities ("Facilities") in connection with the STAHL acquisition. The Facilities consist of a Revolving Facility ("Revolver") in the amount of $100,000,000 and a $445,000,000 1st Lien Term Loan ("Term Loan"). The Term Loan has a seven-year term maturing in 2024.
On February 26, 2018, the Company amended the Credit Agreement (known as the "First Amended Credit Agreement"). The First Amended Credit Agreement has the same terms mentioned above except for a reduction in interest rates. The applicable rate for the repriced term loan was reduced from 3.00% to 2.50%. The Company accounted for the First Amended Credit Agreement as a debt modification, therefore, debt repricing fees incurred in fiscal 2018 were expensed as General and Administrative expenses and the deferred financing fees incurred as part of the Credit Agreement (discussed below) remain unchanged.
On August 26, 2020, the Company entered into a Second Amendment (known as the "Second Amended Credit Agreement") to the Credit Agreement (as amended by the First Amended Credit Agreement). The First Amended Credit Agreement extends the $100,000,000 secured Revolver which was originally set to expire on January 31, 2022 to August 25, 2023. At March 31, 2021 the Company has not drawn from the Revolver.
The key terms of the agreement are as follows:
•Term Loan: An aggregate $445,000,000 1st Lien Term Loan which requires quarterly principal amortization of 0.25% with the remaining principal due at maturity date. In addition, if the Company has Excess Cash Flow ("ECF") as defined in the Credit Agreement, the ECF Percentage of the Excess Cash Flow for such fiscal year minus optional prepayment of the Loans (except prepayments of Revolving Loans that are not accompanied by a corresponding permanent reduction of Revolving Commitments) pursuant to Section 2.10(a) of the Credit Agreement other than to the extent that any such prepayment is funded with the proceeds of Funded Debt, shall be applied toward the prepayment of the Term Loan. The ECF Percentage is defined as 50% stepping down to 25% or 0% based on the Secured Leverage Ratio as of the last day of the fiscal year.
•Revolver: An aggregate $100,000,000 secured revolving facility which includes sublimits for the issuance of standby letters of credit, swingline loans and multi-currency borrowings in certain specified foreign currencies.
•Fees and Interest Rates: Commitment fees and interest rates are determined on the basis of either a Eurocurrency rate or a Base rate plus an applicable margin based upon the Company's Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement).
•Prepayments: Provisions permitting a Borrower to voluntarily prepay either the Term Loan or Revolver in whole or in part at any time, and provisions requiring certain mandatory prepayments of the Term Loan or Revolver on the occurrence of certain events which will permanently reduce the commitments under the Credit Agreement, each without premium or penalty, subject to reimbursement of certain costs of the Lenders. A prepayment premium of 1% of the principal amount of the First Lien Term Loans is required if the prepayment is associated with a Repricing Transaction and it were to occur within the first twelve months.
•Covenants: Provisions containing covenants required of the Corporation and its subsidiaries including various affirmative and negative financial and operational covenants. The key financial covenant is triggered only on any date when any Extension of Credit under the Revolving Facility is outstanding (excluding any Letters of Credit) (the “Covenant Trigger”), and permits the Total Leverage Ratio for the Reference Period ended on such date to not exceed (i) 4.50:1.00 as of any date of determination prior to December 31, 2017, (ii) 4.00:1.00 as of any date of determination on December 31, 2017 and thereafter but prior to December 31, 2018, (iii) 3.50:1.00 as of any date of determination on December 31, 2018 and thereafter but prior to December 31, 2019 and (iv) 3.00:1.00 as of any date of determination on December 31, 2019 and thereafter. As there is no amount drawn on the Revolver as of March 31, 2021 the
requirement to comply with the covenant is not triggered. Had we been required to determine the covenant ratio we would have been in compliance with the covenant provisions as of March 31, 2021 and 2020.
The Facility is secured by all U.S. inventory, receivables, equipment, real property, certain subsidiary stock (limited to 65% of non-U.S. subsidiaries) and intellectual property. The Credit Agreement allows the declaration of dividends, but limits our ability to pay dividends.
As discussed in Note 3, the Company completed its acquisition of Dorner on April 7, 2021 and entered into a $750,000,000 credit facility ("First Lien Facilities") with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ("JPMorgan Chase Bank"), PNC Capital Markets LLC, and Wells Fargo Securities LLC. The First Lien Facilities consist of a Revolving Facility (the “New Revolving Credit Facility”) in an aggregate amount of $100,000,000 and a $650,000,000 First Lien Term Facility. Proceeds from the First Lien Term Facility was used, among other things, to finance the purchase price for the Dorner acquisition, pay related fees, expenses and transaction costs, and refinance the Company's borrowings under its prior Term Loan and Revolver. Refer to Note 3 to our March 31, 2021 consolidated financial statements for key terms of the First Lien Facilities, which went into effect during fiscal 2022.
The outstanding balance of the Term Loan was $254,900,000 and $259,350,000 as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company made $4,450,000 of principal payment on the Term Loan during fiscal 2021 and $51,113,000 of principal payment on the Term Loan during fiscal 2020. The Company is obligated to make $4,450,000 of principal payments over the next 12 months. As previously discussed, in response to COVID-19 the Company is seeking to take all appropriate measures to protect the cash flow and liquidity of the Company. As such, only the required principal amount has been recorded within the current portion of long-term debt on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet with the remaining balance recorded as long-term debt.
There was $0 outstanding on the Revolving Credit Facility and $17,302,000 outstanding letters of credit as of March 31, 2021. The outstanding letters of credit at March 31, 2021 consisted of $537,000 in commercial letters of credit and $16,765,000 of standby letters of credit.
The gross balance of deferred financing costs on the term loan was $14,690,000 as of March 31, 2021 and 2020. The accumulated amortization balances were $8,744,000 and $6,645,000 as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
The gross balance of deferred financing costs associated with the Revolving Credit Facility is included in Other assets is $3,615,000 as of March 31, 2021 and $2,789,000 as of March 31, 2020. The accumulated amortization balance is $2,313,000 and $1,766,000 as of March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020 respectively. These balances are classified in Other assets since no funds were drawn on the Revolving Credit Facility as of March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020.
Non-U.S. Lines of Credit and Loans
Unsecured and uncommitted lines of credit are available to meet short-term working capital needs for certain of our subsidiaries operating outside of the U.S. The lines of credit are available on an offering basis, meaning that transactions under the line of credit will be on such terms and conditions, including interest rate, maturity, representations, covenants, and events of default, as mutually agreed between our subsidiaries and the local bank at the time of each specific transaction. As of March 31, 2021, unsecured credit lines totaled approximately $2,580,000, of which $0 was drawn. In addition, unsecured lines of $15,478,000 were available for bank guarantees issued in the normal course of business of which $12,598,000 was utilized.
Debt - Key Terms subsequent to March 31, 2021
As discussed in Note 3 to our March 31, 2021 consolidated financial statements, on April 7, 2021, the Company completed its acquisition of Dorner for $485,000,000 on a cash-free, debt-free basis with a working capital adjustment.
To finance the Dorner acquisition, on April 7, 2021 the Company entered into a $750,000,000 credit facility ("First Lien Facilities") with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ("JPMorgan Chase Bank"), PNC Capital Markets LLC, and Wells Fargo Securities LLC. The First Lien Facilities consist of a Revolving Facility (the “New Revolving Credit Facility”) in an aggregate amount of $100,000,000 and a $650,000,000 First Lien Term Facility ("Bridge Facility"). Proceeds from the Bridge Facility were used, among other things, to finance the purchase price for the Dorner acquisition, pay related fees, expenses and transaction costs, and refinance the Company's borrowings under its prior Term Loan and Revolver.
The key terms of the First Lien Facility are as follows:
1) Bridge Facility: An aggregate $650,000,000 Bridge Facility which requires quarterly principal amortization of 0.25% with the remaining principal due at maturity date. In addition, if the Company has Excess Cash Flow (ECF) as defined in the Credit Agreement, the ECF Percentage of the Excess Cash Flow for each fiscal year minus optional prepayments of the Loans (except
prepayments of Revolving Loans that are not accompanied by a corresponding permanent reduction of Revolving Commitments) pursuant to Section 2.10(a) of the Credit Agreement other than to the extent that any such prepayment is funded with the proceeds of Funded Debt, shall be applied toward the prepayment of the Bridge Facility. The ECF Percentage is defined as 50% stepping down to 25% or 0% based on the achievement of specified Secured Leverage Ratios as of the last day of such fiscal year.
2) Revolver: An aggregate $100,000,000 secured revolving facility which includes sublimits for the issuance of standby letters of credit, swingline loans and multi-currency borrowings in certain specified foreign currencies.
3) Fees and Interest Rates: Commitment fees and interest rates are determined on the basis of either a Eurocurrency rate or a Base rate plus an applicable margin, which is based upon the Company's Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) in the case of Revolver loans.
4) Prepayments: Provisions permitting a Borrower to voluntarily prepay either the Bridge Facility or Revolver in whole or in part at any time, and provisions requiring certain mandatory prepayments of the Bridge Facility or Revolver on the occurrence of certain events which will permanently reduce the commitments under the Credit Agreement, each without premium or penalty, subject to reimbursement of certain costs of the Lenders. A prepayment premium of 1% of the principal amount of the First Lien Term Facility is required if the prepayment is associated with a Repricing Transaction and it were to occur within the first six months following the closing date.
5) Covenants: Provisions containing covenants required of the Corporation and its subsidiaries including various affirmative and negative financial and operational covenants. The key financial covenant is triggered only on any date when any Extension of Credit under the Revolving Facility is outstanding (excluding any Letters of Credit) (the “Covenant Trigger”), and prohibits the Total Leverage Ratio for the Reference Period ended on such date from exceeding (i) 6.75:1.00 as of any date of determination prior to June 30, 2021, (ii) 5.75:1.00 as of any date of determination on June 30, 2021 and thereafter but prior to June 30, 2022, (iii) 4.75:1.00 as of any date of determination on June 30, 2022 and thereafter but prior to June 30, 2023 and (iv)
3.50:1.00 as of any date of determination on June 30, 2023 and thereafter.
6) Collateral: Obligations under the First Lien Facilities are secured by liens on substantially all assets of the Company and its material domestic subsidiaries.
Debt and equity issuance costs were not material in fiscal 2021.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company expects to incur $6,272,000 in debt extinguishment costs, of which $5,946,000 relates to the Company's prior Term Loan and $326,000 relates to the Company's prior Revolver. These costs will be classified as Cost of debt refinancing in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Further, in fiscal 2022 the Company expects to record $5,432,000 in deferred financing costs on the First Lien Term Facility, which will be amortized over seven years. The Company expects to record $4,027,000 in deferred financings costs on the New Revolver, of which $3,050,000 is related to the new Revolver and $977,000 is carried over from the Company's prior Revolver as certain Revolver lenders increased their borrowing capacity. These balances will be amortized over five years and classified in Other assets since no funds are expected to be drawn on the New Revolver in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.
In addition to the debt borrowing described above, the Company commenced an underwritten public offering of 4,312,500 shares of its common stock at a price of $48.00 per share for total gross proceeds of $207,000,000. The Company used all of the net proceeds from the equity offering to repay in part outstanding borrowings under its Bridge Facility. The equity offering closed on May 4, 2021. Following the repayment, the Bridge Facility was refinanced with a Term Loan B facility. The terms of the Term Loan B facility are similar to the terms for the Bridge Facility with the exception of the limits related to the financial covenants which are triggered only on any date when any Extension of Credit under the Revolving Facility is outstanding. The Term Loan B prohibits the Total Leverage Ratio on such date from exceeding (i) 6.75:1.00 as of any date of determination prior to June 30, 2021, (ii) 5.50:1.00 as of any date of determination on June 30, 2021 and thereafter but prior to June 30, 2022, (iii) 4.50:1.00 as of any date of determination on June 30, 2022 and thereafter but prior to June 30, 2023 and (iv) 3.50:1.00 as of any date of determination on June 30, 2023 and thereafter.
Fees paid on the portion of the First Lien Facilities that were associated with the Bridge Facility are expected to be expensed as part of Cost of debt refinancing in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the amount of $8,531,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
The following table reflects a summary of our expected future cash outflows associated with contractual obligations in effect as of March 31, 2021:
(a)As described above, subsequent to March 31, 2021, the Company refinanced its Term Loan and Revolver in connection with its purchase of Dorner. The new required annual principal payments (taking into account the completion of the Company’s underwritten public common stock offering and associated use of proceeds for the repayment of amounts outstanding under the First Lien Term Facilities) will be $4,500,000 plus a required excess cash sweep on the $450,000,000 Term Loan B facility.
(b)Estimated for our Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility and interest rate swaps as described in Note 10 and Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements. Calculated using a Eurocurrency rate of 1.00% plus an applicable margin of 2.50%.
(c)As described in Note 18 to consolidated financial statements.
(d)As described in Note 13 to consolidated financial statements.
We have no additional off-balance sheet obligations that are not reflected above.
CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
In addition to keeping our current equipment and plants properly maintained, we are committed to replacing, enhancing, and upgrading our property, plant and equipment to support new product development, improve productivity and customer responsiveness, reduce production costs, increase flexibility to respond effectively to market fluctuations and changes, meet environmental requirements, and enhance safety. Our capital expenditures for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 were $12,300,000, $9,432,000, and $12,288,000 respectively. Excluded from fiscal 2021 capital expenditures is $730,000, $365,000, and $227,000 in property, plant and equipment purchases included in accounts payable at March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. We expect capital expenditure spending in fiscal 2022 to range from $20,000,000 to $25,000,000, of which $3,000,000 to $4,000,000 is attributable to Dorner.
INFLATION AND OTHER MARKET CONDITIONS
Our costs are affected by inflation in the U.S. economy and, to a lesser extent, in non-U.S. economies including those of Europe, Canada, Mexico, South America, and Asia-Pacific. We do not believe that general inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations over the periods presented primarily due to overall low inflation levels over such periods and our ability to generally pass on rising costs through annual price increases. However, increases in U.S. employee benefits costs such as health insurance and workers compensation insurance have exceeded general inflation levels. In the future, we may be further affected by inflation that we may not be able to pass on as price increases. With changes in worldwide demand for steel and fluctuating scrap steel prices over the past several years, we experienced fluctuations in our costs that we have reflected as price increases to our customers. We believe we have been successful in instituting price increases to pass on these material cost increases. We will continue to monitor our costs and reevaluate our pricing policies.
SEASONALITY AND QUARTERLY RESULTS
Our quarterly results may be materially affected by the timing of large customer orders, periods of high vacation and holiday concentrations, restructuring charges, and other costs attributable to plan closures as well as divestitures and acquisitions. Therefore, our operating results for any particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for the full fiscal year.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We continually evaluate the estimates and their underlying assumptions, which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities. Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates. If interpreted differently under different conditions or circumstances, changes in our estimates could result in material changes to our reported results. We have identified below the accounting policies involving estimates that are critical to our financial statements. Other accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements.
Insurance Reserves. Our accrued general and product liability reserves as described in Note 16 to consolidated financial statements involve actuarial techniques including the methods selected to estimate ultimate claims, and assumptions including emergence patterns, payment patterns, initial expected losses, and increased limit factors. These actuarial estimates are subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to a variety of factors, including extended lag time in the reporting and resolution of claims, trends or changes in claim settlement patterns, insurance industry practices, and legal interpretations. Changes to these estimates could result in material changes to the amount of expense and liabilities recorded in our financial statements. Further, actual costs could differ significantly from the estimated amounts. Adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs. Other insurance reserves such as workers compensation and group health insurance are based on actual historical and current claim data provided by third party administrators or internally maintained.
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing. Our goodwill balance of $331,176,000 as of March 31, 2021 is subject to impairment testing. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually, as of the end of February, and more frequently whenever events occur or circumstances change that indicate there may be impairment. These events or circumstances could include a significant long-term adverse change in the business climate, poor indicators of operating performance, or a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.
We test goodwill at the reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segment. We identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segment constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components. We also aggregate components that have similar economic characteristics into single reporting units (for example, similar products and / or services, similar long-term financial results, product processes, classes of customers, or in circumstances where the components share assets or other resources and have other economic interdependencies). We have four reporting units, only two of which have goodwill. The Duff-Norton and Rest of Products reporting units have goodwill totaling $9,699,000, and $321,477,000, respectively, at March 31, 2021.
Annual Goodwill Impairment Test
When we evaluate the potential for goodwill impairment, we assess a range of qualitative factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for our products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors such as strategy, and changes in key personnel and overall financial performance. If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we proceed to a quantitative impairment test. We also proceed to the quantitative model when economic or other business factors indicate that the fair value of our reporting units may have declined since our last quantitative test. We performed the qualitative assessment as of February 28, 2021 and determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units was less than that its applicable carrying value. Accordingly, we did not perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test for any of our reporting units during fiscal 2021.
We further test our indefinite-lived intangible asset balance of $47,857,000 consisting of trademarks on our acquisitions on an annual basis for impairment. Similar to goodwill, we first assess various qualitative factors in the analysis. If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, we proceed to a quantitative impairment test. We performed the qualitative assessment as of February 28, 2021 and determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of our indefinite-lived intangible assets was less than that its applicable carrying value.
