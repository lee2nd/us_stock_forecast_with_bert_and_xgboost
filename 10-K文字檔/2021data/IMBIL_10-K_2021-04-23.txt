Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Introduction
The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is qualified by reference to and should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. This annual report on Form 10-K, including the following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, may contain certain “forward-looking” information within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. This information involves risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Discussion, analysis and comparisons of Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2019 that are not included in this report can be found in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 1, 2020.
Overview
Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business
In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have focused on taking necessary steps to keep our employees, contractors, vendors, customers, guests, and their families safe during these uncertain times. Throughout the pandemic, we have mandated that non-essential personnel work from home, reduced the number of personnel who are allowed in our facilities and on our production sets, and implemented increased cleaning protocols, social distancing measures, and temperature screenings for those personnel who enter our facilities. We have also mandated that all essential personnel who do not feel comfortable coming to work will not be required to do so. We have experienced certain disruptions in our business due to these modifications and resource constraints. Restrictions on travel have also negatively impacted the availability of some of our on-air experts and has eliminated our ability to produce remote broadcasts. We have also experienced longer ship times in our transportation network, which has driven increased calls into our customer service center and increased wait times.
In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, we reduced spending broadly across the Company, only proceeding with operating and capital spending that is critical. In addition, we eliminated positions across the ShopHQ segment during the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the majority of which were in customer service, order fulfillment, and television production. We developed contingency plans to reduce costs further if the situation deteriorates. We will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state, or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers and shareholders. As a result, at the time of this filing, the COVID-19 pandemic remains fluid and we are unable to determine or predict the overall impact it will have on our business, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources.
Despite these past and potential adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe it has impacted our business less than other media companies because of our direct-to-consumer business model that serves home-bound consumers seeking to buy goods without leaving the safety of their homes. As a result, beginning at the end of March 2020 and continuing through the third quarter of 2020, we observed an increase in demand for merchandise within our beauty & wellness product category, particularly in health products, and decreases in demand for merchandise within our fashion category and higher priced merchandise within our jewelry category. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we shifted airtime into higher priced merchandise in our jewelry category, as we observed a rebound in demand, and decreased airtime in health related products in our beauty & wellness product category. We have continued to offer our installment payment option. While we expect demand for our products will continue, we cannot estimate the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business in the future due to the unpredictable nature of the ultimate scope and duration of the pandemic. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, there is risk of changes in consumer demand, consumer spending patterns, and changes in consumer tastes which may adversely affect our operating results.
Summary Results for Fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018
Consolidated net sales during fiscal 2020 were $454.2 million compared to $501.8 million during fiscal 2019, a 9% decrease. Consolidated net sales during fiscal 2019 were $501.8 million compared to $596.6 million during fiscal 2018, a 16% decrease. We reported an operating loss of $7.9 million and a net loss of $13.2 million for fiscal 2020. The operating loss and net loss for fiscal 2020 included restructuring costs of $715,000 and transaction, settlement and integration costs totaling $1.2 million. We reported an operating loss of $52.5 million and a net loss of $56.3 million for fiscal 2019. The operating loss and net loss for fiscal 2019 included restructuring costs of $9.2 million; a non-cash inventory write-down of $6.1 million; executive and management transition costs of $2.7 million; rebranding costs of $1.3 million; and transaction, settlement and integration costs, net, totaling $694,000. We reported an operating loss of $18.6 million and a net loss of $22.2 million for fiscal 2018. The operating loss and net loss for fiscal 2018 included executive and management transition costs of $2.1 million; transaction, settlement and integrations costs of $1.5 million; and a gain of $665,000 related to the sale of our Boston television station.
Public Equity Offering
On August 28, 2020, we completed a public offering, in which we issued and sold 2,760,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $6.25 per share, including 360,000 shares sold upon the exercise of the underwriter’s option to purchase additional shares. After underwriter discounts and commissions and other offering costs, net proceeds from the public offering were approximately $15.8 million. We are using the proceeds for general working capital purposes.
Private Placement
On April 14, 2020, we entered into a common stock and warrant purchase agreement with certain individuals and entities, pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of 1,836,314 shares of our common stock, issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 979,190 shares of our common stock at a price of $2.66 per share, and fully-paid warrants to purchase an aggregate 114,698 shares of our common stock at a price of $0.001 per share in a private placement, for an aggregate cash purchase price of $4.0 million. The initial closing occurred on April 17, 2020 and we received gross proceeds of $1.5 million. The additional closings occurred on May 22, 2020, June 8, 2020, June 12, 2020 and July 11, 2020 and we received aggregate gross proceeds of $2.5 million. We have used the proceeds for general working capital purposes.
The purchasers consisted of the following: Invicta Media Investments, LLC, Michael and Leah Friedman and Hacienda Jackson LLC. Invicta Media Investments, LLC is owned by Invicta Watch Company of America, Inc. (“IWCA”), which is the designer and manufacturer of Invicta-branded watches and watch accessories, one of our largest and longest
tenured brands. Michael and Leah Friedman are owners and officers of Sterling Time, LLC, which is the exclusive distributor of IWCA’s watches and watch accessories for television home shopping and our long-time vendor. IWCA is owned by our Vice Chair and director, Eyal Lalo, and Michael Friedman also serves as a director of our company. A description of the relationship between the Company, IWCA and Sterling Time is contained in Note 19 - “Related Party Transactions” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Further, Invicta Media Investments, LLC and Michael and Leah Friedman comprise a “group” of investors within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that is our largest shareholder.
The warrants have an exercise price per share of $2.66 and are exercisable at any time and from time to time from six months following their issuance date until April 14, 2025. We have included a blocker provision in the purchase agreement whereby no purchaser may be issued shares of our common stock if the purchaser would own over 19.999% of our outstanding common stock and, to the extent a purchaser in this offering would own over 19.999% of our outstanding common stock, that purchaser will receive fully-paid warrants (in contrast to the coverage warrants that will be issued in this transaction, as described above) in lieu of the shares that would place such holder’s ownership over 19.999%. Further, we included a similar blocker in the warrants (and amended the warrants purchased by the purchasers on May 2, 2019, if any) whereby no purchaser of the warrants may exercise a warrant if the holder would own over 19.999% of our outstanding common stock.
Restructuring Costs
During fiscal 2020, the Company implemented and completed another cost optimization initiative, which eliminated positions across the ShopHQ segment, the majority of which were in customer service, order fulfillment and television production. As a result of the fiscal 2020 cost optimization initiative, we recorded restructuring charges of $715,000 for fiscal 2020, which relate primarily to severance and other incremental costs associated with the consolidation and elimination of positions across the ShopHQ segment. These initiatives were substantially completed as of January 30, 2021, with related cash payments expected to continue through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. The fiscal 2020 optimization initiative is expected to eliminate approximately $16 million in annual overhead costs.
Results of Operations
The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of net sales.
Key Operating Metrics
(a) Digital net sales percentage is calculated based on net sales that are generated from our transactional websites and mobile platforms, which are primarily ordered directly online.
Program Distribution
ShopHQ reached more than 80 million homes as of January 30, 2021. We continue to increase the number of channels on existing distribution platforms and alternative distribution methods, including reaching deals to launch our programming on high definition ("HD") channels. We believe that our distribution strategy of pursuing additional channels in productive homes already receiving our programming is a more balanced approach to growing our business than merely adding new television homes in untested areas. We believe that having an HD feed of our service allows us to attract new viewers and customers.
Television Distribution Rights
During fiscal 2020, we entered into certain affiliation agreements with television providers for carriage of our television programming over their systems, including channel placement rights. As a result, we recorded a television distribution rights asset of $43.7 million. The liability relating to the television distribution rights was $36.5 million as of January 30, 2021, of which $29.2 million was classified as current. We believe having favorable channel positioning within the general entertainment area on the distributor's channel line-up impacts our sales. We believe that a portion of our sales is attributable to purchases resulting from channel "surfing" and that a channel position near popular cable networks increases the likelihood of such purchases. See Note 2 - “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion on our accounting policy for television distribution rights.
Net Shipped Units
The number of net shipped units (shipped units less returned units) during fiscal 2020 decreased 5% from fiscal 2019 to 6.5 million from 6.9 million. The number of net shipped units during fiscal 2019 decreased 26% from fiscal 2018 to 6.9 million from 9.2 million. The decrease in the net shipped units during fiscal 2020 was driven primarily by a decrease in consolidated net sales, partially offset by a mix shift into health products within our beauty & wellness product category. The decrease in net units shipped during fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by a decrease in consolidated net sales and by offering a higher average selling price in our jewelry & watches and home & consumer electronics product categories. The decrease in net shipped units during fiscal 2019 was also driven by shifting our merchandise mix out of fashion & accessories, which is a high unit volume sales category.
Average Selling Price
The average selling price ("ASP") per net unit was $61 in fiscal 2020, a 6% decrease from fiscal 2019. The decrease in the ASP during fiscal 2020 was primarily driven by a mix shift into health products within our beauty & wellness product category, which was a lower ASP assortment. For fiscal 2019, the ASP was $65, a 12% increase from fiscal 2018. The increase in the ASP during fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by a mix shift into jewelry & watches from our fashion & accessories category, combined with ASP increases in our jewelry & watches and home & consumer electronics product categories.
Product Return Rates
Our product return rate was 14.8% in fiscal 2020 compared to 19.4% in fiscal 2019, a 460 bps decrease. The decrease in the fiscal 2020 return rate was driven by return rate decreases in all product categories, primarily in our jewelry & watches and beauty & wellness product categories. The decrease in the return rate was additionally driven by a sales mix shift out of jewelry and into beauty & wellness, which has a lower return rate. Our return rate was 19.4% in fiscal 2019 and 19.0% in fiscal 2018. We continue to monitor our product return rates in an effort to keep our overall product return rates commensurate with our current product mix and our average selling price levels.
Total Customers
Total customers is determined by counting the total customers who made a purchase during the prior 12 months. Total customers during the last twelve months, as of January 30, 2021, decreased 2% from the prior year to approximately 1,020,000. Total customers purchasing over the last twelve months, as of February 1, 2020, decreased 14% from the prior year to 1,041,000.
Total customers have declined for the last six years, primarily driven by decreases in attracting new customers compared to the prior year. Although we increased our new customers during fiscal 2020 compared to the prior year, we are continually working on reversing this trend by implementing the following initiatives, among others, to increase our active customer file:
● introducing by appointment viewing “static programming,” so viewers know when to tune in;
● launching innovative programming, such as “Learning to Cook with Shaq,” “Fashion Talk with Fatima,” and “GemHQ”; and
● establishing category specific customer growth priorities around ASP, product assortment and product margins.
Net Sales
Consolidated net sales, inclusive of shipping and handling revenue, for fiscal 2020 were $454.2 million, a 9% decrease from consolidated net sales of $501.8 million for fiscal 2019. Consolidated net sales, inclusive of shipping and handling revenue, for fiscal 2019 were $501.8 million, a 16% decrease from consolidated net sales of $596.6 million for fiscal 2018.
Net Sales Trends
During fiscal 2020 and 2019, our consolidated net sales, inclusive of shipping and handling revenue, decreased 9% and 16%, which continued a multi-year trend of net sales decreases. Our continued decrease in net sales was primarily driven by a 2% and 14% decline in our 12-month active customer file (as discussed under “Total Customers” above). This trend has been a significant driver of our sales decreases over the prior two years.
Fiscal 2020 Consolidated Net Sales Compared to Fiscal 2019
Jewelry & Watches: The $38.9 million decrease in jewelry & watches was primarily due to decreased airtime of 13%. The decrease was additionally driven by reduced productivity (sales per on-air minute) from a declining active customer file during fiscal 2020. Jewelry & watches continues to be our most productive category. The airtime decreases in jewelry & watches was primarily within jewelry, as we shifted airtime into beauty & wellness as a result of increased demand for health-related products during the second, third and fourth quarters.
Home & Consumer Electronics: The $43.1 million decrease was driven by a 33% reduction in airtime during fiscal 2020 and a declining active customer file.
Beauty & Wellness: The $43.3 million increase in fiscal 2020 was driven by increased active customers. The increase was also driven by increased airtime of 78% during fiscal 2020.
Fashion & Accessories: The $20.4 million decrease was driven by a decreased active customer base and an overall softness in this product category. The decrease was additionally driven by reduced airtime of 19%.
Other: The $0.1 million increase was driven by increased revenue from monthly subscriptions to the ShopHQ VIP customer program, mostly offset by decreased shipping & handling revenue resulting from the 5% decrease in net shipped units.
Emerging Businesses: The $11.3 million increase was driven by revenue from business initiatives commencing within or following the comparable prior year period, such as our third-party logistics services (i3PL), ShopBulldogTV, OurGalleria.com, and recently acquired businesses, J.W. Hulme and Float Left. Additionally, revenue for fiscal 2020 includes the results from ShopHQHealth, which launched during the third quarter of fiscal 2020. The increase was partially offset by reduced sales from our niche website, princetonwatches.com.
Digital and Mobile Net Sales
We believe that our television shopping program is a key driver of traffic to both our website and mobile applications whereby many of the online sales originate from customers viewing our television program and then placing their orders online or through mobile devices. Our digital sales penetration, or, the percentage of ShopHQ net sales that are generated from our website and mobile platforms, which are primarily ordered directly online, was 50.8% in fiscal 2020 as compared to 52.7% in fiscal 2019 and 53.1% in fiscal 2018. Overall, we continue to deliver strong digital sales penetration. Our mobile penetration decreased to 55.5% of total digital orders during fiscal 2020 versus 57.3% and 54.0% of total digital orders during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018.
Gross Profit
Consolidated gross profit for fiscal 2020 was $167.1 million, an increase of 2%, compared to $163.6 million for fiscal 2019. ShopHQ’s gross profit decreased $2.6 million, or 2% compared to fiscal 2019. The decrease in ShopHQ’s gross profit during fiscal 2020 was primarily driven by the 12% decrease in net sales (as discussed above), partially offset by higher gross profit percentages experienced in most product categories during fiscal 2020. ShopHQ’s fiscal 2019 gross profit includes a non-cash inventory impairment write-down of $6.1 million. Emerging's gross profit increased $6.0 million compared to fiscal 2019 and was primarily driven by the increase in net sales (as discussed above).
Consolidated gross margin percentages for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 were 36.8% and 32.6%, which represents a 420 basis point increase. ShopHQ's gross margin percentages fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 were 36.6% and 32.8%, which represent a 380 basis point increase. The increase in ShopHQ’s gross margin percentage reflects the following: a 210 basis point margin increase attributable to increased gross profit rates in most product categories, primarily jewelry & watches and home & consumer electronics; a 140 basis point margin increase attributable to a shift into our beauty & wellness category, which typically has a higher margin; a 40 basis point increase due to higher shipping and handling margins; and
a 10 basis point increase attributable to decreased inventory write-offs. The category gross profit rates were positively impacted by more disciplined pricing and markdown execution. Emerging's gross margin percentages for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 were 40.3% and 14.5%. The increase in the Emerging gross margin percentage reflects business initiatives commencing within or following the comparable prior year period, such as i3PL, ShopBulldogTV, ShopHQHealth, and recently acquired businesses, J.W. Hulme and Float Left.
Operating Expenses
Total operating expenses were $175.0 million, $216.2 million and $225.5 million for fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, representing a decrease of $41.2 million or 19% from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020, and a decrease of $9.3 million, or 4% from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019. Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were 38.5%, 43.1% and 37.8% for fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018. Total operating expense for fiscal 2020 included restructuring costs of $715,000. Total operating expense for fiscal 2019 included restructuring costs of $9.2 million; executive and management transition costs of $2.7 million and rebranding costs of $1.3 million. Total operating expenses for fiscal 2018 included executive and management transition costs of $2.1 million and a gain of $665,000 from the sale of our Boston television station. Excluding restructuring costs, executive and management transition costs and the gain on sale of television station, total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were 38.4%, 40.7% and 37.5% for fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018.
Distribution and selling expense for fiscal 2020 decreased $40.7 million, or 24%, to $129.9 million or 28.6% of net sales compared to $170.6 million or 34.0% of net sales in fiscal 2019. Distribution and selling expense decreased during fiscal 2020 due to decreased program distribution expense of $25.6 million, decreased variable expenses of $9.6 million, decreased salaries and benefits of $6.1 million, decreased online selling and search fees of $905,000, decreased travel expense of $444,000, decreased direct mail advertising of $350,000, decreased production expense of $204,000, and integration costs included in the comparable prior year period of $383,000 relating to the start-up of our third party logistics business and launch of our customer loyalty program, called ShopHQ VIP. The decrease from the comparable prior period was partially offset by increased accrued incentive compensation of $1.6 million and a $1.5 million gain included in the comparable prior year period related to proceeds on the sale of our claim related to the Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation class action lawsuit. The decrease in program distribution expense was driven by renegotiated agreements with certain cable and satellite distributors resulting in lower rates, a decrease in access fees attributable to a lower average number of homes receiving our programming, and by acquiring television distribution rights in lieu of continuing monthly subscriber fee obligations. The decrease in variable costs was primarily driven by decreased variable fulfillment and customer service salaries and wages of $5.6 million and decreased variable credit card processing fees and bad debt expense of $4.4 million, partially offset by increased customer service telecommunications expense of $474,000. Total variable expenses during fiscal 2020 were approximately 8.5% of total net sales versus 9.5% of total net sales for the prior year comparable period.
To the extent that our ASP changes, our variable expense as a percentage of net sales could be impacted as the number of our shipped units change. Program distribution expense is primarily a fixed cost per household, however, this expense may be impacted by changes in the number of average homes or channels reached or by rate changes associated with changes in our channel position with carriers.
General and administrative expense for fiscal 2020 decreased $5.3 million, or 21%, to $20.3 million, or 4.5% of net sales compared to $25.6 million or 5.1% of net sales in fiscal 2019. For fiscal 2020, the decrease in general and administrative expense was primarily due to decreased salaries of $2.8 million, decreased share-based compensation expense of $1.3 million, decreased rebranding costs of $1.3 million, decreased contract settlement costs of $602,000, decreased travel expense of $155,000, decreased costs of $121,000 related to costs included in the comparable prior year period to amend our Articles of Incorporation and to effect a one-for-ten reverse stock split of our common stock, and decreased transaction and integration costs of $94,000. The decrease from the comparable period was partially offset by increased accrued incentive compensation of $720,000 and increased costs of $183,000 related to consulting fees incurred to explore additional loan financings and incremental COVID-19 legal costs.
Depreciation and amortization expense was $24.0 million, $8.1 million and $6.2 million for fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, representing an increase of $16.0 million, or 198% from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020 and an increase of $1.8 million, or 29% from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019. Depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of net sales was 5.3% for fiscal 2020, 1.6% for fiscal 2019 and 1.0% for fiscal 2018. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal 2020 was primarily due to increased amortization expense of $16.9 million related to the channel placement
rights obtained during fiscal 2020, increased amortization expense of $309,000 related to the intangible assets acquired during our fourth quarter fiscal 2019 business acquisitions, and increased depreciation expense of $30,000 resulting from an average net increase in our non-fulfillment depreciable asset base year over year. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal 2020 was partially offset by decreased amortization expense of $1.3 million relating primarily to the accelerated amortization of the Evine trademark in fiscal 2019.
Operating Loss
We reported an operating loss of $7.9 million in fiscal 2020 compared to an operating loss of $52.5 million for fiscal 2019. ShopHQ and Emerging reported operating losses of $3.6 million and $4.3 million for fiscal 2020 compared to $47.0 million and $5.6 million for fiscal 2019. For fiscal 2020, ShopHQ’s operating loss improved primarily as a result of decreases in distribution and selling expense, restructuring costs, general and administrative expense, and executive and management transition costs. ShopHQ's operating loss also improved due to the non-cash inventory write-down of $6.1 million during the comparable prior period. The improvement in ShopHQ's operating loss was partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization expense and decreased gross profit driven by decreased net sales. Emerging's operating loss improved during fiscal 2020 primarily from an increase in gross profit of $6.0 million driven by an increase in net sales and decreased restructuring costs of $938,000. The improvement in Emerging’s operating loss was partially offset by increased distribution and selling expense of $3.8 million and increased general and administrative expense of $1.8 million.
Interest Expense
Total interest expense for fiscal 2020 increased $1.5 million, or 39%, to $5.2 million compared to $3.8 million for fiscal 2019. During fiscal 2020, we recorded liabilities relating to television distribution rights, which represent the present value of payments for the television channel placement rights. The interest expense recorded during fiscal 2020 includes interest expense of $1.4 million imputed on our television distribution rights obligation. The total television distribution rights liability was $36.5 million as of January 30, 2021, of which $29.2 million was classified as current in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Estimated interest expense related to the television distribution obligation is $1.3 million for fiscal 2021 and $212,000 for fiscal 2022. The increase in interest rate expense for fiscal 2020 was additionally driven by increased vendor financing interest of $277,000, partially offset by a lower average balance outstanding on our PNC Credit Facility, an impact of approximately $320,000.
Income Taxes
For fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, our net loss reflects an income tax provision of $60,000, $11,000 and $65,000, which relates to state income taxes payable on certain income for which there is no loss carryforward benefit available. We have not recorded any income tax benefit on the losses recorded during fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 due to the uncertainty of realizing income tax benefits in the future as indicated by our recording of an income tax valuation allowance. Based on our recent history of losses, a full valuation allowance has been recorded and was calculated in accordance with GAAP, which places primary importance on our most recent operating results when assessing the need for a valuation allowance. We will continue to maintain a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets, including those related to net operating loss carryforwards, until we believe it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized in the future.
Net Loss
For fiscal 2020, we reported a net loss of $13.2 million, or $1.23 per basic and dilutive share, on 10,745,916 weighted average common shares outstanding. For fiscal 2019, we reported a net loss of $56.3 million, or $7.54 per basic and dilutive share, on 7,462,380 weighted average common shares outstanding. For fiscal 2018 we reported a net loss of $22.2 million or $3.35 per basic and dilutive share, on 6,607,321 weighted average common shares outstanding. Net loss for fiscal 2020 includes restructuring costs of $715,000; interest expense of $5.2 million; and transaction, settlement and integrations costs totaling $1.2 million. Net loss for fiscal 2019 includes restructuring costs of $9.2 million; a non-cash inventory write-down of $6.1 million; executive and management transition costs of $2.7 million; rebranding costs of $1.3 million; interest expense of $3.8 million; and transaction, settlement and integrations costs, net, totaling $694,000. Net loss for fiscal 2018 includes executive and management transition costs of $2.1 million, contract termination costs of $753,000, business development and expansion costs of $796,000, a gain on the sale of our Boston television station of $665,000, and interest expense of $3.5 million.
Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation
Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) for fiscal 2020 was $23.9 million compared with Adjusted EBITDA of $(18.4) million for fiscal 2019 and $(2.4) million for fiscal 2018.
A reconciliation of the comparable GAAP measure, net income (loss), to Adjusted EBITDA follows, in thousands:
(a) Includes distribution facility depreciation of $4.0 million, $4.0 million and $3.9 million for the years ended January 30, 2021, February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019. Distribution facility depreciation is included as a component of cost of sales within the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The year ended January 30, 2021 includes amortization expense related to the television distribution rights totaling $16.9 million.
(b) EBITDA as defined for this statistical presentation represents net income (loss) for the respective periods excluding depreciation and amortization expense, interest income (expense) and income taxes. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding non-operating gains (losses); transaction, settlement and integration costs, net; restructuring costs; non-cash impairment charges and write downs; executive and management transition costs; rebranding costs; gain on sale of television station; and non-cash share-based compensation expense.
(c) Transaction, settlement and integration costs for the year ended January 30, 2021 include consulting fees incurred to explore additional loan financings, settlement costs, professional fees related to the TheCloseOut.com transaction, and incremental COVID-19 related legal costs. Transaction, settlement and integration costs, net, for year ended February 1, 2020 includes contract settlement costs of $1.2 million; business acquisition and integration-related costs of $246,000 to acquire Float Left and J.W. Hulme; costs incurred related to the implementation of our ShopHQ VIP customer loyalty program and our third-party logistics service offerings of $658,000, costs incurred to amend our Articles of Incorporation and to effect a one-for-ten reverse stock split of our common stock of $121,000, partially offset by a $1.5 million gain for the sale of our claim related to the Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation class action lawsuit. Transaction, settlement and integration costs for the year ended February 2, 2019 includes business development and expansion costs of $796,000 and contract termination costs of $753,000.
We have included the term "Adjusted EBITDA" in our EBITDA reconciliation in order to adequately assess the operating performance of our video and digital businesses and in order to maintain comparability to our analyst’s coverage and financial guidance, when given. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA allows investors to make a meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time with those of other similar
companies. In addition, management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a metric measure to evaluate operating performance under our management and executive incentive compensation programs. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to operating income (loss), net income (loss) or to cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be construed as a measure of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly entitled measures reported by other companies.
Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of January 30, 2021, we had cash of $15.5 million. In addition, under the PNC Credit Facility, we are required to maintain a minimum of $10 million of unrestricted cash plus unused line availability at all times. As of February 1, 2020, we had cash of $10.3 million. During fiscal 2020, working capital increased $191,000 to $33.7 million compared to working capital of $33.5 million for fiscal 2019 (see "Cash Requirements" below for additional information on changes in working capital accounts). The current ratio (our total current assets divided by total current liabilities) was 1.2 at January 30, 2021 and 1.3 at February 1, 2020.
Sources of Liquidity
Our principal source of liquidity is our available cash and our additional borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility with PNC Bank, N.A. ("PNC"), a member of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. As of January 30, 2021, we had cash of $15.5 million and additional borrowing capacity of $12.6 million. Our cash was held in bank depository accounts primarily for the preservation of cash liquidity.
PNC Credit Facility
On February 9, 2012, we entered into a credit and security agreement (as amended through February 5, 2021, the "PNC Credit Facility") with PNC, as lender and agent. The PNC Credit Facility, which includes CIBC Bank USA (formerly known as The Private Bank) as part of the facility, provides a revolving line of credit of $70.0 million and provides for a term loan on which we had originally drawn to fund improvements at our distribution facility in Bowling Green, Kentucky and to partially pay down our previously outstanding term loan with GACP Finance Co., LLC. All borrowings under the PNC Credit Facility mature and are payable on July 27, 2023. Subject to certain conditions, the PNC Credit Facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount up to $6.0 million which, upon issuance, would be deemed advances under the PNC Credit Facility. The PNC Credit Facility also provides for an accordion feature that would allow us to expand the size of the revolving line of credit by an additional $20.0 million at the discretion of the lenders and upon certain conditions being met. Maximum borrowings and available capacity under the revolving line of credit under the PNC Credit Facility are equal to the lesser of $70.0 million or a calculated borrowing base comprised of eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory.
The revolving line of credit under the PNC Credit Facility bears interest at either a Base Rate or LIBOR plus a margin consisting of between 2% and 3.5% on Base Rate advances and 3% and 4.5% on LIBOR advances based on our trailing twelve-month reported leverage ratio (as defined in the PNC Credit Facility) measured semi-annually as demonstrated in our financial statements. The term loan bears interest at either a Base Rate or LIBOR plus a margin consisting of between 4% and 5% on Base Rate term loans and 5% to 6% on LIBOR Rate term loans based on our leverage ratio measured annually as demonstrated in our audited financial statements.
As of January 30, 2021, we had borrowings of $41.0 million under our revolving line of credit. As of January 30, 2021, the term loan under the PNC Credit Facility had $12.4 million outstanding, of which $2.7 million was classified as current in the accompanying balance sheet. Remaining available capacity under the revolving credit facility as of January 30, 2021 was approximately $12.6 million, which provides liquidity for working capital and general corporate purposes. In addition, as of January 30, 2021, our unrestricted cash plus unused line availability was $28.0 million, we were in compliance with applicable financial covenants of the PNC Credit Facility and expect to be in compliance with applicable financial covenants over the next twelve months.
Principal borrowings under the term loan are payable in monthly installments over an 84-month amortization period that commenced on September 1, 2018 and are also subject to mandatory prepayment in certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, upon receipt of certain proceeds from dispositions of collateral. Borrowings under the term loan are also subject to mandatory prepayment in an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of excess cash flow for such fiscal year, with any such payment not to exceed $2.0 million in any such fiscal year.
The PNC Credit Facility contains customary covenants and conditions, including, among other things, maintaining a minimum of unrestricted cash plus unused line availability of $10.0 million at all times and limiting annual capital expenditures. Certain financial covenants, including minimum EBITDA levels (as defined in the PNC Credit Facility) and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.1 to 1.0, become applicable only if unrestricted cash plus unused line availability falls below $10.8 million. In addition, the PNC Credit Facility places restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness or prepay existing indebtedness, to create liens or other encumbrances, to sell or otherwise dispose of assets, to merge or consolidate with other entities, and to make certain restricted payments, including payments of dividends to common shareholders.
Public Equity Offerings
On August 28, 2020, we completed a public offering, in which we issued and sold 2,760,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $6.25 per share, including 360,000 shares sold upon the exercise of the underwriter’s option to purchase additional shares. After underwriter discounts and commissions and other offering costs, net proceeds from the public offering were approximately $15.8 million. We are using the proceeds for general working capital purposes.
Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2020, on February 22, 2021, we completed a public offering, in which we issued and sold 3,289,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $7.00 per share, including 429,000 shares sold upon the exercise of the underwriter’s option to purchase additional shares. After underwriter discounts and commissions and other offering costs, net proceeds from the public offering were approximately $21.2 million. Please refer to Note 22 - “Subsequent Events” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Private Placement Securities Purchase Agreement
On April 14, 2020, we entered into a common stock and warrant purchase agreement with certain individuals and entities, pursuant to which we will issue and sell shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. The initial closing occurred on April 17, 2020 and we issued an aggregate of 731,937 shares and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 367,197 shares of our common stock. We received gross proceeds of $1.5 million for the initial closing. The additional closings occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 with an aggregate cash purchase price of $2.5 million, in which we issued 1,104,377 shares of our common stock, warrants to purchase an aggregate of 611,993 shares of our common stock at a price of $2.66 per share, and fully-paid warrants to purchase an aggregate of 114,698 shares of our common stock at a price of $0.001 per share. See Note 10 - "Shareholders' Equity" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Other
Our ValuePay program is an installment payment program which allows customers to pay by credit card for certain merchandise in two or more equal monthly installments. As of January 30, 2021, we had approximately $49.7 million of net receivables due from customers under the ValuePay program. Another potential source of near-term liquidity is our ability to increase our cash flow resources by reducing the percentage of our sales offered under our ValuePay installment program or by decreasing the length of time we extend credit to our customers under this installment program. However, any such change to the terms of our ValuePay installment program could impact future sales, particularly for products sold with higher price points. Please see "Cash Requirements" below for a discussion of our ValuePay installment program.
Cash Requirements
Currently, our principal cash requirements are to fund our business operations, which consist primarily of purchasing inventory for resale, funding ValuePay installment receivables, funding our basic operating expenses, particularly our contractual commitments for cable and satellite programming distribution, and the funding of necessary capital expenditures. We closely manage our cash resources and our working capital. We attempt to manage our inventory receipts and reorders in order to ensure our inventory investment levels remain commensurate with our current sales trends. We also monitor the collection of our credit card and ValuePay installment receivables and manage our vendor payment terms in order to more effectively manage our working capital which includes matching cash receipts from our customers, to the extent possible, with related cash payments to our vendors. ValuePay remains a cost-effective promotional tool for us. We continue to make strategic use of our ValuePay program in an effort to increase sales and to respond to similar competitive programs.
We also have significant future commitments for our cash, primarily payments for cable and satellite program distribution obligations and the eventual repayment of our credit facility. As of January 30, 2021, we had total contractual cash obligations and commitments primarily with respect to our cable and satellite agreements, credit facility, operating leases, and finance lease payments totaling approximately $181.2 million coming due over the next five fiscal years. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2020, we acquired certain assets related to the Christopher & Banks eCommerce business. See Note 22 - “Subsequent Events” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
We have experienced a decline in net sales and a decline in our active customer file during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 and a corresponding impact to our profitability. We have taken or are taking the following steps to enhance our operations and liquidity position: completed equity public offerings during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and third quarter of fiscal 2020 in which we received proceeds of $21.2 million and $15.8 million, after deducting underwriters’ discounts and commissions and other offering costs; entered into a private placement securities purchase agreements in which we received gross proceeds of $6.0 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2019; entered into a common stock and warrant purchase agreement in which we received gross proceeds of $4.0 million during the first six months of fiscal 2020; implemented a reduction in overhead costs totaling $22 million in expected annualized savings for the reductions made during fiscal 2019 and $16 million in expected annualized savings for the reductions made during the first quarter of fiscal 2020, primarily driven by a reduction in our work force; negotiated improved payment terms with our inventory vendors; renegotiating with certain cable and satellite distributors to reduce our service costs and improve our payment terms; reduced capital expenditures in fiscal 2020 compared to prior years; managed our inventory receipts in fiscal 2020 to reduce our inventory on hand; implemented by appointment viewing "static programming" to increase viewership; launching or have launched new innovative programming; and establishing category specific customer growth priorities around ASP, product assortment and product margins; launched ShopHQHealth, an additional television network that offers a robust assortment of products and services dedicated to addressing the physical, spiritual and mental health needs of customers; and entered into a licensing agreement to operate the Christopher & Banks business.
Our ability to fund operations and capital expenditures in the future will be dependent on our ability to generate cash flow from operations, maintain or improve margins, decrease the rate of decline in our sales and to use available funds from our PNC Credit Facility. Our ability to borrow funds is dependent on our ability to maintain an adequate borrowing base and our ability to meet our credit facility's covenants (as described above). We believe that it is probable our existing cash balances, together with the cost cutting measures described above and our availability under the PNC Credit Facility, will be sufficient to fund our normal business operations over the next twelve months from the issuance of this report. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our strategic initiatives or obtain additional funding on favorable terms in the future which could have a significant adverse effect on our operations.
For fiscal 2020, net cash provided by operating activities totaled $6.2 million compared to net cash used for operating activities of $6.2 million in fiscal 2019 and net cash provided by operating activities of $7.2 million in fiscal 2018. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2020 reflects a net loss, as adjusted for depreciation and amortization, share-based payment compensation, payments for television distribution rights and amortization of deferred financing costs. In addition, net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2020 reflects decreases in inventories, accounts receivable and prepaid expenses, and an increase in deferred revenue; partially offset by decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Inventories decreased primarily as a result of disciplined management of overall working capital components commensurate with sales. Accounts receivable decreased primarily due to lower sales levels, as well as a slight decrease in the utilization of our ValuePay installment program. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased during the first nine months of fiscal 2020 primarily due to a decrease in inventory payables as a result of lower inventory levels and timing of payments to vendors, a decrease in accrued severance resulting from our 2019 cost optimization initiative and 2019 executive and management transition, and a decrease in accrued cable distribution fees.
Net cash used for operating activities for fiscal 2019 reflects a net loss, as adjusted for depreciation and amortization, share-based payment compensation, inventory impairment write-down, and the amortization of deferred financing costs. In addition, net cash used for operating activities for fiscal 2019 reflects an increase in inventories; partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, decreases in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses, and increases in deferred revenue. Inventory increased as a result of lower than expected sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and management's plan to increase our air-time in consumer electronics, which are primarily drop-shipped from our vendors, and decrease airtime for merchandise previously purchased in our long lead time businesses. Accounts receivable decreased primarily due to lower sales levels, as well as a slight decrease in the utilization of our ValuePay installment program. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased during the first twelve months of fiscal 2019 primarily due to
an increase in accrued cable distribution fees as a result of negotiated extended payment agreements, an increase in inventory payables as a result of higher inventory purchases during the holiday season and the timing of these elevated inventory payments made to vendors, and an increase in accrued severance resulting from our 2019 cost optimization initiative and 2019 executive and management transition. The increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was partially offset by a decrease in freight payables and a decrease in our merchandise return liability.
Net cash used for investing activities totaled $4.9 million for fiscal 2020 compared to net cash used for investing activities of $7.8 million for fiscal 2019. Expenditures for property and equipment were $4.9 million in fiscal 2020 compared to $7.1 million in fiscal 2019. The decrease in capital expenditures in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily related to expenditures made for the upgrades in our customer service call routing technology during fiscal 2019. Additional capital expenditures made during the periods presented relate primarily to the development, upgrade and replacement of computer software, order management, merchandising and warehouse management systems, related computer equipment, digital broadcasting equipment, and other office equipment, warehouse equipment and production equipment. Principal future capital expenditures are expected to include: the development, upgrade and replacement of various enterprise software systems; equipment improvements and technology upgrades at our distribution facility in Bowling Green, Kentucky; security upgrades to our information technology; the upgrade of television production and transmission equipment; related computer equipment associated with the expansion of our television shopping business and digital commerce initiatives; and the assets acquired to operate the Christopher & Banks eCommerce business as described in Note 22 - “Subsequent Events” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. During fiscal 2019, we paid $635,000 for the acquisition of J.W. Hulme and Float Left.
Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $5.2 million in fiscal 2020 and related primarily to proceeds from our PNC revolving loan of $26.4 million and proceeds from the issuance of common stock and warrants of $20.0 million, offset by principal payments on the PNC revolving loan of $39.3 million, principal payments on our PNC term loan of $2.7 million, final payments related to our fiscal 2019 business acquisitions of $238,000, payments for common stock issuance costs of $216,000, finance lease payments of $103,000 and tax payments for restricted stock unit issuances of $13,000. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $3.3 million in fiscal 2019 and related primarily to proceeds from our PNC revolving loan of $188.1 million and proceeds from the issuance of common stock and warrants of $6.0 million, offset by principal payments on the PNC revolving loan of $188.1 million, principal payments on our PNC term loan of $2.5 million, payments for common stock issuance costs of $109,000, finance lease payments of $71,000 and tax payments for restricted stock unit issuances of $39,000.
Financial Covenants
The PNC Credit Facility contains customary covenants and conditions, including, among other things, maintaining a minimum of unrestricted cash plus unused line availability of $10.0 million at all times and limiting annual capital expenditures. Certain financial covenants, including minimum EBITDA levels (as defined in the PNC Credit Facility) and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.1 to 1.0, become applicable only if unrestricted cash plus unused line availability falls below $10.8 million or upon an event of default. As of January 30, 2021, our unrestricted cash plus unused line availability was $28.0 million, and we were in compliance with applicable financial covenants of the PNC Credit Facility and expect to be in compliance with applicable financial covenants over the next twelve months.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, investments in special purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt. Additionally, we are not party to any derivative contracts or synthetic leases.
Impact of Inflation
We believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended January 30, 2021. We cannot assure you that inflation will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition in future periods.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
See Note 2 - "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and assumptions, including those related to the realizability of accounts receivable, inventory and product returns. Management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Management believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements:
● Accounts receivable. We utilize an installment payment program called ValuePay that entitles customers to purchase merchandise and pay for the merchandise in two or more equal monthly credit card installments in which we bear the risk of collection. The percentage of our net sales generated utilizing our ValuePay payment program over the past three fiscal years ranged from 55% to 67%. As of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020, we had approximately $49.7 million and $56.9 million due from customers under the ValuePay installment program. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. Estimates are used in determining the provision for doubtful accounts and are based on historical rates of actual write offs and delinquency rates, historical collection experience, credit policy, current trends in the credit quality of our customer base, average length of ValuePay offers, average selling prices, our sales mix and accounts receivable aging. The provision for doubtful accounts, which is primarily related to our ValuePay program, for fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 was $4.9 million, $7.3 million and $7.8 million. Based on our fiscal 2020 bad debt experience, a one-half point increase or decrease in our bad debt experience as a percentage of total net sales would have an impact of approximately $1.4 million on consolidated distribution and selling expense.
● Inventory. We value our inventory, which consists primarily of consumer merchandise held for resale, principally at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. As of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020, we had inventory balances of $68.7 million and $78.9 million. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on the following factors: age of the inventory, estimated required sell-through time, stage of product life cycle and whether items are selling below cost. In determining appropriate reserve percentages, we look at our historical write off experience, the specific merchandise categories affected, our historic recovery percentages on various methods of liquidations, return to vendor contract rights, forecasts of future planned receipts, forecasts of inventory levels, forecasts of future product airings and current markdown processes. Provision for excess and obsolete inventory for fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 was $5.5 million, $8.8 million and $5.1 million. The fiscal 2019 provision includes a non-cash inventory write-down of $6.1 million resulting from a change in our merchandise strategy (see Note 17 - "Inventory Impairment Write-down" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements). Based on our fiscal 2020 inventory write down experience, a 10% increase or decrease in inventory write downs would have had an impact of approximately $560,000 on consolidated gross profit.
● Merchandise returns. We record a merchandise return liability as a reduction of gross sales for anticipated merchandise returns at each reporting period and must make estimates of potential future merchandise returns related to current period product revenue. Our return rates on our total net sales were 14.8% in fiscal 2020, 19.4% in fiscal 2019, and 19.0% in fiscal 2018. We estimate and evaluate the adequacy of our merchandise returns liability by analyzing historical returns by merchandise category, looking at current economic trends and changes in customer demand and by analyzing the acceptance of new product lines. Assumptions and estimates are made and used in connection with establishing the merchandise return liability in any accounting period. As of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020, we recorded a merchandise return liability of $5.3 million and $5.8 million, included in accrued liabilities, and a right of return asset of $2.7 million and $3.2 million, included in
other current assets. Based on our fiscal 2020 sales returns, a one-point increase or decrease in our returns rate would have had an impact of approximately $2.1 million on gross profit.
