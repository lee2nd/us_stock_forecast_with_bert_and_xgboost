The Company's significant operating losses raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. As indicated herein, we need capital for the implementation of our business plan, and we will need additional capital for continuing our operations. We do not have sufficient revenues to pay our operating expenses at this time. Unless the Company is able to raise working capital, it is likely that the Company will either have to cease operations or substantially change its methods of operations or change its business plan. For the next 12 months the Company has an oral commitment from its CEO to advance funds as necessary to meeting our operating requirement.

Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020 was $-0- and $206,571, respectively. The decrease amount was attributed to interest expense on convertible note warrants, joint venture write off and (gain) loss on derivative.
