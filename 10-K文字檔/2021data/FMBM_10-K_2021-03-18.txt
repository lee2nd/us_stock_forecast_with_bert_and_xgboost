Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in thousands)
The following discussion provides information about the major components of the results of operations and financial condition, liquidity and capital resources of F & M Bank Corp. and its subsidiaries. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements presented in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Information, of this Form 10-K.
Lending Activities
Credit Policies
The principal risk associated with each of the segments of loans in our portfolio is the creditworthiness of our borrowers. Within each segment, such risk is increased or decreased, depending on prevailing economic conditions. In an effort to manage the risk, our loan policy gives loan amount approval limits to individual loan officers based on their position and level of experience and to our loan committees based on the size of the lending relationship. The risk associated with real estate and construction loans, commercial loans and consumer loans varies, based on market employment levels, fluctuations in the value of real estate and other conditions that affect the ability of borrowers to repay indebtedness. The risk associated with real estate construction loans varies, based on the supply and demand for the type of real estate under construction.
We have written policies and procedures to help manage credit risk. We have a loan review policy that includes regular portfolio reviews to establish loss exposure and to ascertain compliance with our loan policy.
We use a management loan committee and a directors’ loan committee to approve loans. The management loan committee is comprised of members of senior management, and the directors’ loan committee is comprised of any six directors. Both committees approve new, renewed and or modified loans that exceed officer loan authorities. The directors’ loan committee also reviews any changes to our lending policies, which are then approved by our board of directors.
Construction and Development Lending
We make construction loans, primarily residential, and land acquisition and development loans. The residential construction loans are secured by residential houses under construction and the underlying land for which the loan was obtained. The land acquisition and development loans are secured by the land for which the loan was obtained. The average life of a construction loan is approximately 12 months, and it is typically re-priced as the prime rate of interest changes. Construction lending entails significant additional risks, compared with residential mortgage lending. Construction loans often involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Another risk involved in construction lending is attributable to the fact that loan funds are advanced upon the security of the land or home under construction, which value is estimated prior to the completion of construction. Thus, it is more difficult to evaluate accurately the total loan funds required to complete a project and related loan-to-value ratios. To mitigate the risks associated with construction lending, we generally limit loan amounts to 75% to 90% of appraised value, in addition to analyzing the creditworthiness of our borrowers. We also obtain a first lien on the property as security for our construction loans and typically require personal guarantees from the borrower’s principal owners.

Commercial Real Estate Lending
Commercial real estate loans are secured by various types of commercial real estate in our market area, including multi-family residential buildings, commercial buildings and offices, shopping centers and churches. Commercial real estate lending entails significant additional risks, compared with residential mortgage lending. Commercial real estate loans typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Additionally, the payment experience on loans secured by income producing properties is typically dependent on the successful operation of a business or a real estate project and thus may be subject, to a greater extent, to adverse conditions in the real estate market or in the economy in general. Our commercial real estate loan underwriting criteria require an examination of debt service coverage ratios and the borrower’s creditworthiness, prior credit history and reputation. We also evaluate the location of the property securing the loan and typically require personal guarantees or endorsements of the borrower’s principal owners.
Commercial & Industry - Non-Real Estate
Business loans generally have a higher degree of risk than residential mortgage loans but have higher yields. To manage these risks, we generally obtain appropriate collateral and personal guarantees from the borrower’s principal owners and monitor the financial condition of our business borrowers. Residential mortgage loans generally are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from employment and other income and are secured by real estate whose value tends to be readily ascertainable. In contrast, business loans typically are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from cash flow from its business and are secured by business assets, such as real estate, accounts receivable, equipment and inventory. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of business loans is substantially dependent on the success of the business itself. Furthermore, the collateral for business loans may depreciate over time and generally cannot be appraised with as much precision as residential real estate.
Consumer Lending
We offer various consumer loans, including personal loans and lines of credit, automobile loans, deposit account loans, installment and demand loans, and home equity loans and lines of credit. Such loans are generally made to clients with whom we have a pre-existing relationship. We currently originate all of our consumer loans in our geographic market area.
The underwriting standards employed by us for consumer loans include a determination of the applicant’s payment history on other debts and an assessment of their ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. The stability of the applicant’s monthly income may be determined by verification of gross monthly income from primary employment and additionally from any verifiable secondary income. Although creditworthiness of the applicant is of primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes an analysis of the value of the security in relation to the proposed loan amount. For home equity lines of credit and loans we require title insurance, hazard insurance and, if required, flood insurance.
Residential Mortgage Lending
The Bank makes residential mortgage loans for the purchase or refinance of existing loans with loan to value limits generally ranging between 80 and 90% depending on the age of the property, borrower’s income and credit worthiness. Loans that are retained in our portfolio generally carry adjustable rates that can change every three to five years, based on amortization periods of twenty to thirty years.
PART II, continued
Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in thousands), Continued
Loans Held for Sale
The Bank makes fixed rate mortgage loans with terms of typically fifteen or thirty years through its subsidiary F&M Mortgage. These loans are funded by F&M Mortgage utilizing a line of credit at the Bank until sold to investors in the secondary market. Similarly, the Bank also has a relationship with Northpointe Bank in Grand Rapids, MI whereby it purchases fixed rate conforming 1-4 family mortgage loans for short periods of time pending those loans being sold to investors in the secondary market. These loans have an average duration of ten days to two weeks, but occasionally remain on the Bank’s books for up to 60 days. The Bank began its relationship with Northpointe Bank in 2014 and had a similar program with a prior bank since 2003. This relationship allows the Bank to achieve a higher rate of return than is available on other short-term investment opportunities. F&M Bank does not share in the gains on sale of loans for the Northpointe participation and only earns interest during the holding period.
Dealer Finance Division
In September 2012, the Bank started a loan production office in Penn Laird, VA which specializes in providing automobile financing through a network of automobile dealers. The Dealer Finance Division was originally staffed with three officers that have extensive experience in Dealer Finance. Based on the strong growth of this division the staff has been increased to seven employees. This office is serving the automobile finance needs for customers of dealers throughout the existing geographic footprint of the Bank. Approximately sixty-nine dealers have signed contracts to originate loans on behalf of the Bank. As of year end 2020, the division had total loans outstanding of $91,861.
Critical Accounting Policies
General
The Company’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The financial information contained within the statements is, to a significant extent, financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. The Company’s financial position and results of operations are affected by management’s application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues, expenses and related disclosures. Different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in the Company’s consolidated financial position and/or results of operations.
In addition, GAAP itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method. Although the economics of these transactions would be the same, the timing of events that would impact these transactions could change. Following is a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies that are highly dependent on estimates, assumptions and judgments.
Allowance for Loan Losses
The allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in the loan portfolio. The allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting: (i) ASC 450 “Contingencies”, which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable and (ii) ASC 310, “Receivables”, which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral, present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance. The Company’s allowance for loan losses is the accumulation of various components that are calculated based on independent methodologies. All components of the allowance represent an estimation performed pursuant to either ASC 450 or ASC 310. Management’s estimate of each ASC 450 component is based on certain observable data that management believes are most reflective of the underlying credit losses being estimated. This evaluation includes credit quality trends; collateral values; loan volumes; economic conditions, borrower and industry concentrations; changes in the experience and depths of lending management and staff; effects of any concentrations of credit; the findings of internal credit quality assessments, results from external bank regulatory examinations and third-party loan reviewer. These factors, as well as historical losses and current economic and business conditions, are used in developing estimated loss factors used in the calculations.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in thousands), continued
Allowance for Loan Losses, continued
Allowances for loan losses are determined by applying estimated loss factors to the portfolio based on management’s evaluation and “risk grading” of the loan portfolio. Specific allowances, if required, are typically provided on all impaired loans in excess of a defined loan size threshold that are classified in the Substandard or Doubtful risk grades and on all troubled debt restructurings. The specific reserves are determined on a loan-by-loan basis based on management’s evaluation of the Company’s exposure for each credit, given the current payment status of the loan and the value of any underlying collateral.
While management uses the best information available to establish the allowance for loan and lease losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions change or, if required by regulators, based upon information available to them at the time of their examinations. Such adjustments to original estimates, as necessary, are made in the period in which these factors and other relevant considerations indicate that loss levels may vary from previous estimates.
Fair Value
The estimate of fair value involves the use of (1) quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets, (2) quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques using significant assumptions that are observable in the market or (3) model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. When observable market prices and parameters are not fully available, management’s judgment is necessary to arrive at fair value including estimates of current market participant expectations of future cash flows, risk premiums, among other things. Additionally, significant judgment may be required to determine whether certain assets measured at fair value are classified within the fair value hierarchy as Level 2 or Level 3. The estimation process and the potential materiality of the amounts involved result in this item being identified as critical.
Pension Obligations
The accounting guidance for the measurement and recognition of obligations and expense related to pension plans generally applies the concept that the cost of benefits provided during retirement should be recognized over the employees’ active working life. Inherent in this concept is the requirement to use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date. Major actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of benefits expense and accumulated benefit obligation include discount rates, expected return on assets, mortality rates, and projected salary increases, among others. Changes in assumptions or judgments related to any of these variables could result in significant volatility in the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. As a result, accounting for the Company’s pension expense and obligation is considered a significant estimate. The estimation process and the potential materiality of the amounts involved result in this item being identified as critical.
Other Real Estate Owned (OREO)
OREO is held for sale and represents real estate acquired through or in lieu of foreclosure. OREO is initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. Physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan occurs when legal title is obtained upon completion of foreclosure or when the borrower conveys all interest in the property to satisfy the loan through completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or through a similar legal agreement. The Company’s policy is to carry OREO on its balance sheet at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell. If fair value declines subsequent to foreclosure, a valuation allowance is recorded through expense. Operating costs after acquisition are expensed.

COVID-19
The World Health Organization declared a global pandemic in the first quarter of 2020 due to the spread of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) around the globe. As a result, the state of Virginia issued a stay at home order in March 2020 requiring all nonessential businesses to shut down and nonessential workers to stay home. The Company, while considered an essential business, implemented procedures to protect its employees, customers and the community and still serve their banking needs. Branch lobbies are closed and the Company is utilizing drive through windows and courier service to handle transactions, new accounts are opened electronically with limited in person contact for document signing and verification of identification, and lenders are taking applications by appointment with limited in person contact as well.
The SBA implemented the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) to support small business operations with loans during the shutdown and into the following months. The Company worked diligently to support both our customers and noncustomers within our footprint with these loans. As of December 31, 2020, there were 451 PPP loans outstanding for a total of $34,907 through the SBA program, with unamortized fee income related to these loans of $946. These fees will be recognized over the life of the associated loans. On January 19, 2021 the SBA began accepting application for the second round of PPP loans. As of February 28, 2021, the bank has originated 199 second round PPP loans totaling $17,927.
The Company initially funded PPP loans through the Federal Reserve’s PPP liquidity facility (“PPPLF”); this facility allows Banks to borrow funds to support the PPP program at a rate of .35%, reduce the leverage ratio reported by the amount of the debt and maintain liquidity for core loan growth and investment opportunities. As of September 30, 2020, the Company had borrowed $59,903 under the PPPLF program. The Company paid off the PPPLF facility on October 30, 2020.
While the full impact of COVID-19 remains uncertain at this time, end of the year data indicated that the economy is in a recession. Many foreign countries and states in the United States continue to be under restriction as far as employment, recreation and gatherings. Unemployment claims remain higher than normal, but less than original estimates.
The Company is closely monitoring the effects of the pandemic on our customers. Management is focused on assessing the risks in our loan portfolio and working with our customers to minimize losses. Additional resources have been allocated to analyze higher risk segments in our loan portfolio, monitor and track loan payment deferrals and customer status.
The industries most likely to be affected by COVID-19, which include lodging, food service, assisted living facilities, recreation, multi-family, retail, childcare and education services, have been identified and reviewed. Management determined there is a concentration in low-end budget hotels and as they reopen may have more vacancies than normal. There are also a couple of large recreational facilities that were closed and missed the summer camp season. There were approximately $89,076 in closed/restricted businesses that are considered non-essential. Multi-family may struggle with collecting rents from tenants; however, our portfolio has not seen any indication.
As of February 9, 2021, we had executed 1,250 modifications allowing principal and interest deferrals on outstanding loan balances of $88,632 in connection with the COVID-19 related needs. These modifications, 75% of which were short-term dealer loan modifications, were consistent with regulatory guidance and/or the CARES Act. As of February 28, 2021, 70 loans remain in deferral with a balance of $9,339, 741 modified loans are current on their payment, 197 have paid off, 43 have charged off, 6 are matured, 6 are on non-accrual and 194 are past due.

The table below shows the impacted industries identified by management, the percent of the loan portfolio and the loan deferrals in those categories as of December 31, 2020:
(1 ) Includes dealer finance
Based on the Company’s capital levels, current underwriting policies, low loan-to-deposit ratio, loan concentration diversification and rural operating environment, management believes that it is well positioned to support its customers and communities and to manage the economic risks and uncertainties associated with COVID-19 pandemic and remain adequately capitalized.
Given the rapidly changing and unprecedented nature of the pandemic, however, the Company could experience material and adverse effects on its business, including as a result of credit deterioration, operational disruptions, decreased demand for products and services, or other reasons. Further, our loan deferral program could delay or make it difficult to identify the extent of current credit quality deterioration during the deferral period. The extent to which the pandemic impacts the Company will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict, including, but not limited to, its duration and severity, the actions to contain it or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume.

Overview
The Company’s net income for 2020 totaled $8,788 or $2.66 per common share (basic), an increase of 95% from $4,509 or $1.32 a share (basic) in 2019. Return on average equity increased in 2020 to 9.39% versus 4.93% in 2019, and the return on average assets increased from .57% in 2019 to .99% in 2020. The Company’s net income per share (dilutive) totaled $2.56 in 2020, an increase from $1.30 in 2019.
Changes in Net Income per Common Share (Basic)
Net Interest Income
The largest source of operating revenue for the Company is net interest income, which is calculated as the difference between the interest earned on earning assets and the interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities. Net interest income decreased 1.04% from 2019 to 2020 following a decrease of 0.49% from 2018 to 2019. The net interest margin is the net interest income expressed as a percentage of interest earning assets. Changes in the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, along with their yields and rates, have a significant impact on the level of net interest income. Tax equivalent net interest income for 2020 was $31,154 representing a decrease of $312 or 0.99% over the prior year. A 0.51% decrease in 2019 versus 2018 resulted in total tax equivalent net interest income of $31,466.
In this discussion and in the tabular analysis of net interest income performance, entitled “Consolidated Average Balances, Yields and Rates,” the interest earned on tax exempt loans and investment securities has been adjusted to reflect the amount that would have been earned had these investments been subject to normal income taxation. This is referred to as tax equivalent net interest income. For a reconciliation of tax equivalent net interest income to GAAP measures, see the accompanying table.
Tax equivalent income on earning assets decreased $1,402 in 2020 compared to 2019. Loans held for investment, expressed as a percentage of total earning assets, decreased in 2020 to 76.37% as compared to 87.41% in 2019. During 2020, yields on earning assets decreased 100 basis points (BP) and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased 36BP. Both are a result of the declining interest rate environment experienced in 2020.

The following table provides detail on the components of tax equivalent net interest income:
Interest Income
Tax equivalent interest income decreased $312 or 0.99% in 2020, after decreasing 0.51% or $160 in 2019. Overall, the yield on earning assets decreased 1.00%, from 5.27% to 4.27%. Average loans held for investment increased during 2020, with average loans outstanding increasing $23,999 to $659,109. Average real estate loans decreased 5.38%, commercial loans increased 29.07%, primarily due to PPP loans with an average yield of 1%. Consumer installment loans decreased 9.99% on average. The decrease in tax equivalent net interest income is due primarily to the decrease in deposit cost, in spite a of 20.39% growth in average interest-bearing deposits.
Interest Expense
Interest expense decreased $1,090 or 15.99% during 2020. The average cost of funds of 0.94% decreased 36BP compared to 2019, which followed an increase of 28BP in 2019. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $86,952 or 16.60% in 2020. Changes in the cost of funds attributable to rate and volume variances are in a following table.
The analysis on the next page reveals a decrease in the net interest margin to 3.61% in 2020 from 4.33% in 2019, due to changes in balance sheet mix during the year and decreases in interest rates in earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.

The following table illustrates the effect of changes in volumes and rates.
Note: Volume changes have been determined by multiplying the prior years’ average rate by the change in average balances outstanding. The rate change is determined by multiplying the current year average balance outstanding by the change in rate from the prior year to the current year.
Noninterest Income
Noninterest income continues to be an increasingly important factor in maintaining and growing profitability. Management is conscious of the need to constantly review fee income and develop additional sources of complementary revenue.
Noninterest income increased 23.08% or $2,290, in 2020. The 2020 increase is due to primarily to growth in the gross revenue of F&M Mortgage. The Company also experienced growth in VST Title, F & M Financial Services, as well as increased volumes in ATM and check card fees.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in thousands), Continued
Noninterest Expense
Noninterest expenses increased from $29,518 in 2019 to $29,939 in 2020, a 1.43% increase. Areas of increase include FDIC insurance due to the expiration of credits, telecommunication and data processing, and other operating expenses, which increased primarily due to prepayment costs of FHLB advances. These growing expense areas were offset by a decrease in salary and benefits of 3.89% or $16,484 in 2020, and other real estate owned, net of $170. The salary and benefits decrease was the result lower pension settlement costs and severance packages expensed during the year 2019 that were not repeated in 2020, and an increased effort to dispose of other real estate owned properties. Total noninterest expense as a percentage of average assets totaled 3.36% and 3.70% in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Peer group averages (as reported in the most recent Uniform Bank Performance Report) were 2.60% for 2020 and 2.81% for 2019.
Provision for Loan Losses
Management evaluates the loan portfolio in light of national and local economic trends, changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio and industry standards. Specific factors considered by management in determining the adequacy of the level of the allowance for loan losses include internally generated and third-party loan review reports, past due reports and historical loan loss experience. This review also considers concentrations of loans in terms of geography, business type and level of risk. Management evaluates nonperforming loans relative to their collateral value, when deemed collateral dependent, and makes the appropriate adjustments to the allowance for loan losses when needed. During 2020, the Company increased environmental factors for the economy and concentrations in industries specifically impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. This is reflective of the negative effect on the economy from continued government restrictions on businesses, higher than normal weekly unemployment claims and deferred loan payments. Additionally, the Company has continued to analyze the loan portfolio for industries most likely to be affected by COVID-19 such as hotels, restaurants, recreations facilities, assisted living facilities, retail establishments, childcare and education facilities, and multi-family properties. Based on loans in these industry segments, the environmental factor was increased for five segments of the loan portfolio. Past due loans have remained at 2019 levels, while nonperforming loans and classified loans have increased. In addition, the full impact of loan payment deferrals will not be known until these borrowers return to their normal scheduled payments.
Based on the factors outlined above, the current year provision for loan losses totaled $3,300 compared to $7,405 for 2019. During 2019, Management made a concerted effort to reduce nonperforming loans, including through charge-off of loan balances after disposal. This led to an increased provision in 2019. Net charge offs decreased from $4,255 in 2019 to $1,215 in 2020. Net charge-offs as a percentage of loans held for investment totaled 0.18% and 0.71% in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The dealer finance charge-off percentage is the largest category at 0.12% of loans held for investment. As stated in the most recently available Uniform Bank Performance Report (UPBR), peer group loss averages were 0.08% in 2020 and 0.09% in 2019. The Bank anticipates losses will remain above peer due to the Dealer Finance Division, however losses in this segment are closely monitored, and due to payment deferrals, have declined in 2020.
The current levels of the allowance for loan losses reflect net charge-off activity and other credit risk factors that the Company considers in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Management will continue to monitor nonperforming, adversely classified and past due loans and will make necessary adjustments to specific reserves and provision for loan losses should conditions change regarding collateral values or cash flow expectations.
Balance Sheet
Total assets increased 18.79% during the year to $966,930, an increase of $152,931 from $813,999 in 2019. Cash and cash equivalents increased $2,604, the AFS security portfolio grew $102,533, net loans held for investment increased $55,819, and loans held for sale declined $8,119. Average earning assets increased 18.78% to $863,072 at December 31, 2020. The increase in earning assets is due largely to the growth in the loans held for investment, investment securities and federal funds sold. Deposits grew $176,873 and liabilities decreased $27,996 in 2020. Short term debt and FHLB advances declined due to regular scheduled payments and prepayments, while the bank increased long-term debt with the issuance of subordinated debt. Average interest-bearing deposits increased $90,864 for 2020 or 20.39%, with increases in interest-bearing demand accounts and savings while time deposits declined. The Company continues to utilize its assets well, with 93.68% of average assets consisting of earning assets.

In January 2021, the Bank entered into an agreement to purchase the operations of a branch office in Waynesboro, Virginia from Carter Bankshares, Inc. The branch purchase is expected to add approximately $13,500 of deposits. No loans are included in the transaction. Subject to regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, the transaction is expected to close early in the second quarter of 2021.
Investment Securities
Due to the deposit growth initiatives implemented in recent years and the COVID-19 pandemic, management has invested excess funds into securities during 2020. Total securities increased $99,883 or 554.44% in 2020 to $117,898 at December 31, 2020 from $18,015 at December 31, 2019. Average balances in investment securities increased 353.44% in 2020 to $60,825. At year end, 7.05% of average earning assets of the Company were held as investment securities, all of which are unpledged. Management strives to match the types and maturities of securities owned to balance projected liquidity needs, interest rate sensitivity and to maximize earnings through a portfolio bearing low credit risk. Portfolio yields averaged 1.73% for 2020, compared to 3.69% in 2019; this is due to the overall market declines in 2020.
There were no Other Than Temporary Impairments (OTTI) write-downs in 2020 or 2019. There were no realized security gains or losses on sale of securities in 2020 or 2019.
The composition of securities at December 31 was:
At estimated fair value. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for amortized cost.
Issued by a U.S. Government Agency or secured by U.S. Government Agency collateral.
Maturities and weighted average yields of securities at December 31, 2020 are presented in the table below. Amounts are shown by contractual maturity; expected maturities will differ as issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations. Maturities of other investments are not readily determinable due to the nature of the investment; see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of these investments.

Analysis of Loan Portfolio
The Company’s market area has a relatively stable economy which tends to be less cyclical than the national economy. Major industries in the market area include agricultural production and processing, higher education, retail sales, services and light manufacturing.
The Company’s portfolio of loans held for investment totaled $661,329 at December 31, 2020 compared with $603,425 at December 31, 2019. Collateral required by the Company is determined on an individual basis depending on the purpose of the loan and the financial condition of the borrower. Real estate mortgages decreased $17,457 or 7.41%. Construction loans decreased $5,664 or 7.34%. Commercial loans, including agricultural and multifamily loans, increased 34.85% during 2020 to $267,632, primarily due to PPP loans of $34,908 at December 31, 2020.
Consumer loans increased $12,197 or 13.72% mainly due to the dealer finance division loans, resulting in a December 31, 2020 balance in this portfolio of $91,861. Consumer loans include personal loans, auto loans and other loans to individuals. The following table presents the changes in the loan portfolio over the previous five years.

Analysis of Loan Portfolio, continued
The following table shows the Company’s loan maturity and interest rate sensitivity as of December 31, 2020:
Residential real estate loans are made for a period up to 30 years and are secured by a first deed of trust which normally does not exceed 90% of the appraised value. If the loan to value ratio exceeds 90%, the Company requires additional collateral, guarantees or mortgage insurance. On approximately 81% of the real estate loans, interest is adjustable after each one, three or five-year period. The remainder of the portfolio is comprised of fixed rate loans that are generally made for a fifteen-year or a twenty-year period with an interest rate adjustment after ten years, except for dealer loans that generally have a term of 5 years.
Fixed rate real estate loans have been partially funded with fixed rate borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank, which allows the Company to control its interest rate risk. The Company has not had a need for additional funding from the FHLB, but there may be a time where we match the maturities in the future. In addition, the Company makes home equity loans secured by second deeds of trust with total indebtedness not to exceed 90% of the appraised value. Home equity loans are made for ten or twenty year periods as a revolving line of credit.
Construction loans may be made to individuals, who have arranged with a contractor for the construction of a residence, or to contractors that are involved in building pre-sold, spec-homes or subdivisions. The majority of commercial loans are made to small retail, manufacturing and service businesses. Commercial construction loans are made to construct commercial and agricultural buildings. Consumer loans are made for a variety of reasons; however, approximately 75% of the loans are secured by automobiles and trucks.
Approximately 74% of the Company’s loans are secured by real estate; however, policies relating to appraisals and loan to value ratios are adequate to control the related risk. Market values continue to be stable with increases in sales prices, reduction in inventory and reduction in days on the market. Unemployment rates in the Company’s market area continue to be below both the national and state averages.
The Bank has not identified any loan categories that would be considered loan concentrations of greater than 25% of capital. The Bank has an approved limit of 16% for dealer loans as a percentage of total loans. The Bank has not developed a formal policy limiting the concentration level of any other particular loan type or industry segment; it has established target limits on both a nominal and percentage of capital basis. Concentrations are monitored and reported to the board of directors quarterly. Concentration levels have been used by management to determine how aggressively we may price or pursue new loan requests.

Nonaccrual and Past Due Loans
Nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans and loans 90 days or more past due still accruing. Nonaccrual loans are loans on which interest accruals have been suspended or discontinued permanently. The Company would have earned approximately $366 in additional interest income in 2020 had the loans on nonaccrual status been current and performing. Nonperforming loans totaled $6,537 at December 31, 2020 compared to $5,729 at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2020, there were $102 of loans 90 days or more past due and accruing compared to $722 at December 31, 2019. The remainder of nonperforming loans were on nonaccrual. Nonperforming loans have increased approximately $808 since December 31, 2019. While Management continues their efforts to reduce nonperforming loans, there was an increase in 2020 due primarily to loans affected by COVID-19.
Approximately 100% of these nonperforming loans are secured by real estate and were in the process of collection. The Bank believes that adequate specific reserves have been established on impaired loans and continues to actively work with its customers to effect payment. As of December 31, 2020, the Company holds $0 of real estate acquired through foreclosure.

Loan Losses and the Allowance for Loan Losses
Management evaluates the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis in light of national and local economic trends, changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio and trends in past due and criticized loans. Specific factors evaluated include internally generated loan review reports, past due reports, historical loan loss experience and changes in the financial strength of individual borrowers that have been included on the Bank’s watch list or schedule of classified loans.
In evaluating the portfolio, loans are segregated by segment with identified potential losses, pools of loans by type, with separate weighting for past dues and a general allowance based on a variety of criteria. Loans with identified potential losses include examiner and bank classified loans. Classified relationships in excess of $500,000 and loans identified as troubled debt restructurings are reviewed individually for impairment under ASC 310. A variety of factors are considered when reviewing these credits, including borrower cash flow, payment history, fair value of collateral, company management, industry and economic factors.
Loans that are not reviewed for impairment are categorized by call report code into unimpaired and classified loans. For both unimpaired and classified loans an estimate is calculated based on actual loss experience over the last two years. The classified Dealer finance loans are given a higher risk factor for past due and adverse risk ratings based on back testing of the risk factors.
A general allowance for inherent losses has been established to reflect other unidentified losses within the portfolio. The general allowance is calculated using nine qualitative factors identified in the 2006 Interagency Policy Statement on the allowance for loan losses. The general allowance assists in managing recent changes in portfolio risk that may not be captured in individually impaired loans, or in the homogeneous pools based on loss histories. The Board approves the loan loss provision for each quarter based on this evaluation.
The allowance for loan losses of $10,475 at December 31, 2020 is equal to 1.58% of total loans held for investment, or 1.67% of total loans held for investment net of PPP loans. This compares to an allowance of $8,390 or 1.39% of total loans at December 31, 2019. PPP loans are 100% guaranteed by the SBA; thus, they do not have an allowance. During 2020, four impaired loan relationships were added and one was paid off; new appraisals on two relationships increased the calculated impairment. Due to COVID-19, the bank increased the qualitative factor for the economy and concentrations in industries specifically affected by the virus. The bank increased the environmental factor for COVID-19's negative impact on the economy, such as continued government restrictions on businesses, high weekly unemployment filings, and deferred loan payments. Additionally, the bank analyzed the loan portfolio for industries most likely to be affected by COVID-19, such as hotels, restaurants, recreations facilities, assisted living facilities, retail establishments, childcare and education facilities, and multi-family properties. Based on the Bank’s loans in these industry segments, the environmental factor was increased for three segments of the loan portfolio. Nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2020 totaled $6,435 compared to $5,007 at December 31, 2019. In addition, classified loans (internally rated substandard or watch) increased significantly from a total of $39,772 at December 31, 2019 to $67,592 at December 31, 2020, or 69.49%. Management is closely monitoring the effects of COVID-19 on the loan portfolio and added loans in industries impacted by COVID-19 to the classified loan list. These include hotels, restaurants, and commercial real estate.
Loan losses, net of recoveries, totaled $1,215 in 2020 which is equivalent to .18% of total loans outstanding.

Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits, which are comprised of checking accounts, increased $37,581 or 22.68% from $165,731 at December 31, 2019 to $203,312 at December 31, 2020. Average interest-bearing deposits, which include interest checking accounts, money market accounts, regular savings accounts and time deposits, increased $90,964 or 20.42% from $445,481 at December 31, 2019 to $536,445 at December 31, 2020. Total average interest checking account balances increased $18,138 or 20.19% from $89,823 at December 31, 2019 to $107,961 at December 31, 2020. Total average savings account balances (including money market accounts) increased $87,852 or 42.12% from $208,551 at December 31, 2019 to $296,403 at December 31, 2020. The bank has a competitive money market rate to maintain and attract core deposits.
Average time deposits decreased $15,026 or 10.21% from $147,107 at December 31, 2019 to $132,081 at December 31, 2020. The money market rate has been attractive and as time deposits matured, customers moved their deposits to the money market account.
The maturity distribution of certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more is as follows:
Non-deposit borrowings include federal funds purchased, Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) borrowings, (both short term and long term), a note to purchase the minority interest in F&M Mortgage and subordinated debt notes. Non-deposit borrowings are an important source of funding for the Bank. These sources assist in managing short and long-term funding needs.
Borrowings from the FHLB are used to support the Bank’s lending program and allow the Bank to manage interest rate risk by laddering maturities and matching funding terms to the terms of various loan types in the loan portfolio. The Company borrowed an additional $30,000 in 2019 and had no additional long-term borrowings in 2020. Repayment of amortizing and fixed maturity loans through FHLB totaled $31,929 during 2020. These long-term loans carried an average rate of 1.39% at December 31, 2020.
Other long-term debt includes a final payment of $194 due on the minority interest purchase of F&M Mortgage and $11,740 of subordinated notes, net of unamortized costs at December 31, 2020. On July 29, 2020, the Company issued $5,000 in aggregate principal amount of 5.75% fixed rate subordinated notes due July 31, 2027 and $7,000 in aggregate principal amount of 6% fixed to floating rate subordinated notes due July 31, 2030.

Stockholders’ Equity
Total stockholders’ equity increased $4,054 or 4.43% in 2020. Capital was increased by net income totaling $8,788, net of noncontrolling interest of $105, issuance of common stock totaled $258, pension adjustment of ($617) and unrealized gains on available for sale securities of $811. Capital was reduced by common and preferred dividends totaling $3,591, repurchases of common stock of $473, and minority interest distributions of $177. As of December 31, 2020, book value per common share was $28.43 compared to $27.11 as of December 31, 2019. Dividends are paid to stockholders on a quarterly based on decisions by the Board of Directors unless unexpected fluctuations in net income indicate a change to this policy is needed.
Banking regulators have established a uniform system to address the adequacy of capital for financial institutions. The rules require minimum capital levels based on risk-adjusted assets. Simply stated, the riskier an entity’s investments, the more capital it is required to maintain. The Bank is required to maintain these minimum capital levels. Beginning in 2015, the Bank implemented the Basel III capital requirements, which introduced the Common Equity Tier I ratio in addition to the two previous capital guidelines of Tier I capital (referred to as core capital) and Tier II capital (referred to as supplementary capital). At December 31, 2020, the Bank had Common Equity Tier I capital of 13.55%, Tier I risked based capital of 13.55% and total risked based capital of 14.81% of risk weighted assets. Regulatory minimums at this date were 4.5%, 6% and 8%, respectively. The Bank has maintained capital levels far above the minimum requirements throughout the year. In the unlikely event that such capital levels are not met, regulatory agencies are empowered to require the Bank to raise additional capital and/or reallocate present capital.
In addition, the regulatory agencies have issued guidelines requiring the maintenance of a capital leverage ratio. The leverage ratio is computed by dividing Tier I capital by average total assets. The regulators have established a minimum of 4% for this ratio but can increase the minimum requirement based upon an institution’s overall financial condition. At December 31, 2020, the Bank reported a leverage ratio of 9.93%. The Bank’s leverage ratio was also substantially above the minimum. The Bank also reported a capital conservation buffer of 6.81% at December 31, 2020. The capital conservation buffer is designed to strengthen an institution’s financial resilience during economic cycles. Financial institutions are required to maintain a minimum buffer as required by the Basel III final rules in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and other payments. The capital conservations buffer requirement was fully phased in on January 1, 2019 at 2.5%.

Market Risk Management
Most of the Company’s net income is dependent on the Bank’s net interest income. Rapid changes in short-term interest rates may lead to volatility in net interest income resulting in additional interest rate risk to the extent that imbalances exist between the maturities or repricing of interest-bearing liabilities and interest earning assets. The Company’s net interest margin decreased .72% in 2020 following a decrease of .27% in 2019. This decrease is primarily due to decreases in interest rates as well as changes in balance sheet structure including a decrease in loans held for investment, establishing an investment portfolio, and substantial deposit growth which led to excess funds on hand. In 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee elected to decrease the short-term rates target 150BP to 0% from 1.50%.
Net interest income is also affected by changes in the mix of funding that supports earning assets. For example, higher levels of non-interest bearing demand deposits and leveraging earning assets by funding with stockholder’s equity would result in greater levels of net interest income than if most of the earning assets were funded with higher cost interest-bearing liabilities, such as certificates of deposit and borrowings.
Liquid assets, which include cash and cash equivalents, federal funds sold, interest bearing deposits and short-term investments averaged $77,106 for 2020. The Bank historically has had a stable core deposit base and, therefore, does not have to rely on volatile funding sources. Because of growth in the core deposit base, liquid assets have grown over the prior year. The Company has increased efforts to raise deposits and depositors have changed their savings habits during 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While this helps liquidity, the investment options and rate market in general have hurt the new interest margin. The Company has lowered core deposit rates throughout 2020 to mitigate the decline in net interest margin. The Bank's membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank has historically provided liquidity as the Bank borrows money that is repaid over a five to ten-year period and uses the money to make fixed rate loans. With excess funds provided by deposit growth, management anticipates that FHLB borrowings will continue to mature without replacement. The matching of the long-term receivables and liabilities helps the Bank reduce its sensitivity to interest rate changes. The Company reviews its interest rate gap periodically and makes adjustments as needed. Management is not aware of any off-balance sheet items that will impair future liquidity.
The following table depicts the Company’s interest rate sensitivity, as measured by the repricing of its interest sensitive assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2020. As the notes to the table indicate, the data was based in part on assumptions as to when certain assets or liabilities would mature or reprice. The analysis indicates an asset sensitive one-year cumulative GAP position of 17.03% of total earning assets, compared to 17.16% in 2019. Approximately 40.04% of rate sensitive assets and 33.46% of rate sensitive liabilities are subject to repricing within one year. Short term assets (less than one year) increased $35,637 during the year, while total earning assets increased $151,801. The growth in earning assets is primarily due to the utilization of excess funds created by deposit growth. Short term deposits, maturities less than 365 days, increased $31,514 and short-term borrowings decreased $20,806. Short term borrowings decreased as advances matured and were not renewed.

The following GAP analysis shows the time frames as of December 31, 2020, in which the Company’s assets and liabilities are subject to repricing:
·
In preparing the above table, no assumptions are made with respect to loan prepayments or deposit run off. Loan principal payments are included in the earliest period in which the loan matures or can be repriced. Principal payments on installment loans scheduled prior to maturity are included in the period of maturity or repricing. Proceeds from the redemption of investments and deposits are included in the period of maturity. Estimated maturities on deposits which have no stated maturity dates were derived from regulatory guidance.
