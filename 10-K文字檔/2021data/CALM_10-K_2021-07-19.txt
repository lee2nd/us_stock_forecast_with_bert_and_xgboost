Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations in
the
Company's fiscal 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY
Our
working
capital
at
May
29,
was
$303.5 million,
compared
to
$429.1 million
at
May
30,
2020.
The
calculation
of
working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities. Our current ratio
was 5.77 at May 29, 2021 compared to 5.60
at May 30, 2020. The
current ratio is calculated
by dividing current assets by
current liabilities. Due to seasonal
factors described
Part I. Item I. Business - Seasonality
, we generally expect our need for working capital to be highest in
the fourth and first fiscal
quarters ending in May/June and August/September, respectively.
We
had no
long-term debt outstanding
at the
end of
fiscal 2021
and 2020.
On July 10,
2018, we
entered into a
$100.0 million
Senior Secured
Revolving Credit
Facility (the
“Revolving Credit
Facility”). As
of May
29, 2021,
no amounts
were borrowed
under the Revolving Credit Facility.
We have
$4.1 million in outstanding standby letters of credit, which were
issued under our
Revolving
Credit
Facility
for
the
benefit
of
certain
insurance
companies.
Refer
to
Part
II.
Item

the
Financial
Statements,

for further information regarding our long-term debt.
Net cash provided
by operating activities
was $26.1 million
for fiscal year
2021 compared with
$73.6 million for fiscal
year 2020.
Decreased gross profit margins resulting primarily from lower selling prices for shell
eggs, and increased feed costs contributed
greatly to
our decrease
in cash
flow from
operations. The
increase in
accounts receivables
balance at
fiscal 2021
compared to
prior fiscal
2020 is
due to
the income
tax receivable
related to
the CARES
Act, which
is expected
to be
received in
our third
quarter of fiscal 2022.
For fiscal 2021,
approximately $129.1 million was provided
from the sale
and maturity of
investments securities available-for-
sale, $88.3 million
was used
to purchase
short-term investments
and net
payments of
$6.7 million were
received from
investments
in unconsolidated entities. Approximately $95.1 million was
used to purchase or
construct property, plant
and equipment, most
of
which
related
to
the
expansion
of
our
cage-free
shell
egg
production
capacity. Refer
to
the
table
of
material
construction
projects presented
below for
additional information
on purchases
and construction
of property,
plant and
equipment. The
net
result of these and other activities as of May 29, 2021 was a decrease in cash of $20.8 million from May 30, 2020.
For fiscal 2020, approximately
$204.3 million was provided
from the sale and
maturity of investments securities
available-for-
sale,
$107.2
million
was
used
to
purchase
short-term
investments
and
net
payments
of
$7.1
million
were
received
from
investments
i
n
unconsolidated
entities.
We
used
$44.7
million
to
acquire
Mahard
and
the
remaining
interest
in
TEP.
Approximately $124.2
million was
used to
purchase or
construct property,
plant and
equipment, most
of which
related to
the
expansion of our cage-free shell
egg production capacity. Refer to the table of material construction
projects presented below for
additional
information
on
purchases
and
construction
of
property,
plant
and
equipment.
We
used
$1.5
million
for
principal
payments on long-term
debt. The net
result of these
and other activities
as of May
30, 2020 was
an increase in
cash of $8.9
million
from June 1, 2019.
We
continue to
monitor the
increasing demand
for cage-free
eggs and
to engage
with our
customers in
an effort
to achieve
a
smooth
transition
to
meet
their
announced
commitment
timeline
for
cage-free
egg
sales.
We
have
invested
approximately
$476 million in facilities, equipment and
related operations to expand our
cage-free production starting with our
first facility in
2008, which includes
the $48.5 million
acquisition of the
remaining 50% interest
in Red River
discussed in
Note 20 -

We believe
our current cash balances, investments, cash flows from
operations, and Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient
to fund our current capital needs. As we monitor the demand for cage-free eggs and
our growth strategy described in
Part I. Item
I. Business - Growth Strategy,
there may be a need for long-term
debt financing. We
believe with our strong balance sheet that
we will have adequate access to capital markets if that need arises.

IMPACT OF RECENTLY
ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
For information on changes in accounting principles and new accounting principles, see “
New Accounting Pronouncements and
Policies
” in Part II. Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements
in accordance with U.S. GAAP
requires management to make estimates
and assumptions
that affect the
reported amounts
of assets
and liabilities
at the
date of
the financial
statements and
the reported
amounts of
revenues
and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could
differ from these estimates.
Critical accounting estimates
are those
estimates made
in accordance
with GAAP that
involve a significant
level of estimation
uncertainty and
have had
or are reasonably
likely to have a
material impact on the
financial condition or
results of operations. Our
critical accounting estimates
are described
below.
INVESTMENTS IN SECURITIES
Our investment
securities are
accounted for
in accordance
with ASC
320, “Investments
- Debt
and Equity
Securities” (“ASC
320”). The
Company considers
all of
its debt
securities for
which there
is a
determinable fair
market value,
and there
are no
restrictions
on
the
Company's
ability
to
sell
within
the
next
months,
as
available-for-sale.
We
classify
these
securities
as
current, because the amounts invested are available for
current operations. Available-for-sale
securities are carried at fair value,
with unrealized
gains and
losses reported
as a
separate component
of stockholders’
equity.
The Company
regularly evaluates
changes to the
rating of its
debt securities by credit
agencies and economic conditions
to assess and
record any expected credit
losses through allowance for credit losses,
limited to the amount that fair
value was less than the
amortized cost basis. The cost
basis for realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities is determined by the specific identification method. Gains and
losses are recognized
in other income
(expenses) as Other, net
in the Company's
Consolidated Statements of
Income. Investments
in mutual funds are classified as “Other long-term assets” in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.
ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS
Trade receivables
are stated
at their
carrying values,
which include
a reserve
for credit
losses. The
Company extends credit
to
customers based on an
evaluation of each customer's financial
condition and credit history.
Collateral is generally not required.
The Company minimizes
exposure to counter
party credit risk
through credit analysis
and approvals, credit
limits, and monitoring
procedures. In
determining our
reserve for
credit losses,
receivables are
pooled according
to age,
with each
pool assigned
an
expected loss based on historical loss information adjusted as needed for economic and other forward-looking factors.
INVENTORIES
Inventories of
eggs, feed, supplies
and flocks
are valued principally
at the
lower of cost
(first-in, first-out
method) or
net realizable
value. If market
prices for
eggs and
feed grains
move substantially
lower,
we record
adjustments to
write down
the carrying
values of eggs
and feed inventories
to fair market
value. The cost
associated with flock
inventories, consisting
principally of chick
purchases, feed, labor, contractor payments and overhead costs, are accumulated during the growing period of approximately 22
weeks. Capitalized flock costs are then amortized over the flock’s
productive life, generally one to two years. Flock mortality is
charged to cost of sales as incurred. High mortality from disease or extreme temperatures will result in abnormal write-downs to
flock inventories. Management continually monitors each flock
and attempts to take appropriate actions
to minimize the risk of
mortality loss.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS
Depreciable long-lived
assets are
primarily comprised
of buildings,
improvements, machinery
and equipment. Depreciation
is
provided by the
straight-line method over
the estimated useful
lives, which are
15 to 25
years for buildings
and improvements
and 3 to 12 years for machinery and equipment. An increase or decrease in the
estimated useful lives would result in changes to
depreciation expense. When property and equipment are retired, sold, or otherwise disposed of,
the asset’s carrying amount and
related accumulated depreciation are removed
from the accounts and
any gain or loss
is included in operations. We
continually
reevaluate the carrying value
of our long-lived assets,
for events or changes
in circumstances which indicate the
carrying value
may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result
from its use and eventual disposition. If the sum
of the expected future
cash flows (undiscounted and
without interest charges) are
less than the carrying amount
of the asset, an
impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Included in other intangible assets are
separable intangible assets acquired in
business acquisitions, which include franchise
fees,
non-compete agreements and customer
relationship intangibles. They are
amortized over their
estimated useful lives of
5 to 15
years. The
gross
cost
and
accumulated
amortization
of
intangible
assets
are
removed
when
the
recorded
amounts
are
fully
amortized and the asset is no longer in use.
EQUITY AND COST METHOD INVESTMENTS
We have invested in
other companies
engaged in
the production,
processing and
distribution of
shell eggs
and egg
products. These
investments are recorded
using the cost
or equity
method, and
are not consolidated
in our financial
statements. Changes in the
ownership
percentages
of
these
investments
might
alter
the
accounting
methods
currently
used.
Our
investment
in
these
companies is shown on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet in the amounts presented for "Investment in unconsolidated
entities" and “Other long-term assets”.
GOODWILL
Goodwill is evaluated for impairment
annually by first performing a
qualitative assessment to determine whether a
quantitative
goodwill test is necessary.
After assessing the totality of events
or circumstances, if we determine it
is more likely than not that
the fair value of
a reporting unit is
less than its carrying
amount, then we perform
additional quantitative tests to
determine the
magnitude of any impairment.
At May 29, 2021, goodwill represented 2.9% of total assets and
3.5% of stockholders’ equity. Goodwill relates
to the following

REVENUE RECOGNITION AND DELIVERY COSTS
Revenue recognition is completed
upon satisfaction of the
performance obligation to the
customer, which typically occurs within
days of the Company and customer agreeing upon the order. See
Note 14 - Revenue Recognition
in Part II. Item 8. Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the policy.
The Company believes the performance
obligation is met upon delivery
and acceptance of the product
by our customers. Costs
to deliver product
to customers are
included in selling,
general and administrative
expenses in the
accompanying Consolidated
Statements
of
Income. Sales
revenue
reported
in
the
accompanying
Consolidated
Statements
of
Income
is
reduced
to
reflect
estimated returns
and allowances. The
Company records
an estimated
sales allowance
for returns
and discounts
at the
time of
sale using historical trends based on actual sales returns and sales.
SALES INCENTIVES PROVIDED TO CUSTOMERS
The Company periodically
provides incentive
offers to its
customers to encourage
purchases. Such
offers include current
discount
offers (e.g., percentage
discounts off current purchases),
inducement offers (e.g.,
offers for future discounts
subject to a
minimum
current purchase), and other similar offers. Current
discount offers, when accepted by customers,
are treated as a reduction to the
sales price
of the
related transaction, while
inducement offers,
when accepted
by customers, are
treated as
a reduction to
sales
price based on estimated future redemption rates. Redemption rates are estimated using the Company’s historical experience for
similar inducement offers.
Current discount and inducement offers are presented as a net amount in ‘‘Net sales.’’
STOCK BASED COMPENSATION
We
account
for
share-based
compensation
in
accordance
with
ASC
718,
“Compensation-Stock
Compensation”
(“ASC
718”). ASC 718 requires
all share-based payments
to employees, including
grants of employee
stock options, restricted
stock and
performance-based shares to be recognized in the statement of
income based on their fair values. ASC 718 requires
the benefits
of
tax
deductions
in
excess
of
recognized
compensation
cost
to
be
reported
as
a
financing
cash
flow. See
Note 16 - Stock
Compensation Plans
in Part II. Item 8. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
INCOME TAXES
We
determine our effective tax
rate by estimating our
permanent differences resulting from
differing treatment of
items for tax
and
accounting
purposes. We
are
periodically
audited
by
taxing
authorities. Any
audit
adjustments
affecting
permanent
differences could have an impact on our effective tax rate.
