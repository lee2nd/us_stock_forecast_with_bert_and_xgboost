Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations as of, and for, the periods presented and should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding industry outlook, our expectations for the future of our business, and our liquidity and capital resources as well as other non-historical statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the risks and uncertainties described in “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements.
Overview
We are dedicated to supporting local, independent businesses and franchises by providing innovative marketing solutions and cloud-based tools to the entrepreneurs who run them.
We are one of the largest domestic providers of SaaS end-to-end customer experience tools and digital marketing solutions to SMBs. Our solutions enable our SMB clients to generate new business leads, manage their customer relationships and run their day-to-day business operations.
We serve over 330,000 SMB clients through two business segments: Marketing Services and SaaS.
Our Marketing Services segment provides both print and digital solutions and generated $979.6 million, $1,292.8 million and $1,659.8 million of consolidated total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our Marketing Services offerings include our owned and operated PYP, which carry the “The Real Yellow Pages” tagline, our proprietary IYP, known by the Yellowpages.com, Superpages.com, and Dexknows.com URLs, SEM solutions and other digital media solutions, which include online display and social advertising, online presence, and video and SEO tools.
Our SaaS segment generated $129.8 million, $128.6 million and $124.6 million of consolidated total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our primary SaaS offerings include Thryv, our flagship SMB end-to-end customer experience platform, and Thryv Leads, an automated lead generation service that integrates with our Thryv platform.
Our expertise in delivering solutions for our client base is rooted in our deep history of serving SMBs. In 2020, SMB demand for integrated technology solutions continues to grow as SMBs adapt their business and service model to facilitate remote working and virtual interactions. We have seen this trend accelerate following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic from March 2020 onwards.
On October 1, 2020, the Company completed a direct listing of the Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market, under the symbol “THRY”.
On March 1, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of Sensis Holding Limited (the “Sensis Acquisition”), Australia’s leading provider of marketing solutions serving SMBs. The Sensis Acquisition brings more than 100,000 existing Sensis clients under the Thryv banner, many of which are ideal candidates for the Thryv platform. See Note 18, Subsequent Events, to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, for more information.
Recent Developments - COVID-19
In March 2020, the World Health Organization categorized COVID-19 as a pandemic. The outbreak of COVID-19 and public and private sector measures to reduce its transmission, such as the imposition of social distancing and orders to work-from-home, stay-at-home and shelter-in place, have significantly disrupted the global economy, resulting in an adverse effect to the business operations of certain SMBs. However, many of our SMB clients operate service-based businesses that can easily operate remotely, or are designated as “essential” by state and local authorities administering shelter-in-place orders, and have continued to operate without significant interruption during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the impact of COVID-19 and the related regulatory and private sector response on our financial and operating results in the year ended December 31, 2020 was somewhat mitigated as many of our clients continue to operate during this pandemic.
In our Marketing Services segment, we began offering certain pandemic credit incentives to select clients, including free advertising or headings, and payment extensions of up to three months. Additionally, some clients elected to pause their online advertising programs, which resulted in a $7.5 million reduction in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. Marketing
Services segment revenue decreased by $313.2 million or 24.2% during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the continued trending decline in demand for print and digital services and increased competition. This trending decline in Marketing Services, which has experienced an annual decline in revenue in recent years, predated the COVID-19 pandemic. While the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our revenues depends upon the rate of continued spread of the virus as well as regulatory and private sector response, we expect Marketing Services revenues will continue to be impacted primarily by trends predating the COVID-19 pandemic.
In our SaaS segment, we have continued to experience an increase in demand as SMBs seek integrated technology solutions to facilitate virtual interactions with their customers in lieu of in person interactions. Because of this recent increase in demand, the number of new clients has increased by 2% during the three months ended December 31, 2020, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2019. We have seen continued strength in demand during this period from many of our key categories such as home services and professional services. Offsetting this growth is a decline in our legacy SaaS client base as a result of our continued focus on targeting higher spend, higher engaged clients in lieu of lower-spend, less engaged clients that tend to have a higher churn. Additionally, we began offering certain pandemic credit incentives to select clients, including free digital and SaaS services for two to four months, and payment extensions of up to three months.
We have taken steps to mitigate the overall potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operating results by enhancing the capabilities of our inside and outside sales force while also actively managing costs. We minimized business disruptions by quickly and proactively transitioning our sales and client support teams into a remote working environment and providing increased training, technical capabilities and resources to enable virtual interactions with our clients. Additionally, in March 2020, we began offering certain pandemic credit incentives to select clients. These pandemic credits resulted in a $17.5 million reduction in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. New requests for incentives have continued to decline in the second half of 2020 and the majority of clients who accepted incentives in the first half of 2020 started to resume contractual terms and pricing. However, due to a spike in COVID-19 cases during the three months ended December 31, 2020, we continued to offer pandemic credit incentives in 2021. Currently, we are continuously monitoring the business environment of our clients. We expect to provide further assistance to those clients in need through the first half of Spring 2021. Depending upon future development and spread of the virus, we expect the business environment to improve as more people are vaccinated and thus the need for assistance may diminish by the middle of the second quarter of 2021. With respect to managing our costs, steps we have taken include cuts in non-essential spending, reduction in force, suspension of merit raises, suspension of our employee 401(k) match program and decrease of other selected benefits. Merit raises and the employee 401(k) match program have been reinstated for 2021. We believe the majority of these other cost-saving measures to be temporary in nature. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred total severance expense of $11.7 million. The severance expense includes employee termination charges of $5.0 million, recorded as a result of COVID-19. The economic downturn caused by COVID-19 resulted in an incremental amount of $2.1 million recorded to allowance for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, we remain committed to our variable cost structure and to limiting our capital expenditures, which will allow the Company to continue operating with relatively low working capital needs.
On June 23, 2020, we announced our plans to become a “Remote First” company, meaning that the majority of our workforce will continue to operate in a remote working environment indefinitely. As a result, we have closed certain office buildings, including most of the space at our corporate headquarters in Dallas. We will keep certain office buildings open to house essential employees who cannot perform their duties remotely, such as employees who work in our data centers in Dallas and Virginia. The closures of our offices resulted in impairment charges totaling $24.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
While the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2020, the overall impact was somewhat mitigated by the nature of our client base (SMBs offering services related to home, health and wellness, automotive, etc. and certain SMBs designated as “essential” by state and local authorities), the terms of our print agreements (typically 14 to 15 months), and the gradual increase in demand for our Thryv platform. The increase in demand for our Thryv platform and our decision to target higher spend and higher- retention clients have also somewhat mitigated the impact of a reduced salesforce on the Company’s ability to generate revenues.
During early 2021, we have continued to see trends similar to those experienced during the year ended December 31, 2020, including an increase in demand for our SaaS solutions and a continuing trend of decline in our Marketing Services business. The challenges we face in the future relating to COVID-19 will depend largely, we believe, on the impact that the continuing spread of the virus and regulatory and private sector response have on our current and prospective clients, including their ability and willingness to purchase our solutions, the timing of their purchasing decisions and the willingness of existing clients to renew subscriptions for our solutions. Although to date, the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material impact on our operational performance, financial performance, or liquidity, it is difficult to predict what the ongoing impact of the pandemic will be on the economy, our clients and our business.
Factors Affecting Our Performance
Our operations can be impacted by, among other factors, general economic conditions and increased competition with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants. We believe that our performance and future success depend on a number of factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges, including those listed below and those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors.”
Ability to Attract and Retain Clients
Our revenue growth is driven by our ability to attract and retain SMB clients. To do so, we must deliver solutions that address the challenges currently faced by SMBs at a value-based price point that an SMB can afford.
Our strategy is to expand the use of our solutions by introducing our SaaS solutions to new SMB clients, as well as our current Marketing Services clients. This strategy includes capitalizing on the increased needs of SMBs for solutions that facilitate a remote working environment and virtual interactions. This strategy will require substantial sales and marketing capital.
Investment in Growth
We intend to continue to invest in the growth of our SaaS segment. We have selectively utilized a portion of the cash generated from our Marketing Services segment to support initiatives in our evolving SaaS segment, which has represented an increasing percentage of total revenue since launch. The SaaS segment became profitable during 2019. We intend to continue to improve our SaaS solutions by analyzing user behavior, expanding features, improving usability, enhancing our onboarding services and customer support and making version updates available to SMBs. We believe these initiatives will ultimately drive revenue growth; however, such improvements will also likely increase our operating expenses.
Ability to Grow Through Acquisition
Our growth prospects depend upon our ability to successfully develop new markets. We currently serve the United States SMB market and plan to leverage strategic acquisitions to expand our client base domestically and enter new markets internationally. Identifying proper targets and executing strategic acquisitions may take substantial time and capital. In August 2020, we launched our first international SaaS reseller pilot, a joint initiative with the leading yellow pages player in the Caribbean, and we also signed a SaaS multi-location franchise client, a home services company with operations in the U.S. and Canada. On March 1, 2021 we completed the Sensis Acquisition. See Note 18, Subsequent Events, to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report for additional information related to the acquisition of Sensis, Australia’s leading provider of marketing solutions serving SMBs. We believe that acquisitions of marketing services companies will expand our client base and provide additional opportunities to offer our SaaS solutions. Our success largely depends on our ability to identify and execute acquisition opportunities and our ability to establish relationships with new SMBs.
Key Business Metrics
We review several operating metrics, including the following key business metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. We believe these key metrics are useful to investors both because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, and they may be used by investors to help analyze the health of our business.
Total Clients
We define total clients as the number of SMB accounts with one or more revenue-generating solutions in a particular period. For quarter- and year-ending periods, total clients from the last month in the period are reported. A single client may have separate revenue-generating accounts for multiple Marketing Services solutions or SaaS offerings, but we count these as one client when the accounts are managed by the same business entity or individual. Although infrequent, where a single organization has multiple subsidiaries, divisions, or segments, each business entity that is invoiced by us is treated as a separate client. We believe that the number of total clients is an indicator of our market penetration and potential future business opportunities. We view the mix between Marketing Services clients and SaaS clients as an indicator of potential future opportunities to offer our SaaS solutions to our Marketing Services clients.
Marketing Services Clients
Clients that purchase one or more of our Marketing Services solutions are included in this metric. These clients may or may not also purchase subscriptions to our SaaS offerings.
SaaS Clients
Clients that purchase subscriptions to our SaaS offerings are included in this metric. These clients may or may not also purchase one or more of our Marketing Services solutions.
(1)Marketing Services clients plus SaaS clients are greater than Total clients since clients that purchase both Marketing Services and SaaS are considered only one client in the Total client count when the accounts are managed by the same business entity or individual.
Marketing Services clients decreased by 69 thousand, or 18% as of December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019. Marketing Services clients decreased by 80 thousand, or 17%, as of December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018. The decrease in Marketing Services clients for all periods was related to a secular decline in the print media industry. The decline in the digital portion of our Marketing Services business was due to significant competition in the consumer search and display space, particularly from large, well-capitalized businesses such as Google, Yelp and Facebook.
SaaS clients decreased by 3 thousand, or 6% as of December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019. SaaS clients decreased by 7 thousand, or 13%, as of December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018. The decrease in SaaS clients in each period was the result of an intentional strategic move by us to target higher spend, higher retention clients in lieu of lower-spend, higher churn clients. As part of this strategy, we discontinued sale of lower priced tiers of our Thryv platform, which led to higher monthly average revenue per unit (“ARPU”) for the year ended December 31, 2020. In making this strategic shift, our SaaS client count has decreased while SaaS ARPU has increased, and we expect this trend to continue into fiscal year 2021.
Total clients decreased by 69 thousand, or 17% as of December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019. Total clients decreased by 81 thousand, or 17%, as of December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018. The primary driver of the decrease in total clients was the secular decline in the print media business combined with increasing competition in the digital media space.
Monthly ARPU
We define monthly ARPU as our total client billings for a particular month divided by the number of revenue-generating units during the same month. For each reporting period, the weighted average monthly ARPU from all the months in the period are reported. We define units as SMB accounts with one or more revenue-generating solutions in a particular month. Units are synonymous with clients. As monthly ARPU varies based on the amounts we charge for our services, we believe it can serve as a measure by which investors can evaluate trends in the types and levels of services across our client base. Our measurement of ARPU helps us understand the rate at which we are monetizing our client base.
(1)During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, total monthly ARPU is higher than the individual monthly ARPUs for Marketing Services and SaaS due to clients that purchase both Marketing Services and SaaS solutions. During the year ended December 31, 2020, SaaS ARPU is higher than total monthly ARPU as we shift to selling to more higher spend SaaS-only clients.
Monthly ARPU for the Marketing Services segment decreased by $13 or 6% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, and decreased by $15 or 6% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in ARPU for these periods was related to reduced spend by clients on our print media offerings due to the secular decline of the industry caused by the continuing shift of advertising spend to less expensive digital media. This decrease in ARPU was further driven by a reduction of our resale of high-spend, low margin third-party local search and display services that were not hosted on our owned and operated platforms.
Monthly ARPU for the SaaS segment increased by $37 or 17% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, and increased by $18 or 9% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in ARPU for these periods was largely driven by our strategic shift to selling to higher spend clients and, at the same time, discontinuing our sale of the lower-priced tiers of our Thryv platform. In addition, we introduced higher priced tiers of our Thryv platform to our clients in the second quarter of 2019, which raised our overall SaaS monthly ARPU.
Monthly Active Users - SaaS
We define a monthly active user for SaaS offerings as a client with one or more users who log into our SaaS solutions at least once during the calendar month. It should be noted that the inherent challenge is that one individual may register for, and use, multiple accounts across computer and mobile devices which may overstate the number of unique users who actively use our Thryv platform within a month. Additionally, some of our original SaaS clients exclusively use the website features of their Thryv platform which does not require a login and those users are not included in our active users count. For each reporting period, active users from the last month in the period are reported. We believe that monthly active users best reflects our ability to engage, retain, and monetize our users, and thereby drive increases in revenue. We view monthly active users as a key measure of user engagement for our Thryv platform.
Monthly active users increased by 5 thousand, or 22% during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Monthly active users remained flat for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The number of monthly active users increased period over period despite the decline in the total number of SaaS clients as we undertook efforts such as enhancing the sales process, client onboarding experience and lifecycle management in order to increase engagement among our SaaS clients. The increase was also driven by the focus by our sales team on obtaining higher retention, higher spend clients as these clients are more engaged with our platform. Additionally, we experienced an increase in engagement from existing clients as SMBs increased virtual interactions with their customers in lieu of in person interactions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Key Components of Our Results of Operations
Revenue
We generate revenue from our two business segments, Marketing Services and SaaS. Our primary sources of revenue in our Marketing Services segment are print and digital services. Our primary source of revenue in our SaaS segment is our Thryv platform.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses consist of cost of services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization), sales and marketing, general and administrative, and depreciation and amortization.
Cost of Services (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization)
Cost of services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) consists of expenses related to delivering our solutions, such as publishing, printing, and distribution of our print directories and fulfillment of our digital and SaaS offerings. Additionally, it includes personnel-related expenses such as salaries paid to our information technology personnel, as well as internet operations and development personnel, stock-based compensation expense, and non-capitalizable software and hardware purchases.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of base salaries, stock-based compensation, sales commissions paid to our inside and outside sales force and other expenses incurred by personnel within the sales, marketing, sales training, and client care departments. Additionally, Sales and marketing expense includes advertising costs such as media, promotional material, branding, and online advertising.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expense primarily consists of compensation expense incurred by corporate management and administrative functions such as finance and accounting, legal, internal audit, human resources, billing and receivables, and management personnel. In addition, General and administrative expense includes stock-based compensation expense, bad debt expense, restructuring and integration charges, and other corporate expenses such as professional fees, operating taxes, and insurance.
Depreciation and Amortization Expense
Depreciation and amortization expense consists of depreciation from fixed assets and amortization associated with capitalized software and intangible assets.
Other Income (Expense)
Other income (expense) consists of interest expense, other components of net periodic pension cost, and (loss) gain on early extinguishment of debt.
Results of Operations
Consolidated Results of Operations - Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
The following table sets forth certain consolidated financial data for each of the periods indicated:
(i)Impairment charges, which was previously included as part of General and administrative expense, is presented as a separate line item for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2020 to the Year Ended December 31, 2019
Revenue
The following table summarizes revenues by business segment for the periods indicated:
Total revenues decreased by $311.9 million, or 21.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in total revenues was driven by a decrease in Marketing Services revenue of $313.2 million, partially offset by an increase in SaaS revenue of $1.2 million.
Marketing Services Revenue
Marketing Services revenue decreased by $313.2 million, or 24.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
Print revenue decreased by $162.6 million, or 26.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Secular decline in industry demand for print services resulted in a 20% decline in revenue compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, with the remaining decline primarily driven by publication timing differences caused by our print agreements having greater than 12 month terms. Print revenue is recognized upon delivery of the published directories. Individual directory titles have different lifecycles, which typically range from 14 to 15 months. The titles published during the year ended December 31, 2020 are therefore different than the titles published during the year ended December 31, 2019. This should be considered when comparing period over period.
Digital services revenue decreased by $150.5 million, or 21.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. IYP and SEM revenues decreased by $123.2 million, or 21.6%, driven by a continued trending decline in the Company’s client base due to significant competition in the consumer search and display space, particularly from large, well-capitalized businesses such as Google, Yelp and Facebook. Other digital media solutions revenue decreased by $27.3 million, or 23.7%, as we shifted from selling these services on a standalone basis to only offering them as inclusions or add-ons to our Thryv platform for new clients.
SaaS Revenue
SaaS revenue increased by $1.2 million, or 1.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was driven by increased demand for our Thryv platform as SMBs have increased their contact-less customer interactions and remote working capabilities due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and by our success in re-focusing our go-to-market and onboarding strategy targeting on higher spend and higher engaged clients. This is partially offset by a decline in our lower-spend and less engaged legacy SaaS clients that tend to have a higher churn and an increase in the provision for service credits due to COVID-19.
Operating Expenses
Cost of Services (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization)
Cost of services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) decreased by $109.7 million, or 23.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in Cost of services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was primarily driven by declining revenue and strategic cost savings initiatives. Cost of services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) as a percentage of revenue decreased to 33.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 33.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decline was largely the result of the Company’s continued efforts to reduce costs in order to maintain profitability, and the completion of restructuring and integration efforts associated with the acquisition of YP Holdings, Inc. (the “YP Acquisition”) on June 30, 2017 (the “Acquisition Date”) and reduced workforce due to the impacts of COVID-19. Specifically, we reduced printing, distribution and digital and fulfillment support costs by $63.4 million, contract services by $17.7 million, employee related costs by $14.2 million, and non-capitalized software and hardware purchases by $7.4 million.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expense decreased by $89.7 million, or 25.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue decreased to 23.7% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 24.8% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in Sales and marketing expense was primarily due to declining revenues and cost savings initiatives that were undertaken to mitigate the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations. Specifically, the decrease in Sales and marketing expense was due to lower employee related costs of $54.1 million and lower sales commissions of $14.8 million, primarily due to our reduction in workforce. Additionally, travel expenses decreased by $8.5 million, facility costs decreased by $4.0 million, and automobile allowance decreased by $3.1 million.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expense decreased by $18.0 million, or 10.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of $15.2 million. The Company recorded a stock-based compensation benefit of $3.1 million in general and administrative expense during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to stock-based compensation expense of $12.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. Additionally, the Company recorded lower restructuring and integration expenses of $12.4 million, a decrease in contract services of $7.8 million, and lower facility costs of $3.3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in direct listing and other transaction costs of $14.9 million and higher bad debt expense of $2.0 million.
General and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue increased to 14.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 12.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily attributable to the decrease in total revenue and was also driven by the increase in direct listing and other transaction costs and higher severance expense.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $59.7 million, or 29.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
The decrease in Depreciation and amortization resulted primarily from a decline of $50.7 million related to amortization of our intangible assets. The Company uses the income forecast method, which is an accelerated amortization method that assumes the remaining value of the intangible asset is greater in the earlier years and then steadily declines over time based on expected future cash flows. Depreciation and amortization further decreased due to a decline in depreciation and amortization expense of $9.0 million primarily related to the Company's retirement of fixed assets and capitalized software.
Impairment Charges
Impairment charges increased by $19.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was due to the Company becoming a Remote First company and the closing of certain office buildings, including most of the space at its corporate headquarters in Dallas, Texas. Impairment charges recorded during the year ended December 31, 2019 were the result of consolidating operations at certain locations.
Other Income (Expense)
Interest Expense
Interest expense decreased by $24.4 million, or 26.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 due to lower indebtedness and lower LIBOR rates. The Company incurred interest expense from related parties of $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $24.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Other Components of Net Periodic Pension Cost
Other components of net periodic pension cost decreased by $10.9 million, or 20.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense of $8.2 million, a lower remeasurement loss of $1.8 million, and a higher expected return on assets of $1.0 million, partially offset by a higher settlement loss of $0.1 million.
Benefit (Provision) for Income Taxes
The Company recorded a benefit for income taxes of $108.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a (provision) for income taxes of $(18.1) million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The effective income tax rate was (261.0%) and 33.7% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the effective tax rate differs from the 21.0% U.S. Federal statutory rate primarily due to a partial release of the valuation allowance, partial release of uncertain tax positions, and tax permanent differences. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the effective tax rate differs from the 21.0% U.S. Federal statutory rate primarily due to the changes in valuation allowance and tax permanent differences.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $109.8 million, or 22.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by the decrease in total revenue, which was partially offset by declining costs as we continue to focus on cost reductions.
Consolidated Results of Operations - Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018
(i)Impairment charges, which was previously included as part of General and administrative expense, is presented as a separate line item for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.
Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2019 to the Year Ended December 31, 2018.
Revenue
The following table summarizes revenues by business segment for the periods indicated:
Total revenues decreased by $363.0 million, or 20.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in total revenues was driven by a decrease in Marketing Services revenue of $367.0 million, partially offset by an increase in SaaS revenue of $4.0 million.
Marketing Services Revenue
Marketing Services revenue decreased by $367.0 million, or 22.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.
Print revenue decreased by $192.9 million, or 24.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This was primarily driven by the decline in the overall industry demand for print services and as a result of publication timing differences caused by our print agreements having greater than 12 month terms. Print revenue is recognized upon delivery of the published directories. Individual directory titles have different lifecycles, which typically range 14 to 15 months. The titles published during the year ended December 31, 2019 are therefore different than the titles published during the year ended December 31, 2018. This should be considered when comparing period over period.
Digital services revenue decreased by $174.1 million, or 20.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. IYP and SEM revenues decreased by $136.7 million, or 19.3%, driven by a continued trending decline in the Company’s client base due to significant competition in the consumer search and display space, particularly from large, well-capitalized businesses such as Google, Yelp and Facebook. Other digital media solutions revenue decreased by $37.4 million, or 24.5%, as we shifted from selling these services on a standalone basis to only offering them as add-ons to our Thryv platform for new clients.
SaaS Revenue
SaaS revenue increased by $4.0 million, or 3.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in SaaS revenue was largely driven by the April 2018 launch of Thryv Leads.
Operating Expenses
Cost of Services (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization)
Cost of services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) decreased by $170.9 million, or 26.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in Cost of services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was primarily driven by declining revenue and strategic cost savings initiatives. Cost of services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) as a percentage of revenue decreased to 33.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019 from 36.3% for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decline largely resulted from the Company’s continued efforts to reduce costs in order to maintain profitability and the completion of the YP restructuring and integration efforts in 2019. Specifically, we reduced printing, distribution and digital and fulfillment support costs by $117.0 million. Additionally, we reduced employee related costs by $22.2 million.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expense decreased by $116.5 million, or 24.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in Sales and marketing expense was primarily due to declining revenues and strategic cost savings initiatives. Sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue decreased to 24.8% for the year ended December 31, 2019 from 26.3% for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Specifically, the decline in sales and marketing expense was due to lower employee related costs of $53.5 million, lower advertising, sales promotion and other brand management costs of $31.5 million, and lower sales commissions of $21.0 million.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expense decreased by $64.3 million, or 26.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.
Restructuring and integration costs of $46.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased by $41.3 million, or 47.3%, as compared to $87.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. In the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company continued its efforts to eliminate redundancies in the workforce, information technology, and facilities as part of its YP restructuring and integration efforts. As of December 31, 2019, the cumulative cost of these efforts amounted to $198.9 million. The Company completed its restructuring and integration efforts in 2019. As a result of the restructuring and integration costs, the Company generated significant cost savings, which were largely realized by December 31, 2019.
The decrease in General and administrative expense was further driven by a decrease of $19.1 million in stock-based compensation expense related to our liability-classified stock-based compensation awards, resulting from the Company’s tender offer (the “Tender Offer”) and a decrease in per share fair value. The Company completed the Tender Offer in May 2019, in which we settled approximately 2.3 million outstanding stock options. Additionally, the per share value of our stock decreased from $18.77 as of December 31, 2018 to $16.51 as of December 31, 2019
General and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue decreased to 12.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019 from 13.4% for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decline largely resulted from the Company’s continued focus on reducing costs to maintain profitability and YP restructuring and integration efforts.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $60.7 million, or 22.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.
The decrease in Depreciation and amortization resulted primarily from a decline of $54.5 million related to amortization of our intangible assets. The Company uses the income forecast method, which is an accelerated amortization method that assumes the remaining value of the intangible asset is greater in the earlier years and then steadily declines over time based on expected future cash flows. Depreciation and amortization further decreased due to a decline in depreciation expense of $6.2 million as we retired certain fixed assets and capitalized software.
Impairment Charges
Impairment charges increased by $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Impairment charges recorded during the year ended December 31, 2019 were the result of consolidating operations at certain locations. No impairment charges were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018.
Other Income (Expense)
Interest Expense
Interest expense increased by $10.3 million, or 12.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 due to higher indebtedness. The Company incurred interest expense from third parties of $68.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $53.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Company incurred interest expense from related parties of $24.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $28.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Other Components of Net Periodic Pension Cost
Other components of net periodic pension cost increased by $52.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to a mark to market pension remeasurement loss of $45.4 million, during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to a pension remeasurement gain of $3.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. Other components of net periodic pension cost were also affected by an increase in interest expense of $1.2 million and lower expected return on assets of $1.7 million, offset by a settlement loss increase of $0.9 million.
(Loss) on Early Extinguishment of Debt
During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company incurred a loss of $6.4 million on early extinguishment of debt upon funding of the second installment of the Senior Term Loan while during the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company incurred a loss on extinguishment of $18.4 million. See Note 11, Debt Obligations, to our audited consolidated financial statements for more information.
(Provision) Benefit for Income Taxes
(Provision) for income taxes of $18.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $9.6 million compared to the $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The effective income tax rate was 33.7% and 14.0% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The change in the effective rate was primarily driven by the change in valuation allowance due to the change in the realizability of deferred tax assets.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $76.1 million, or 13.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by the decrease in total revenue, which was partially offset by declining costs as we continue to focus on cost reductions.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We prepare our audited consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We also present Adjusted EBITDA, as defined below, as a non-GAAP financial measure in this Annual Report.
We use Adjusted EBITDA because management believes it provides useful information to investors in gaining an overall understanding of our current financial performance and provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance. Specifically, we believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to management and investors by excluding certain non-operating items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is used by management for budgeting and forecasting as well as measuring the Company’s performance. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with a financial measure that most closely aligns with our internal processes.
We define Adjusted EBITDA (“Adjusted EBITDA”) as Net income plus Interest expense, provision for income taxes, Depreciation and amortization expense, Loss on early extinguishment of debt, Restructuring and integration charges, Transaction costs, Stock-based compensation expense, Impairment charges and non-operating expenses, such as, Other components of net periodic pension cost, Non-cash (gain) loss from remeasurement of indemnification asset, and certain unusual and non-recurring charges that might have been incurred. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a performance measure.
Non-GAAP financial information has limitations as an analytical tool and is presented for supplemental informational purposes only. Such information should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
The following is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income (in thousands):
(1)Income tax benefit of $(108.0) million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020, was primarily attributable to a partial release of the Company’s valuation allowance on the basis of management’s reassessment of the amount of its deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized.
(2)For the year ended December 31, 2020, expenses relate to periodic efforts to enhance efficiencies and reduce costs, and include severance benefits, loss on disposal of fixed assets and capitalized software, and costs associated with abandoned facilities and system consolidation. A portion of the severance benefits, amounting to $5.0 million, resulted from COVID-19. For further detail on severance benefits, see Note 9, Accrued Liabilities, to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, restructuring and integration charges include severance benefits, facility exit costs, system consolidation and integration costs, and professional consulting and advisory services costs related to the YP Acquisition. See Note 6, Restructuring and Integration Expenses, to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report.
(3)Expenses related to the Company's direct listing and other transaction costs.
(4)The Company records stock-based compensation expense related to the amortization of grant date fair value of the Company’s stock-based compensation awards. Prior to October 1, 2020, stock-based compensation expense includes the remeasurement of these awards at each period end. See Note 4, Fair Value Measurements, to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report for more information.
(5)Other components of net periodic pension cost is from our non-contributory defined benefit pension plans that are currently frozen and incur no additional service costs. The most significant component of other components of net periodic pension cost relates to the mark to market pension remeasurement. See Note 12, Pensions, to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report for more information.
(6)In connection with the YP Acquisition, the seller provided the Company indemnity for future potential losses associated with certain federal and state tax positions taken in tax returns filed by the seller prior to the Acquisition Date. The indemnity covers potential losses in excess of $8.0 million and is capped at an amount equal to the lesser of the uncertain tax position (“UTP”) liability or the current fair value of the 1,804,715 shares of the Company's common stock issued to the seller as part of the purchase consideration.
(7)Impairment charges of $24.9 million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020 are primarily due to the Company closing certain office buildings as part of becoming a “Remote First” company, and consolidating operations at certain locations. Impairment charges of $5.7 million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2019, are due to consolidating operations at certain locations and are included in Restructuring and integration charges in the consolidated statements of operations.
(8)Other primarily includes expenses related to potential non-income based tax liabilities.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company is a holding company that does not conduct any business operations of its own. We derive cash flows from cash transfers and other distributions from our operating subsidiary, Thryv Inc., who in turn generates cash flow from operations and has cash and cash equivalents on hand, funds provided under term loan facilities and funds available under the ABL Facility. The agreements governing our Senior Credit Facilities may restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make loans or otherwise transfer assets to us. Further, our subsidiaries are permitted under the terms of our Senior Credit Facilities and other indebtedness to incur additional indebtedness that may restrict or prohibit the making of distributions or the making of loans by such subsidiaries to us. Our and our subsidiaries’ ability to meet our debt service requirements is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations.
We believe that expected cash flows from operations, available cash and cash equivalents, and funds available under our ABL Facility will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements, such as working capital requirements for our operations, business development and investment activities, and payments for our debt obligations, for the following 12 months. Any projections of future earnings and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our future success and capital adequacy will depend on, among other things, our ability to achieve anticipated levels of revenues and cash flows from operations and our ability to address our annual cash obligations and reduce our outstanding debt, all of which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control. As a result of COVID-19, many SMBs will continue to experience a reduction in revenues and cash flows and may not have the ability to pay amounts owed to us. We have increased our allowance for credit losses by $2.1 million based on expected future credit losses due to COVID-19. Although to date, the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material impact on our operational performance, financial performance, or liquidity, it is difficult to predict what the ongoing impact of the pandemic will be on the economy, our clients and our business. We continue to monitor our capital requirements to ensure our needs are in line with available capital resources.
In addition, our Board authorizes us to undertake share repurchases from time to time. The amount and timing of any share repurchases that we make will depend on a variety of factors, including available liquidity, cash flows, our capacity to make repurchases under our credit facility and market conditions.
Term Loan Agreement
On March 1, 2021, the Company entered into a new Term Loan Credit Agreement (the “Term Loan Agreement”), the proceeds of which were used, in part, to finance the Sensis Acquisition, pay off the existing term loan and to pay fees and expenses related to the Sensis acquisition and related financing.
The Term Loan Agreement established a senior secured term loan facility (the “Term Loan Facility”) in an aggregate principal amount equal to $700.0 million. The Term Loan Facility matures on March 1, 2026 and borrowings under the Term Loan Facility will bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to, at the Company’s option, LIBOR or base rate, in each case, plus an applicable margin per annum equal to (i) 8.50% (for LIBOR loans) and (ii) 7.50% (for base rate loans). The Term Loan Facility requires mandatory amortization payments equal to $17.5 million per fiscal quarter commencing June 30, 2021.
ABL Credit Agreement
On March 1, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement to amend the ABL Facility (“ABL Amendment”), dated as of June 30, 2017. The ABL Amendment was entered into in order to permit the term loan refinancing, the Sensis Acquisition and make certain other changes to the ABL Credit Agreement, including, among others:
•reduce the interest rate per annum to (i) 3.00% (for LIBOR loans) and (ii) 2.00% (for base rate loans);
•reduce the commitment fee on undrawn amounts under the ABL Facility to 0.375%;
•extend the maturity date of the ABL Facility to March 1, 2026;
•add the Australian subsidiaries acquired pursuant to the Sensis Acquisition as borrowers and guarantors, and establish an Australian borrowing base; and
•make certain other conforming changes consistent with the Term Loan Agreement.
Sources and Uses of Cash
The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated (in thousands):
Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2020 to the Year Ended December 31, 2019
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $37.8 million, or 14.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities of $37.8 million was primarily due to the timing of accounts receivable collections, the timing of billing of unbilled receivables in accordance with the terms of our print agreements, and the timing of payments against accounts payable and taxes payable, in addition to the overall decline of our sales. The change in cash flows from operating activities was also affected by lower income tax payments of $13.3 million and lower interest payments of $8.6 million.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities increased by $0.8 million, or 3.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
The increase in net cash used in investing activities of $0.8 million was primarily due to an increase of $1.7 million in capitalized expenditures, partially offset by an increase of $0.7 million in proceeds from the sales of buildings and other fixed assets.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities decreased by $71.4 million, or 25.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The change in cash flow from financing activities relates to the repurchase of common stock and the timing of proceeds and payments on the Senior Term Loan and ABL Facility.
The decrease in net cash used in financing activities of $71.4 million was primarily driven by a $54.6 million decrease in payments on the Senior Term Loan resulting from a decrease in the Company’s Excess Cash Flow requirements, which dictates the Senior Term Loan payment amounts. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was further driven by the net cash used of $19.3 million as a result of the Tender Offer that was completed on May 1, 2019, in which the Company repurchased $437.9 million of common stock, financed primarily with proceeds from the Senior Term Loan of $418.6 million. Additionally, the decrease in net cash used in financing activities was driven by lower payments, net of proceeds on the ABL facility of $15.8 million. Finally, other financing activities, primarily associated with cash received from the exercise of stock options, resulted in a decrease in net cash used in financing activities of $12.3 million. These decreases were partially offset by cash used of $30.6 million to repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2019 to the Year Ended December 31, 2018
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $76.5 million, or 22.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.
The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities of $76.5 million was primarily due to a decrease in net income combined with the settlement of the stock option liability of $33.9 million. The change in cash flows from operating activities was also affected by lower income tax payments of $5.9 million, the timing of accounts receivable collections and the timing of payments against accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other current liabilities.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $3.3 million, or 11.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.
The decrease in net cash used in investing activities of $3.3 million was due to a decrease of $1.4 million in purchases of fixed assets and capitalized software, a decrease of $1.1 million in net cash outflow related to acquisition activity and a decrease of $0.8 million in proceeds received from the sale of fixed assets.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities decreased by $8.8 million, or 3.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The change in cash flow from financing activities relates to the repurchase of common stock and the timing of proceeds and payments on the Senior Term Loan and ABL Facility.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, our net cash used in financing activities of $277.5 million was primarily driven by the repurchase of common stock in the amount of $438.0 million. Additionally, during 2019, the Company received proceeds of $1,142.7 million and made payments of $1,184.3 million on the ABL Facility.
Cash flows from financing activities also included proceeds of $418.6 million (net of debt issuance costs of $6.4 million) from the Senior Term Loan, offset by payments of $215.0 million on the Senior Term Loan.
Debt
On July 29, 2016, upon emerging from our pre-packaged bankruptcy, we entered into a term facility (the “Original Term Facility”) with certain owners of the Company’s common stock with initial borrowings of $600.0 million and a maturity date of July 29, 2021. On June 30, 2017, an additional $550.0 million was borrowed under the Original Term Facility to finance the YP Acquisition. Of the $550.0 million, 49.4% was held by related parties who are equity holders of the Company, including Mudrick Capital Management, LP; Paulson & Co Inc; and GoldenTree Asset Management, LP, who each held 16.9%, 16.4% and 16.1% of the debt, respectively.
On December 31, 2018, we entered into the Term Loan Agreement pursuant to which the lenders party thereto agreed to provide the Senior Term Loan. The Senior Term Loan was borrowed by Thryv, Inc., the Company’s operating subsidiary and is secured by substantially all of the assets of Thryv, Inc. and is guaranteed by the Company in an initial aggregate principal amount not to exceed $825.0 million. The Senior Term Loan was funded in two installments. The first installment of $400.0
million was funded on December 31, 2018 and the second installment of $425.0 million on January 31, 2019, resulting in debt extinguishment losses of $18.4 million and $6.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019, respectively.
On December 15, 2016, the Company entered into an asset-based line of credit agreement (the “Original ABL Facility”), which was amended on April 21, 2017 and was utilized to finance ongoing general corporate and working capital needs. On June 30, 2017, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the “Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”) which increased the Maximum Revolver Amount (“MRA”) to (i) $350.0 million from June 30, 2017 through December 31, 2017, (ii) $325.0 million from January 1, 2018 through June 30, 2018, (iii) $300.0 million July 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018, (iv) $275.0 million from January 1, 2019 through June 30, 2019, (v) $250.0 million from July 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019, (vi) $225.0 million from January 1, 2020 through June 30, 2020 and (vii) $200.0 million after July 1, 2020.
On January 31, 2019, we entered into a subsequent amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to extend the maturity date of the ABL Facility to December 31, 2023, and to increase the MRA to (i) $225.0 million from January 31, 2019 through December 31, 2019, (ii) $200.0 million from January 1, 2020 through June 30, 2020, (iii) $175.0 million from July 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, (iv) $150.0 million from January 31, 2021 through June 30, 2021, (v) $125.0 million from July 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021 and (vi) $100.0 million after January 1, 2022. The existing unamortized debt issuance costs and the $0.7 million of fees and third-party costs associated with the amendment of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement that were incurred in the year ended December 31, 2019 were deferred and will be amortized over the term of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.
We maintain debt levels that we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors, including cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities), and overall cost of capital. Per the terms of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, payments of the Senior Term Loan balance are determined by the Company's Excess Cash Flow (as defined within the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement). We are in compliance with all covenants under the Senior Term Loan and ABL Facility as of December 31, 2020. We had total recorded debt outstanding of $528.4 million as of December 31, 2020, which was comprised of amounts outstanding under our Senior Term Loan of $449.2 million and ABL Facility of $79.2 million.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material to our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
Contractual Obligations
____________________________________
(1)During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company repaid $160.4 million on the Senior Term Loan.
(2)During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company made payments, net of proceeds, of $25.7 million on the ABL Facility.
(3)Represents the estimated interest payments associated with the amounts outstanding on our Senior Term Loan and ABL Facility as of December 31, 2020, assuming current interest rates and the amount of debt outstanding in the periods indicated in the table above. See Note 11, Debt Obligations in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
(4)Represents the undiscounted future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases.
(5)Represents future minimum lease principal payments under leaseback obligations related to a failed sale-leaseback liability associated with property in Tucker, Georgia. These payments exclude future interest payments of $5.6 million in 2021 and $4.2 million in 2022.
(6)Represents future purchase commitments from third-party service providers. Reasonable estimates of the period of cash outflows related to purchase commitments beyond one year cannot be made.
(7)In connection with the YP Acquisition, the Company recorded a UTP liability relating to certain federal and state tax positions regarding credits, deductions, and other apportionment items associated with income tax returns filed by the seller prior to the Acquisition Date. The seller provided the Company indemnity for future potential losses in excess of $8.0 million. The indemnity is capped at an amount equal to the lesser of the UTP liability or the current fair value of shares of the Company’s stock issued to the seller as part of purchase consideration. The seller may elect to pay such amounts in cash and/or shares. The recorded value of the UTP liability, including interest and penalties, and the related indemnification asset were $32.6 million and $24.3 million, respectively, at December 31, 2020. See Note 16, Contingent Liabilities, in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Additionally, for approximately $1.9 million of our unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the cash outflow due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our audited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In preparing our financial statements, we make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that can have a significant impact on our reported revenues, results of operations and net income or loss, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet during and as of the reporting periods. These estimates, assumptions, and judgments are necessary because future events and their effects on our results and the value of our assets cannot be determined with certainty and are made based on our historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates may change as new events occur or additional information is obtained, and we may periodically be faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which are not within our control and may not be known for a prolonged period of time. Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates.
We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, business combinations, goodwill and intangible assets, capitalized software and development, net pension obligation, income taxes, including net valuation allowance, and stock-based compensation expense have the greatest potential impact on our audited consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. See Note 1, Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report for further information on these and our other significant accounting policies and estimates as well as our disclosures on recent accounting pronouncements. Our most critical accounting policies are summarized below.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue based on the revenue recognition standard, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), (“ASC 606”). The Company determines the amount of revenue to be recognized through application of the five-step model as described in Note 1, Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report.
We derive revenue from our two business segments Marketing Services and SaaS. The Company has determined that each of its services is distinct and represents a separate performance obligation because the SMB can benefit from each service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the SMB, and services are separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. Revenue for all services is recognized when control transfers to the SMB. For print solutions, control transfers upon delivery of the published directories. Control over SaaS and digital services within Marketing Services transfers to the SMB evenly over the service period.
The transaction price of a contract consists of fixed and variable consideration components pursuant to the applicable contractual terms and may involve the use of estimates. These judgments involve consideration of historical and expected experience with the customer and other similar customers. The Company’s contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, the Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling price is the price at which the Company would sell a promised service separately to a client. Judgment is required to determine the standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation. Often, the Company does not have sufficient standalone sales information, as contracts with customers generally
include multiple performance obligations. When standalone sales information is not available, the Company estimates the standalone selling price using information that may include market conditions, entity-specific factors such as pricing and discounting strategies, and other inputs.
The Company has determined that sales commissions are incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract. However, commissions related to renewal contracts are not commensurate with costs incurred to obtain an initial contract. Therefore, commissions incurred to obtain a new contract are capitalized and recognized over the benefit period, which is determined to be two years based on expected contract renewals, the Company’s technology development life-cycle, and other factors. Renewal commissions are expensed as incurred under practical expedient available under ASC 606.
Direct costs associated with fulfilling a print directory contract with a SMB include costs related to printing and distribution. Directly attributable costs incurred to fulfill print solutions are capitalized as incurred and then expensed at the time of delivery, in line with the recognition of revenue. Costs to fulfill SaaS and digital contracts with SMBs are expensed as incurred.
Business Combinations, Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Business Combinations
We have completed several acquisitions of other businesses in the past, the most significant being the YP Acquisition on June 30, 2017, and we may acquire additional businesses in the future. In an acquisition, we first review if substantially all the fair value of the assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. If such concentration exists, the transaction is considered an asset acquisition rather than a business combination.
The results of businesses acquired in a business combination are included in our audited consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. We allocate the purchase price, which is the sum of the consideration paid and may consist of cash, equity, or a combination of the two, to the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business at their acquisition date fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and assumed liabilities requires management to use significant judgment and estimates, including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenue and cash flows, and discount rates.
We use all available information to estimate fair values. We typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in determining the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets such as client relationships, trademarks, and any other significant assets or liabilities. During the measurement period, of up to one year after the acquisition date, we may adjust the values attributed to the assets acquired and assumed liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date.
Our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires assumptions and management’s judgment to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and assumed liabilities at the acquisition date. Key judgments used to estimate the fair value of intangible assets include projected revenue growth and operating margins, discount rates, client attrition rates, as well as the estimated economic life of intangible assets. Management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets, and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows. Our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment as of October 1st and at any time upon the occurrence of certain triggering events or changes in circumstances. The Company performs its goodwill impairment test at the reporting unit level. In assessing goodwill for impairment, an entity has the option to assess qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Performing a qualitative impairment assessment requires an examination of relevant events and circumstances that could have a negative impact on the carrying value of our Company, such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, earnings and cash flows, overall financial performance, and other relevant entity-specific events. The estimates of the fair value of the Company’s reporting units are primarily determined using an income approach based on discounted cash flows. The discounted cash flow methodology requires significant judgment, including estimation of future
cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, current and anticipated economic conditions and trends, the estimation of the long-term growth rate of the Company’s business, and the determination of the Company’s weighted average cost of capital. Changes in the estimates and assumptions incorporated in our impairment assessment could materially affect the determination of fair value and the associated impairment charge.
As of December 31, 2020, goodwill was $609.5 million, of which $283.5 million was generated from the YP Acquisition on June 30, 2017. For additional information related to goodwill, see Note 5, Goodwill and Intangible Assets to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report.
No impairment charge was recorded in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Intangible Assets
All of the Company’s intangible assets are classified as definite-lived intangible assets. The Company’s intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives using the income forecast method and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. The recoverability analysis includes estimates of future cash flows directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of the definite-lived intangible asset. The Company’s estimates of future cash flows attributable to long-lived assets require significant judgment based on its historical and anticipated results and are subject to assumptions.
An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the definite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value.
For additional information related to goodwill and intangible assets, see Note 5, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report. for more information.
Capitalized Software and Development
Costs associated with internal use software are capitalized during the application development stage, if they have a useful life in excess of one year. Subsequent additions, modifications, or upgrades to internal use software are capitalized only to the extent they allow the software to perform a task it previously did not perform. Capitalized software is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. A key estimate included within the capitalized software balance includes the determination of the useful life.
Net Pension Obligation
The Company maintains pension obligations associated with non-contributory defined benefit pension plans that are currently frozen and incur no additional service costs.
Although the plans are frozen, the Company continues to incur interest cost as well as gains or losses associated with changes in fair value of plan assets, all of which are referred to as net periodic pension cost. In determining the net pension obligations at each reporting period, management makes certain actuarial assumptions, including discount rates and mortality rates. For these assumptions, management consults with actuaries, monitors plan provisions and demographics, and reviews public market data and general economic information. Changes in these assumptions can have a significant impact on the projected pension obligations, funding requirement, and net periodic pension cost. The Company immediately recognizes actuarial gains and losses in its operating results in the year in which the gains and losses occur.
Income Taxes
Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weight of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character, for example, ordinary income or capital gain within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. We regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed.
The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal and state tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions. We establish reserves for open tax years for UTPs that may be subject to challenge by various tax authorities. The consolidated tax provision and related accruals include the impact of such reasonably estimable losses and related interest and penalties as deemed appropriate. Tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from UTPs are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company established a stock-based compensation plan which allows for incentive awards to be granted to designated eligible employees, non-management directors, consultants, and independent contractors providing services to the Company. The Stock Incentive Plan permitted grants of cash-settled stock options. Prior to October 1, 2020, these awards were classified as liabilities due to our intent to net cash settle upon exercise. Accordingly, the fair value of these awards is initially measured at the grant date and is remeasured each subsequent reporting date, until the award is settled or forfeited, with remeasurement (gains)/losses recognized in Cost of services, Sales and Marketing and General and administrative expenses, in accordance with the awards’ vesting schedule. As a result of completing the direct listing on October 1, 2020, the Company no longer intends to cash settle these stock options upon exercise. Based on the Company’s intention to equity settle upon exercise, these stock options are classified as equity awards as of December 31, 2020. Accordingly, the fair value is measured at the date of the grant and recognized over the requisite service period (generally three to four years).
Determining the fair value of stock-based compensation awards requires the use of judgment. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of our stock options. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires inputs based on certain subjective assumptions, including the fair value of common stock and its volatility, the expected life of the option, and the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected life of the option. The Company historically has been a private company and lacks company-specific historical and implied volatility information for its common stock. Therefore, it estimates its expected volatility based on the debt leveraged historical volatility of publicly traded peer companies and expects to continue to do so until such time as it has adequate historical data regarding the volatility of its own traded share price. Following the closing of our direct listing, the fair value per share of our common stock for purposes of determining stock-based compensation is the last available closing price of our common stock as reported on or before the applicable grant date.
The assumptions used to determine the fair value of the stock-based awards are management’s best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. If any of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model change significantly, stock-based compensation expense for future awards may differ compared with the awards granted previously.
Common Stock Fair Value
The common stock fair value is one of the significant valuation inputs of the indemnification asset and stock-based compensation awards.
As of and Subsequent to September 30, 2020
Due to the Company's direct listing on October 1, 2020. As of September 30, 2020, the fair value of the Company’s common stock is based on the THRY Nasdaq per share price.
Prior to September 30, 2020
The absence of an active market for the Company's common stock required the Company to determine the fair value of its common stock. The Company obtained contemporaneous third-party valuations to assist it in determining fair value. These contemporaneous third-party valuations used methodologies, approaches and assumptions consistent with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation.
The Company determined the fair value utilizing the income approach, which estimated value based on market participant expectations of future cash flows the Company will generate. These future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate based on the Company's weighted average cost of capital, which reflects the risk of achieving the projected cash flows. Significant inputs of the income approach also include the long-term financial projections of the Company
along with its long-term growth rate, which is used to calculate the residual value of the Company before discounting to present value. The fair value of the common stock was discounted based on the lack of marketability.
Other factors taken into consideration in assessing the fair value of the Company’s common stock prior to September 30, 2020 included but were not limited to: industry information such as market growth and volume and macro-economic events; and additional objective and subjective factors relating to its business.
