Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ TOGETHER WITH THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.
Impact of COVID-19 Outbreak
The ongoing COVID-19 global and national health emergency has caused significant disruption in the international and United States economies and financial markets. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. The spread of COVID-19 has caused illness, quarantines, cancellation of events and travel, business and school shutdowns, reduction in business activity and financial transactions, labor shortages, supply chain interruptions and overall economic and financial market instability. The COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to significantly impact the Company's supply chain and other service providers.
In addition, a severe prolonged economic downturn could result in a variety of risks to the business, including weakened demand for products and services and a decreased ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. As the situation continues to evolve, the Company will continue to closely monitor market conditions and respond accordingly. To date, the Company has not experienced a significant adverse economic impact due to COVID-19. While travel and other restrictions have been imposed, the company has mitigated the situation by teleconferencing, web demos, etc. However, there is no assurance that we will not have any adverse impact in the future.
The following discussion reflects the Company's plan of operation. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements which are attached to this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expected financial position, business and financing plans. These statements involve risks and uncertainties. The actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly under the headings "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements."

Results of Operations
Year Ended September 30, 2021 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2020.
Revenue
Revenues from operations were $1,651,297 for the year ended September 30, 2021 as compared to $1,752,024 for the year ended September 30, 2020. Subscriptions of ReadyOp software increased 19.3% from $1,325,623 to $1,581,413 in the year ended September 30, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Sales of ReadyOp ACE IP gateways decreased 90.65% from $333,750 to $31,200 in the year ended September 30, 2020 and 2021, respectively. This decrease was primarily due to one client purchasing $212,000 of ReadyOp ACE IP gateways in 2020. Consulting fees and related income decreased from $49,350 in 2020 to $18,815 in 2021 due to less training activity due to COVID in the year ended September 30, 2021.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenues was $267,298 for the year ended September 30, 2021, as compared to $407,136 for the year ended September 30, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to higher costs associated with the large ReadyOp ACE IP gateway sale in 2020. Gross profits were $1,383,999 and $1,344,888 for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Gross profit margin increased to 84% from 77% for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase was primarily due to higher margins generated from subscriptions of ReadyOp software and lower profit margins from sales of ReadyOp ACE IP gateways.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses increased 4.73% to approximately $1,158,318 for the year ended September 30, 2021 compared to $1,105,956 for the year ended September 30, 2020. For the year ended September 30, 2021, selling expenses were $571,242 compared to $530,853 for the year ended September 30, 2020. This increase is primarily due to an increase in travel expenses and slightly offset by the decrease in advertising expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by $6,265 or 1.52%. Amortization and depreciation expense decreased by 81.45% from $11,480 for the year ended September 30, 2020 to $2,129 for the year ended September 30, 2021. Research and development expenses were $152,602 for the year ended September 30, 2020 as compared to $167,661 for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase was primarily due to increase in consulting expense and expenses associated with the development of a new technology associated with a patent owned by the University of South Florida Research Foundation. The Company has obtained the exclusive license to develop and market the technology associated with the patent.
Other Income/(Expenses)
The Company's other income increased to $135,417 from other expense of ($8,727) during the year ended September 30, 2021, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2020. The primary reason for this increase was the settlement of certain accounts payable, gain on forgiveness of PPP loan and slightly offset by the decreased interest expense.
Income from Continuing Operations
The Company's income from continuing operations increased to $361,098 from $230,205 during the year ended September 30, 2021 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher margins generated from subscriptions of ReadyOp software.
Loss from Discontinued Operations
There was no loss from discontinued operations during the year ended September 30, 2021 compared to a loss of $64,936 for the year ended September 30, 2020. The reason for the decrease was the deconsolidation of VoiceInterop from the Company in February 2020.
Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders
Net income attributable to common stockholders was $320,171 and $124,119 for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase was primarily due to gain on forgiveness of PPP loan and higher profit margins generated from subscription of ReadyOp software in 2021.

Critical Accounting Estimates
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable in the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements.
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE
The Company provides an allowance for uncollectible accounts based upon a periodic review and analysis of outstanding accounts receivable balances. Uncollectible receivables are charged to the allowance when deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts previously written off are used to credit the allowance account in the periods in which the recoveries are made. When a client is invoiced, the amount is recorded as an asset in Accounts Receivable and as Deferred Revenue in Current Liabilities. When payment is received the amount is moved to Cash on the balance sheet. The amount listed as Deferred Revenue is amortized monthly over the license period.
INVENTORY
Inventory consists of components held for assembly and finished goods held for resale or to be utilized for installation in projects. Inventory is valued at lower of cost or net realizable value on a first-in, first-out basis. The Company's policy is to record a reserve for technological obsolescence or slow-moving inventory items. The Company only carries finished goods to be shipped along with completed circuit boards and parts necessary for final assembly of finished product. All existing inventory is considered current and usable.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The recent accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) or other standard setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statement upon adoption.
The recent accounting pronouncements are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statement appearing elsewhere in this report.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
