Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain terms and acronyms used throughout this report are defined in the Glossary of Abbreviations and Acronyms included as part of this report. Some of the information in this discussion and analysis or included elsewhere in this report, including information with respect to our projections, plans and strategy for our business, are forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed under “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements-Safe Harbor Provisions” and in the Risk Factors detailed in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Index to Item 7
Overview
We are a diversified mortgage and real estate services business with two business segments-Mortgage and Real Estate. Our Mortgage segment provides credit-related insurance coverage, principally through private mortgage insurance on residential first-lien mortgage loans, as well as other credit risk management and contract underwriting solutions, to mortgage lending institutions and mortgage credit investors. Our Real Estate segment is primarily a fee-for-service business that offers a broad array of products and services to market participants across the mortgage and real estate value chain.
Operating Environment
As a seller of mortgage credit protection and other mortgage and credit risk management solutions, our Mortgage business results are subject to macroeconomic conditions and other events that impact the housing, real estate and housing finance markets, and the credit performance of our underlying insured assets as well as our future business opportunities. These include the current global pandemic as well as seasonal fluctuations that specifically affect the mortgage origination environment. The macroeconomic conditions, seasonality and other events that impact the housing, mortgage finance and related real estate markets also affect the demand for our products and services offered through our Real Estate segment.
Following the financial crisis of 2007-2008 and until the first quarter of 2020, our mortgage insurance business benefited from continued improvement in market conditions evidenced by, among other things, the strength of the U.S. economy and housing finance industry. Our NIW since 2008 has consisted primarily of high credit quality loans that have had significantly better credit performance than the loans originated during 2008 and prior periods. Significant contributors to the improved loan quality of our post-2008 insured portfolio include the greater risk discipline of loan originators and private mortgage insurance providers, the QM loan requirements under the Dodd Frank Act and the loan-level criteria of the PMIERs financial requirements.
Beginning in March 2020, the unprecedented and continually evolving social and economic impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic on the U.S. and global economies generally, and in particular on the U.S. housing, real estate and housing finance markets, had a negative effect on our business and our financial results for the second quarter of 2020, and to a lesser extent the second half of 2020, and could continue to adversely impact our business and results of operations in future periods. Despite the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we wrote record levels of NIW in 2020 and believe that the long-term housing

______________________________________________________________________________________________________
market fundamentals and outlook remain positive, including low interest rates, demographics supporting growth in the population of first-time homebuyers and a relatively constrained supply of homes available for sale. However, the economic impact of the pandemic as well as public and private sector initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, such as social distancing and the imposition of restrictions on business activities, have affected and we expect will continue in the near term to affect, among other things: (i) the number of defaults that, over time, will result in claims that we must pay; (ii) the number of mortgages we have insured that will default; and (iii) the number of real estate transactions available for our services. See “-COVID-19 Impacts” below for further discussion of the impacts on our business associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including the effects of low interest rates on our mortgage insurance and investment portfolios. Further, beginning in March 2020, the market volatility stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic caused a temporary disruption in the market for reinsurance, including new mortgage insurance-linked notes transactions. While Radian Guaranty and other private mortgage insurers completed new insurance-linked notes transactions during the second half of 2020, those transactions were on less favorable terms than similar reinsurance transactions executed prior to the pandemic.
Our Real Estate business, comprising real estate and title services, is largely a transactional business that depends on the level of customer activity and may be sensitive to changes in macro-level home sales, mortgage volumes, interest rates, mortgage default rates and GSE guidelines. In addition, demand for our title services may be impacted by general marketplace competition in the real estate title industry, coupled with housing market conditions such as new home sales, the sizes of the real estate purchase and refinance markets and interest rate fluctuations. See “Item 1. Business-Real Estate-Real Estate Business Overview” and Notes 1 and 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Real Estate segment.
In order to be eligible to insure loans purchased by the GSEs, mortgage insurers such as Radian Guaranty must meet the GSEs’ eligibility requirements, or PMIERs. The GSEs have significant discretion under the PMIERs and may amend the PMIERs at any time. For further discussion of the PMIERs eligibility and other requirements, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our PMIERs Minimum Required Assets and the COVID-19 Amendment to the PMIERs, see “Item 1. Business-Regulation-GSE Requirements,” “Liquidity and Capital Resources-Mortgage” and Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
COVID-19 Impacts
The COVID-19 pandemic has created periods of significant economic disruption, high unemployment, volatility and disruption in financial markets, and required adjustments in the housing finance system and real estate markets. In addition, the pandemic has resulted in travel restrictions, temporary business shutdowns, and stay-at-home, quarantine, and similar orders, and even as some businesses have been reopened, numerous operating limitations such as social distancing and extensive health and safety measures have limited operations, all of which contributed to the rapid and significant rise in unemployment. Although unemployment declined in the second half of 2020, it remains elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels, and may remain elevated or may rise if the current economic disruption is prolonged.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the economy, including the significant increase in unemployment, we have experienced a material increase in new defaults, substantially all related to defaults of loans subject to forbearance programs implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in the number of new mortgage defaults resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative effect on our results of operations for the second quarter of 2020, and to a lesser extent the second half of 2020. This negative impact could continue in future quarters, primarily due to the need to increase our reserve for losses related to the volume of new defaults. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the reserving methodology for the mortgage insurance industry.
As a result of this material increase in new defaults, our primary default rate increased from 2.0% at December 31, 2019 to 5.2% at December 31, 2020, which is down from a peak of 6.5% at June 30, 2020. Favorable trends in the number of new defaults and Cures were the primary drivers of the decline in our default inventory and default rate in the second half of 2020, compared to June 30, 2020. As a result of these favorable trends in new defaults and Cures and assuming continued economic recovery, we currently expect our primary default rate to remain below 6%. However, the number, timing and duration of new defaults and, in turn, the number of defaults that ultimately result in claims will depend on a variety of factors, including the scope, severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the resulting impact on the economy, including with respect to unemployment and housing prices, and the effectiveness of forbearance and other government efforts such as financial stimulus programs, to provide economic and individual relief to assist homeowners. Consequently, the number and rate of total defaults is difficult to predict and will depend on the foregoing and other factors, including the number and timing of Cures and claims paid and the net impact on IIF from our Persistency Rate and future NIW. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for additional discussion of these factors and other risks and uncertainties.
The increase in new defaults resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic may also affect our ability to remain compliant with the PMIERs financial requirements. Our Master Policies generally provide that a default occurs when a borrower misses one monthly payment, regardless of why the payment was missed, including if the payment was deferred under a forbearance program. Once two missed payments have occurred, the PMIERs characterize a loan as “non-performing” and require us to establish an increased Minimum Required Asset factor for that loan regardless of the reason for the missed payments. Pursuant to the COVID-19 Amendment that temporarily amends the PMIERs, a Disaster Related Capital Charge that effectively reduces the
Glossary
Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
Minimum Required Asset factor by 70% is now applied nationwide to all COVID-19 Defaulted Loans for no longer than three calendar months beginning with the month the loan becomes non-performing (i.e., missed two monthly payments), or if greater, the period of time that the loan is subject to a forbearance plan, repayment plan or loan modification trial period granted in response to a financial hardship related to COVID-19. The current broad-based application of the Disaster Related Capital Charge has significantly reduced the total amount of assets that Radian Guaranty otherwise would be required to hold against COVID-19 Defaulted Loans under the PMIERs. Nonetheless, since March 31, 2020, the overall volume of new defaults resulting from the pandemic, even after giving effect to the Disaster Related Capital Charge, resulted in an increase in Radian Guaranty’s Minimum Required Assets and negatively impacted Radian Guaranty’s PMIERs Cushion as of December 31, 2020. While we expect Radian Guaranty to continue to maintain its eligibility status with the GSEs, there are possible scenarios in which the projected increase in new defaults could impact Radian Guaranty’s ability to comply with the PMIERs financial requirements. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Radian Guaranty may fail to maintain its eligibility status with the GSEs, and the additional capital required to support Radian Guaranty’s eligibility could reduce our available liquidity.”
Further, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the government stimulus efforts in response to the pandemic, has resulted in a historically low interest rate environment. As discussed above, this low interest rate environment contributed to strong NIW volume in 2020, including from continued elevated levels of refinance activity. However, mortgage prepayment speeds also impact the ultimate profitability of our mortgage insurance business. The increase in policy cancellations associated with the high level of refinance activity during 2020 has reduced our Persistency Rate, and in turn, limited the growth of our IIF, which is one of the primary drivers of future premiums that we expect to earn over time. If refinance activity remains elevated, resulting in earlier than anticipated loan prepayments, it could result in a decrease in our future revenues, particularly from our Recurring Premium Policies. The low interest rate environment also affected the performance of our investment portfolio, resulting in an increase in our unrealized gains on investments beginning with the second quarter of 2020, and we expect it will result in the recognition of lower net investment income in future periods if the current low interest rate environment persists and we must reinvest cash flows in lower yielding securities. In addition, the negative impacts to the global economy could result in increased defaults on corporate bonds and other financial instruments, which could increase the frequency and severity of impairments in our investment portfolio. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our investments.
As further described in this report, although we are uncertain of the potential magnitude or duration of the business and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe the resulting increased financial requirements under the PMIERs, reduced Persistency Rates due to a low interest rate environment and increased reserves for losses due to higher new defaults could continue to negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our businesses will depend on, among other things: the extent and duration of the pandemic, the severity of and number of people infected with the virus and the widespread availability of effective anti-viral treatments and vaccines, especially as new strains of COVID-19 have been discovered; the wider economic effects of the pandemic and the scope and duration of governmental and other third-party measures restricting day-to-day life and business operations; the impact of economic stimulus efforts to support the economy through the pandemic; and governmental and GSE programs implemented to assist borrowers experiencing a COVID-19-related hardship, including forbearance programs and suspensions of foreclosures and evictions. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors-The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted us, and its ultimate impact on our business and financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic.”
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we raised additional capital, temporarily suspended purchases under our share repurchase program, aligned our business with the temporary origination and servicing guidelines announced by the GSEs, and made adjustments to our pricing and our underwriting guidelines to account for the increased risk and uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we have taken a number of actions to focus on protecting and supporting our workforce, while continuing to serve our customers with excellence and support our communities. We have activated our business continuity program by transitioning to a work-from-home virtual workforce model with certain essential activities supported by limited staff in office environments that comply with CDC guidelines and applicable state and local requirements. In order to support our communities during this unprecedented time, we have, among other things, pledged financial support to certain charitable organizations focused on assisting first responders, health care workers and their families. Further actions to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and comply with governmental regulations and government and GSE programs adopted in response to the pandemic may be necessary as conditions continue to evolve.
Despite the risks and uncertainties posed by COVID-19, we believe that the steps we have taken in recent years, such as improving our debt maturity profile, enhancing our financial flexibility, implementing greater risk-based granularity into our pricing methodologies and increasing our use of risk distribution strategies to lower the risk profile and financial volatility of our mortgage insurance portfolio, has helped position the Company to better withstand the negative effects from macroeconomic stresses associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, which may continue in future periods.

Key Factors Affecting Our Results
Mortgage
Our Mortgage segment provides credit-related insurance coverage, principally through private mortgage insurance issued nationwide, as well as other credit risk management and contract underwriting solutions, to mortgage lending institutions and mortgage credit investors. The following sections discuss certain key drivers affecting our Mortgage revenue, as well as other key factors affecting our results.
IIF and Related Drivers
Our IIF is one of the primary drivers of our future premiums that we expect to earn over time. Although not reflected in the current period financial statements, nor in our reported book value, we expect our IIF to generate substantial earnings in future periods, due to the high credit quality of our current mortgage insurance portfolio and expected Persistency Rate over multiple years.
Based on the composition of our mortgage insurance portfolio, with Monthly Premium Policies comprising a larger proportion of our total portfolio than Single Premium Policies, an increase or decrease in IIF generally has a corresponding impact on premiums earned. Cancellations of our insurance policies as a result of prepayments and other reductions of IIF, such as Rescissions of coverage and claims paid, generally have a negative effect on premiums earned over time. See “Mortgage Insurance Portfolio-Insurance and Risk in Force” for more information about the levels and characteristics of our IIF.
The ultimate profitability of our mortgage insurance business is affected by the impact of mortgage prepayment speeds on the mix of business we write. The measure for assessing the impact of policy cancellations on our IIF is our Persistency Rate, defined as the percentage of IIF that remains in force over a period of time. Assuming all other factors remain constant, over the life of the policies, prepayment speeds have an inverse impact on IIF and the expected revenue from our Monthly Premium Policies. Slower loan prepayment speeds, demonstrated by a higher Persistency Rate, result in more IIF remaining in place, providing increased revenue from Monthly Premium Policies over time as premium payments continue. Earlier than anticipated loan prepayments, demonstrated by a lower Persistency Rate, reduce IIF and the revenue from our Monthly Premium Policies. Among other factors, prepayment speeds may be affected by changes in interest rates and other macroeconomic factors. A rising interest rate environment generally will reduce refinancing activity and result in lower prepayments, whereas a declining interest rate environment generally will increase the level of refinancing activity and therefore increase prepayments.
In contrast to Monthly Premium Policies, when Single Premium Policies are cancelled by the insured because the loan has been paid off or otherwise, we accelerate the recognition of any remaining unearned premiums, net of any refunds that may be owed to the borrower. Although these cancellations reduce IIF, assuming all other factors remain constant, the profitability of our Single Premium business increases when Persistency Rates are lower. As a result, we believe that writing a mix of Single Premium Policies and Monthly Premium Policies has the potential to moderate the overall impact on our results if actual prepayment speeds are significantly different from expectations. However, the impact of this moderating effect may be affected by the amount of reinsurance we obtain on portions of our portfolio, with the Single Premium QSR Program currently reducing the proportion of retained Single Premium Policies in our portfolio.
NIW and Related Drivers
NIW increases our IIF and our premiums written and earned. NIW is affected by the overall size of the mortgage origination market, the penetration percentage of private mortgage insurance into the overall mortgage origination market and our market share of the private mortgage insurance market. The overall mortgage origination market is influenced by macroeconomic factors such as household formation, household composition, home affordability, interest rates, housing markets in general, credit availability and the impact of various legislative and regulatory actions that may influence the housing and mortgage finance industries. The penetration percentage of private mortgage insurance is mainly influenced by: (i) the competitiveness of private mortgage insurance for GSE conforming loans compared to FHA and VA insured loans and (ii) the relative percentage of mortgage originations that are for purchased homes versus refinances. We believe, for example, that better execution for borrowers with higher FICO scores, lender preference and the inability to cancel FHA insurance for certain loans are factors that continue to provide a competitive advantage for private mortgage insurers. See “Mortgage Insurance Portfolio-New Insurance Written.”
Private mortgage insurance penetration in the insurable market has generally been significantly higher on new mortgages for purchased homes than on the refinance of existing mortgages, because average LTVs are typically higher on home purchases and therefore these lower down payment loans are more likely to require mortgage insurance. Radian Guaranty’s share of the private mortgage insurance market is influenced by competition in that market. See “Item 1. Business-Competition.”

(2)Excluding originations under HARP.
Premiums
The premium rates we charge for our insurance are based on a number of borrower, loan and property characteristics. The mortgage insurance industry is highly competitive and private mortgage insurers compete with each other and with the FHA and VA with respect to price and other factors. We expect price competition to continue throughout the mortgage insurance industry and future price changes from private mortgage insurers or the FHA could impact our future premium rates or our ability to compete.
Glossary
Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
Our pricing is risk-based and is intended to generally align with the capital requirements under the PMIERs, while considering pricing trends within the private mortgage insurance industry. As a result, our pricing is expected to generate relatively consistent returns across the credit spectrum and to provide relatively stable expected loss ratios regardless of further credit expansion or contraction. In developing our strategies, we monitor various competitive and economic factors while seeking to enhance the long-term value of our portfolio by balancing credit risk, profitability and volume considerations, and aim to achieve an overall risk-adjusted rate of return on capital given our modeled performance expectations. We continued to generate strong NIW in 2020, while at the same time maintaining projected returns on NIW within our targeted ranges.
Our pricing actions gradually affect our results over time, as existing IIF cancels and is replaced with NIW at current pricing. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources-Mortgage” and “Mortgage Insurance Portfolio-New Insurance Written” for additional information.
As described above, premiums on our mortgage insurance products are generally paid either on an installment basis, pursuant to Monthly Premium Policies, or in a single payment at the time of loan origination, pursuant to Single Premium Policies. See “Item 1. Business-Mortgage-Pricing-Primary Mortgage Insurance Premiums.” Our expected premium yield on our Single Premium Policies is lower than on our Monthly Premium Policies because our premium rates for the life of the policy are generally lower for our Single Premium Policies. However, as discussed above, the ultimate profitability of Single Premium Policies may be higher or lower than expected due to the impact of prepayment speeds. See “-IIF and Related Drivers” above.
Our actual portfolio returns will depend on a number of factors, including economic conditions, the mix of NIW that we are able to write, our pricing, the amount of reinsurance we use and the level of capital required under the PMIERs financial requirements.
Approximately 74.6% of the loans in our total Primary Mortgage Insurance portfolio at December 31, 2020 are Monthly Premium Policies that provide a level monthly premium for the first 10 years of the policy, followed by a reduced level monthly premium thereafter. For loans that have been refinanced under HARP, the initial 10-year period is reset. Due to the borrower’s ability to cancel the policy generally when the LTV reaches 80% of the original value, and the automatic cancellation of the policy on the date the LTV is scheduled to reach 78% of the original value, the volume of loans that remain insured after 10 years and would be subject to the premium reset is generally not material in relation to the total loans originated. However, to the extent the volume of loans resetting from year to year varies significantly, the trend in earned premiums may also vary.
Losses
Incurred losses represent the estimated future claim payments on newly defaulted insured loans as well as any change in our claim estimates for existing defaults, including changes in the estimates we use to determine our expected losses, and estimates with respect to the frequency, magnitude and timing of anticipated losses on defaulted loans. Other factors influencing incurred losses include:
■The mix of credit characteristics in our total direct RIF (e.g., loans with higher risk characteristics, or loans with layered risk that combine multiple higher-risk attributes within the same loan, generally result in more delinquencies and claims). See “Mortgage Insurance Portfolio-Insurance and Risk in Force.”
■The average loan size (relatively higher priced properties with larger average loan amounts may result in higher incurred losses).
■The percentage of coverage on insured loans (higher percentages of insurance coverage generally correlate with higher incurred losses) and the presence of structural mitigants such as deductibles or stop losses.
■Changes in housing values (declines in housing values generally make it more difficult for borrowers to sell a home to avoid default or for the property to be sold to mitigate a claim, and also may negatively affect a borrower’s willingness to continue to make mortgage payments when the home value is less than the mortgage balance; conversely, increases in housing values tend to reduce the level of defaults as well as make it more likely that foreclosures will result in the loan being satisfied).
■The distribution of claims over the life cycle of a portfolio (historically, claims are relatively low during the first two years after a loan is originated and then increase over a period of several years before declining; however, several factors can impact and change this cycle, including the economic environment, the quality of the underwriting of the loan, characteristics of the mortgage loan, the credit profile of the borrower, housing prices and unemployment rates).
■Our ability to mitigate potential losses through Rescissions, Claim Denials, cancellations and Claim Curtailments on claims submitted to us. These actions all reduce our incurred losses. However, if these Loss Mitigation Activities are successfully challenged at rates that are higher than expected or we agree to settle disputes related to our Loss Mitigation Activities, our incurred losses will increase. We may enter into specific agreements that govern activities such as claims decisions, claim payments, Loss Mitigation Activities and insurance coverage. As our portfolio originated prior to and including 2008 has become a smaller percentage of our overall insured portfolio, there has been a decrease in the amount of Loss Mitigation Activity with respect to the claims we receive, and we expect this trend to continue, particularly given the limitations on our Loss Mitigation Activities imposed in both the 2014 Master Policy and 2020 Master Policy. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on Loss Mitigation Activities and “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Our
Glossary
Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
Loss Mitigation Activity is not expected to mitigate mortgage insurance losses to the same extent as in prior years; Loss Mitigation Activity could continue to negatively impact our customer relationships.”
Risk Distribution
We use third-party reinsurance in our mortgage insurance business to manage capital and risk in an effort to optimize the amounts and types of capital and risk distribution deployed against insured risk. See “-IIF and Related Drivers” above. Currently, we distribute risk in our mortgage insurance portfolio through quota share and excess-of-loss reinsurance programs.
When we enter into a quota share reinsurance agreement, the reinsurer receives a premium and, in exchange, agrees to insure an agreed upon portion of incurred losses. These arrangements reduce our earned premiums but also reduce our net RIF, which provides capital relief, including under the PMIERs financial requirements. Our incurred losses are reduced by any incurred losses ceded in accordance with the reinsurance agreement, and we often receive ceding commissions from the reinsurer as part of the transaction, which, in turn, reduce our reported operating expenses and policy acquisition costs.
Our Excess-of-Loss Program accesses the capital markets (through the Eagle Re Issuers, VIEs funded by mortgage insurance-linked notes), as well as the reinsurance markets directly (through separate excess-of-loss reinsurance with a third-party reinsurer). Our Excess-of-Loss Program reduces our earned premiums, but also reduces our net RIF, PMIERs financial requirements and incurred losses, which are allocated in accordance with the structure of the transaction. The Eagle Re Issuers are special purpose VIEs that are not consolidated in our consolidated financial statements because we do not have the unilateral power to direct those activities that are significant to their economic performance.
As of December 31, 2020, 66% of our primary RIF is subject to a form of risk distribution and our estimated reinsurance recoverables related to our mortgage insurance portfolio was $71.8 million. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our reinsurance arrangements, including the total assets and liabilities of the Eagle Re Issuers.
Investment Income
Investment income is determined primarily by the investment balances held and the average yield on our overall investment portfolio.
Other Operating Expenses
Our other operating expenses are affected by the amount of our NIW, as well as the amount of IIF. Our other operating expenses may also be affected by the impact of performance on our incentive compensation programs, as a result of our pay-for-performance approach to compensation that is based on the level of achievement of both short-term and long-term goals.
Real Estate
Our Real Estate segment offers a broad array of products and services to market participants across the real estate value chain. See “Item 1. Business-Real Estate-Real Estate Business Overview” and Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Real Estate segment.
In contrast to our Mortgage business, the Real Estate segment is primarily a fee-for-service business without significant balance sheet risk. Key factors impacting results for our Real Estate business include the following items.
Premiums
We earn net premiums on title insurance through Radian Title Insurance. Demand for our title services may be impacted by general marketplace competition in the real estate title industry, coupled with housing market related conditions such as new home sales, the sizes of the real estate purchase and refinance markets and interest rate fluctuations.
Services Revenue
Our Real Estate segment is dependent upon overall activity in the mortgage, real estate and mortgage finance markets, as well as the overall health of the related industries. Due, in part, to the transactional nature of the business, revenues for our Real Estate segment are subject to fluctuations from period to period, including seasonal fluctuations that reflect the activities in these markets. Sales volume is also affected by the number of competing companies and alternative products offered in the market. We believe the diversity of services we offer has the potential to produce fee income from the Real Estate segment throughout various mortgage finance environments, although market conditions can significantly impact the mix and amount of fee income we generate in any particular period. See “Item 1. Business-Real Estate-Real Estate Business Overview” for more information on our Real Estate services.
The Real Estate segment is dependent on a limited number of large customers that represent a significant portion of its revenues. An unexpected loss of a major customer could significantly impact the level of Real Estate revenue. Generally, our
Glossary
Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
contracts do not contain volume commitments and may be terminated by clients at any time. Access to Radian Guaranty’s mortgage insurance customer base provides additional opportunities to expand the Real Estate segment’s existing customers.
Our Real Estate revenue is primarily generated under fixed-price contracts. Under fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the specified services and deliverables for a pre-determined per-unit price. To the extent our actual direct and allocated indirect costs decrease or increase from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit, respectively, or could incur a loss. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on revenue recognition policies for our Real Estate segment.
Cost of Services
Our cost of services is primarily affected by our level of services revenue and the number of employees providing products and services for our Real Estate businesses. Our cost of services primarily consists of employee compensation and related payroll benefits and to a lesser extent, other costs of providing services such as travel and related expenses incurred in providing client services, costs paid to outside vendors, data acquisition costs and other compensation-related expenses to maintain software application platforms that directly support our businesses. The level of these costs may fluctuate if market rates of compensation change, or if there is decreased availability or a loss of qualified employees.
Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses primarily consist of salaries and benefits not classified as cost of services because they are related to employees, such as sales and corporate employees, who are not directly involved in providing client services. Operating expenses also include other selling, general and administrative expenses, depreciation, and allocations of corporate general and administrative expenses.
Other Factors Affecting Consolidated Results
For information about our All Other activities that affect our consolidated results, see “Item 1. Business-All Other.” In addition, the following items also may impact our consolidated results in the ordinary course. The items listed are not representative of all potential items impacting our consolidated results. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for additional information on the risks affecting our business.
Net Gains (Losses) on Investments and Other Financial Instruments. The recognition of realized investment gains or losses can vary significantly across periods as the activity is highly discretionary based on the timing of individual securities sales due to such factors as market opportunities, our tax and capital profile and overall market cycles. Unrealized gains and losses arise primarily from changes in the market value of our investments that are classified as trading or equity securities. These valuation adjustments may not necessarily result in realized economic gains or losses.
Loss on Extinguishment of Debt. Gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt and losses incurred to purchase our debt prior to maturity are discretionary activities that are undertaken in order to take advantage of market opportunities to strengthen our financial and capital positions.
Impairment of Goodwill or Other Acquired Intangible Assets. The periodic review of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets for potential impairment may impact consolidated results. Our goodwill and other acquired intangible assets analysis is based on management’s assumptions, which are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

(2)Adjusted to reflect subsequent refinancing activity under HARP, this percentage would decrease to 3.7%, 4.7%, and 6.0% as of December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.
New Insurance Written
A key component of our current business strategy is to write profitable NIW while effectively maintaining the portfolio’s health, balance and profitability. Consistent with this objective, we wrote $105.0 billion of primary new mortgage insurance in 2020, compared to $71.3 billion of NIW in 2019. The NIW written on a Flow Basis in 2020 was Radian’s highest volume in its history.
We target a blended return on required capital on new business on an unlevered basis (i.e., after-tax underwriting returns plus projected investment income) between 13-17%. This projected targeted return incorporates the impact of the PMIERs financial requirements and the risk distribution programs we have in place to cover NIW at the time it is originated, such as our Single Premium QSR Program, but does not include the impact of leverage or risk distribution transactions that are executed after the NIW has been originated, such as our Excess-of-Loss Program. Actions we take with respect to pricing and risk on NIW we are writing today are expected to gradually affect our results over time, due to the natural turnover of the mortgage insurance portfolio as existing IIF cancels.
Our 2020 NIW, partially offset by cancellations and amortization within our existing portfolio, resulted in an increase in IIF to $246.1 billion at December 31, 2020, from $240.6 billion at December 31, 2019, as shown in the chart above. Our NIW increased by 47.2% in 2020 as compared to 2019, due to a strong mortgage origination market including higher refinance activity, aided by a historically low interest rate environment, and increased private mortgage insurance penetration rates.
Among other factors, private mortgage insurance industry volumes are impacted by total mortgage origination volumes and the mix between mortgage originations that are for home purchases versus refinancings of existing mortgages, with the penetration rate for private mortgage insurance being generally three to five times higher for purchase transactions than for refinancings. According to industry estimates, total mortgage origination volume was higher in 2020 as compared to 2019, due to a strong purchase market and a significant increase in refinance originations driven largely by lower interest rates. Although it is difficult to project future volumes, recent market projections for 2021 estimate total mortgage originations of approximately three trillion dollars, which would represent a decline in the total mortgage origination market of 20-25%, with a private mortgage insurance market of 450 to 500 billion dollars. This outlook anticipates a significant decrease in refinance originations in the second half of 2021 resulting from expected increases in interest rates. While expectations for refinance volume vary, there is consensus around a large purchase market driven by increased home sales, which is a positive for mortgage insurers given the higher likelihood of purchase loans to utilize private mortgage insurance as compared to a refinance loan. If refinance volume declines we would expect the Persistency Rate for our portfolio to increase, benefiting the growth of our Insurance in Force portfolio. See "Overview-COVID-19 Impacts” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for more information.
We experienced a decrease in our total mix of Single Premium Policies to 12.3% of our NIW for 2020, compared to 16.5% for 2019. Borrower-paid Single Premium Policies were 90.2% of our total direct Single Premium NIW for 2020 compared to

86.1% for 2019. We expect our production level for Single Premium Policies to fluctuate over time based on various factors, which include risk/return considerations and market conditions.
The following table provides selected information as of and for the periods indicated related to our mortgage insurance NIW. For direct Single Premium Policies, NIW includes policies written on an individual basis (as each loan is originated) and on an aggregated basis (in which each individual loan in a group of loans is insured in a single transaction, typically after the loans have been originated).
(1)Lender-paid Single Premium Policies have higher Minimum Required Assets under the PMIERs as compared to borrower-paid Single Premium Policies. See “Item 1. Business-Regulation-GSE Requirements” for additional information.
(2)For loans with multiple borrowers, the percentage of NIW by FICO score represents the lowest of the borrowers’ FICO scores. Data for 2018 had previously been presented based on the FICO score of the primary borrower and have been restated to reflect the lowest of the borrowers’ FICO scores.
Insurance and Risk in Force
IIF at December 31, 2020 increased 2.3% as compared to the same period last year, reflecting an 11.4% increase in Monthly Premium Policies in force, partially offset by a 20.9% decline in Single Premium Policies in force. As shown in the table below, our Persistency Rate at December 31, 2020 declined as compared to the same period in 2019. Historically, there is a close correlation between interest rates and Persistency Rates. Lower interest rate environments generally increase refinancings, which increase the cancellation rate of our insurance and negatively affect our Persistency Rates. The decline in our Persistency Rate at December 31, 2020 was primarily attributable to increased refinance activity resulting from historically low interest rates, and resulted in an increase in policy cancellations and a net decline in Single Premium Policies in force in particular.

Our IIF is the primary driver of the future premiums that we expect to earn over time. Although not reflected in the current period financial statements, nor in our reported book value, we expect our IIF to generate substantial earnings in future periods, due to the high credit quality of our current mortgage insurance portfolio and its expected persistency over multiple years. See “Key Factors Affecting Our Results-Mortgage-IIF and Related Drivers” for more information.
Our earnings in future periods are subject to elevated risks and uncertainties due in particular to the potential impact of the unprecedented and continually evolving social and economic impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic on the U.S. and global economies generally, and in particular on the U.S. housing, real estate and housing finance markets. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the COVID-19 pandemic, which could have a material negative effect on the Company’s business, liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. See “Overview-COVID-19 Impacts” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for additional information.
Historical loan performance data indicates that credit scores and underwriting quality are key drivers of credit performance. As of December 31, 2020, our portfolio of business written subsequent to 2008, including refinancings under HARP, represented approximately 96.3% of our total primary RIF. Loan originations after 2008 have consisted primarily of high credit quality loans with significantly better credit performance than loans originated during 2008 and prior periods. The volume of insurance that we have written on high credit quality loans after 2008 has significantly improved our mortgage insurance portfolio mix. Our actual and expected future losses on our portfolio written after 2008, together with refinancings under HARP, are significantly lower than those experienced on our NIW prior to and including 2008. However, the impact to our future losses from the COVID-19 pandemic, including from recent increases in and elevated levels of unemployment, which may be prolonged, is highly uncertain.
The following table illustrates the trends of our cumulative incurred loss ratios by year of origination and development year.
(1)Represents inception-to-date losses incurred as a percentage of net premiums earned.
(2)Losses incurred in 2020 across all vintages were elevated due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Throughout this report, unless otherwise noted, RIF is presented on a gross basis and includes the amount ceded under reinsurance. NIW, RIF and IIF for direct Single Premium Policies include policies written on an individual basis (as each loan is originated) and on an aggregated basis (in which each individual loan in a group of loans is insured in a single transaction, typically after the loans have been originated).

Risk Distribution
We use third-party reinsurance in our mortgage insurance business as part of our risk distribution strategy, including to manage our capital position and risk profile. When we enter into a reinsurance agreement, the reinsurer receives a premium and, in exchange, insures an agreed upon portion of incurred losses. While these arrangements have the impact of reducing our earned premiums, they reduce our required capital and are expected to increase our return on required capital for the related policies. The impact of these programs on our financial results will vary depending on the level of ceded RIF, as well as the levels of prepayments and incurred losses on the reinsured portfolios, among other factors. See “Key Factors Affecting Our Results-Mortgage-Risk Distribution” and Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our reinsurance transactions.

This section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K generally discusses our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and a year-over-year comparison between 2020 and 2019. Detailed discussions of our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018, including the year-over-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018, that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K can be found in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 filed with the SEC on February 28, 2020.
Net Income. As discussed in more detail below, our net income decreased for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily reflecting: (i) an increase in provision for losses; (ii) a decrease in our Mortgage segment net premiums earned; (iii) a decrease in services revenue primarily related to the sale of Clayton; and (iv) a decrease in net investment income. Partially offsetting these items are decreases in: (i) our income tax provision; (ii) other operating expenses; (iii) loss on extinguishment of debt; and (iv) cost of services primarily related to the sale of Clayton. See “Results of Operations-All Other-Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019” for additional information on the sale of Clayton.
Diluted Net Income Per Share. The decrease in diluted net income per share for 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily due to the change in net income, as discussed above, partially offset by the decrease in average diluted shares from 210.3 million shares in 2019 to 196.6 million shares for 2020.
Adjusted Diluted Net Operating Income Per Share. The decrease in adjusted diluted net operating income per share for 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily due to the decrease in our Mortgage segment’s adjusted pretax operating income, which decreased to $451.5 million in 2020, from $852.9 million in 2019. See “Results of Operations-Mortgage-Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019-Adjusted Pretax Operating Income” for more information on our Mortgage segment’s results.
Book Value Per Share. The increase in book value per share from $20.13 at December 31, 2019, to $22.36 at December 31, 2020, is primarily due to: (i) our net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 and (ii) an increase of $0.76 per share due to net unrealized gains in our available for sale securities, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. Partially offsetting these items is: (i) a $0.49 per share impact of dividends and dividend equivalents and (ii) a $0.06 per share reduction from the net impact of our share repurchases for the year ended December 31, 2020, inclusive of the cost of these repurchases.
Return on Equity. The changes in return on equity across all periods presented are primarily due to the changes in net income and, to a lesser extent, increases in stockholders’ equity. See “-Net Income” above for more information on the changes in net income.
Adjusted Net Operating Return on Equity. The changes in adjusted net operating return on equity across all periods presented are primarily due to the changes in our adjusted pretax operating income, partially offset by increases in stockholders’ equity.
Net Gains (Losses) on Investments and Other Financial Instruments. Net gains on investments and other financial instruments for 2020 increased as compared to 2019 primarily due to: (i) net realized gains on our fixed-maturities available for sale and (ii) higher gains on other financial instruments. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in unrealized gains in our equity and trading portfolio. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on net gains (losses) on investments.
Loss on Extinguishment of Debt. During 2019, the redemption of our remaining Senior Notes due 2020 and 2021 resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $22.7 million. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Amortization and Impairment of Other Acquired Intangible Assets and Impairment of Goodwill. During the fourth quarter of 2019, in connection with the reclassification of Clayton as held for sale, we recorded a goodwill impairment of $4.8 million, as well as an impairment charge for other acquired intangible assets of $13.7 million. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The amortization of intangible assets primarily reflects the amortization of intangible assets acquired as part of the Clayton acquisition in 2014.
Income Tax Provision. Our 2020 effective tax rate was 17.9%, as compared to 20.8% for 2019. Our effective tax rate in 2020 was lower than the federal statutory tax rate primarily due to the accounting for uncertainty of income taxes, which we view as a Discrete Item. Our effective tax rate in 2019 approximated the federal statutory tax rate.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures. In addition to the traditional GAAP financial measures, we have presented “adjusted pretax operating income,” “adjusted diluted net operating income per share” and “adjusted net operating return on equity,” which are non-GAAP financial measures for the consolidated company, among our key performance indicators to evaluate our fundamental financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures align with the way our business performance is evaluated by both management and by our board of directors. These measures have been established in order to increase transparency for the purposes of evaluating our operating trends and enabling more meaningful comparisons with our peers. Although on a consolidated basis “adjusted pretax operating income,” “adjusted diluted net operating income per share” and “adjusted net operating return on equity” are non-GAAP financial measures, for the reasons discussed above we believe these measures aid in understanding the underlying performance of our operations.

Total adjusted pretax operating income (loss), adjusted diluted net operating income (loss) per share and adjusted net operating return on equity are not measures of overall profitability, and therefore should not be considered in isolation or viewed as substitutes for GAAP pretax income (loss), diluted net income (loss) per share or return on equity. Our definitions of adjusted pretax operating income (loss), adjusted diluted net operating income (loss) per share and adjusted net operating return on equity, as discussed and reconciled below to the most comparable respective GAAP measures, may not be comparable to similarly-named measures reported by other companies.
Our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Radian’s chief operating decision maker), uses adjusted pretax operating income (loss) as our primary measure to evaluate the fundamental financial performance of the Company’s business segments and to allocate resources to the segments.
Adjusted pretax operating income (loss) is defined as GAAP consolidated pretax income (loss) excluding the effects of: (i) net gains (losses) on investments and other financial instruments; (ii) loss on extinguishment of debt; (iii) amortization and impairment of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets; and (iv) impairment of other long-lived assets and other non-operating items, such as gains (losses) from the sale of lines of business and acquisition-related expenses.
Although adjusted pretax operating income (loss) excludes certain items that have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future, the excluded items represent those that are: (i) not viewed as part of the operating performance of our primary activities or (ii) not expected to result in an economic impact equal to the amount reflected in pretax income (loss). These adjustments, along with the reasons for their treatment, are described in Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
The following table provides a reconciliation of consolidated pretax income to our non-GAAP financial measure for the consolidated Company of adjusted pretax operating income.
(1)The amounts for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 primarily relate to impairments of other long-lived assets and are included in other operating expenses on the consolidated statement of operations. The amount for the year ended December 31, 2018 is included within restructuring and other exit costs on the consolidated statements of operations, except for $1.6 million in 2018 related to the impairment of other long-lived assets, included in other operating expenses.
(2)Total adjusted pretax operating income on a consolidated basis consists of adjusted pretax operating income (loss) for our Mortgage segment, Real Estate segment and All Other activities, as further detailed in Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019
Adjusted Pretax Operating Income. The decrease in our Mortgage segment’s adjusted pretax operating income for 2020, compared to 2019, primarily reflects: (i) an increase in provision for losses and (ii) a decrease in net premiums earned. These items were partially offset by a decrease in other operating expenses. See “-Net Premiums Written and Earned” and “-Provision for Losses” below for more information about our net premiums earned and provision for losses, respectively.
Net Premiums Written and Earned. Net premiums written for 2020 decreased compared to 2019. The decrease reflects lower premium rates on our IIF portfolio compared to the same period in 2019, as well as a lower proportion of Single Premium Policies. In addition, net premiums written for 2020 reflect an increase in ceded premiums resulting from a reduction to accrued profit commissions, due to higher ceded losses primarily recorded in the second quarter of 2020.

The table below provides additional information about the components of mortgage insurance net premiums earned for the periods indicated, including the effects of our reinsurance programs.
(1)Includes a cumulative adjustment to unearned premiums recorded in the second quarter of 2019 related to an update to the amortization rates used to recognize revenue for Single Premium Policies. This adjustment increased the 2019 direct premium yield and net premium yield by 1.9 and 1.4 basis points, respectively. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
(2)Includes premiums from our participation in certain credit risk transfer programs.
(3)Includes the impact of related profit commissions.
(4)Represents the profit commission on the Single Premium QSR Program, excluding the impact of Single Premium Policy cancellations.
(5)Calculated by dividing direct premiums earned, including assumed revenue and excluding revenue from cancellations, by average primary IIF.
(6)Calculated by dividing net premiums earned by average primary IIF. The calculation for all periods presented incorporates the impact of profit commission adjustments related to our Single Premium QSR Program. For the year ended December 31, 2020, these profit commission adjustments are significantly impacted by the increased ceded losses in 2020. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Net premiums earned decreased for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to reduced profit commissions as a result of higher ceded losses. Also contributing to the decline for 2020 compared to 2019 was a $32.9 million cumulative adjustment in 2019 related to an update to the amortization rates used to recognize revenue for Single Premium Policies. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. These decreases to net premiums earned for 2020 were partially offset by the increase in net premiums earned from Single Premium Policy cancellations, as compared to 2019.
The level of mortgage prepayment speeds affects the revenue ultimately produced by our mortgage insurance business and is influenced by the mix of business we write. We believe that writing a mix of Single Premium Policies and Monthly Premium Policies has the potential to moderate the overall impact on our results if actual prepayments are significantly different from expectations. However, the impact of this moderating effect is affected by the amount of reinsurance we obtain on portions of our portfolio, with the Single Premium QSR Program currently reducing the proportion of retained Single Premium Policies in our portfolio. See “Key Factors Affecting Our Results-Mortgage-IIF and Related Drivers” for more information.

(1)Does not include the benefit from ceding commissions on our Single Premium QSR Programs, which are included in other operating expenses on the consolidated statement of operations. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Net Investment Income. Lower investment yields, partially offset by higher average investment balances, resulted in decreases in net investment income for 2020, compared to 2019. Our higher investment balances were a result of investing our positive cash flows from operations.
Provision for Losses. The following table details the financial impact of the significant components of our provision for losses for the periods indicated.
(1)Related to defaulted loans with a most recent default notice dated in the year indicated. For example, if a loan had defaulted in a prior year, but then subsequently cured and later re-defaulted in the current year, that default would be considered a current year default.
(2)Related to defaulted loans with a default notice dated in a year earlier than the year indicated, which have been continuously in default since that time.
(3)Provision for losses as a percentage of net premiums earned. See below and “-Net Premiums Written and Earned” for further discussion of the components of this ratio.
(4)Calculated by dividing provision for losses for new defaults, net of reinsurance, by new primary defaults for each period.
Our mortgage insurance provision for losses for 2020 increased by $351.8 million as compared to 2019. Reserves established for new default notices were the primary driver of our total incurred losses for 2020 and 2019. Current year new primary defaults increased significantly for 2020, compared to 2019, as shown below. The increase primarily relates to a significant increase in the number of new default notices resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, substantially all due to borrowers in forbearance programs. Our gross Default to Claim Rate assumption for new primary defaults was 8.5% at December 31, 2020, compared to 7.5% as of December 31, 2019. This increase reflects the estimated impact of a worsening macroeconomic environment, partially offset by the expected beneficial effects of mortgage relief options and protections, including forbearance programs under the CARES Act. See Notes 1 and 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for additional information. In addition, the new defaults reported in 2020 are concentrated in more recent origination vintages and have higher average loan balances, which in turn contributes to higher reserves per new default.
Our provision for losses during 2020 benefited from favorable reserve development on prior period defaults, based on favorable cure activity. Our provision for losses during 2019 was similarly impacted by favorable reserve development on prior year defaults. This favorable development in 2019 was primarily driven by a reduction during the period in certain Default to Claim Rate assumptions for prior year defaults, based on observed trends of higher Cures than were previously estimated on those prior year defaults, partially offset by an increase in our IBNR reserve estimate related to certain legal proceedings. See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

We develop our Default to Claim Rate estimates on defaulted loans based on models that use a variety of loan characteristics to determine the likelihood that a default will reach claim status. Our gross Default to Claim Rate estimates on defaulted loans are mainly developed based on the Stage of Default and Time in Default of the underlying defaulted loans, as measured by the progress toward foreclosure sale and the number of months in default. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the table detailing our Default to Claim Rate assumptions.
The following tables show additional information about our primary loans in default as of the dates indicated.
N/A - Not applicable
Our aggregate weighted-average net Default to Claim Rate assumption for our primary loans used in estimating our reserve for losses, which is net of estimated Claim Denials and Rescissions, was approximately 24% and 30%, at December 31,

2020 and 2019, respectively. This decrease was primarily due to a shift in the mix of defaults during 2020, given the larger proportion of more recent defaults, including defaults of loans subject to forbearance programs implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our net Default to Claim Rate and loss reserve estimate incorporates our expectations with respect to future Rescissions, Claim Denials and Claim Curtailments. Our estimate of such net future Loss Mitigation Activities, inclusive of claim withdrawals, reduced our loss reserve as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 by $29 million and $19 million, respectively. These expectations are based primarily on recent claim withdrawal activity and our recent experience with respect to the number of claims that have been denied due to the policyholder’s failure to submit sufficient documentation to perfect a claim within the time period permitted under our Master Policies, as well as our recent experience with respect to the number of insurance certificates that have been rescinded due to fraud, underwriter negligence or other factors.
Our reported Rescission, Claim Denial and Claim Curtailments activity in any given period is subject to challenge by our lender and servicer customers through our claims rebuttal process. In addition, we are at times engaged in discussions with our lender and servicer customers regarding our Loss Mitigation Activities. Unless a liability associated with such activities or discussions becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated, we consider our claim payments and our Rescissions, Claim Denials and Claim Curtailments to be resolved for financial reporting purposes. In accordance with the accounting standard regarding contingencies, we accrue for an estimated loss when we determine that the loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.
We expect that a portion of previously rescinded policies will be reinstated and previously denied claims will be resubmitted with the required documentation and ultimately paid; therefore, we have incorporated this expectation into our IBNR reserve estimate. Our IBNR reserve estimate was $10.0 million and $41.0 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in our IBNR reserve in 2020 as compared to 2019 is primarily related to claims paid in 2020 to settle certain previously disclosed legal proceedings. See Notes 11 and 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Factors that impact the severity of a claim include, but are not limited to: (i) the size of the loan; (ii) the amount of mortgage insurance coverage placed on the loan; (iii) the amount of time between default and claim during which we are expected to cover interest (capped at two years under our Prior Master Policy and capped at three years under our 2014 Master Policy and 2020 Master Policy) and certain expenses; and (iv) the impact of certain loss management activities with respect to the loan. The average Claim Severity experienced for loans covered by our primary insurance was 101.4% for 2020, compared to 101.8% in 2019.
Our mortgage insurance total loss reserve as a percentage of our mortgage insurance total RIF was 1.4% and 0.7% at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our reserves for losses and a reconciliation of our Mortgage segment’s beginning and ending reserves for losses and LAE.
Total mortgage insurance claims paid in 2020 of $97.6 million have decreased from claims paid of $132.2 million in 2019. The decrease in claims paid is primarily attributable to COVID-19-related forbearance plans and suspensions of foreclosures and evictions. Claims paid in both periods also include the impact of commutations and settlements, including for payments made in 2020 to settle certain previously disclosed legal proceedings. Although expected claims are included in our reserve for losses, the timing of claims paid is subject to fluctuation from quarter to quarter, based on the rate that defaults cure and other factors, including the impact of foreclosure moratoriums (as further described in “Item 1. Business-Mortgage-Defaults and Claims”), that make the timing of paid claims difficult to predict.
The following table shows net claims paid by product and the average claim paid by product for the periods indicated.
(1)Net of reinsurance recoveries.
(2)Includes payments to commute mortgage insurance coverage on certain performing and non-performing loans. For the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily includes payments made to settle certain previously disclosed legal proceedings.

______________________________________________________________________________________________________
Other Operating Expenses. The decrease in other operating expenses for 2020, as compared to 2019, is primarily due to: (i) a decrease in technology-related expenses; (ii) a decrease in compensation expense in 2020, including variable and share-based compensation; and (iii) an increase in ceding commissions. This decrease in expense was partially offset by higher allocated corporate operating expenses.
Our expense ratio on a net premiums earned basis represents our Mortgage segment’s operating expenses (which include policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses, as well as allocated corporate operating expenses), expressed as a percentage of net premiums earned. Our expense ratio was 21.2% for 2020, compared to 22.1% for 2019. The decrease in other operating expenses during 2020 was the primary driver of the decrease in the expense ratio as compared to 2019.
Interest Expense. The increase in interest expense for 2020, as compared to 2019, primarily reflects an increase in our senior notes outstanding in 2020. This increase in interest expense was partially offset by the positive impact of our net reduction in senior notes outstanding in 2019. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our senior notes.
Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018
The increase in our Mortgage segment’s adjusted pretax operating income for 2019, compared to 2018, primarily reflected an increase in net premiums earned, due primarily to an increase in IIF and also impacted by a $32.9 million cumulative adjustment in 2019 related to an update to the amortization rates used to recognize revenue for Single Premium Policies, as further discussed above in “-Net Premiums Written and Earned”. Partially offsetting this item were increases in: (i) provision for losses; (ii) other operating expenses; and (iii) interest expense allocated by Radian Group.
Results of Operations-Real Estate
As noted above in “Results of Operations-Consolidated” and as further discussed in Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we made certain modifications to our segment reporting in 2020. These changes to our reportable segments have been reflected in our Real Estate segment operating results for all periods presented. See “Item 1. Business-Real Estate-Real Estate Business Overview-Services Offered” and Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Real Estate segment and the January 2020 sale of Clayton, as well as other changes impacting our reportable segments in 2020.
The following table summarizes our Real Estate segment’s results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
(1)Our senior management uses adjusted pretax operating income (loss) as our primary measure to evaluate the fundamental financial performance of each of our business segments. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
(2)Includes allocation of corporate operating expenses of $12.8 million, $10.2 million and $8.4 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019
Our Real Estate segment’s adjusted pretax operating loss for 2020 was $23.2 million, compared to an adjusted pretax operating loss of $18.0 million in 2019. The increase in our adjusted pretax operating loss in 2020, as compared to 2019, was primarily related to the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the operating environment for certain business lines and continued strategic investments focused on our title and digital real estate businesses. Such investments contributed to an increase in total expenses, which was partially offset by an increase in net premiums earned and services revenue attributable to the strong origination growth in our title insurance business. The increase in other operating expenses for 2020 compared to 2019 was also due in part to higher allocated corporate operating expenses.

Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018
The increase in our adjusted pretax operating loss for 2019, as compared to 2018, was driven by an increase in other operating expenses and cost of services due to an increase in the number of employees and other similar initiatives to support growth, partially offset by an increase in net premiums earned from our title insurance business.
Results of Operations-All Other
The following table summarizes our All Other results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
(1)Our senior management uses adjusted pretax operating income (loss) as our primary measure to evaluate the fundamental financial performance of each of the Company’s business segments. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019
Adjusted pretax operating income decreased in 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily as a result of certain allocated adjustments, which contributed to the reduction in services revenue from 2019 in addition to the impact of the sale of Clayton discussed below. Also contributing to the decrease in adjusted pretax operating income is a decrease in net investment income. Lower investment yields, partially offset by higher average investment balances, resulted in decreases in investment income for 2020, compared to 2019. Our higher investment balances were primarily a result of investing the proceeds from our May 2020 issuance of Senior Notes due 2025. In addition, services revenue, cost of services and other operating expenses all declined in 2020 as compared to 2019 as a result of the sale of Clayton in January 2020; however, the net impact of the sale was not material to the trend in adjusted pretax operating income.
Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018
Adjusted pretax operating income increased in 2019 compared to an adjusted pretax operating loss in 2018 primarily as a result of: (i) a decrease in interest expense, as a result of the Clayton Intercompany Note repayment, and (ii) an increase in net investment income. Higher average investment balances, combined with higher investment yields, resulted in increases in investment income for 2019, compared to 2018. Our higher investment balances were primarily a result of investing the large Extraordinary Distributions received by Radian Group from Radian Guaranty in 2019 and 2018.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash Flows
The following table summarizes our consolidated cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.
Operating Activities. Our most significant source of operating cash flows is generally from premiums received from our mortgage insurance policies, while our most significant uses of operating cash flows are generally for claims paid on our mortgage insurance policies and our operating expenses. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $658.4 million for 2020, compared to $694.4 million in 2019. This decrease was principally the result of cash received from the IRS in the first quarter of 2019, which included a $57.2 million refund that was previously on deposit with the IRS, partially offset by a reduction in claims paid in 2020.
Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities increased in 2020, compared to 2019, primarily as a result of: (i) an increase in purchases, net of proceeds from sales, of fixed-maturity investments available for sale; (ii) a decrease in proceeds from sales of trading securities; and (iii) an increase in net purchases of short-term investments.
Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities for 2020 was $222.6 million, as compared to net cash used in financing activities for 2019 of $403.1 million. For 2020, our primary financing activities included the issuance of Senior Notes due 2025, partially offset by: (i) repurchases of our common shares and (ii) an increase in dividends paid. See Notes 12 and 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our senior note issuance, share repurchases and increased dividends. For 2019, our primary financing activities included: (i) repurchases of our common shares and (ii) repayments and repurchases of senior notes exceeding related issuances.

Liquidity Analysis-Holding Company
Radian Group serves as the holding company for our operating subsidiaries and does not have any operations of its own. At December 31, 2020, Radian Group had available, either directly or through unregulated subsidiaries, unrestricted cash and liquid investments of $1.1 billion. Available liquidity at December 31, 2020 excludes certain additional cash and liquid investments that have been advanced to Radian Group from our subsidiaries to pay for corporate expenses and interest payments. Total liquidity, which includes our undrawn $267.5 million unsecured revolving credit facility, as described below, was $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2020.
During 2020, Radian Group’s available liquidity increased by $450.1 million, due primarily to net proceeds of $515.6 million from the issuance of Senior Notes due 2025 (see “-Capitalization-Holding Company” below for details) and Radian Reinsurance’s return of $465 million of capital to Radian Group in January 2020, as approved by the Pennsylvania Insurance Department. The effects of the debt issuance and return of capital were partially offset by the cost of share repurchases and dividends, as described below, and the transfer of $200 million of cash and marketable securities to Radian Guaranty in exchange for a surplus note in the same amount. See “-Mortgage” below for additional information.
In addition to available cash and marketable securities, Radian Group’s principal sources of cash to fund future liquidity needs include: (i) payments made to Radian Group by its subsidiaries under expense- and tax-sharing arrangements; (ii) net investment income earned on its cash and marketable securities; (iii) to the extent available, dividends or other distributions from our subsidiaries; and (iv) amounts, if any, that Radian Guaranty is able to repay under the Surplus Notes. Radian Group also has in place a $267.5 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of bank lenders, which has a maturity date of January 18, 2022. At December 31, 2020, the full $267.5 million remains undrawn and available under the facility. Subject to certain limitations, borrowings under the credit facility may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, capital contributions to our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries as well as growth initiatives. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the unsecured revolving credit facility.
We expect Radian Group’s principal liquidity demands for the next 12 months to be: (i) the payment of corporate expenses, including taxes; (ii) interest payments on our outstanding debt obligations; and (iii) subject to approval by our board of directors and our ongoing assessment of our financial condition and potential capital demands in our Mortgage business, the payment of quarterly dividends on our common stock and the potential repurchase of shares of our common stock, including pursuant to the current share repurchase authorization, as described below, for which $198.9 million in authorization remains outstanding.
In addition to our ongoing short-term liquidity needs discussed above, our most significant need for liquidity beyond the next 12 months is the repayment of $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of our senior debt due in future years. See “-Capitalization-Holding Company” below for details of our debt maturity profile. Radian Group’s liquidity demands for the next 12 months or in future periods could also include: (i) early repurchases or redemptions of portions of our debt obligations; (ii) the repurchase of shares of our common stock; (iii) potential additional investments to support our business strategy; and (iv) potential additional capital contributions to our subsidiaries, including due to the continuing impact that the COVID-19 pandemic could have on the liquidity, results of operations and financial condition of Radian Group and our subsidiaries. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the economy, including the significant increase in unemployment, we experienced a material increase in new defaults in the second quarter of 2020, and to a lesser extent in the second half of 2020, substantially all related to defaulted loans subject to forbearance programs implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. While we expect it will take a number of months or years before any new defaults resulting from the pandemic would require a claim payment, Radian Group may be required to contribute additional capital to support Radian Guaranty’s PMIERs Cushion due to increased minimum asset requirements on defaulted loans. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including “-Radian Group’s sources of

liquidity may be insufficient to fund its obligations” and “-Radian Guaranty may fail to maintain its eligibility status with the GSEs, and the additional capital required to support Radian Guaranty’s eligibility could reduce our available liquidity” for additional discussion about the elevated risks and uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the potential impact to Radian Guaranty’s Minimum Required Assets. See also Notes 1 and 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and “Overview-COVID-19 Impacts” for further information.
If Radian Group’s current sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund its obligations, or if we otherwise decide to increase our liquidity position, Radian Group may seek additional capital, including by incurring additional debt, issuing additional equity, or selling assets, which we may not be able to do on favorable terms, if at all.
Share Repurchases. During 2020 and 2019, the Company repurchased 11.0 million shares and 13.5 million shares of Radian Group common stock, respectively, under programs authorized by Radian Group’s board of directors, at a total cost of $226.3 million and $300.2 million, respectively, including commissions. Effective March 19, 2020, the Company temporarily suspended purchases under its share repurchase program and canceled its then current 10b5-1 plan in response to uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Radian may initiate a new 10b5-1 plan at its discretion in the future. The expiration date of the current share repurchase authorization remains August 31, 2021 and the Company had $198.9 million of the share repurchase authorization remaining at December 31, 2020. See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on our share repurchase programs.
Dividends. Effective February 13, 2020, Radian Group’s board of directors authorized an increase to the Company’s quarterly cash dividend to $0.125 per share. Based on our current outstanding shares of common stock, we would require approximately $96 million in the aggregate to pay our quarterly dividends for the next 12 months. Radian Group is not subject to any limitations on its ability to pay dividends except those generally applicable to corporations that are incorporated in Delaware. Delaware corporation law provides that dividends are only payable out of a corporation’s capital surplus or (subject to certain limitations) recent net profits. As of December 31, 2020, our capital surplus was $4.2 billion, representing our dividend limitation under Delaware law. The declaration and payment of future quarterly cash dividends remains subject to the board of directors’ determination.
Corporate Expenses and Interest Expense. Radian Group has expense-sharing arrangements in place with its principal operating subsidiaries that require those subsidiaries to pay their allocated share of certain holding-company-level expenses, including interest payments on Radian Group’s outstanding debt obligations. Corporate expenses and interest expense on Radian Group’s debt obligations allocated under these arrangements during 2020 of $129.9 million and $68.9 million, respectively, were substantially all reimbursed by our subsidiaries. We expect substantially all of our holding company expenses to continue to be reimbursed by our subsidiaries under our expense-sharing arrangements. The expense-sharing arrangements between Radian Group and our mortgage insurance subsidiaries, as amended, have been approved by the Pennsylvania Insurance Department, but such approval may be modified or revoked at any time.
Taxes. Pursuant to our tax-sharing agreements, our operating subsidiaries pay Radian Group an amount equal to any federal income tax the subsidiary would have paid on a standalone basis if they were not part of our consolidated tax return. As a result, from time to time, under the provisions of our tax-sharing agreements, Radian Group may pay to or receive from its operating subsidiaries amounts that differ from Radian Group’s consolidated federal tax payment obligation. During 2020, Radian Group received $17.4 million of net tax-sharing agreement payments from its operating subsidiaries.
Capitalization-Holding Company
The following table presents our holding company capital structure.
Glossary
Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
Stockholders’ equity increased by $235.6 million from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. The net increase in stockholders’ equity resulted primarily from: (i) our net income of $393.6 million for 2020 and (ii) net unrealized gains on investments of $153.3 million. These items were partially offset by shares repurchased under our share repurchase programs at a cost of $226.3 million, including commissions, and dividend and dividend equivalents of $98.8 million.
We regularly evaluate opportunities, based on market conditions, to finance our operations by accessing the capital markets or entering into other types of financing arrangements with institutional and other lenders and financing sources, and consider various measures to improve our capital and liquidity positions, as well as to strengthen our balance sheet, improve Radian Group’s debt maturity profile and maintain adequate liquidity for our operations. In the past we have repurchased or exchanged, prior to maturity, some of our outstanding debt, and in the future, we may from time to time seek to redeem, repurchase or exchange for other securities, or otherwise restructure or refinance some or all of our outstanding debt prior to maturity in the open market or through other public or private transactions, including pursuant to one or more tender offers or through any combination of the foregoing, as circumstances may allow. The timing or amount of any potential transactions will depend on a number of factors, including market opportunities and our views regarding our capital and liquidity positions and potential future needs, including as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. There can be no assurance that any such transactions will be completed on favorable terms, or at all.
In May 2020, we issued $525 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2025 and received net proceeds of $515.6 million. These notes mature on March 15, 2025 and bear interest at a rate of 6.625% per annum, payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, which interest payments commenced on September 15, 2020. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about these notes and our other senior notes.
Mortgage
The principal demands for liquidity in our Mortgage business currently include: (i) the payment of claims, and potential claim settlement transactions, net of reinsurance; (ii) expenses (including those allocated from Radian Group); (iii) repayments of FHLB advances; (iv) interest expense and repayments, if any, associated with the Surplus Notes; and (v) taxes, including potential additional purchases of U.S. Mortgage Guaranty Tax and Loss Bonds. See Notes 10 and 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to these non-interest bearing instruments. The principal sources of liquidity in our Mortgage business currently include insurance premiums, net investment income and cash flows from: (i) investment sales and maturities; (ii) FHLB advances; and (iii) capital contributions from Radian Group. We believe that the operating cash flows generated by each of our mortgage insurance subsidiaries will provide these subsidiaries with a substantial portion of the funds necessary to satisfy their needs for the foreseeable future. However, see “Overview-COVID-19 Impacts” and Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion about the elevated risks and uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including the impact on our PMIERs Cushion.
As of December 31, 2020, our mortgage insurance subsidiaries maintained claims paying resources of $5.2 billion on a statutory basis, which consists of contingency reserves, statutory policyholders’ surplus, premiums received but not yet earned and loss reserves. In addition, our reinsurance programs are designed to provide additional claims-paying resources during times of economic stress and elevated losses. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our reinsurance programs.
Radian Guaranty’s Risk-to-capital as of December 31, 2020 was 12.7 to 1. Radian Guaranty is not expected to need additional capital to satisfy state insurance regulatory requirements in their current form. At December 31, 2020, Radian Guaranty had statutory policyholders’ surplus of $481.5 million. This balance includes a $210.9 million benefit from U.S. Mortgage Guaranty Tax and Loss Bonds issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, which mortgage guaranty insurers such as Radian Guaranty may purchase in order to be eligible for a tax deduction, subject to certain limitations, related to amounts required to be set aside in statutory contingency reserves. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, “Overview-COVID-19 Impacts” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for more information about these bonds and the risks associated with potential corporate tax rate increases, our statutory and PMIERs requirements and the potential effects of increased defaults due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Private mortgage insurers, including Radian Guaranty, are required to comply with the PMIERs to remain approved insurers of loans purchased by the GSEs. Radian Guaranty currently is an approved mortgage insurer under the PMIERs. At December 31, 2020, Radian Guaranty’s Available Assets under the current PMIERs financial requirements totaled approximately $4.7 billion, resulting in a PMIERs Cushion of $1.3 billion, or 40%, over its Minimum Required Assets of $3.4 billion.

The following chart summarizes our PMIERs Cushion and Radian’s excess available resources as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, calculated based on the PMIERs financial requirements in effect for each date shown.
_______________________________________________________________________
(1)Percentages represent the values shown as a percentage of Minimum Required Assets under the applicable PMIERs financial requirements in effect for the dates shown.
(2)Represents Radian Group’s available liquidity, net of the $35 million minimum liquidity requirement under the unsecured revolving credit facility.
(3)Represents Radian Guaranty’s excess, or “cushion,” of Available Assets over its Minimum Required Assets, calculated in accordance with the PMIERs financial requirements in effect for each date shown.
Our PMIERs Cushion at December 31, 2020, includes a benefit from the current broad-based application of the Disaster Related Capital Charge that has reduced the total amount of Minimum Required Assets that Radian Guaranty otherwise would have been required to hold against pandemic-related defaults as of December 31, 2020 by approximately $650.0 million, taking into consideration our existing risk distribution structures. We expect that application of the Disaster Related Capital Charge will continue to materially reduce Radian Guaranty’s PMIERs Minimum Required Assets; however, the benefit that Radian Guaranty currently is receiving from the Disaster Related Capital Charge is expected to diminish over time.
Under the terms of the temporary COVID-19 Amendment, unless extended by the GSEs, the COVID-19 Crisis Period is currently scheduled to end March 31, 2021. If this occurs, for new defaults going forward, the Disaster Related Capital Charge would only be applied to these defaults if they are subject to a COVID-19 forbearance plan. The Disaster Related Capital Charge would continue to apply to these defaults for as long as they remained in the COVID-19 forbearance plan.
With respect to existing defaults occurring during the COVID-19 Crisis Period, the Disaster Related Capital Charge will continue to apply until: (i) they fail to enter a COVID-19 forbearance program within the period prescribed by the COVID-19 Amendment or (ii) for defaults subject to a COVID-19 forbearance plan, repayment plan or loan modification trial period, they exit the program, plan or trial period without curing the default status.
For all defaulted loans that continue to remain in forbearance, increased asset factors under the PMIERs are applied against defaulted loans based on the amount of time the loans remain in default, with increases taking place upon four, six and 12 missed monthly payments. As a result, notwithstanding the continued application of the Disaster Related Capital Charge, the total amount of Minimum Required Assets we may be required to hold against defaulted loans will increase over time, including for loans subject to forbearance programs, because the 0.30 multiplier is applied to a higher base factor for the defaulting loans as they age.
Given the lack of an expiration date under the CARES Act, it is difficult to estimate how long the GSEs may continue to offer COVID-19 forbearance programs for new defaults. It is also difficult to assess how long the GSEs may continue to apply the temporary COVID-19 Amendment to new and existing defaults. See “Item 1. Business-Regulation-GSE Requirements” for more information about the Disaster Related Capital Charge that is currently being applied by the GSEs to certain nonperforming loans in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Our PMIERs Cushion as of December 31, 2020 includes the benefit from our reinsurance agreements, including the 2020 agreements with Eagle Re 2020-1 Ltd. and Eagle Re 2020-2 Ltd., effective February 2020 and October 2020, respectively. The PMIERs Cushion also includes the transfer of $200 million of cash and marketable securities from Radian Group in exchange for a surplus note in the same amount in January 2020, partially offset by an increase in Minimum Required Assets due to the termination of the intercompany reinsurance agreement with Radian Reinsurance.

In addition to the PMIERs Cushion held at Radian Guaranty, our excess available resources include our unsecured revolving credit facility and holding company liquidity. While these resources may be utilized to enhance Radian Guaranty’s PMIERs Cushion, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could affect our ability to remain compliant with the PMIERs financial requirements as the increase in defaults and resulting increase to our Minimum Required Assets could reduce or potentially exhaust our PMIERs Cushion or exceed our Available Assets. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for additional information.
Even though they hold assets in excess of the minimum statutory capital thresholds and PMIERs financial requirements, the ability of Radian’s mortgage insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends on their common stock is restricted by certain provisions of the insurance laws of Pennsylvania, their state of domicile. Under Pennsylvania’s insurance laws, ordinary dividends and other distributions may only be paid out of an insurer’s positive unassigned surplus, measured as of the end of the prior fiscal year, unless the Pennsylvania Insurance Department approves the payment of dividends or other distributions from another source. In light of Radian Guaranty’s negative unassigned surplus related to operating losses in prior periods, the ongoing need to set aside contingency reserves, and the current ongoing economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which increased losses in 2020 and could further increase losses in future periods, we do not anticipate that Radian Guaranty will be permitted under applicable insurance laws to pay ordinary dividends to Radian Group for the foreseeable future. As a result of its positive unassigned surplus as of December 31, 2020, Radian Reinsurance does have the ability to pay an ordinary dividend in 2021 up to $36.1 million. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on statutory dividend restrictions and contingency reserve requirements.
Under Pennsylvania’s insurance laws, an insurer may request an Extraordinary Distribution, but payment is subject to the approval of the Pennsylvania Insurance Department. Radian Guaranty sought and received such approval to return capital by paying Extraordinary Distributions of $375 million and $450 million to Radian Group in 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Radian Guaranty and Radian Reinsurance are both members of the FHLB. As members, they may borrow from the FHLB, subject to certain conditions, which include requirements to post collateral and to maintain a minimum investment in FHLB stock. Advances from the FHLB may be used to provide low-cost, supplemental liquidity for various purposes, including to fund incremental investments. Radian’s current strategy includes using FHLB advances as financing for general cash management purposes and for purchases of additional investment securities that have similar durations, for the purpose of generating additional earnings from our investment securities portfolio with limited incremental risk. As of December 31, 2020, there were $176.5 million of FHLB advances outstanding. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Real Estate
As of December 31, 2020, our Real Estate segment maintained cash and liquid investments totaling $55.3 million, primarily held by Radian Title Insurance. The sale of Clayton, in January 2020, did not have a material impact on our liquidity.
Title insurance companies, including Radian Title Insurance, are subject to comprehensive state regulations, including minimum net worth requirements. Radian Title Insurance was in compliance with its respective minimum net worth requirements at December 31, 2020. In the event the cash flows from operations of the Real Estate segment are not adequate to fund all of its needs, including the regulatory capital needs of Radian Title Insurance, Radian Group may provide additional funds to the segment in the form of an intercompany note or other capital contribution, and if needed for Radian Title Insurance subject to the approval of the Ohio Department of Insurance. Additional capital support may also be required for potential investments in new business initiatives to support our strategy of growing our businesses.
Liquidity levels may fluctuate depending on the levels and contractual timing of our invoicing and the payment practices of our Real Estate clients, in combination with the timing of our Real Estate segment’s payments for employee compensation and to external vendors. The amount, if any, and timing of the Real Estate segment’s dividend paying capacity will depend primarily on the amount of excess cash flow generated by the segment.

Critical Accounting Estimates
SEC guidance defines Critical Accounting Estimates as those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operation of the registrant. These items require the application of management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. In preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, management has made estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
In preparing these financial statements, management has utilized available information, including our past history, industry standards and the current and projected economic and housing environments, among other factors, in forming its estimates, assumptions and judgments, giving due consideration to materiality. Because the use of estimates is inherent in GAAP, actual results could differ from those estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. A summary of the accounting estimates that management believes are critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is set forth below. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures regarding our significant accounting policies.
Mortgage Insurance Portfolio
Reserve for Losses and LAE
We establish reserves to provide for losses and LAE, which include the estimated costs of settling claims in our mortgage insurance portfolio, in accordance with the accounting standard regarding accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises. In our mortgage insurance business, the default and claim cycle begins with the receipt of a default notice from the loan servicer. We maintain an extensive database of default and claim payment history, and use models based on a variety of loan characteristics to determine the likelihood that a default will reach claim status.
With respect to loans that are in default, considerable judgment is exercised as to the adequacy of reserve levels. We use an actuarial projection methodology referred to as a “roll rate” analysis that uses historical claim frequency information to determine the projected ultimate Default to Claim Rates based on the Stage of Default and Time in Default as well as the date that a loan goes into default. The Default to Claim Rate also includes our estimates with respect to expected Rescissions and Claim Denials, which have the effect of reducing our Default to Claim Rates. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the table detailing our Default to Claim Rate assumptions.
After estimating the Default to Claim Rate, we estimate Claim Severity based on the average of recently observed severity rates within product type, type of insurance, and Time in Default cohorts. These average severity estimates are then applied to individual loan coverage amounts to determine reserves. Similar to the Default to Claim Rate, Claim Severity also is impacted by the length of time that loans are in default and by our Loss Mitigation Activity. For claims under our Primary Mortgage Insurance, the coverage percentage is applied to the claim amount, which consists of the unpaid loan principal, plus past due interest (for which our liability is contractually capped in accordance with the terms of our Master Policies) and certain expenses associated with the default, to determine our maximum liability. Therefore, Claim Severity generally increases the longer that a loan is in default.
We considered the sensitivity of first-lien loss reserve estimates at December 31, 2020 by assessing the potential changes resulting from a parallel shift in Claim Severity and Default to Claim Rate estimates for primary loans, excluding any potential benefits from reinsurance. For example, assuming all other factors remain constant, for every one percentage point change in primary Claim Severity (which we estimate to be 97.5% of defaulted risk exposure at December 31, 2020), we estimated that our loss reserves would change by approximately $8.2 million at December 31, 2020. Assuming all other factors remain constant, for every one percentage point change in our overall primary net Default to Claim Rate (which we estimate to be 24% at December

31, 2020, including our assumptions related to Loss Mitigation Activities), we estimated a $33.5 million change in our loss reserves at December 31, 2020.
Senior management regularly reviews the modeled frequency, Claim Severity and Loss Mitigation Activity estimates, which are based on historical trends, as described above. If recent emerging or projected trends differ significantly from the historical trends used to develop the modeled estimates, management evaluates these trends and determines how they should be considered in its reserve estimates. Estimating our case reserve for losses involves significant reliance upon assumptions and estimates with regard to the likelihood, magnitude and timing of each potential loss. The models, assumptions and estimates we use to establish loss reserves may prove to be inaccurate, especially during an extended economic downturn or a period of extreme market volatility and economic uncertainty such as we are currently experiencing due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These assumptions require management to use considerable judgment in estimating the rate at which these loans will result in claims. As such, given the current environment, there is significant uncertainty around our reserve estimate.
Premium Revenue Recognition
Premiums on mortgage insurance products are written on a recurring basis, either as monthly or annual premiums, or on a multi-year basis as a single premium. Monthly premiums written are earned as coverage is provided each month. For certain monthly policies where the billing is deferred for the first month’s coverage period, currently to the end of the policy, we record a net premium receivable representing the present value of such deferred premiums that we estimate will be collected at that future date. We recognize changes in this receivable based on changes in the estimated amount and timing of such collections, including as a result of changes in observed trends as well as our periodic review of our servicing guide and our operations and collections practices. Key assumptions supporting our estimate include a collection rate and average life. During 2020, we adjusted our assumptions for collectability and average life, which had an impact of increasing the net premium receivable and net premiums earned by $11.3 million and was the primary driver of the $12.3 million net change in the deferred premium receivable. If the collection rate assumption increased or decreased by 500 basis points, it would result in a $2.5 million increase or decrease, respectively, in the net premium receivable and net premiums earned. If the average life assumption increased or decreased by one year, it would result in an approximate $2.5 million decrease or increase, respectively, in the net premium receivable and net premiums earned. Additionally, given the difference between the present value of the net premium receivable recorded and the contractual premiums due, changes in our servicing guide, operations or collection practices, such as reductions in the deferral period, could have up to a $47.3 million pre-tax benefit to our results of operations in periods when any changes are implemented.
Single premiums written are initially recorded as unearned premiums and earned over time based on the anticipated loss pattern and the estimated period of risk exposure, which is primarily derived from historical experience and other factors such as projected losses, premium type and projected contractual periods of risk based on original LTV. Our estimate for the single premium earnings pattern is updated periodically and subject to change given uncertainty as to the underlying loss development and duration of risk. During 2019, we updated our estimated period of risk exposure due to the continuing increase in the significance of borrower-paid Single Premium Policies as well as our estimated anticipated loss pattern due to changes in observed and projected losses. During 2019, this change in estimate resulted in a $32.9 million increase in net premiums earned. There were no changes to our single premium earnings pattern estimate in 2020. Actual future experience that is different than expected loss development or policy cancellations could result in further material increases or decreases in the recognition of net premiums earned. Based on historical experience, losses are relatively low during the first two years after a loan is originated and then increase over a period of several years before declining; however, several factors can impact and change this cycle, including the economic environment, the quality of the underwriting of the loan, characteristics of the mortgage loan, the credit profile of the borrower, housing prices and unemployment rates. If the timing of losses were to shift, it could accelerate or decelerate our recognition of net premiums earned and could have a material impact on our results of operations.
Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs
Incremental, direct costs associated with the successful acquisition of mortgage insurance policies, consisting of compensation, premium tax and other policy issuance and underwriting expenses, are initially deferred and reported as deferred policy acquisition costs and amortized in proportion to estimated gross profits over the life of the policies. Estimates of expected gross profit, including the Persistency Rate and loss development assumptions for each underwriting year used as a basis for amortization, are evaluated quarterly and the total amortization recorded to date is adjusted by a charge or credit to our consolidated statements of operations if actual experience or other evidence suggests that previous estimates should be revised. As our premiums are earned over time, changes in our assumptions for persistency or the timing of projected losses can result in the acceleration or deceleration in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, which could create volatility in our consolidated statements of operations in the period of the change. Considerable judgment is used in evaluating these estimates and the assumptions on which they are based. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, deferred policy acquisition costs were $18.3 million and $20.8 million, respectively.

Credit Losses and Other Impairments
Investments
We perform an evaluation of fixed-maturity securities available for sale each quarter to assess whether any decline in their fair value below cost is deemed to be a credit impairment recognized in earnings. Factors considered in our assessment for impairment include the extent to which the amortized cost basis is greater than fair value and the reasons for the decline in value. As of December 31, 2020, our gross unrealized losses on available for sale securities was $14.2 million, which can fluctuate materially over time based on changes in market conditions. During 2020, we recognized credit losses of $1.0 million related to our fixed-maturity securities available for sale. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding impairments related to investments.
Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets
We review goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. We review other acquired intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The estimated fair value of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets requires considerable judgment and is determined by an income approach using a discounted cash flow methodology. The discounted cash flow methodology is based on projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows, assumed discount rates and other assumptions as deemed appropriate. In estimating future cash flows, we consider factors such as historical performance, anticipated market conditions, operating expense trends and capital expenditure requirements as well as management’s future changes in strategy.
We recognized a $4.8 million impairment of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2019. As it relates to other acquired intangible assets, we recognized $1.3 million and $13.7 million in impairments for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, our remaining goodwill and other acquired intangible assets were $9.8 million and $13.2 million, respectively. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Our estimated fair value measurements are intended to reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on the best information available. Assumptions include the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique (such as a pricing model) and the risks inherent in the inputs to the model. Changes in economic conditions and capital market conditions, including but not limited to, benchmark interest rate changes, credit spread changes, market volatility and changes in the value of underlying collateral, could cause actual results to differ materially from our estimated fair value measurements.
Nearly all of our financial instruments recorded at fair value relate to our investment portfolio, which totaled $6.8 billion as of December 31, 2020. The primary risks in our investment portfolio are interest-rate risk and credit-spread risk, namely the fair value sensitivity of our fixed income securities to changes in interest rates and credit spreads, respectively. We regularly analyze our exposure to interest-rate risk and credit-spread risk and have determined that the fair value of our investments is materially exposed to changes in both interest rates and credit spreads. For additional information regarding the sensitivity of our investment portfolio to these inputs, see “
