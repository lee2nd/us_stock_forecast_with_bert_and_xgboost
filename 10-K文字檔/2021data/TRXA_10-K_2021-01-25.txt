ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION
The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements for the years ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015 together with notes thereto as included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in the section entitled “Risk Factors.” Our audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
We are a development stage company since we have no current operations, are currently pursuing options to find suitable merger candidates and have not generated any significant revenue to date. We have incurred recurring losses to date. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation.
We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.
RESULTS OF OPERATION
Year Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to Year Ended June 30, 2015
Our net loss for the year ended June 30, 2016 was ($141,067) compared to a net loss of ($282,683) during the year ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in net loss was mainly due to the decrease in management fees and the bad debt incurred in the Kerr Transaction. We had advanced $100,000 to Kerr in May 2014 and a further $100,000 to Kerr in July 2014. Kerr subsequently ceased business operations. Therefore, at June 30, 2015, the original $100,000 was determined to be a bad debt and, therefore, was recorded as bad debt for the year ended June 30, 2014. The remaining $100,000 was reflected as a bad debt during the year ended June 30, 2015. During the years ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, we did not generate any revenue.
During the year ended June 30, 2016, we incurred operating expenses of $138,371 compared to $279,933 incurred during the year ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in operating expenses was mainly due to the decrease in management fees. In addition, we had advanced $100,000 to Kerr in May 2014 and a further $100,000 to Kerr in July 2014. Kerr subsequently ceased business operations. Therefore, at June 30, 2014, the original $100,000 was determined to be a bad debt and, therefore, was recorded as bad debt for the year ended June 30, 2014. The remaining $100,000 was reflected as a bad debt during the year ended June 30, 2015.
During the year ended, we incurred interest expenses of $2,696, compared to $2,750 incurred during the year ended June 30, 2015.
On January 1, 2015, the company entered into a management agreement with Mr. Horkey for a period of 5 years and will issue 350,000 shares of its common stock as consideration and is accounted for on the balance sheet as shares to be issued and will be expensed over the life of the contract (5 years), which resulted in a prepaid consulting expense of $210,000. For the year ended June 30, 2015, we expensed $42,000 in consulting expense for Mr. Horkey They were valued on the date of the agreement and the stock price at that time was $.60.
Therefore, our net loss and loss per share during the year ended June 30, 2016 was ($141,067) to a net loss for year ended June 30, 2015 of ($282,683).

GOING CONCERN
The independent auditors’ report accompanying our June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015 financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared “assuming that we will continue as a going concern,” which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. We have suffered recurring losses from operations and have a working capital deficit. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
The following describes the recently issued accounting standards used in reporting our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, accounting standards allow more than one alternative accounting method for reporting. Such is the case with accounting for oil and gas activities described below. In those cases, our reported results of operations would be different should we employ an alternative accounting method.
Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
