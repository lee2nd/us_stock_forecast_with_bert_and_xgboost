Overview
The following discussion provides information about the results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital resources of East West Bancorp, Inc. (referred to herein on an unconsolidated basis as “East West” and on a consolidated basis as the “Company,” “we” or “EWBC”), and its subsidiaries, including its subsidiary bank, East West Bank and its subsidiaries (referred to herein as “East West Bank” or the “Bank”). This information is intended to facilitate the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
Company Overview
East West is a bank holding company incorporated in Delaware on August 26, 1998 and is registered under the BHC Act. The Company commenced business on December 30, 1998 when, pursuant to a reorganization, it acquired all of the voting stock of the Bank, which became its principal asset. The Bank is an independent commercial bank headquartered in California that has a strong focus on the financial service needs of the Asian-American community. Through over 120 locations in the U.S. and Greater China, the Company provides a full range of consumer and commercial products and services through three business segments: Consumer and Business Banking, Commercial Banking, with the remaining operations included in Other. The Company’s principal activity is lending to and accepting deposits from businesses and individuals. The primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is principally derived from the difference between interest earned on loans and debt securities and interest paid on deposits and other funding sources. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $52.16 billion in assets and approximately 3,200 full-time equivalent employees. For additional information on products and services provided by the Bank, see Item 1. Business - Banking Services.

Coronavirus Disease 2019 Global Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruption around the world, as well as economic and financial market deterioration, which did not exist at the beginning of 2020. These economic and operating conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have created financial difficulties for many of the Company’s commercial and consumer customers. As a result, some borrowers may not be able to satisfy their obligations to us. As many of the Company’s loans are secured by real estate, a potential decline in the real estate markets could also negatively impact the Company’s business, financial condition and the credit quality of the Company’s loan portfolio. It has adversely affected, and is likely continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot predict at this time the scope and duration of the pandemic as the COVID-19 pandemic has not yet been contained. While there have been various governmental and other responses to slow or control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to mitigate its adverse impacts, such as stay-at-home orders, restrictions on business activities, economic relief for individuals and businesses, and monetary policy measures, these responses have met varying degrees of success, and it remains uncertain whether these actions will be successful as the pandemic continues. Although effective vaccines have been developed, their distribution is still in the early stages and it is uncertain how long the process will take to complete, nationally or globally.
Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act - The CARES Act was enacted on March 27, 2020 to lessen the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals, businesses and local economies. The CARES Act initiatives included extended unemployment benefits, mortgage forbearance, the SBA PPP and funding and authorization for the MSLP. The Company participated in the Federal Reserve’s MSLP and funded $233.6 million in MSLP loans as of December 31, 2020. The related Main Street special purpose vehicle purchased participations in these loans which amounted to $221.9 million or 95%. The CARES Act also required mortgage servicers to grant, on a borrower’s request, forbearance for up to 180 days (which could be extended for up to another 180 days) on a federally-backed single-family mortgage loan or forbearance up to 30 days (which could be extended for two additional 30-day periods) on a federally-backed multifamily mortgage loan when the borrowers experience financial hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In response to the continued market disruption and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, President Trump signed into law the CAA on December 27, 2020. The CAA contains a variety of provisions for emergency relief to individuals and business related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including measures to, among other things, provide additional funding to businesses, facilitate emergency capital investments by community development financial institutions, fund rental assistance for certain individuals and extend regulatory relief relating to the adoption of CECL until the earlier of the first day of the fiscal year of the institution that begins after the national emergency termination date or January 1, 2022. The CAA provided additional funding to the PPP, expanded eligibility of businesses for the PPP, extended the PPP to March 31, 2021, and allows eligible borrowers to obtain a second PPP loan (“second draw”) up to a maximum amount of $2 million. Second draw PPP borrowers are eligible for loan forgiveness on the same terms as the first draw borrowers. The CAA also simplified the loan forgiveness process for first and second draw borrowers with PPP loans of $150,000 or less and includes a “hold harmless” provision, which provides that a lender may rely on any certification or documentation submitted by a borrower for a PPP loan and that no enforcement action may be taken against the lender, and the lender will not be subject to any penalties relating to loan origination or forgiveness, if (i) the lender acts in good faith relating to loan origination or forgiveness and (ii) all other applicable statutory and regulatory requirements are satisfied.
Paycheck Protection Program - The PPP provides forgivable loans to businesses in order to keep their employees on the payroll and make certain other eligible payments. The SBA guarantees 100% of the PPP loans made to eligible borrowers, and the entire principal amount and any accrued interest on the loans are eligible to be forgiven if certain conditions are met, at which point the SBA will pay the bank that originated the PPP loan the forgiven amount. The Company is a participant in the PPP. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately 6,200 PPP loans outstanding with balances totaling $1.57 billion, which were recorded in the commercial and industrial (“C&I”) portfolio. Related to the PPP loans made in 2020, as of February 25, 2021, the Company has submitted and received approval from the SBA for forgiveness approximately 2,700 PPP loan applications, totaling $341.9 million. In January 2021, the Company began processing applications under the newly funded PPP, largely second draw PPP loans. Since the start of the second draw PPP through February 25, 2021, the Company has funded over 4,300 new PPP loans, totaling $700.3 million.
Other U.S. Government Facilities and Programs - In connection with our participation in the PPP under the CARES Act as discussed above, the Company participated in the PPPLF. During the second quarter of 2020, the Federal Reserve established the PPPLF to allow eligible lenders to facilitate lending under the SBA’s PPP, taking PPP loans as collateral. The Company drew down $1.44 billion from the Federal Reserve PPPLF and pledged the same amount in PPP loans as collateral during the second quarter of 2020. The Company paid off the outstanding amounts under the PPPLF in full during the fourth quarter of 2020.
Loan Modifications - The CARES Act and related guidance from the federal banking agencies provide financial institutions the option to temporarily suspend requirements under GAAP related to classification of certain loan modifications as TDRs to account for the current and anticipated effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act, as amended by the CAA, specified that COVID-19 related loan modifications executed between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of (i) 60 days after the date of termination of the national emergency declared by the President and (ii) January 1, 2022, on loans that were current as of December 31, 2019 are not TDRs. Additionally, under guidance from the federal banking agencies, other short-term modifications made on a good faith basis in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to borrowers that were current prior to any relief are not TDRs under ASC Subtopic 310-40, “Troubled Debt Restructuring by Creditors.” These modifications include short-term (e.g., up to six months) modifications such as payment deferrals, fee waivers, extensions of repayment terms, or delays in payment that are insignificant. We have granted loan modifications to our customers in the form of maturity extensions, payment deferrals and forbearance. For a summary of the loans that we have modified in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, please refer to Item 7. MD&A - Risk Management - Credit Risk Management in this Form 10-K.
Regulatory Capital - The CARES Act requires PPP loans to be assigned a zero percent risk weight under the federal banking agencies’ risk-based capital rules. Additionally, under an interim final rule of the federal banking agencies, PPP loans that an institution pledges as collateral to the PPPLF may be deducted from the institution’s average total consolidated assets for purposes of the Tier 1 leverage ratio.
Federal Reserve Requirements - On March 26, 2020, the Federal Reserve reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero percent, eliminating the reserve requirement for all depository institutions, an action that provides liquidity in the banking system to support lending to households and businesses, in response to the economic stress stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Our Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic
In response to the pandemic, the Company has implemented protocols and processes to execute its business continuity plans to help protect its employees and support its customers. The Company is managing its response to the COVID-19 pandemic according to its Enterprise Business Continuity Policy, which invokes centralized management of the crisis event and the integration of its response. The CEO and key members of the Company’s management team meet regularly with senior executives to help drive decisions, communication and consistency of response across all businesses and functions. In addition, we have implemented measures to assist our employees and customers as discussed below:
•Employees:
The majority of the Company’s employees are able to work from home. The Company continues to evaluate its continuity plans and work-from-home strategy to best protect the health and safety of its employees. For employees with jobs that are required to be performed on-site, we have taken significant actions to ensure employee safety by providing personal protection equipment, adopting social distancing measures, placing visual safety reminders related to social distancing, implementing an enhanced cleaning program, installing plexiglass panels, and requiring temperature screenings and the wearing of masks for all employees.
•Customers:
We assisted our commercial, consumer and small business clients affected by the COVID-19 pandemic through payment deferrals, suspension of foreclosures on certain residential mortgage loans, and participation in the SBA PPP and the MSLP. We intend to evaluate participation in additional new government-sponsored programs, as they are established. In addition, the Company continues to make a wide range of banking services accessible to customers through mobile and other digital channels to reduce the need for in-person branch visits.
Impact on our Financial Position and Results of Operations - Our financial position and results of operations are sensitive to the ability of our loan customers to meet loan obligations, the availability of our workforce and the decline in the value of assets held by us. While its effects continue to materialize, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant decrease in commercial activity throughout our operating footprint. This decrease in commercial activity has caused and may continue to cause our customers to be unable to meet existing payment or other obligations to us. The greatest impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial condition has been in the increase of the provision for credit losses and the allowance for loan losses. We recorded approximately $210.7 million of provision for credit losses during 2020, bringing our allowance for loan losses to $620.0 million as of December 31, 2020, with an allowance for loan losses to loans held-for-investment ratio of 1.61%. Despite the impact of the increased provision for credit losses, we maintained solid profitability for the full year of 2020, earning 1.16% on return on average assets (“ROA”) and 11.17% on return on average equity (“ROE”). Our capital ratios are strong, and we remain well-positioned from a liquidity perspective, enabling us to weather adverse economic scenarios while continuing to support our customers and invest in our business.
For additional information, see Item 7. MD&A - Risk Management - Credit Risk Management and - Liquidity Risk Management, and - Balance Sheet Analysis - Regulatory Capital and Ratios in this Form 10-K. Further discussion of the potential impacts on our business from the COVID-19 pandemic is provided under Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors in this Form 10-K.
Accounting Standards Update 2016-13 Adoption
On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, which establishes a single allowance framework for all financial assets carried at amortized cost, and for certain off-balance sheet exposures. Replacing the prior incurred loss model, this framework requires that management estimate credit losses over the full remaining expected life of a loan, and consider expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions. The adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020 increased the allowance for loan losses by $125.2 million, and the allowance for unfunded credit commitments by $10.5 million, and an after-tax decrease to retained earnings of $98.0 million.

Results of Operations
Net Interest Income
The Company’s primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is the interest income earned on interest-earning assets less interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income to average interest-earning assets. Net interest income and net interest margin are impacted by several factors, including changes in average balances and the composition of interest-earning assets and funding sources, market interest rate fluctuations and the slope of the yield curve, repricing characteristics and maturity of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, volume of noninterest-bearing sources of funds and asset quality.
Net interest income for 2020 was $1.38 billion, a decrease of $90.6 million or 6%, compared with $1.47 billion in 2019. The decrease in net interest income for 2020 was due to lower interest-earning asset yields, reflecting significantly lower benchmark interest rates in 2020, partially offset by a lower cost of funds. Net interest margin for 2020 was 2.98%, a decrease of 66 basis points from 3.64% in 2019.
Average interest-earning assets were $46.24 billion in 2020, an increase of $5.92 billion or 15% from $40.32 billion in 2019. This was primarily due to loan growth, as well as increases of $1.19 billion in average interest-bearing cash and deposits with banks, and $1.17 billion in average AFS debt securities. Average loans were $36.80 billion in 2020, an increase of $3.43 billion or 10% from $33.37 billion in 2019.
The yield on average interest-earning assets for 2020 was 3.45%, a decrease of 122 basis points from 4.67% in 2019. The year-over-year yield compression reflected the lower average loan yield, as well as yield compression for all other earning asset categories, in response to the low interest rate environment. The average loan yield for 2020 was 3.98%, a decrease of 117 basis points from 5.15% in 2019. The year-over-year yield compression reflected materially lower benchmark interest rates, including a 150 basis points reduction to the target federal funds rate in March 2020. Approximately 65% and 64% of loans held-for-investment were variable-rate or hybrid loans in their adjustable rate period as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Deposits are an important source of funds and impact both net interest income and net interest margin. Average total deposits were $40.76 billion in 2020, an increase of $4.71 billion or 13% from $36.05 billion in 2019. Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits were $13.82 billion in 2020, an increase of $3.32 billion or 32% from $10.50 billion in 2019. Average interest-bearing deposits were $26.94 billion in 2020, an increase of $1.39 billion or 5% from $25.55 billion in 2019. Due to the strong growth in average noninterest-bearing deposits, the share of noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased to 34% of average total deposits in 2020, compared with 29% in 2019.
The average cost of funds in 2020 was 0.51%, a decrease of 61 basis points from 1.12% in 2019. The decrease in the average cost of funds primarily reflected a 150 basis points reduction to the target federal funds rate in March 2020. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits decreased 78 basis points to 0.69% in 2020, from 1.47% in 2019. Other sources of funding included in the calculation of the average cost of funds primarily consist of long-term debt, FHLB advances, repurchase agreements, and short-term borrowings.
The Company utilizes various tools to manage interest rate risk. Refer to the “Interest Rate Risk Management” section of Item 7. MD&A - Risk Management - Market Risk Management for details.
The following table presents the interest spread, net interest margin, average balances, interest income and expense, and the average yield/rate by asset and liability component in 2020, 2019 and 2018:
(1)Average balances of resale and repurchase agreements are reported net, pursuant to ASC 210-20-45-11, Balance Sheet Offsetting: Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Agreements. The weighted-average yields of gross resale agreements were 1.94%, 2.66% and 2.63% for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The weighted-average interest rates of gross repurchase agreements were 3.25%, 4.74% and 4.46% for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
(2)Yields on tax-exempt securities are not presented on a tax-equivalent basis.
(3)Includes the amortization of premiums on debt securities of $33.9 million, $10.9 million and $16.1 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
(4)Average balances include nonperforming loans and loans held-for-sale.
(5)Loans include the accretion of net deferred loan fees, unearned fees and amortization of premiums, which totaled $52.4 million, $36.8 million and $39.2 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
(6)Average balance of deposits for 2018 includes average deposits held-for-sale related to the sale of DCB branches.
The following table summarizes the extent to which changes in (1) interest rates; and (2) average interest-earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities affected the Company’s net interest income for the periods presented. The total change for each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities is segmented into changes attributable to variations in volume and yield/rate. Changes that are not solely due to either volume or yield/rate are allocated proportionally based on the absolute value of the change related to average volume and average rate.
Noninterest Income
The following table presents the components of noninterest income for the periods indicated:
Noninterest income comprised 15% and 13% of total revenue in 2020 and 2019, respectively. 2020 noninterest income was $235.5 million, an increase of $13.3 million or 6%, compared with $222.2 million in 2019. This increase was primarily due to increases in lending fees, deposit account fees and gains on sales of AFS debt securities, partially offset by decreases in interest rate contracts and other derivative income, and other investment income.
Lending fees were $74.8 million in 2020, an increase of $11.1 million or 18%, compared with $63.7 million in 2019. This increase was primarily due to valuation gains on warrants received as part of lending relationships and the subsequent exercise of warrants during the fourth quarter of 2020.
Deposit account fees were $48.1 million in 2020, an increase of $9.5 million or 25%, compared with $38.6 million in 2019. This increase was primarily due to an increase in customer-driven transactions.
Interest rate contracts and other derivative income was $31.7 million in 2020, a decrease of $8.2 million or 21%, compared with $39.9 million in 2019. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of negative credit valuation adjustments, which reflected higher loss probabilities for borrowers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as a decline in customer interest rate swap transactions.
Gains on sales of AFS debt securities were $12.3 million in 2020, an increase of $8.4 million or 213%, compared with $3.9 million in 2019. This increase primarily reflected gains recorded from $131.6 million in sales of municipal bonds during the second quarter of 2020.
Other investment income was $10.6 million in 2020, a decrease of $7.5 million or 41%, compared with $18.1 million in 2019. This decrease was due to reduced earnings from CRA tax credit investments accounted for under the equity method, and decreased distributions from investments in qualified affordable housing partnerships.
Noninterest Expense
The following table presents the components of noninterest expense for the periods indicated:
(1)Refer to Item 7. MD&A - Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures in this Form 10-K for the detailed calculation of GAAP and non-GAAP efficiency ratios.
2020 noninterest expense was $716.3 million, a decrease of $31.2 million or 4%, compared with $747.5 million in 2019. This decrease was primarily due to decreases in amortization of tax credit and other investments, and other operating expense, partially offset by repurchase agreements’ extinguishment cost.
Amortization of tax credit and other investments was $70.1 million in 2020, a decrease of $28.3 million or 29%, compared with $98.4 million in 2019. This year-over-year change was primarily due to the recognition pattern of production and renewable energy tax credit investments placed in service; $10.7 million of recoveries recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to DC Solar tax credit investments, and lower OTTI charges. In 2020, there were $5.2 million of OTTI charges related to three historic tax credit investments and a CRA investment. In comparison, during 2019, there were $7.6 million of OTTI charges related to five historic tax credit investments and a CRA investment, as well as $5.4 million of net OTTI charges related to DC Solar tax credit investments.
Other operating expense primarily consists of telecommunications and postage, loan related expenses, marketing, other real estate owned expense (“OREO”), charitable contributions, travel, and other miscellaneous expense categories. Other operating expense was $79.5 million in 2020, a decrease of $12.7 million or 14%, compared with $92.2 million in 2019. This decrease was largely driven by lower travel and marketing expenses, partially offset by a write-down on OREO.
In the second quarter of 2020, the Company prepaid $150.0 million of repurchase agreements and incurred a debt extinguishment cost of $8.7 million. No such expense was incurred in 2019.
Efficiency ratio, calculated as noninterest expense divided by total revenue, was 44.42% and 44.23% in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Non-GAAP efficiency ratio, adjusted for the amortization of tax credit and other investments, the amortization of core deposit intangibles, and repurchase agreements’ extinguishment cost (where applicable), was 39.30% in 2020, an increase of 116 basis points from 38.14% in 2019. For additional detail, see the reconciliations of non-GAAP measures presented under Item 7. MD&A - Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures in this Form 10-K.
Income Taxes
2020 income tax expense was $118.0 million, and the effective tax rate was 17.2%, compared with 2019 income tax expense of $169.9 million, and an effective tax rate of 20.1%. 2020 income tax expense included $5.1 million in uncertain tax position related to the Company’s investment in DC Solar. The higher effective tax rate in 2019 was primarily due to $30.1 million of additional income tax expense recorded to reverse certain previously claimed tax credits related to the Company’s investment in DC Solar.
Management regularly reviews the Company’s tax positions and deferred tax balances. Factors considered in this analysis include the Company’s ability to generate future taxable income, implement tax-planning strategies (as defined in ASC 740, Income Taxes) and utilize taxable income from prior carryback years (if such carryback is permitted under the applicable tax law), as well as future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability approach, the objective of which is to establish deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company’s assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized and settled. Net deferred tax assets increased $57.3 million or 53.8% to $163.8 million as of December 31, 2020, compared with $106.5 million as of December 31, 2019. This increase was mainly due to an increase in allowance for credit losses due to the Company’s CECL adoption, partially offset by an increase in deferred tax liabilities arising from net unrealized loss on securities. For additional details on the components of net deferred tax assets, see Note 11 - Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.
A valuation allowance is used, as needed, to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more-likely-than-not to be realized. To determine whether a valuation allowance is needed, the Company considers evidence such as the Company’s ability to generate future taxable income, implement tax-planning strategies (as defined in ASC 740, Income Taxes), and utilize taxable income from prior carryback years (if such carryback is permitted under the applicable tax law), as well as future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. The Company expects to have sufficient taxable income in future years to fully realize its deferred tax assets. The Company also performed an overall assessment by weighing all positive evidence against all negative evidence, and concluded that it is more-likely-than-not that all of the benefits of the deferred tax assets will be realized, with the exception of the deferred tax assets related to certain state net operating losses (“NOL”) carryforwards. As of December 31, 2020, management released $21 thousand of valuation allowance provided as of December 31, 2019, which related to the state NOL carryforwards. No additional valuation allowance was recorded as of December 31, 2020. For additional details on the components of net deferred tax assets, see Note 11 - Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.
Impact of Investment in DC Solar Tax Credit Funds
The Company invested in four solar energy tax credit funds in the years 2014, 2015, 2017 and 2018 as a limited member. These tax credit funds engaged in the acquisition and leasing of mobile solar generators through DC Solar entities. The Company’s investments in the DC Solar tax credit funds qualified for federal energy tax credit under Section 48 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Company also received a “should” level legal opinion from an external law firm supporting the legal structure of the investments for tax credit purposes. These investments were recorded in Investments in tax credit and other investments, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and were accounted for under the equity method of accounting. DC Solar had its assets frozen in December 2018 and filed for bankruptcy protection in February 2019. In February 2019, an affidavit from the Federal Bureau of Investigation special agent stated that DC Solar was operating a fraudulent “Ponzi-like scheme” and that the majority of the mobile solar generators sold to investors and managed by DC Solar, as well as the majority of the related lease revenues claimed to have been received by DC Solar might not have existed. In January 2020, the owners of DC Solar pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering in a Ponzi scheme related to DC Solar.
During 2019, the Company fully wrote off the remainder of its tax credit investments related to DC Solar, recorded a $7.0 million OTTI charge and a subsequent $1.6 million recovery. During 2020, the Company further recorded $10.7 million in recoveries, of which $1.1 million is recorded as an impairment recovery. The recoveries were recorded in Amortization of tax credit and other investments, net on the Consolidated Statement of Income. There were no balances in Accrued expenses and other liabilities - Unfunded commitments related to DC Solar as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. More discussion on the Company’s impairment evaluation and monitoring process of tax credit investments is provided in Note 2 - Fair Value Measurement and Fair Value of Financial Instruments to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.
ASC 740-10-25-6 states in part, that an entity shall initially recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more-likely-than-not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination. The term “more-likely-than-not” means a likelihood of more than 50 percent; the terms “examined” and “upon examination” include resolution of the related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The level of evidence that is necessary and appropriate to support the technical merits of a tax position is subject to judgment and depends on available information as of the balance sheet date. The Company received a “should” level legal opinion from an external law firm supporting the legal structure of these investments for tax credit purposes. A subsequent measurement of a tax position is based on management’s best judgment given the facts, circumstances and information available at the latest quarterly reporting date. A change in judgment that results in a subsequent derecognition or change in measurement of a tax position is recognized as a discrete item in the period in which the change occurs.
Investors in DC Solar funds, including the Company, received tax credits for making renewable energy investments. Between 2014 and 2018, the Company had invested in four DC Solar energy tax credit funds and claimed tax credits of approximately $53.9 million, partially reduced by a deferred tax liability of $5.7 million related to the 50% tax basis reduction, for a net impact of $48.2 million to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
In 2019, the Company, in coordination with other fund investors, engaged an unaffiliated third-party inventory firm to investigate the actual number of mobile solar generators in existence. Based on the inventory report, none of the mobile service generators that had been purchased by the Company’s 2017 and 2018 tax credit funds were found. On the other hand, a vast majority of the mobile solar generators purchased by the Company’s 2014 and 2015 tax credit funds were found. In 2019, the Company reversed $33.6 million out of $53.9 million in previously claimed tax credits, and $3.5 million out of $5.7 million deferred tax liability, resulting in $30.1 million of additional income tax expense. Based on management’s best judgments regarding the future settlement of the related tax positions with the IRS, the Company recorded $5.1 million in uncertain tax position related to its investments in DC Solar in 2020. The Company’s investigation related to this matter is ongoing. For additional information on the risks surrounding the Company’s investments in tax-advantaged projects, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Form 10-K.
Operating Segment Results
The Company organizes its operations into three reportable operating segments: (1) Consumer and Business Banking; (2) Commercial Banking; and (3) Other. These segments are defined by the type of customers served and the related products and services provided. The segments reflect how financial information is currently evaluated by management. For additional description of the Company’s internal management reporting process, including the segment cost allocation methodology, see Note 18 - Business Segments to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.
Segment net interest income represents the difference between actual interest earned on assets and interest incurred on liabilities of the segment, adjusted for funding charges or credits through the Company’s internal funds transfer pricing (“FTP”) process. The process was effective in the current market conditions as of December 31, 2020.
The following tables present the results by operating segment for the periods indicated:
Consumer and Business Banking
The Consumer and Business Banking segment primarily provides financial products and services to consumer and commercial customers through the Company’s domestic branch network. This segment offers consumer and commercial deposits, mortgage and home equity loans, and other products and services. It also originates commercial loans for small- and medium-sized enterprises. Other products and services provided by this segment include wealth management, treasury management and foreign exchange services. The integration of digital channels and our brick and mortar channels has been a priority for the Bank. The Company is developing a digital consumer banking platform to enhance the customer user experience and offer a full suite of banking services. Customer adoption of the digital banking application is in progress, and has contributed to growth in segment fee income and deposit growth in 2020.
The following table presents additional financial information for the Consumer and Business Banking segment for the periods indicated:
Segment net income decreased $96.2 million, or 34%, to $187.9 million in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to lower net interest income before provision for credit losses.
Net interest income before provision for credit losses decreased $165.7 million, or 24%, to $530.8 million in 2020, primarily reflecting a lower credit assigned to deposits under the FTP system in a near-zero interest environment. Noninterest income increased $9.2 million, or 16%, to $67.1 million in 2020, primarily driven by higher deposit account fees due to higher customer-driven transactions.
The provision for credit losses decreased $10.3 million, to $3.9 million in 2020, primarily driven by the methodology change to credit loss estimates under CECL. The loan portfolio in the Consumer and Business Banking segment is predominantly made up of residential mortgage loans, with a long history of low loan losses.
Noninterest expense decreased $11.3 million, or 3%, to $331.8 million in 2020, primarily due to lower allocated corporate overhead expense.
Commercial Banking
The Commercial Banking segment primarily generates commercial loans and deposits. Commercial loan products include commercial business loans and lines of credit, trade finance loans and letters of credit, CRE loans, construction and land lending, affordable housing loans and letters of credit, asset-based lending, and equipment financing. Commercial deposit products and other financial services include treasury management, foreign exchange services, and interest rate and commodity risk hedging.
The following table present additional financial information for Commercial Banking for the periods indicated:
Segment net income decreased $47.5 million, or 15%, to $266.3 million in 2020 compared with 2019, reflecting a higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher net interest income before provision for credit losses.
Net interest income before provision for credit losses increased $54.9 million, or 8%, to $706.3 million in 2020, primarily driven by lower FTP charges assessed for loans, partially offset by lower interest income earned on loans due to the lower interest rate environment. Noninterest income increased $4.7 million, or 4%, to $139.4 million in 2020, primarily driven by higher lending fees, partially offset by lower interest rate contracts and other derivative income.
The provision for credit losses increased $122.3 million, to $206.8 million in 2020, primarily due to deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and outlook in the first half of 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The loan portfolio in the Commercial Banking segment primarily consists of commercial and CRE loans, the loss estimates for which are highly sensitive to changes in the macroeconomic conditions.
Noninterest expense increased $3.9 million in 2020, primarily due to a write-down on OREO.
Other
Centralized functions, including the corporate treasury activities of the Company and eliminations of inter-segment amounts, have been aggregated and included in the Other segment, which provides broad administrative support to the two core segments, namely the Consumer and Business Banking and the Commercial Banking segments.
The following table presents additional financial information for Other for the periods indicated:
Segment net income increased $37.5 million, or 49%, to $113.5 million in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily driven by lower noninterest expense and higher net interest income before provision for credit losses.
Net interest income before provision for credit losses increased $20.2 million, or 17%, to $140.1 million in 2020, primarily driven by lower deposit costs, partially offset by lower interest income on investments. Noninterest income remained relatively flat year-over-year.
Noninterest expense decreased $23.7 million, or 17%, to $117.6 million in 2020, reflecting lower amortization of tax credit and other investments.
The income tax expense or benefit in the Other segment consists of the remaining unallocated income tax expense or benefit after allocating income tax expense to the two core segments. Income tax expense is allocated to the Consumer and Business Banking and the Commercial Banking segments based on statutory income tax rates, applied to segment income before income taxes.
Balance Sheet Analysis
The following table presents a discussion of the significant changes between December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Selected Consolidated Balance Sheet Data
(1)On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments using the modified retrospective approach. The Company recorded $125.2 million increase to allowance for loan losses and $98.0 million after-tax decrease to opening retained earnings as of January 1, 2020.
As of December 31, 2020, total assets were $52.16 billion, an increase of $7.96 billion or 18% from $44.20 billion as of December 31, 2019, primarily due to loan growth, and an increase in purchases of AFS debt securities. The loan growth came from C&I lending, driven by originations of PPP loans, single-family residential and CRE.
As of December 31, 2020, total liabilities were $46.89 billion, an increase of $7.71 billion or 20% from $39.18 billion as of December 31, 2019, primarily due to deposit growth, driven by strong growth in noninterest-bearing deposits.
As of December 31, 2020, total stockholders’ equity was $5.27 billion, an increase of $251.6 million or 5% from $5.02 billion as of December 31, 2019, primarily due to $567.8 million in 2020 net income, partially offset by cash dividends declared on common stock and common stock repurchases.
Debt Securities
The Company maintains a portfolio of high quality and liquid debt securities with relatively short durations to minimize overall interest rate and liquidity risks. The Company’s debt securities provide:
•interest income for earnings and yield enhancement;
•availability for funding needs arising during the normal course of business;
•the ability to execute interest rate risk management strategies in response to changes in economic or market conditions; and
•collateral to support pledging agreements as required and/or to enhance the Company’s borrowing capacity.
Available-for-Sale Debt Securities
Debt securities classified as AFS are carried at their fair value with the corresponding changes in fair value recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, as a component of Stockholders’ equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The following table presents the distribution of the Company’s AFS debt securities portfolio by fair value and percentage of fair value as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and by credit ratings as of December 31, 2020:
(1)There were no securities of a single non-governmental agency issuer that exceeded 10% of stockholder’s equity as of both December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.
(2)Primarily based upon the lowest of the credit ratings issued by S&P, Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) or Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”). Rating percentages are allocated based on fair value.
The fair value of AFS debt securities totaled $5.54 billion as of December 31, 2020, an increase of $2.23 billion or 67% from $3.32 billion as of December 31, 2019. The largest net change came from U.S. government agency and U.S. government-sponsored enterprise mortgage-backed securities, which increased $1.21 billion, followed by corporate debt securities, which increased $394.8 million, and non-agency mortgage-backed securities, which increased $394.5 million.
The Company’s debt securities portfolio had an effective duration of 4.2 years as of December 31, 2020 which increased from 3.1 years as of December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in the target duration of securities purchases to achieve enhancement in portfolio yield. As of December 31, 2020, 88% of the carrying value of the Company’s debt securities portfolio was rated “AA-” or “Aa3” or higher by nationally recognized credit rating agencies, compared with 97% as of December 31, 2019. The decrease in higher-rated securities was primarily due to the strategic growth in non-agency securities within the portfolio mix. Credit ratings of BBB- or higher by S&P and Fitch, or Baa3 or higher by Moody’s, are considered investment grade.
The Company’s AFS debt securities are carried at fair value with noncredit-related unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in Other comprehensive income (loss) on the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Pre-tax net unrealized gain on AFS debt securities was $74.1 million as of December 31, 2020, a net improvement of $77.6 million from pre-tax net unrealized losses of $3.4 million as of December 31, 2019. This change was primarily due to a decrease in benchmark interest rates as of December 31, 2020. Gross unrealized losses on AFS debt securities totaled $22.5 million as of December 31, 2020, compared with $23.2 million as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had no intention to sell securities with unrealized losses and believed it is more-likely-than-not that it would not be required to sell such securities before recovery of their amortized costs.
Of the securities with gross unrealized losses, substantially all were rated investment grade as of both December 31, 2020 and 2019, as classified based upon the lowest of the credit ratings issued by S&P, Moody’s, or Fitch. The Company believes that the gross unrealized losses were due to non-credit related factors and the gross unrealized losses were primarily attributable to yield curve movement and widened spreads. The Company believes that the credit support levels of the AFS debt securities are strong and, based on current assessments and macroeconomic forecasts, expects that full contractual cash flows will be received, even if near term credit performance is impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
If a credit loss exists, the Company records an impairment related to credit losses through the allowance for credit losses with a corresponding Provision for credit losses on the Consolidated Statement of Income. There were no credit losses recognized in earnings for 2020 and no OTTI credit losses were recognized in earnings for 2019. The Company assesses individual securities for credit losses for each reporting period. For additional information of the Company’s accounting policies, valuation and composition, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 2 - Fair Value Measurement and Fair Value of Financial Instruments, and Note 4 - Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.
The following table presents the weighted-average yields and contractual maturity distribution, excluding periodic principal payments, of the Company’s AFS debt securities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Actual maturities of certain securities can differ from contractual maturities as the borrowers have the right to prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties. In addition, factors such as prepayments and interest rates may affect the yields on the carrying values of these securities.
(1)Weighted-average yields are computed based on amortized cost balances.
(2)Yields on tax-exempt securities are not presented on a tax-equivalent basis.
Loan Portfolio
The Company offers a broad range of financial products designed to meet the credit needs of its borrowers. The Company’s loan portfolio segments include commercial loans, which consist of C&I, CRE, multifamily residential, and construction and land loans; and consumer loans, which consist of single-family residential, home equity lines of credit (“HELOCs”) and other consumer loans. Total net loans, including loans held-for-sale, were $37.77 billion as of December 31, 2020, an increase of $3.35 billion or 10% from $34.42 billion as of December 31, 2019. This was primarily driven by increases of $1.48 billion or 12% in C&I loans, driven by PPP loan growth; $1.08 billion or 15% in single-family residential loans and $896.2 million or 9% in CRE loans. The composition of the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2020 was similar to the composition as of December 31, 2019.
The following table presents the composition of the Company’s total loan portfolio by loan type as of the periods indicated:
(1)On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13. Total loans include net deferred loan fees, unearned fees, unamortized premiums and unaccreted discounts of $(58.8) million, $(43.2) million, $(48.9) million, $(34.0) million and $1.2 million as of December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net origination fees related to PPP loans were $(12.7) million as of December 31, 2020.
(2)Includes $1.57 billion of PPP loans as of December 31, 2020.
(3)Includes $78.1 million of loans held-for-sale in Branch assets held-for-sale as of December 31, 2017.
Actions to Support Customers during the COVID-19 Pandemic
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company assisted customers by offering SBA PPP loans to help struggling businesses in our communities pay their employees and sustain their businesses, and by providing payment relief through various loan modification programs. For a summary of the loans that the Company has modified in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to Item 7. MD&A - Risk Management - Credit Risk Management in this Form 10-K.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately 6,200 SBA PPP loans outstanding with balances totaling $1.57 billion, which were included in the C&I portfolio. These loans carry an interest rate of 1%, and are 100% guaranteed by the SBA. The substantial majority of the Company’s PPP loans have a term of two years. Related to the PPP loans made in 2020, as of February 25 2021, the Company has submitted and received approval from the SBA for forgiveness approximately 2,700 PPP loan applications, totaling $341.9 million.
In January 2021, the Company began processing applications to provide additional support for those in need under the latest round of the SBA’s PPP in response to the CAA signed by the President on December 27, 2020. Year-to-date through February 25, 2021, the Company funded over 4,300 new PPP loans, totaling $700.3 million. For more information on PPP loans, refer to Item 7. MD&A - Overview - Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic - Paycheck Protection Program and Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Paycheck Protection Program to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.
Commercial
The commercial loan portfolio comprised 75% of total loans as of both December 31, 2020 and 2019. The Company actively monitors the commercial lending portfolio for elevated levels of credit risk and reviews credit exposures for sensitivity to changing economic conditions.
Commercial - Commercial and Industrial Loans. C&I loans totaled $13.63 billion, or 36% of total loans held-for-investment, as of December 31, 2020, compared with $12.15 billion, or 35% of total loans held-for-investment, as of December 31, 2019. Year-over-year, C&I loans increased $1.48 billion, or 12%, driven by PPP loan funding. The C&I loan portfolio includes loans and financing for businesses in a wide spectrum of industries, and includes asset-based lending, equipment financing and leasing, project-based finance, revolving lines of credit, SBA lending, structured finance, term loans and trade finance. The Company also has a portfolio of broadly syndicated C&I loans, primarily Term B, which totaled $892.1 million and $894.6 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The majority of the C&I loans have variable interest rates.
The C&I portfolio is well-diversified by industry. The Company monitors concentrations within the C&I loan portfolio by customer exposure and industry classification, setting diversification targets and exposure limits by industry or loan product. The following charts illustrate the industry mix within our C&I portfolio as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Oil & gas loans outstanding comprised 7% of C&I loans and 3% of total loans held-for-investment as of December 31, 2020, a decrease from 11% of C&I loans and 4% of total loans held-for-investment as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, oil & gas outstanding totaled $1.03 billion, a decrease of 23% from $1.33 billion as of December 31, 2019. Unfunded commitments to oil & gas borrowers were $312.1 million as of December 31, 2020, a decrease of 35% from $477.6 million as of December 31, 2019. Based on total commitment as of December 31, 2020, the oil & gas portfolio mix was: 59% exploration and production (“E&P”) companies, 34% midstream and downstream companies, and 7% oilfield services and other companies. In comparison, the oil & gas portfolio mix was: 64% E&P companies, 29% midstream and downstream companies, and 7% oilfield services and other companies as of December 31, 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic, fallen global commodity demand, and oil & gas price volatility have unfavorably impacted the credit risk of the oil & gas industry sector. Accordingly, the Company increased its allowance for loan loss coverage for oil & gas loans outstanding to 11% as of December 31, 2020, up from 5% as of December 31, 2019.
Commercial - Commercial Real Estate Loans. The CRE portfolio consists of income-producing CRE, multifamily residential, and construction and land loans. Total CRE loans outstanding were $14.81 billion, or 39% of total loans held-for-investment as of December 31, 2020, compared with $13.76 billion, or 40% of total loans held-for-investment as of December 31, 2019. Year-over-year, total CRE loans increased $1.04 billion, or 8%, primarily driven by growth in income-producing CRE.
The Company’s total CRE portfolio is granular and broadly diversified by property type, which serves to mitigate a portion of its geographical concentration in California. The average size of total CRE loans was $2.4 million and $2.1 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The following table summarizes the Company’s total CRE loans by property type as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:
The weighted-average loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratio of the total CRE portfolio was 51% as of December 31, 2020, compared with 50% as of December 31, 2019. The low weighted-average LTV ratio was consistent by CRE property type. Approximately 89% of total CRE loans had an LTV ratio of 65% or lower as of December 31, 2020, compared with 85% as of December 31, 2019. The consistency of the Company’s low LTV underwriting standards has historically resulted in lower credit losses for income-producing CRE and multifamily residential loans.
The following tables provide a summary of the Company’s income-producing CRE, multifamily residential, and construction and land loans by geography as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The distribution of the total CRE loan portfolio reflects the Company’s geographical footprint, which is concentrated in California:
(1)Loans net of ASC 310-30 discount.
Since 77% these loans were concentrated in California as of both December 31, 2020 and 2019, changes in California’s economy and real estate values could have a significant impact on the collectability of these loans and the required level of allowance for loan losses. For additional information related to the higher degree of risk from a downturn in real estate markets in California, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Form 10-K.
Commercial - Income-Producing Commercial Real Estate Loans. The Company focuses on providing financing to experienced real estate investors and developers who have moderate levels of leverage, many of whom are long-time customers of the Bank. Income-producing CRE loans totaled $11.17 billion, or 29% of total loans held-for-investment, as of December 31, 2020, compared with $10.28 billion, or 30% of total loans held-for-investment as of December 31, 2019. Interest rates on CRE loans may be fixed, variable or hybrid. Loans are underwritten with conservative standards for cash flows, debt service coverage and LTV.
Owner-occupied properties comprised 20% of the income-producing CRE loans as of both December 31, 2020 and 2019. The remainder were non-owner-occupied properties, where 50% or more of the debt service for the loan is typically provided by unaffiliated rental income from a third party.
Commercial - Multifamily Residential Loans. The multifamily residential loan portfolio is largely made up of loans secured by residential properties with five or more units. Multifamily residential loans totaled $3.03 billion as of December 31, 2020, compared with $2.86 billion as of December 31, 2019, and accounted for 8% of total loans held-for-investment as of both dates. The Company offers a variety of first lien mortgages, including fixed- and variable-rate loans, as well as hybrid loans with interest rates that adjust annually after an initial fixed rate period of three to seven years.
Commercial - Construction and Land Loans. Construction and land loans provide financing for a portfolio of projects diversified by real estate property type. These loans totaled $599.7 million December 31, 2020, compared with $628.5 million as of December 31, 2019, and accounted for 2% of total loans held-for-investment as of both dates. Construction loan exposure was made up of $554.7 million in loans outstanding, plus $288.2 million in unfunded commitments, as of December 31, 2020, compared with $558.2 million in loans outstanding, plus $351.4 million in unfunded commitments, as of December 31, 2019.
Consumer
The following tables summarize the Company’s single-family residential and HELOCs loan portfolios by geography as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:
(1)Loans net of ASC 310-30 discount.
Consumer - Single-Family Residential Loans. Single-family residential loans totaled $8.19 billion, or 21% of total loans held-for-investment, as of December 31, 2020, compared with $7.11 billion, or 20% of total loans held-for-investment as of December 31, 2019. Year-over-year, single-family residential loans increased $1.08 billion, or 15%, primarily driven by growth in New York and Southern California. The Company was in a first lien position for virtually all single-family residential loans as of both December 31, 2020 and 2019. Many of these loans are reduced documentation loans, for which a substantial down payment is required, resulting in a low LTV ratio at origination, typically 65% or less. These loans have historically experienced low delinquency and loss rates. The Company offers a variety of single-family residential first lien mortgage loan programs, including fixed- and variable-rate loans, as well as hybrid loans with interest rates that adjust annually after an initial fixed rate period.
Consumer - Home Equity Lines of Credit. HELOCs totaled $1.60 billion as of December 31, 2020, compared with $1.47 billion as of December 31, 2019, and accounted for 4% of total loans held-for-investment as of both dates. Year-over-year, HELOCs increased $128.9 million, or 9%, primarily driven by growth in California and Washington. The Company was in a first lien position for 86% and 84% of its HELOCs as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Many of the loans within this portfolio are reduced documentation loans, for which a substantial down payment is required, resulting in a low LTV ratio at origination, typically 60% or less. These loans have historically experienced low delinquency and loss rates. Virtually all of the Company’s HELOCs were variable-rate loans.
All originated commercial and consumer loans are subject to the Company’s underwriting guidelines and loan origination standards. Management believes that the Company’s underwriting criteria and procedures adequately consider the unique risks associated with these products. The Company conducts a variety of quality control procedures and periodic audits, including the review of lending and legal requirements, to ensure that the Company is compliant with these requirements.
The following table presents the contractual loan maturities by loan category and the contractual distribution of loans to changes in interest rates as of December 31, 2020:
Purchased Credit Deteriorated Loans
The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 using the prospective transition approach for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration that were previously classified as purchased credit impaired (“PCI”) and accounted for under ASC 310-30. On January 1, 2020, the amortized cost basis of the purchased credit deteriorated (“PCD”) loans was adjusted to reflect a $1.2 million addition of allowance for loan losses. The Company did not acquire any PCD loans during 2020. For additional details regarding PCD loans, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 6 - Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13, the carrying value of PCI loans totaled $222.9 million as of December 31, 2019.
Loans Held-for-Sale
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, loans held-for-sale totaled $1.8 million and $434 thousand, respectively, and consisted of single-family residential loans. At the time of commitment to originate or purchase a loan, a loan is determined to be held-for-investment if it is the Company’s intent to hold the loan to maturity or for the “foreseeable future,” subject to periodic reviews under the Company’s evaluation processes, including liquidity and credit risk management. If the Company subsequently changes its intent to hold certain loans, those loans are transferred from held-for-investment to held-for-sale at the lower of cost or fair value.
Sales of Originated Loans and Purchased Loans
All loans originated by the Company are underwritten pursuant to the Company’s policies and procedures. Although the Company’s primary focus is on directly originated loans, in certain circumstances, the Company also purchases loans and participates in loans with other banks. The Company also participates out interests in directly originated commercial loans to other financial institutions or sells loans in the normal course of business.
The following tables provide information on loan sales during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Refer to Note 6 - Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information on loan purchases and transfers.
(1)Net gains on sales of purchased loans were insignificant or none.
Foreign Outstandings
The Company’s overseas offices, which include the branch in Hong Kong and the subsidiary bank in China, are subject to the general risks inherent in conducting business in foreign countries, such as regulations, or economic and political uncertainties. In addition, the Company’s financial assets held in the Hong Kong branch and the subsidiary bank in China may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates or other factors. The Company’s country risk exposure is largely concentrated in China and Hong Kong. The following table presents the major financial assets held in the Company’s overseas offices as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:
(1)Primarily comprised of U.S. Treasury securities and foreign government bonds as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
(2)Primarily comprised of C&I loans as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
(3)Comprised of foreign government bonds as of December 31, 2020.
The following table presents the total revenue generated by the Company’s overseas offices in 2020, 2019 and 2018:
Capital
The Company maintains a strong capital base to support its anticipated asset growth, operating needs and credit risks, and to ensure that the Company and the Bank are compliant with all regulatory capital guidelines. The Company engages in regular capital planning processes on at least an annual basis to optimize the use of available capital and to appropriately plan for future capital needs, allocating capital to existing and future business activities. Furthermore, the Company conducts capital stress tests as part of its capital planning process. The stress tests enable the Company to assess the impact of adverse changes in the economy and interest rates on its capital base.
In March 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500.0 million of the Company’s common stock. This $500.0 million repurchase authorization was inclusive of the Company’s $100.0 million stock repurchase authorization previously outstanding. The Company determines the timing and amount of stock repurchases, based on its assessment of various factors, including prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital, liquidity and the economic environment. During the first quarter of 2020, the Company repurchased 4,471,682 shares at an average price of $32.64 per share and a total cost of $146.0 million. The Company did not repurchase any shares during the remainder of 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the total remaining available capital authorized for repurchase was $354.0 million.
The Company’s stockholders’ equity was $5.27 billion as of December 31, 2020, an increase of $251.6 million or 5% from $5.02 billion as of December 31, 2019. The increase in the Company’s stockholders’ equity was primarily due to 2020 net income of $567.8 million, partially offset by cash dividends declared of $158.8 million and share repurchases of $146.0 million. For other factors that contributed to the changes in stockholders’ equity, refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders’ Equity in this Form 10-K.
Book value was $37.22 per common share as of December 31, 2020, an increase of 8% from $34.46 per common share as of December 31, 2019. The Company paid cash dividends of $1.100 per common share in 2020, compared with $1.055 per share in 2019. In January 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors declared first quarter 2021 cash dividends of $0.330 per common share, which represents a 20% increase, or 5.5 cents per share, from the previous quarterly cash dividend of $0.275 per common share. The dividend was paid on February 23, 2021 to stockholders of record as of February 9, 2021.
Deposits and Other Sources of Funds
Deposits are the Company’s primary source of funding, the cost of which has a significant impact on the Company’s net interest income and net interest margin. Additional funding is provided by short- and long-term borrowings, and long-term debt. See Item 7. MD&A - Risk Management - Liquidity Risk Management - Liquidity in this Form 10-K for a discussion of the Company’s liquidity management. The following table summarizes the Company’s sources of funds as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Deposits
The Company offers a wide variety of deposit products to consumer and commercial customers. The Company’s deposit strategy is to grow and retain relationship-based deposits, which provide a stable and low-cost source of funding and liquidity to the Company.
Total deposits reached $44.86 billion as of December 31, 2020, an increase of $7.54 billion or 20% from $37.32 billion as of December 31, 2019. Deposit growth was well-diversified across our commercial sectors and branch network, including cross-border clients, partially offset by a reduction in higher-cost time deposits. The strongest growth was in noninterest-bearing demand deposits, which increased by $5.22 billion or 47% year-over-year. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits reached $16.30 billion, or 36% of total deposits, as of December 31, 2020, up from $11.08 billion, or 30% of total deposits, as of December 31, 2019. Additional information regarding the impact of deposits on net interest income, with a comparison of average deposit balances and rates, is provided in Item 7 - MD&A - Results of Operations - Net Interest Income in this Form 10-K.
Domestic time deposits of $100,000 or more totaled $7.17 billion, representing 16% of the total deposit portfolio as of December 31, 2020. The following table presents the maturity distribution of domestic time deposits of $100,000 or more:
As of December 31, 2020, foreign time deposits of $100,000 or more consisted of $312.4 million of deposits held in the Company’s branch in Hong Kong and $522.7 million of deposits held in the Company’s subsidiary bank in China. This compares with $611.0 million of deposits held in the Company’s branch in Hong Kong and $595.1 million of deposits held in the Company’s subsidiary bank in China as of December 31, 2019.
Other Sources of Funding
Short-term borrowings consist of borrowings entered into by the Company’s subsidiary, East West Bank (China) Limited, which amounted to $21.0 million as of December 31, 2020, compared with $28.7 million as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, short-term borrowings entered into by East West Bank (China) Limited had a fixed interest rate of 3.70% and mature in the first quarter of 2021.
The following table presents selected information for short-term borrowings as of the periods indicated:
FHLB advances were $652.6 million as of December 31, 2020, a decrease of $93.3 million or 13% from $745.9 million as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, FHLB advances had fixed and floating interest rates ranging from zero percent to 2.34% and remaining maturities between four months and 1.9 years. Of these, $405.0 million have a blended interest rate of 2.22% and mature in the second quarter of 2021.
Gross repurchase agreements totaled $300.0 million and $450.0 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease was due to the extinguishment of $150.0 million of repurchase agreements in the second quarter of 2020. Resale and repurchase agreements are reported net, pursuant to ASC 210-20-45-11, Balance Sheet Offsetting: Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Agreements. As of December 31, 2020, the Company did not have gross resale agreements that were eligible for netting pursuant to ASC 210-20-45-11. In comparison, net repurchase agreements totaled $200.0 million as of December 31, 2019, after netting gross repurchase agreements of $250.0 million against gross resale agreements. As of December 31, 2020, gross repurchase agreements had interest rates ranging from 2.46% to 2.48%, with original terms between 4.0 years and 8.5 years and remaining maturities between 2.6 years and 2.7 years.
Repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions and recorded as liabilities based on the values at which the assets are sold. As of December 31, 2020, the collateral for the repurchase agreements was comprised of U.S. government agency and U.S. government-sponsored enterprise mortgage-backed securities, and U.S. Treasury securities. To ensure the market value of the underlying collateral remains sufficient, the Company monitors the fair value of collateral pledged relative to the principal amounts borrowed under repurchase agreements. The Company manages liquidity risks related to the repurchase agreements by sourcing funds from a diverse group of counterparties, and entering into repurchase agreements with longer durations, when appropriate. For additional details, see Note 3 - Assets Purchased under Resale Agreements and Sold under Repurchase Agreements to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.
The Company uses long-term debt to provide funding to acquire interest-earning assets, and to enhance liquidity and regulatory capital adequacy. Long-term debt totaled $147.4 million and $147.1 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Long-term debt consists of junior subordinated debt, which qualifies as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes. The junior subordinated debt was issued in connection with the Company’s various pooled trust preferred securities offerings, as well as with common stock issued by the six wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company in conjunction with these offerings. The junior subordinated debt had a weighted-average interest rate of 2.26% and 3.98% during 2020 and 2019, respectively, with remaining maturities ranging between 13.9 years and 16.7 years as of December 31, 2020. In October 2020, the Company paid off the $1.43 billion in borrowing from the Federal Reserve PPPLF. This debt was included in long-term debt on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30 and September 30, 2020.
Regulatory Capital and Ratios
The federal banking agencies have risk-based capital adequacy guidelines intended to ensure that banking organizations maintain capital that is commensurate with the degree of risk associated with a banking organization’s operations. See Item 1. Business - Supervision and Regulation - Regulatory Capital Requirements in this Form 10-K for additional details.
The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020. The Company elected the phase-in option provided by regulatory guidance, which delays the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital for two years and phases the impact over three years. As a result, the effects of CECL on the Company’s and the Bank’s regulatory capital will be delayed through the year 2021, after which the effects will be phased-in over a three-year period from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. In April 2020, in recognition of CARES Act requirements, and to facilitate the use of the PPPLF, the U.S banking agencies issued an interim final rule that banking organizations may exclude from leverage and risk-based capital requirements any eligible assets sold or pledged to the Federal Reserve on a non-recourse basis as part of the PPPLF. In addition, under the CARES Act, loans originated by a banking organization under the PPP (whether or not sold or pledged in the PPPLF) will be risk-weighted at zero percent for regulatory capital purposes. Accordingly, the December 31, 2020 capital ratios exclude the impact of the increased allowance for loan losses due to CECL, and PPP loans are risk weighted at zero percent. In addition, the quarterly average PPP loan balances that were pledged as collateral to PPPLF was excluded from the Tier 1 leverage ratio.
The following table presents the Company’s and the Bank’s capital ratios as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 under the Basel III Capital Rules, and those required by regulatory agencies for capital adequacy and well-capitalized classification purposes:
(1)The Tier 1 leverage well-capitalized requirement applies only to the Bank since there is no Tier 1 leverage ratio component in the definition of a well-capitalized bank holding company.
(2)As of January 1, 2019, the 2.5% capital conservation buffer above the minimum capital ratios was required in order to avoid limitations on distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers.
The Company is committed to maintaining strong capital levels to assure the Company’s investors, customers and regulators that the Company and the Bank are financially sound. As of both December 31, 2020 and 2019, both the Company and the Bank continued to exceed all “well-capitalized” capital requirements and the required minimum capital requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules. Total risk-weighted assets were $38.41 billion as of December 31, 2020, an increase of $3.27 billion or 9% from $35.14 billion as of December 31, 2019. The increase in the risk-weighted assets was primarily due to loan growth.
Other Matters
LIBOR Transition
On July 27, 2017, the FCA, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it will no longer persuade or require banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The ARRC has proposed the SOFR as its preferred alternative rate for LIBOR. On November 30, 2020, LIBOR’s administrator, the IBA, in coordination with U.K. and U.S. regulators, announced the IBA’s intention to cease publication of the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on December 31, 2021, and the remaining USD LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on June 30, 2023. Banks are encouraged to cease entering new contracts that use USD LIBOR as a reference rate as soon as practicable by December 31, 2021.
Given LIBOR’s extensive use across financial markets, the transition away from LIBOR presents various risks and challenges to financial markets and institutions, including to the Company. A portion of the Company’s loans, derivatives, debt securities, resale agreements, FHLB advances, as well as junior subordinated debt and repurchase agreements are indexed to LIBOR and mature after 2021. The volume of the Company’s products that are indexed to LIBOR is significant and, if not sufficiently planned for, the discontinuation of LIBOR could result in financial, operational, legal, reputational or compliance risks to the Company.
Due to the uncertainty surrounding the future of LIBOR, the transition is anticipated to span several reporting periods through the end of 2021 and potentially into 2023 with the newly released LIBOR cessation timing. The Company has created a cross-functional team to manage the communication of the Company’s transition plans with both internal and external stakeholders and to ensure that the Company appropriately updates its business processes, analytical tools, information systems and contract language to minimize disruptions during and after the LIBOR transition. The Company has completed a review of LIBOR contracts maturing after 2021 and has begun taking steps to convert these contracts to alternative rates. For additional information related to the potential impact surrounding the transition from LIBOR on the Company’s business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Form 10-K.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations
In the course of the Company’s business, the Company may enter into or be a party to transactions that are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are considered to be off-balance sheet arrangements. Off-balance sheet arrangements are any contractual arrangements to which a nonconsolidated entity is a party and under which the Company has: (1) any obligation under a guarantee contract; (2) a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets; (3) any obligation under certain derivative instruments; or (4) any obligation under a material variable interest held by the Company in a nonconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company, or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with the Company.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Commitments to Extend Credit
As a financial service provider, the Company routinely enters into commitments to extend credit such as loan commitments, commercial letters of credit for foreign and domestic trade, standby letters of credit (“SBLCs”), and financial guarantees to meet the financing needs of our customers. Many of these commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. The credit policies used in underwriting loans to customers are also used to extend these commitments. Under some of these contractual agreements, the Company may also have liabilities contingent upon the occurrence of certain events. The Company’s liquidity sources have been, and are expected to be, sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its lending activities. Information about the Company’s loan commitments, commercial letters of credit and SBLCs is provided in Note 12 - Commitments, Contingencies and Related Party Transactions to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.
Guarantees
In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into various guarantee agreements in which the Company sells or securitizes loans with recourse. Under these guarantee arrangements, the Company is contingently obligated to repurchase the recourse component of the loans when the loans default. Additional information regarding guarantees is provided in Note 12 - Commitments, Contingencies and Related Party Transactions to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.
Contractual Obligations
The following table presents the Company’s significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations, along with the categories of payment dates as of December 31, 2020:
(1)Includes deposits with no defined maturity, such as noninterest-bearing demand, interest-bearing checking, money-market and savings accounts.
(2)Represents junior subordinated debt, which is subject to call options where early redemption requires appropriate notice.
(3)Represents the future interest obligations related to interest-bearing time deposits, FHLB, gross repurchase agreements, short-term borrowings and long-term debt in the normal course of business. These interest obligations assume no early debt redemption. The Company estimated variable interest rate payments using December 31, 2020 rates, which the company held constant until maturity.
Risk Management
Overview
In conducting its businesses, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks, some of which are inherent to the financial services industry and others of which are more specific to the Company’s businesses. The Company operates under a Board-approved ERM framework, which outlines the company-wide approach to risk management and oversight, and describes the structures and practices employed to manage the current and emerging risks inherent to the Company. The Company’s ERM program incorporates risk management throughout the organization in identifying, managing, monitoring, and reporting risks. It identifies the Company’s major risk categories as credit risk; liquidity risk; capital risk; market risk; operational risk; regulatory, compliance and legal risks; accounting and tax risks, and strategic and reputational risks.
The Board of Directors monitors the ERM program to ensure independent review and oversight of the Company’s risk appetite and control environment. The Risk Oversight Committee provides focused oversight of the Company’s identified enterprise risk categories on behalf of the full Board of Directors. Under the direction of the Risk Oversight Committee, management committees apply targeted strategies to reduce the risks to which the Company’s operations are exposed.
The Company’s ERM program is executed along the three lines of defense model, which provides for a consistent and standardized risk management control environment across the enterprise. The first line of defense is comprised of production, operational, and support units. The second line of defense is comprised of various risk management and control functions charged with monitoring and managing specific major risk categories and/or risk subcategories. The third line of defense is comprised of the Internal Audit function and Independent Asset Review. Internal Audit provides assurance and evaluates the effectiveness of risk management, control and governance processes as established by the Company. Internal Audit has organizational independence and objectivity, reporting directly to the Board’s Audit Committee. Further discussion and analysis of each major risk area are included in the following sub-sections of Risk Management.
Credit Risk Management
Credit risk is the risk that a borrower or counterparty will fail to perform according to the terms and conditions of a loan or investment and expose the Company to loss. Credit risk exists with many of the Company’s assets and exposures such as loans and certain derivatives. The majority of the Company’s credit risk is associated with lending activities.
The Risk Oversight Committee has primary oversight responsibility of identifying enterprise risk categories including credit risk. The Risk Oversight Committee monitors management’s assessment of asset quality and credit risk trends, credit quality administration and underwriting standards; as well as portfolio credit risk management strategies and processes, such as diversification and liquidity; all of which enable management to control credit risk. At the management level, the Credit Risk Management Committee has primary oversight responsibility for credit risk. The Senior Credit Supervision function manages credit policy and provides the resources to manage the line of business transactional credit risk, assuring that all exposure is risk-rated according to the requirements of the credit risk rating policy. The Senior Credit Supervision function evaluates and reports the overall credit risk exposure to senior management and the Risk Oversight Committee. The Independent Asset Review function supports a strong credit risk management culture by providing independent and objective assessment of underwriting and documentation quality, reporting directly to the Board’s Risk Oversight Committee. A key focus of our credit risk management is adherence to a well-controlled underwriting process.
The Company assesses overall credit quality performance of the loan held-for-investment portfolio through an integrated analysis of specific performance ratios. This approach forms the basis of the discussion in the sections immediately following: Nonperforming Assets, TDRs and Allowance for Credit Losses.
Nonperforming Assets
Nonperforming assets are comprised of nonaccrual loans, OREO, and other nonperforming assets. Other nonperforming assets and OREO are repossessed assets and properties, respectively, acquired through foreclosure, or through full or partial satisfaction of loans held-for-investment. Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days past due or when the full collection of principal or interest becomes uncertain regardless of the length of past due status. Collectability is generally assessed based on economic and business conditions, the borrower’s financial condition and the adequacy of collateral, if any. For additional details regarding the Company’s nonaccrual loan policy, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Loans Held-for-Investment to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.
The following table presents information regarding nonperforming assets as of the periods indicated:
Period-over-period changes to nonaccrual loans represent loans that are placed on nonaccrual status in accordance with the Company’s accounting policy, offset by reductions from loans that are repaid, paid down, charged off, sold, foreclosed, or no longer classified as nonaccrual as a result of continued performance and improvement in the borrowers’ financial condition and loan repayment capabilities. Nonaccrual loans were $215.2 million or 0.56% of loans held-for-investments, as of December 31, 2020, compared with $120.2 million or 0.35% of loans held-for-investments, as of December 31, 2019. Year-over-year, nonaccrual loans increased by $94.9 million or 79%, primarily driven by inflows of C&I oil & gas loans and CRE loans to nonaccrual status, partially offset by charge-offs and sales of C&I loans, as well as a transfer of a CRE loan to OREO. C&I nonaccrual loans were 62% of total nonaccrual loans as of both December 31, 2020 and 2019. As of December 31, 2020, $106.4 million, or 49% of nonaccrual loans were less than 90 days delinquent. In comparison, $35.6 million, or 30% of nonaccrual loans were less than 90 days delinquent as of December 31, 2019.
OREO was $15.8 million as of December 31, 2020, an increase of $15.7 million from $125 thousand as of December 31, 2019 due to the Company taking possession of one retail CRE property located in Southern California.

Troubled Debt Restructurings
TDRs are loans for which contractual terms have been modified by the Company for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower’s financial difficulties, and for which a concession to the borrower was granted that the Company would not otherwise consider. The Company’s loan modifications are handled on a case-by-case basis and are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan collectability and meet the borrower’s financial needs. The following table presents the performing and nonperforming TDRs by loan portfolio segments as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The allowance for loan losses for TDRs was $10.3 million as of December 31, 2020 and $400 thousand as of December 31, 2019.
Performing TDRs were $143.2 million as of December 31, 2020, an increase of $65.3 million or 84% from $77.9 million as of December 31, 2019. This increase reflected $68.4 million in newly designated C&I TDRs, primarily from general manufacturing & wholesale, and oil & gas sectors, and $21.2 million in newly designated CRE TDRs. Over 85% of the performing TDRs were current as of both December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Nonperforming TDRs were $71.9 million as of December 31, 2020, an increase of $17.4 million or 32% from $54.6 million as of December 31, 2019. This increase primarily reflected additions to nonperforming TDR, from C&I oil & gas loans, partially offset by a sale of one C&I loan and a transfer of one CRE loan to OREO.
Existing TDRs that were subsequently modified in response to the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be classified as TDRs. As of December 31, 2020, there were four TDRs totaling $11.8 million that were provided subsequent modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Loan Modifications Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic
Beginning in late March 2020, the Company granted various commercial and consumer loan accommodation programs, predominantly in the form of payment deferrals, to provide relief to borrowers experiencing financial hardship due to COVID-19 pandemic. Section 4013 of the CARES Act, as amended by the CAA, permits a financial institution to elect to temporarily suspend TDR accounting under ASC Subtopic 310-40 in certain circumstances. To be eligible under Section 4013 of the CARES Act, a loan modification must be (1) related to the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) executed on a loan that was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019; and (3) executed between March 1, 2020, and the earlier of (a) 60 days after the date of termination of the federal National Emergency or (b) January 1, 2022. The federal banking regulators, in consultation with the FASB, issued the Interagency Statement on April 7, 2020 confirming that, for loans not subject to Section 4013 of the CARES Act, short-term modifications (i.e. six months or less) made on a good faith basis in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to borrowers who were current as of the implementation date of a loan modification, or modifications granted under government mandated modification programs, are not considered as TDRs under ASC Subtopic 310-40. See additional information in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Troubled Debt Restructurings in this Form 10-K.
The delinquency aging of loans modified related to the COVID-19 pandemic is frozen at the time of the modification. As a result, the recognition of delinquent loans, nonaccrual status, and loan net charge-offs may be delayed for certain borrowers who are enrolled in these loan modification programs, which would have otherwise moved into past due or nonaccrual status. Interest income continues to be recognized over the accommodation period.
The following table provides a summary of the COVID-19 pandemic-related loan modifications that remained under their modified terms as of December 31, 2020. The amounts represent loan modifications that meet the criteria under Section 4013 of the CARES Act, as amended by the CAA, or Interagency Statement and therefore are not considered TDRs. The amounts exclude loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic made on existing TDRs. A loan is counted once in the table regardless of the number of accommodations received.
The above table excludes loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic that did not meet the criteria provided under Section 4013 of the CARES Act, as amended by the CAA, or the Interagency Statement, and that were evaluated and deemed to not be classified as TDRs. The determination to not consider a modification a TDR was made on the premise that the amount of the delayed restructured payments was insignificant relative to the unpaid principal or collateral value of the loan, resulting in an insignificant shortfall in the contractual amount due from the borrower, or an insignificant delay in the timing of the restructured payment period relative to the payment frequency under the loan’s original contractual maturity or expected duration. The above table also excludes loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic made on existing TDRs.
The COVID-19 pandemic-related loan modifications primarily consisted of payment deferrals three months or less in duration, in the form of either principal payment deferrals, where the borrower was still paying interest, or full principal and interest payment deferrals. Other forbearance programs consisted of interest rate concessions. The deferred payments for commercial loans are either repaid at contractual maturity, or spread over the remaining contractual term of the loan. The deferred payments for consumer loans are repaid under defined payment plans between six to 36 months after the deferral period ends, or the loan term is extended beyond the contractual maturity by the number of payments deferred.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $965.8 million of loans under payment deferral and forbearance programs, a decrease of $602.1 million or 38% from $1.57 billion as of September 30, 2020, and a decrease of $1.86 billion or 66% from $2.82 billion as of June 30, 2020. The CRE COVID-19 loan modifications outstanding as of December 31, 2020 were primarily concentrated in the hotel and retail CRE portfolios. Of the CRE COVID-19 loan modifications, 73% were making partial payments, generally as interest payments, while 27% were under full payment deferral. Modifications are considered to have exited active accommodation after the borrower exited the modification program or after the modification period expired. The loans with expired COVID-19 modifications were predominantly current as of December 31, 2020. The Company monitors the delinquency status of loans exiting relief programs on an ongoing basis. The impacts of the COVID-19 loan modifications were considered in determination of the allowance for credit loss.
Allowance for Credit Losses
Effective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses that requires the measurement of the allowance for credit losses to be based on management’s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the Company’s relevant financial assets. The allowance for credit losses estimate uses various models and estimation techniques based on historical loss experience, current borrower characteristics, current conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and other relevant factors. On January 1, 2020, the adoption of the new accounting standard increased the allowance for loan losses by $125.2 million, and the allowance for unfunded credit commitments by $10.5 million. Corresponding with the increase to the allowance due the adoption of ASU 2016-13, there was an after-tax decrease to opening retained earnings of $98.0 million.
The Company’s methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses includes an estimate of expected credit losses on a collective basis for loan groups with similar risk characteristics, and a specific allowance for loans that are individually evaluated. For collectively evaluated loans, the Company uses quantitative models to forecast expected credit losses and these models consider historical credit loss experience, current market and economic conditions, and forecasted changes in market and economic conditions, if such forecasts are considered reasonable and supportable. The Company also considers qualitative factors in determining the allowance for loan losses. Qualitative adjustments are used to capture characteristics in the portfolio that impact expected credit losses, and which are not otherwise fully captured within the Company’s expected credit loss models.
In addition to the allowance for loan losses, the Company maintains an allowance for unfunded credit commitments. The Company has three general areas for which it provides the allowance for unfunded credit commitments: recourse obligations for loans sold, letters of credit, and unfunded lending commitments. The Company’s methodology for determining the allowance for unfunded lending commitments calculation uses the lifetime loss rates of the on-balance sheet commitment. Recourse obligations for loans sold and letters of credit use the weighted loss rates for the segment of the individual credit.
The Company employs a disciplined process and methodology to establish its allowance for loan losses each quarter. The process for estimating the allowance for loan losses takes into consideration many factors, including historical and forecasted loan loss trends, loan-level credit quality ratings and loan-specific risk characteristics. In addition to regular quarterly reviews of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, the Company performs ongoing assessments of the risks inherent in the loan portfolio. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses is complex and requires judgement by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
The Company is committed to maintaining the allowance for credit losses at a level that is commensurate with the estimated inherent losses in the loan portfolio, including unfunded credit facilities. While the Company believes that the allowance for credit losses was appropriate as of December 31, 2020, future allowance levels may increase or decrease based on a variety of factors, including but not limited to, accounting standard and regulatory changes, loan growth, portfolio performance and general economic conditions. For a description of the policies, methodologies and judgements used to determine the allowance for credit losses, see Item 7. MD&A - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates, Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 6 - Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.
The following table presents an allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan portfolio segments as of the periods indicated:
The allowance for loan losses was $620.0 million as of December 31, 2020, an increase of $261.7 million from $358.3 million as of December 31, 2019. This increase to allowance reflects a deterioration in the macroeconomic conditions and outlook as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the adoption of CECL. The change is comprised of the following:
•a net $125.2 million increase due to the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020,
•subsequent to January 1, 2020, a net $150.1 million addition in the allowance against commercial loans, predominantly in C&I and CRE income-producing, and
•a net $13.6 million reduction in the allowance against consumer loans, predominantly in single-family residential and other consumer.
The Company considers multiple economic scenarios to develop the estimate of the allowance for loans. The scenarios consist of a base forecast representing management's view of the most likely outcome, combined with downside and upside scenarios reflecting possible worsening or improving economic conditions. The base forecast assumed near-term economic stress and the economy beginning to recover in 2021, based on anticipated economic stimulus from the government and the Federal Reserve maintaining its target fed funds range. The downside scenario assumed more sustained adverse economic impact resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, as compared to the base forecast. The upside scenario assumed a more optimistic view for the economic recovery, as compared with the base forecast, including travel, business and other restrictions ending sooner, and improved consumer optimism based on more rapid distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. The Company applies management judgment to add qualitative factors for the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on industry and CRE sectors that are affected by the pandemic.
As of December 31, 2020, PPP loans outstanding were $1.57 billion. As these loans are 100% guaranteed by SBA, the Company expects these loans will have zero expected loss. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2020, these loans had no related allowance for loan losses.
2020 net charge-offs were $63.2 million or 0.17% of average loans-held-for-investment, compared with $52.8 million, or 0.16% of average loan held-for-investment, in 2019. The year-over-year change in net loan charge-offs was largely due to higher CRE charge-offs, compared with recoveries in 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact the credit quality of our loan portfolio. Although the potential impacts were considered in our allowance for loan losses, payment deferral activities instituted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic could delay the recognition of some loan charge-offs.
The following tables summarize activity in the allowance for loan losses for loans by loan portfolio segments for the periods indicated:
The following table summarizes activity in the allowance for unfunded credit commitments for the periods indicated:
The allowance for unfunded credit commitments was $33.6 million as of December 31, 2020, compared with $11.2 million as of December 31, 2019. The Company believes the allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was adequate.
Upon adoption of ASU 2016-13, allowance for loan losses for PCD loans is determined using the same methodology as other loans held-for-investment. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had no allowance for loan losses against $222.9 million of PCI loans.
Liquidity Risk Management
Liquidity
Liquidity is a financial institution’s capacity to meet its deposit and other counterparties’ obligations as they come due, or to obtain adequate funding at a reasonable cost to meet those obligations. The objective of liquidity management is to manage the potential mismatch of asset and liability cash flows. Maintaining an adequate level of liquidity depends on the institution’s ability to efficiently meet both expected and unexpected cash flows, and collateral needs without adversely affecting daily operations or the financial condition of the institution. To achieve this objective, the Company analyzes its liquidity risk, maintains readily available liquid assets and utilizes diverse funding sources including its stable core deposit base.
The Board of Directors’ Risk Oversight Committee has primary oversight responsibility. At the management level, the Company’s Asset/Liability Committee (“ALCO”) establishes the liquidity guidelines that govern the day-to-day active management of the Company’s liquidity position by requiring sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover potential funding requirements and avoid over-dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. These guidelines are established and monitored for both the Bank and for East West, the parent company, on a stand-alone basis to ensure that the Company is a source of strength for its subsidiaries. The ALCO regularly monitors the Company’s liquidity status and related management processes, providing regular reports to the Board of Directors. The Company’s liquidity management practices have been effective under normal operating and stressed market conditions such as the financial stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Liquidity Risk - Liquidity Sources The Company’s primary source of funding is from deposits generated by its banking business, which are relatively stable and low-cost. Total deposits amounted to $44.86 billion as of December 31, 2020, compared with $37.32 billion as of December 31, 2019. The Company’s loan-to-deposit ratio was 86% December 31, 2020, compared with 93% as of December 31, 2019.
In addition to deposits, the Company has access to various sources of wholesale funding, as well as borrowing capacity at the FHLB and FRBSF to sustain an adequate liquid asset portfolio, meet daily cash demands and allow management flexibility to execute its business strategy. Economic conditions and the stability of capital markets impact the Company’s access to and the cost of wholesale financing. The Company’s access to capital markets is also affected by the ratings received from various credit rating agencies. See Item 7 - MD&A - Balance Sheet Analysis - Deposits and Other Sources of Funds in this Form 10-K for further detail related to the Company’s funding sources.
The Company maintains liquidity in the form of cash and cash equivalents, interest-bearing deposits with banks, short-term resale agreements, and unencumbered high-quality and liquid AFS debt securities. The following table presents the Company’s liquid assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Unencumbered liquid assets totaled $10.68 billion as of December 31, 2020, compared with $6.70 billion as of December 31, 2019. AFS debt securities included as part of liquidity sources consists of high quality and liquid securities with relatively short durations to minimize overall interest rate and liquidity risks. The Company believes these AFS debt securities provide quick sources of liquidity to obtain financing, regardless of market conditions, through sale or pledging.
As a means to generate incremental liquidity, the Company maintains available borrowing capacity under secured borrowing lines with the FHLB and FRBSF, unsecured federal funds lines of credit with various correspondent banks, and several master repurchase agreements with major brokerage companies. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had total available borrowing capacity of $17.04 billion. The Company believes that its liquidity sources are sufficient to meet all reasonably foreseeable short-term needs over the next 12 months
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had available borrowing capacity of $6.33 billion with the FHLB and $5.54 billion with the FRBSF. Unencumbered loans and/or securities were pledged to the FHLB and the FRBSF discount window as collateral. The Company has established operational procedures to enable borrowing against these assets, including regular monitoring of the total pool of loans and securities eligible as collateral. Eligibility of collateral is defined in guidelines from the FHLB and FRBSF and is subject to change at their discretion. The Bank’s unsecured federal funds lines of credit with correspondent banks, subject to availability, totaled $976.0 million as of December 31, 2020. Estimated borrowing capacity from unpledged AFS debt securities totaled $4.18 billion as of December 31, 2020.
In connection with the Company’s participation in the PPP under the CARES Act, the Company has the ability to pledge loans originated under the SBA’s PPP program to the PPPLF, and receive term funding matching the balance and term of the pledged loans. In the second quarter of 2020, the Company drew down $1.44 billion from the Federal Reserve PPPLF and pledged the same amount in PPP loans as collateral. The Company paid off the outstanding amounts under the PPPLF in full during the fourth quarter of 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the Company did not have any outstanding balance under the PPPLF.
Liquidity Risk - Liquidity for East West In addition to bank level liquidity management, the Company manages liquidity at the parent company level for various operating needs including payment of dividends, repurchases of common stock, principal and interest payments on its borrowings, acquisitions and additional investments in its subsidiaries. East West’s primary source of liquidity is from cash dividends distributed by its subsidiary, East West Bank. The Bank is subject to various statutory and regulatory restrictions on its ability to pay dividends as discussed in Item 1. Business - Supervision and Regulation - Dividends and Other Transfers of Funds in this Form 10-K. As of December 31, 2020, East West held $439.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, after receiving $511.0 million in dividends from the Bank. In comparison, as of December 31, 2019, East West held $166.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, after receiving $190.0 million in dividends from the Bank. Each year, the dividends from the Bank to East West are sufficient to meet the projected cash obligations of the parent company for the coming year.
Liquidity Risk - Liquidity Stress Testing Liquidity stress testing is performed at the Company level, as well as at the foreign subsidiary and foreign branch levels. Stress tests and scenario analyses are intended to quantify the potential impact of a liquidity event on the financial and liquidity position of the entity. Scenario analyses include assumptions about significant changes in key funding sources, market triggers, potential uses of funding and economic conditions in certain countries. In addition, Company specific events are incorporated into the stress testing. Liquidity stress tests are conducted to ascertain potential mismatches between liquidity sources and uses over a variety of time horizons, both immediate and longer term, and over a variety of stressed conditions. Given the range of potential stresses, the Company maintains contingency funding plans on a consolidated basis and for individual entities.
Liquidity Risk - COVID-19 Pandemic In response to the ongoing developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company continues to closely monitor the impact of the pandemic on its business. The uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and its impact on the financial services industry, could potentially impact the liquidity of the Company. The prolonged strained economic, capital, credit and/or financial market conditions may expose the Company to liquidity risk. However, the Company believes that market conditions have shown signs of improvement after the Federal Reserve stepped in with a broad array of actions to stabilize financial markets and to lower borrowing costs. In December 2020, the CAA was signed into law which issued new relief provisions, extended certain provisions of the CARES Act, and provided additional stimulus funding. Additional government stimulus assistance may be passed in 2021. The combination of the CAA and any additional stimulus legislation in 2021 may further enhance economic recovery.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company was not aware of any material commitments for capital expenditures in the foreseeable future and believes it has adequate liquidity resources to conduct operations and meet other needs in the ordinary course of business. Given the uncertainty and the rapidly changing market and economic conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company will continue to actively evaluate the nature and extent of impact on its business and financial position.
Consolidated Cash Flows Analysis
The following table presents a summary of the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the periods indicated. While this information may be helpful to highlight business strategies and certain macroeconomic trends, the cash flow analysis may not be as relevant when analyzing changes in the Company’s net earnings and assets. The Company believes that in addition to this traditional cash flow analysis, the discussion related to liquidity in Item 7. MD&A - Risk Management - Liquidity Risk Management - Liquidity may provide a useful context in evaluating the Company’s liquidity position and related activity.
Operating Activities - Net cash provided by operating activities was $693.3 million, $735.8 million and $883.2 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, net cash provided by operating activities mainly reflected inflows of net income, in the amounts of $567.8 million, $674.0 million and $703.7 million for each of the respective years. During 2020, net operating cash inflows also benefited from noncash adjustments of $285.0 million to reconcile net income to net operating cash, as well as net changes in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $170.4 million, partially offset by net changes in accrued interest receivable and other assets of $339.9 million. The net changes in accrued interest receivable and other assets of $339.9 million during 2020 were primarily due to changes in derivative asset fair values. In comparison, during 2019, net operating cash inflows benefited from noncash adjustments of $221.6 million to reconcile net income to net operating cash, partially offset by net changes in accrued interest receivable and other assets of $170.8 million. Net operating cash inflows for 2018 benefited from $150.4 million in noncash adjustments to reconcile net income to net operating cash, as well as net changes in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $88.1 million, partially offset by net changes in accrued interest receivable and other assets of $60.8 million.
Investing Activities - Net cash used in investing activities was $6.85 billion, $2.57 billion and $3.83 billion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. During 2020, net cash used in investing activities primarily reflected cash outflows of $3.62 billion from loans held-for-investment, $2.16 billion from AFS debt securities, $577.6 million from interest-bearing deposits with banks, $350.0 million from resale agreements, and $154.9 million from investments in qualified affordable housing partnerships, tax credit and other investments. In comparison, during 2019, net cash used in investing activities primarily reflected cash outflows of $2.42 billion from loans held-for-investment, $521.2 million from AFS debt securities, and $146.9 million from investments in qualified affordable housing partnerships, tax credit and other investments. These investing cash outflows were partially offset by cash inflows of $325.0 million from resale agreements and $193.5 million from interest-bearing deposits with banks. During 2018, net cash used in investing activities primarily reflected $3.43 billion increase in net loans held-for-investment, a $503.7 million payment for the sale of the Bank’s eight DCB branches to Flagstar Bank, and $132.6 million in net funding of investments in qualified affordable housing partnerships, tax credit and other investments, partially offset by $217.7 million of net cash inflows from AFS debt securities.
Financing Activities - Net cash provided by financing activities was $6.91 billion, $2.12 billion and $3.80 billion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. During 2020, net cash provided by financing activities primarily reflected net increases of $7.48 billion in deposits, and $1.44 billion in PPPLF advances, partially offset by $1.44 billion repayment of PPPLF advances, $158.7 million net repayment in repurchase agreements, $158.2 million in cash dividends paid, $146.0 million in shares repurchased, and $95.0 million net repayment in FHLB advances. In comparison, net cash inflows in 2019 primarily reflected net increases of $1.90 billion in deposits and $418.0 million in FHLB advances, partially offset by $155.1 million in cash dividends paid. Net cash inflows in 2018 primarily reflected net increases in deposits of $3.90 billion, partially offset by cash dividends paid of $126.0 million.
Market Risk Management
Market risk is the risk that the Company’s financial condition may change resulting from adverse movements in market rates or prices including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, interest rate contracts, investment securities prices, credit spreads, and related risk resulting from mismatches in rate sensitive assets and liabilities. In the event of market stress, the risk could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
The Board’s Risk Oversight Committee has primary oversight responsibility. At the management level, the ALCO establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market risk management activities. Corporate Treasury supports the ALCO in measuring, monitoring and managing interest rate risk as well as all other market risks.
Interest Rate Risk Management
Interest rate risk results primarily from the Company’s traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans; it is the primary market risk for the Company. Economic and financial conditions, movements in interest rates, and consumer preferences impact the level of noninterest-bearing funding sources at the Company, as well as affect the difference between the interest the Company earns on interest-earning assets and pays on interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, changes in interest rates can influence the rate of principal prepayments on loans and the speed of deposit withdrawals. Due to the pricing term mismatches and the embedded options inherent in certain products, changes in market interest rates not only affect expected near-term earnings, but also the economic value of these interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Other market risks include foreign currency exchange risk and equity price risk. These risks are not considered significant to the Company and no separate quantitative information concerning these risks is presented herein.
With oversight by the Company’s Board of Directors, the ALCO coordinates the overall management of the Company’s interest rate risk. The ALCO meets regularly and is responsible for reviewing the Company’s open market positions and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk. Management of interest rate risk is carried out primarily through strategies involving the Company’s debt securities portfolio, loan portfolio, available funding channels and capital market activities. In addition, the Company’s policies permit the use of derivative instruments to assist in managing interest rate risk.
The interest rate risk exposure is measured and monitored through various risk management tools, which include a simulation model that performs interest rate sensitivity analyses under multiple interest rate scenarios. The model incorporates the Company’s cash instruments, loans, debt securities, resale agreements, deposits, borrowings and repurchase agreements, as well as financial instruments from the Company’s foreign operations. The Company uses both a static balance sheet and a forward growth balance sheet to perform these analyses. The simulated interest rate scenarios include a non-parallel shift in the yield curve (“rate shock”) and a gradual non-parallel shift in the yield curve (“rate ramp”). In addition, the Company also performs simulations using alternative interest rate scenarios, including various permutations of the yield curve flattening, steepening or inverting. Results of these various simulations are used to formulate and gauge strategies to achieve a desired risk profile within the Company’s capital and liquidity guidelines.
The net interest income simulation model is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of the Company’s interest-rate sensitive assets, liabilities and related derivative contracts. It also incorporates various assumptions, which management believes to be reasonable but may have a significant impact on results. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, the timing and magnitude of changes in interest rates, the yield curve evolution and shape, the correlation between various interest rate indices, financial instrument future repricing characteristics and spread relative to benchmark rates, and the effect of interest rate floors and caps. The modeled results are highly sensitive to deposit decay and deposit beta assumptions, which are derived from a regression analysis of the Company’s historical deposit data. Deposit beta commonly refers to the correlation of the changes in interest rates paid on deposits to changes in benchmark market interest rates. The model is also sensitive to the loan and investment prepayment assumptions, based on an independent model and the Company’s historical prepayment data, which consider anticipated prepayments under different interest rate environments.
Simulation results are highly dependent on input assumptions. To the extent actual behavior is different from the assumptions in the models, there could be a material change in interest rate sensitivity. The assumptions applied in the model are documented and supported for reasonableness, and periodically back-tested to assess their effectiveness. The Company makes appropriate calibrations to the model as needed, continually refining the model, methodology and results. Changes to key model assumptions are reviewed by the ALCO. Scenario results do not reflect strategies that management could employ to limit the impact of changing interest rate expectations.
Since the federal funds rate range was lowered to near zero in March 2020 and the Federal Reserve has committed its resources to support the financial markets, businesses, and state and local governments, it is not expected that rates will decline further, nor is it expected that rates will enter into the negative territory. Consequently, the simulation results for the downward interest rate scenarios as of December 31, 2020 are not provided.
Twelve-Month Net Interest Income Simulation
Net interest income simulation modeling looks at interest rate risk through earnings. It projects the changes in interest rate sensitive asset and liability cash flows, expressed in terms of net interest income, over a specified time horizon for defined interest rates scenarios. Net interest income simulations generate insight into the impact of market rates changes on earnings and guide risk management decisions. The Company assesses interest rate risk by comparing net interest income using different interest rate scenarios.
The federal funds rate range was between 0.00% and 0.25% as of December 31, 2020 and between 1.50% and 1.75% as of December 31, 2019. After lowering the range to between 0.00% and 0.25% in March 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee (“FOMC”) pledged to maintain monetary support for the economy. Moreover, in December 2020, acknowledging the uncertain and likely lengthy path to a full post-pandemic economic recovery, the majority of FOMC members projected that the federal funds rate range will likely remain unchanged through 2023. The FOMC statement indicated that the federal funds target rate will remain unchanged until maximum employment has been reached and inflation rises to and remains at 2% for some time.
The following table presents the Company’s net interest income sensitivity related to an instantaneous and sustained non-parallel shift in market interest rates of 100 and 200 basis points in an upward direction as of December 31, 2020 and in both directions as of December 31, 2019.
NM - Not meaningful.
(1)The percentage change represents net interest income over 12 months in a stable interest rate environment versus net interest income in the various rate scenarios.
The Company’s net interest income profile as of December 31, 2020 reflects an asset sensitive position. Net interest income would be expected to increase if interest rates rise and to decrease if interest rates decline. The potential impact of rate decreases is somewhat muted due to the current low rate environment with the federal funds rate floored and the federal funds rate range between 0.00% and 0.25%. The Company is naturally asset sensitive due to the large share of variable rate loans in its loan portfolio, which are primarily linked to Prime and LIBOR indices. The Company’s interest income is vulnerable to changes in short-term interest rates. However, given the current low level of interest rates, the potential for further rate decreases is limited which reduces the Bank’s exposure to risks associated with falling rates. The Company’s deposit portfolio is primarily comprised of non-maturity deposits, which are not directly tied to short-term interest rate indices, but are, nevertheless, sensitive to changes in short-term interest rates.
The Company’s estimated twelve-month net interest income sensitivity as of December 31, 2020 was lower than the sensitivity as of December 31, 2019 under both higher rate scenarios. This reflects reduced upward repricing in the Company’s rate sensitive assets due to a higher proportion of floating rate loans at rate floors under a near-zero interest rate environment, as compared with the proportion at rate floors as of December 31, 2019.
While an instantaneous and sustained non-parallel shift in market interest rates was used in the simulation model described in the preceding paragraphs, the Company believes that any shift in interest rates would likely be more gradual and would therefore have a more modest impact. The rate ramp table below shows the net income volatility under a gradual non-parallel shift of the yield curve upward and downward, in even quarterly increments over the first 12 months, followed by rates held constant thereafter:
NM - Not meaningful.
(1)The percentage change represents net interest income under a gradual non-parallel shift in even quarterly increments over 12 months.
The Company believes that the rate ramp table, shown above, when evaluated together with the results of the rate shock simulation, presents a more meaningful indication of the potential impact of rising interest rates to the Company’s twelve-month net interest income. During 2020, the Company’s modeled asset sensitivity decreased under a ramp simulation for the higher interest rate scenarios.
Economic Value of Equity at Risk
Economic value of equity (“EVE”) is a cash flow calculation that takes the present value of all asset cash flows and subtracts the present value of all liability cash flows. This calculation is used for asset/liability management and measures changes in the economic value of the bank. The fair market values of a bank's assets and liabilities are directly linked to interest rates. The economic value approach provides a comparatively broader scope than the net income volatility approach since it captures all anticipated cash flows.
EVE simulation reflects the effect of interest rate shifts on the value of the Company and is used to assess the degree of interest rate risk exposure. In contrast to the earnings perspective, the economic perspective identifies risks arising from repricing or maturity gaps over the life of the balance sheet. Changes in economic value indicate anticipated changes in the value of the bank’s future cash flows. Thus, the economic perspective can provide a leading indicator of the bank’s future earnings and capital values. The economic value method also reflects sensitivity across the full maturity spectrum of the bank’s assets and liabilities.
The following table presents the Company’s EVE sensitivity related to an instantaneous and sustained non-parallel shift in market interest rates of 100 and 200 basis points in an upward direction as of December 31, 2020 and in both directions as of December 31, 2019:
NM - Not meaningful.
(1)The percentage change represents net portfolio value of the Company in a stable interest rate environment versus net portfolio value in the various rate scenarios.
The Company’s EVE sensitivity for the upward interest rate scenarios increased as of December 31, 2020, compared with the results as of December 31, 2019. The changes in EVE sensitivity during this period were primarily due to changes in the level and shape of the yield curve, and an increased proportion of low cost and noninterest-bearing deposits in total deposits.
The Company’s EVE profile as of December 31, 2020 reflects an asset sensitive EVE position under the higher interest rate scenarios. Given the uncertainty of the magnitude, timing and direction of future interest rate movements, and the shape of the yield curve, actual results may vary from those predicted by the Company’s model.
Derivatives
It is the Company’s policy not to speculate on the future direction of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. However, the Company will periodically enter into derivative transactions in order to reduce its exposure to market risks, primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. The Company believes that these derivative transactions, when properly structured and managed, may provide a hedge against inherent risk in certain assets and liabilities and against risk in specific transactions. Hedging transactions may be implemented using a variety of derivative instruments such as swaps, forwards and options. Prior to entering into any hedging activities, the Company analyzes the costs and benefits of the hedge in comparison to alternative strategies. In addition, the Company enters into derivative transactions in order to assist customers with their risk management objectives, such as managing exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currencies and commodity prices. To economically hedge against the derivative contracts entered into with the Company’s customers, the Company enters into mirrored derivative contracts with third-party financial institutions. The exposures from derivative transactions are collateralized by cash and/or eligible securities based on limits as set forth in the respective agreements entered between the Company and counterparty financial institutions.
The Company is subject to credit risk associated with the counterparties to the derivative contracts. This counterparty credit risk is a multi-dimensional form of risk, affected by both the exposure and credit quality of the counterparty, both of which are sensitive to market-induced changes. The Company’s Credit Risk Management Committee provides oversight of credit risks and the Company has guidelines in place to manage counterparty concentration, tenor limits and collateral. The Company manages the credit risk of its derivative positions by diversifying its positions among various counterparties, by entering into legally enforceable master netting arrangements, and by requiring collateral arrangements, where possible. The Company may also transfer counterparty credit risk-related to interest rate swaps to institutional third parties through the use of credit risk participation agreements. Certain derivative contracts are required to be centrally cleared through clearinghouses to further mitigate counterparty credit risk. The Company incorporates credit value adjustments and other market standard methodologies to appropriately reflect its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements of its derivatives.
The following table summarizes certain information concerning derivative financial instruments utilized by the Company in its management of interest rate risk and foreign currency risk as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:
NM - Not meaningful.
(1)As of December 31, 2020, there were no interest rate contracts designated as fair value hedges. The interest rate contracts designated as fair value hedges as of December 31, 2019 were dedesignated when the certificates of deposits were called during 2020.
(2)As of December 31, 2019, there were no interest rate contracts designated as cash flow hedges.
Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments - Interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts are utilized in our asset and liability management activities and serve as an efficient tool to manage the Company’s interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. We use derivatives to hedge the risk of variable cash flows that the Company is exposed to from its variable interest rate borrowings, including repurchase agreements and FHLB advances. The Company also uses derivatives to hedge the risk of changes in the USD equivalent value of a designated monetary amount of the Company’s net investment in East West Bank (China) Limited. For both cash flow and net investment hedges, the change in the fair value of the hedging instruments is recognized in AOCI, net of tax, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The fluctuation in foreign currency translation of the hedged exposure is expected to be offset by changes in the fair value of the forwards. As of December 31, 2020, the outstanding foreign currency forwards effectively hedged approximately 50% of the RMB exposure in East West Bank (China) Limited.
Changes to the composition of the Company’s derivatives designated as hedging instruments during 2020 reflect actions taken for interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk management. The decisions to reposition our derivatives portfolio are based on the current assessment of economic and financial conditions, including the interest rate and foreign currency environments, balance sheet composition and trends, and the relative mix of our cash and derivative positions.
Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments - The Company enters into interest rate, foreign exchange and energy commodity contracts to support the business requirements of its customers. When derivative transactions are executed with its customers, the derivative contracts are offset by paired trades with third-party financial institutions. The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are either exchange-traded, centrally cleared through a clearinghouse or over-the counter.
The Company offers various interest rate derivative contracts to its customers. For the interest rate contracts entered into with its customers, the Company managed its interest rate risk by entering into offsetting interest rate contracts with third-party financial institutions including with central clearing organizations. Certain derivative contracts entered with central clearing organizations are settled-to-market daily to the extent the central clearing organizations’ rulebooks legally characterize the variation margin as settlement. Derivative contracts allow borrowers to lock in attractive intermediate and long-term fixed rate financing while not increasing the interest rate risk to the Company. These transactions are not linked to specific Company assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, or to forecasted transactions in a hedging relationship, and are therefore economic hedges. The contracts are marked-to-market at each reporting period. The changes in fair values of the derivative contracts traded with third-party financial institutions are expected to be largely comparable to the changes in fair values of the derivative transactions executed with customers throughout the terms of these contracts, except for the credit valuation adjustment component. The Company records credit valuation adjustments on derivatives to properly reflect the variances of credit worthiness between the Company and the counterparties, considering the effects of enforceable master netting agreements and collateral arrangements.
The Company enters into foreign exchange contracts with its customers, consisting of forward, spot, swap and option contracts to accommodate the business needs of its customers. For the foreign exchange contracts entered into with its customers, the Company managed its foreign exchange and credit exposures by entering into offsetting foreign exchange contracts with third-party financial institutions and/or entering into bilateral collateral and master netting agreements with customer counterparties. The changes in the fair values entered with third-party financial institutions are expected to be largely comparable to the changes in fair values of the foreign exchange transactions executed with the customers throughout the terms of these contracts. As of December 31, 2020, the Company anticipates performance by all counterparties and has not experienced nonperformance by any of its counterparties, and therefore did not incur any related losses. The Company also utilizes foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to mitigate the economic effect of fluctuations in certain foreign currency on-balance sheet assets and liabilities, primarily foreign currency denominated deposits offered to its customers. The Company’s policies permit taking proprietary currency positions within approved limits, in compliance with exemptions to proprietary trading restrictions provided under Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, or the Volcker Rule. The Company does not speculate in the foreign exchange markets, and actively manages its foreign exchange exposures within prescribed risk limits and defined controls.
The Company enters into energy commodity contracts with its customers to allow them to hedge against the risk of fluctuation in energy commodity prices. To economically hedge against the risk of fluctuation in commodity prices in the products offered to its customers, the Company enters into offsetting commodity contracts with third-party financial institutions, including with central clearing organizations. Certain derivative contracts entered into with central clearing organizations are settled to market daily, to the extent the central clearing organizations’ rulebooks legally characterize the variation margin as settlement. The changes in fair values of the energy commodity contracts traded with third-party financial institutions are expected to be largely comparable to the changes in fair values of the energy commodity transactions executed with customers throughout the terms of these contracts.
Additional information on the Company’s derivatives is presented in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies- Derivatives, Note 2 - Fair Value Measurement and Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Note 5 - Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.
Impact of Inflation
The consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented in this report have been prepared according to GAAP, which require the measurement of financial and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs and in the effect that inflation may have on both short-term and long-term interest rates. Since almost all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than inflation. While inflation expectations do affect interest rates, interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction, or to the same extent, as the prices of goods and services.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The Company’s significant accounting policies and use of estimates are fundamental to understanding its results of operations and financial condition. Some accounting policies, by their nature, are inherently subject to estimation techniques, valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments. In addition, some significant accounting policies require significant judgments in applying complex accounting principles to individual transaction and determining the most appropriate treatment. The Company has procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments.
Certain accounting policies are considered to have a critical effect on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that require the most complex or subjective judgments and are reflective of significant uncertainties, and whose actual results could differ from the Company’s estimates. Future changes in the key variables could change future valuations and impact the results of operations. The following accounting policies are critical to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements as they require management to make subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain where actual results could differ materially from the Company’s estimates. In each area, the Company has identified the most important variables in the estimation process. The Company has used the best information available to make the estimations necessary for the related assets and liabilities.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
In determining the fair value of financial instruments, the Company uses market prices of the same or similar instruments whenever such prices are available. The Company does not use prices involving distressed sellers in determining fair value. Changes in the market conditions such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities, may increase variability or reduce the availability of market prices used to determine fair value. If observable market prices are unavailable or impracticable to obtain, then fair value is estimated using modeling techniques such as discounted cash flows analysis. These modeling techniques incorporate management’s assessments regarding assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or the liability, including the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique and the risk of nonperformance. The use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the Company could result in different estimates of fair value of financial instruments.
Significant judgment is also required to determine the fair value hierarchy for certain financial instruments. When fair values are based on valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement, the financial assets and liabilities are classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy. Total recurring Level 3 assets were $273 thousand and $421 thousand as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and there were no recurring Level 3 liabilities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. For a complete discussion on the Company’s fair value hierarchy of financial instruments, fair value measurement techniques and assumptions, and the impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements, see Note 2 - Fair Value Measurement and Fair Value of Financial Instruments to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.
Allowance for Loan Losses and Unfunded Credit Commitments
On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires the measurement of the allowance for credit losses to be based on management’s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the Company’s relevant financial assets. The Company’s lifetime expected credit losses are determined using macroeconomic forecast assumptions and management judgments applicable to and through the expected life of the loan portfolios, and are net of expected recoveries on loans that were previously charged off.
The Company’s allowance for loan losses and the allowance for unfunded credit commitments are calculated with the objective of maintaining a reserve sufficient to absorb losses inherent in our credit portfolio. Management’s determination of the appropriateness of the allowance is based on periodic evaluation of the loan portfolio, lending-related commitments and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires numerous estimates as further discussed below.
The Company develops and documents the allowance for loan losses methodology at the portfolio segment level. The commercial loan portfolio is comprised of C&I, CRE, multifamily residential, and construction and land loans; and the consumer loan portfolio is comprised of single-family residential, HELOCs, and other consumer loans. When similar risk characteristics exist, the Company measures the expected loan losses on a collective pool basis. Lifetime loss rate models have been adopted for the portfolios, which use historical loss rates and forecast economic variables to calculate the expected credit losses for each loan pool. Models consisting of quantitative and qualitative components are designed for each pool to develop the expected credit loss estimate. Quantitative methods consider a variety of factors such as historical loss experience, the current credit quality of the portfolio as well as an economic outlook over the life of the loan. The Company incorporates forward-looking information using macroeconomic scenarios applied over the forecasted life of the loans. These macroeconomic scenarios, which are applied over a reasonable and supportable forecast period, may consist of a base forecast representing management’s review of the most likely outcome, combined with downside and upside scenarios reflecting possible worsening or improving economic conditions. Additionally, the Company utilizes qualitative factors and environmental factors that are not already included in the quantitative models. The Company reviews the existing qualitative factors for appropriateness and examines the portfolio for any new qualitative factors that may be topical or appropriate. As the economy and risks in the loan portfolio change, management recommends adjustments to these factors as appropriate.
When loans do not share risk characteristics, the Company evaluates the expected credit losses on an individual basis if, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the loan agreement. The following three different asset valuation measurement methods are available: (1) the present value of expected future cash flows, (2) the fair value of collateral less costs to sell, and (3) the loan’s observable market price. The allowance for loan losses for collateral-dependent loans is determined based on the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell. For loans that are not collateral-dependent, the Company applies the present value of expected future cash flows valuation or the market value of the loan.
The allowance for unfunded credit commitments includes reserves provided for unfunded loan commitments, letters of credit, SBLCs and recourse obligations for loans sold. For all off-balance sheet instruments and commitments, the unfunded credit exposure is calculated using utilization assumptions based on the Company's historical utilization experience in related portfolio segments. Loss rates are applied to the calculated exposure balances to estimate the allowance for unfunded credit commitments. Other elements such as credit risk factors for loans outstanding, terms and expiration dates of the unfunded credit facilities, and other pertinent information are considered to determine the adequacy of the allowance.
The evaluation of allowance is inherently subjective, as it requires numerous estimates and judgments that are susceptible to revision as more information becomes available. To the extent actual results differ from estimates or management’s judgments, the allowance for credit losses may be greater or less than future charge-offs. As the Company adds new products, increases the complexity of the loan portfolio and expands the geographic coverage, the Company expects to continue to enhance its methodologies to keep pace with the changing credit environment and the size and complexity of the loan portfolio and unfunded credit commitments. Changes in any of the factors cited above could have a significant impact on the allowance for credit loss calculation. For additional information on allowance for credit losses, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 6 - Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.
Goodwill Impairment
The accounting for goodwill is discussed in Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies and Note 8 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. The Company assesses goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that indicate a potential impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill or elect to bypass the qualitative test and proceed directly to a quantitative test. Factors considered in qualitative assessments may include but are not limited to macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, financial performance of the respective operating segment and other specific reporting unit considerations. If the qualitative analysis indicates that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying fair value, the Company is required to perform a quantitative assessment to determine if there is goodwill impairment. A quantitative valuation involves determining the fair value of each reporting unit and comparing the fair value to its corresponding carrying value. In order to determine the fair value of the reporting units, a combined income approach and market approach is used.
Significant judgments are applied and assumptions are made when estimating the fair value of the reporting units. Estimates of fair value are dependent upon various factors including estimates of the profitability of the Company’s reporting units, long term growth rates and the estimated market cost of equity. Imprecision in estimating these factors can affect the estimated fair value of the reporting units. Certain events or circumstances could have a negative effect on the estimated fair value of the reporting units, including declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions and adverse regulatory or legislative changes, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period.
In light of the COVID-19 pandemic impact and market volatility, an interim goodwill impairment analysis was conducted as of March 31, 2020. In addition, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test on all reporting units as of December 31, 2020. There was no goodwill impairment for its business segments as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2020.
Income Taxes
The Company is subject to income tax laws of the various tax jurisdictions in which it conducts business, including the U.S., its states and the municipalities, and the tax jurisdictions in Hong Kong and China. The Company estimates income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to these various tax jurisdictions. The estimated income tax expense or benefit is reported on the Consolidated Statement of Income.
Accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due to or due from various tax jurisdictions and are reported in Accrued expenses and other liabilities or Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In estimating accrued taxes, the Company assesses the appropriate tax treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent, and other pertinent information. The income tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the Company and the relevant government taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining the tax accruals and in evaluating the tax positions, including evaluating uncertain tax positions. Changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax laws, the status of examinations by the tax authorities, and newly enacted statutory, judicial, and regulatory guidance that could impact the relative merits and risks of tax positions. These changes, when occur, impact tax expense and can materially affect our operating results and financial condition. The Company reviews its tax positions on a quarterly basis and makes adjustments to accrued taxes as new information becomes available.
Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years. Such assets arise due to temporary differences between the financial accounting basis and the income tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as from NOL and tax credit carryforwards. The Company regularly evaluates the realizability of deferred tax assets. The available evidence used in connection with the evaluations includes taxable income, potential tax-planning strategies, and projected future reversals of deferred tax items. A valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
The Company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, in an income tax return. Uncertain tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that management believes has a greater than 50% likelihood of realization upon settlement. Tax benefits not meeting our realization criteria represent unrecognized tax benefits. The Company establishes a liability for potential taxes, interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions based on facts and circumstances, including the interpretation of existing law, new judicial or regulatory guidance, and the status of tax audits. The Company believes that adequate provisions have been recorded for all income tax uncertainties consistent with ASC 740, Income Taxes as of December 31, 2020. See Note 11 - Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information on income taxes.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
For detailed discussion and disclosure on new accounting pronouncements adopted and recent accounting standards, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.
Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company uses certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance. Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to GAAP. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s performance that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. A non-GAAP financial measure may also be a financial metric that is not required by GAAP or other applicable requirements. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance, and allow comparability to prior periods. These non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes.
During 2020, the Company recorded $10.7 million in recoveries, of which $1.1 million was recorded as an impairment recovery, and $5.1 million in uncertain tax position related to the Company’s investment in DC Solar. In addition, the Company prepaid $150.0 million of repurchase agreements and incurred a debt extinguishment cost of $8.7 million in 2020. During 2019, the Company recorded a $7.0 million impairment charge, reversed $30.1 million of certain previously claimed tax credits and subsequently recovered $1.6 million related to DC Solar. During 2018, the Company sold its eight DCB branches and recognized a pre-tax gain on sale of $31.5 million.
The following tables present the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in 2020, 2019 and 2018:
(1)Included in Amortization of tax credit and other investments on the Consolidated Statement of Income.
(2)Applied statutory tax rates of 28.37% for 2020 and 29.56%.for both 2019 and 2018.
(1)In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company reclassified certain income/losses from equity-method investments from Amortization of tax credit and other investments to Other investment income, with no effect on net income. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.
(1)Includes core deposit intangibles and mortgage servicing assets.
(1)Applied statutory rate of 28.37% for 2020 and 29.56% for both 2019 and 2018.
