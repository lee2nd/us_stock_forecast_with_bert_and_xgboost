Overview
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant loss of life, disrupted businesses and restricted travel worldwide, causing significant economic disruption and uncertainty. This disruption and uncertainty has and continues to have an adverse impact on our business, operations and financial results. For fiscal 2020, our total revenues declined 8.8% in U.S. dollars, compared to a 10.3% increase in 2019. The effects of the pandemic have been more impactful to our international business than our domestic business. Our 2020 International revenue decreased 14.7% compared to an 8.7% increase in 2019. Our 2020 Domestic revenue increased 1.5% compared to a 13.3% increase in 2019.
While our revenue declined year over year, our 2020 net income increased by 38.6%. While we could not plan for the pandemic as 2020 began, we took quick action and worked closely with our clients to manage our resources, expenses and capital to achieve a strong net income result. We are proud of this achievement and the focus of our teams in light of the broad economic market impact of the pandemic across the globe.
While the pandemic continues to impact the markets we serve, we did experience a strong fourth quarter domestically as this market appears to be emerging more quickly than our international markets from the pandemic. Our fourth quarter domestic revenue increased 11.9% compared to our international revenue that decreased 8.7% compared to the fourth quarter prior year. In total, our fourth quarter revenue decreased 2.8% compared to an increase of 7.1% in 2019.
Our fourth quarter net income increased 425% over 2019 reflecting a strong performance and commitment to execution. While we are pleased with this result, we have continued to see pressure on both the domestic and international gross profit margins. The international gross profit margin for the fourth quarter was 20.2% compared to 20.2% in 2019. The domestic profit margin for the fourth quarter was 17.8% versus 18.6%. The gross profit margin results were primarily attributable to wage pressures and an unfavorable mix in lower grow margin project work.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The Company's critical accounting policies, including the assumptions and judgements underlying them, are disclosed in Note 2 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. These policies have been consistently applied in all material respects and address such matters as revenue recognition, doubtful accounts and credit risks, internal use software development costs, asset impairment recognition, consolidation of subsidiaries and other companies. While the estimates and judgements associated with the application of these policies may be affected by different assumptions or conditions, the Company believes the estimates and judgements associated with the reported amounts are appropriate under the circumstances.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of the Company's property and equipment and intangible assets subjected to amortization may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment exist, the Company assesses the recoverability of the assets by estimating whether the Company will recover its carrying value through the undiscounted future cash flows generated by the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Based on this analysis, if the Company does not believe that it will be able to recover the carrying value of the asset, the Company records an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. If any assumptions, projections or estimates regarding any asset change in the future, the Company may have to record an impairment to reduce the net book value of such individual asset.
Accounting for Joint Venture Subsidiaries
For the Company's less than wholly owned subsidiaries, the Company first analyzes to determine if a joint venture subsidiary is a variable interest entity (a "VIE") in accordance with ASC 810, and if so, whether the Company is the primary beneficiary requiring consolidation. A VIE is an entity that has: (i) insufficient equity to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support; or (ii) equity holders that lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. VIEs are consolidated by the primary beneficiary, which is the entity that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the entity that potentially could be significant to the entity. Variable interests in a VIE are contractual, ownership, or other financial interests in a VIE that change with changes in the fair value of the VIE's net assets. The Company continuously re-assesses at each level of the joint venture whether the entity is: (i) a VIE; and (ii) if the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. If it was determined that an entity in which the Company holds an interest qualified as a VIE and the Company was the primary beneficiary, it would be consolidated.
Based on the Company's analysis for each of its 51% owned joint ventures, the Company has determined that each is a VIE and that Company is the primary beneficiary of that VIE. In addition to its controlling interest, the Company controls the proprietary information technology that is used at and is significant to each joint venture and the Company has the ability to control other key decisions. Accordingly, the Company has the power to direct key activities and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be significant and consolidates each joint venture under the VIE rules and reflects the 49% interests in the Company's consolidated financial statements as non-controlling interests. The Company records these non-controlling interests at their initial fair value, adjusting the basis prospectively for their share of the respective consolidated investments' net income or loss or equity contributions and distributions. These non-controlling interests are not redeemable by the equity holders and are presented as part of permanent equity. Income and losses are allocated to the non-controlling interest holder based on its economic ownership percentage.
Revenue Recognition
The Company's services are provided to its clients under contracts or agreements. The Company bills its clients based upon service fee arrangements. Revenues under service fee arrangements are recognized when the service is performed. Customer deposits, which are considered advances on future work, are recorded as revenue in the period services are provided.
The Company records revenue from contracts with its customers through the execution of a Master Service Agreement ("MSA") that are effectuated through individual Statements of Work ("SOW" and with the applicable MSA collectively a "Contract"). The MSAs generally define the financial, service, and communication obligations between the client and SPAR while the SOWs state the project objective, scope of work, time frame, rate and driver in which SPAR will be paid. Only when the MSA and SOW are combined as a Contract can all five revenue standard criteria be met. The Company integrates a series of tasks promised within these Contracts into a bundle of services that represent the combined performance obligation of Merchandising Services. Such Merchandising Services are performed over the duration of the SOW. Most Merchandising Services are performed on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. Revenue from Merchandising Services are recognized as the services are performed based on a rate-per-driver basis (per hour, store visit or unit stocked) with services delivered as they are consumed.
All of the Company's Contracts with customers have a duration of one year or less, with over 90% being completed in less than 30 days, and revenue is recognized as services are performed. Given the nature of the Company's business, how the Contracts are structured and how the Company is compensated, the Company has elected the right-to-invoice practical expedients method allowed under the revenue standard.
Doubtful Accounts and Credit Risks
The Company continually monitors the collectability of its accounts receivable based upon current client credit information and financial condition. Balances that are deemed to be uncollectible after the Company has attempted reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the bad debt allowance and a credit to accounts receivable. Accounts receivable balances, net of any applicable reserves or allowances, are stated at the amount that management expects to collect from the outstanding balances. The Company provides for probable uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to bad debt allowance based in part on management's assessment of the current status of individual accounts. Based on management's assessment, the Company established an allowance for doubtful accounts of $563,000 and $438,000 at December 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Bad debt expense was $330,000 and $83,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Internal Use Software Development Costs
The Company capitalizes certain costs associated with its internally developed software. Specifically, the Company capitalizes the costs of materials and services incurred in developing or obtaining internal use software. These costs include (but are not limited to) the cost to purchase software, the cost to write program code, payroll and related benefits and travel expenses for those employees who are directly involved with and who devote time to the Company's software development projects. Capitalized software development costs are amortized over three years on a straight-line basis.
The Company capitalized approximately $1.0 million of costs related to software developed for internal use in both 2020 and 2019, and recognized approximately $1.2 and $1.3 million of amortization of capitalized software for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 respectively.
Results of Operations
The following table sets forth selected financial data and such data as a percentage of net revenues for the years indicated (dollars in millions).
Results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019
Net Revenues
Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, were $230.5 million compared to $252.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $22.4 million or 8.8%. Domestic contributed an increase of $1.4 million and the international segment contributed a decrease of $23.8 million year over year.
Domestic net revenues totaled $92.1 million and $90.7 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase of $1.4 million or 1.5% is primarily attributable to project growth.
International net revenues totaled $138.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $162.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $23.8 million or 14.7%. The decrease in 2020 international net revenues was primarily due to foreign exchange impact as well as decreased revenue in Australia, Canada, and Japan. See Note 12 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements - Segment Information, below.
Cost of Revenues
The Company's cost of revenues consists of its in-store labor and field management wages, related benefits, travel and other direct labor-related expenses and was 80.4% of net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 80.5% of net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Domestic cost of revenue as a percent of net revenue was 78.5% and 76.5% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in cost was due to the labor mix and project work.
International cost of revenue as a percent of net revenue was 81.6% and 82.8% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The international cost of revenue percentage decrease of 1.2% percentage point was primarily due to margin improvements in Mexico, India, and Brazil.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses of the Company include its corporate overhead, project management, information technology, executive compensation, human resources, legal and accounting expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately $33.3 million and approximately $36.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Due to COVID-19 impact, all countries have managed discretionary spending diligently throughout the year of 2020.
Domestic selling, general and administrative expenses totaled approximately $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to approximately $16.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
International selling, general and administrative expenses totaled approximately $17.1 million and $20.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization expense totaled approximately $2.1 million and $2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Interest Expense
The Company's interest expense was $690,000 and $1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The international segment contributed $40,000 to the decrease in the Company's 2020 interest expense primarily due to borrowing requirements from the Company's subsidiary in Brazil of $146,000 and change of allocation of business segment of $202,000. In the domestic segment, 2020 interest expense decreased by approximately $650,000 compared to 2019 primarily due to change of allocation of business segment; excluding allocation, the expense increased by $164,000 due to financing rate increases.
Other Income
Other income was $242,000 and $266,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Income Tax
The income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $312,000 and $3.6 million, respectively. The decrease is from a Brazil tax provision adjustment.
Non-Controlling Interest
Net operating profits from the non-controlling interests, relating to the Company's 51% owned subsidiaries, resulted in a reduction of net income attributable to the Company of $5.6 million and $3.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Net Income
The Company reported a net income attributable to the Company of $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, or $0.16 per basic share, compared to a net income of $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, or $0.11 per diluted share, based on basic shares outstanding of 21.1 million at December 31, 2020, and 20.9 million at December 31, 2019.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
None.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had pre-tax net income before taxes of $9.3 million and $9.4 million, respectively.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $8.8 million and $6.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to cash impacting earnings and a decrease in accounts receivable, partially offset by decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses.
Net cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, was $1.6 million and $1.4 million, respectively. The net cash used in investing activities during 2020 was attributable to fixed asset purchases.
Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was approximately $0.1 million compared to $2.0 million used in financing activities in 2019. Net cash provided by financing activities during 2020 was primarily due to net borrowing on lines of credit.
The above activity and the impact of foreign exchange rate changes resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents for the year ended December 31, 2020 of approximately $5.5 million.
At December 31, 2020, the Company had net working capital of $25.8 million, as compared to net working capital of $17.4 million at December 31, 2019. The Company's current ratio was 1.6 and 1.4 at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.
Credit Facilities
The Company is a party to various domestic and international credit facilities. See Note 4 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements - Credit Facilities.
These various domestic and international credit facilities require compliance with their respective financial covenants. During 2020, the Company was in compliance with all other financial covenants.
Management believes that based upon the continuation of the Company's existing credit facilities, projected results of operations, vendor payment requirements and other financing available to the Company (including amounts due to affiliates), sources of cash availability should be manageable and sufficient to support ongoing operations over the next year. However, delays in collection of receivables due from any of the Company's major clients, a significant reduction in business from such clients, or a negative economic downturn resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 virus, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, cash resources and ongoing ability to fund operations.
