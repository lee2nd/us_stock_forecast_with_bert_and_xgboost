Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Caution About Forward Looking Statements
We make forward looking statements in this annual report that are subject to risks and uncertainties. These forward looking statements include statements regarding our profitability, liquidity, and allowance for loan losses, interest rate sensitivity, market risk, growth strategy, and financial and other goals. The words “believes,” “expects,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “anticipates,” “forecasts,” “intends,” or other similar words or terms are intended to identify forward looking statements. The forward-looking information is based on various factors and was derived using numerous assumptions. Important factors that may cause actual results to differ from projections include:
●
the success or failure of our efforts to implement our business plan;
●
any required increase in our regulatory capital ratios;
●
satisfying other regulatory requirements that may arise from examinations, changes in the law and other similar factors;
●
deterioration of asset quality;
●
changes in the level of our nonperforming assets and charge-offs;
●
fluctuations of real estate values in our markets;
●
our ability to attract and retain talent;
●
demographical changes in our markets which negatively impact the local economy;
●
the uncertain outcome of current or future legislation or regulations or policies of state and federal regulators;
●
the successful management of interest rate risk;
●
the successful management of liquidity;
●
changes in general economic and business conditions in our market area and the United States in general;
●
credit risks inherent in making loans such as changes in a borrower’s ability to repay and our management of such risks;
●
competition with other banks and financial institutions, and companies outside of the banking industry, including online lenders and those companies that have substantially greater access to capital and other resources;
●
demand, development and acceptance of new products and services we have offered or may offer;
●
the effects of, and changes in, trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve, inflation, interest rate, market and monetary fluctuations;
●
the occurrence of significant natural disasters, including severe weather conditions, floods, health related issues (including the ongoing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and the associated efforts to limit the spread of the disease), and other catastrophic events;
●
technology utilized by us;
●
our ability to successfully manage cyber security;
●
our reliance on third-party vendors and correspondent banks;
●
changes in generally accepted accounting principles;
●
changes in governmental regulations, tax rates and similar matters; and,
●
other risks, which may be described in our future filings with the SEC.
Because of these uncertainties, our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward looking statements. In addition, our past results of operations do not necessarily indicate our future results. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.
General
The following commentary discusses major components of our business and presents an overview of our consolidated financial position at December 31, 2020 and 2019 as well as results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. This discussion should be reviewed in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and other statistical information presented elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
New Peoples generates a significant amount of its income from the net interest income earned by the Bank. Net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense. Interest income depends on the volume of interest-earning assets outstanding during the period and the interest rates earned thereon. The Bank’s interest expense is a function of the average amount of interest-bearing deposits and borrowed money outstanding during the period and the interest rates paid thereon. The quality of the assets further influences the amount of interest income lost on nonaccrual loans and the amount of provision expense added to the allowance for loan losses. The Bank also generates noninterest income from service charges on deposit accounts and commissions on insurance and investment products sold.
Critical Accounting Policies
Certain critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. Our most critical accounting policies relate to our provision for loan losses and the calculation of our deferred tax asset and any related valuation allowance.
The provision for loan losses reflects the estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our borrowers were to further deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, our estimates would be updated, and additional provisions could be required. For further discussion of the estimates used in determining the allowance for loan losses, we refer you to the section on “Provision for Loan Losses” in this discussion.
Deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based upon the difference between financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate. In the past, the Company provided a valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets where it was deemed more likely than not such assets would not be realized. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had no valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets.
The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. For further discussion of the deferred tax asset and valuation allowance, we refer you to the section on “Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets” in this discussion.
For further discussion of our other critical accounting policies, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our Consolidated Financial Statements, found in Item 8 to this annual report on Form 10-K.
Cyber Security
The Company, primarily through the Bank, depends on its ability to continuously process, record and monitor a large number of customer transactions and customer, public and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased over time. Accordingly, the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ operational systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions and breakdowns. Although the Company has business continuity plans and other safeguards in place, disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support its businesses and customers, or cyber-attacks or security breaches of the networks, systems or devices on which customers’ personal information is stored and that customers use to access the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ products and services could result in customer attrition, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional compliance costs, any of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.
Although to date the Company has not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, there can be no assurance that it or its subsidiaries will not suffer such losses in the future. The Company’s risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, our plans to continue to implement our e-banking and mobile banking channel strategies and develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers when and how they want to be served. As a result, cyber security and the continued development and enhancement of the Company’s controls, processes and practices, designed to protect its and its subsidiaries’ systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access, remain a priority for the Company. As cyber threats continue to evolve, the Company may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.
In December 2020, the federal banking agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would require banking organizations to notify their primary regulator within 36 hours of becoming aware of a “computer-security incident” or a “notification incident.” The proposed rule also would require specific and immediate notifications by bank service providers that become aware of similar incidents.
To date, we have not experienced a significant compromise, significant data loss or any material financial losses related to cyber-attacks, but our systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers are under constant threat and it is possible that we could experience a significant event in the future.
Recent Events
Since December 31, 2019 COVID-19 has adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, economic activity globally, nationally and locally. Market interest rates have declined significantly. In early 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee reduced the target federal funds rate twice by a total of 150 basis points (bps). As a result of these actions the target federal funds rate now stands at 0.00% - 0.25% and the prime interest rate stands at 3.25%.
State and local governments have issued executive orders and businesses have implemented rules as simple as wearing a mask in public and social distancing to limiting attendance at public and household gatherings. This has had, and will continue to have, a significant adverse impact on the economy as certain industries have been seriously impaired or have been forced to close.
Financial services are considered essential services, and we have continued to meet the needs of our customers. We supplemented our existing procedures for the adoption of workplace safety standards outlined by the Virginia Department of Labor and Industry. Since the first quarter of 2020, we have maintained a committee dedicated to managing our response to the pandemic. This has included marshalling supplies and personal protective equipment, coordinating employee and customer communications, evaluating staffing and maintaining compliance with various mandates and regulations. We have restricted access to our lobbies since the first quarter of 2020. Based on our continuing assessment of the intensity of the pandemic in our market areas, we continue to limit lobby access and expect this limitation to be discontinued in the second quarter of 2021 as local cases decrease and vaccinations increase in our region. Meanwhile, our offices continue to provide customer services principally via drive-thru facilities and ITMs.
As part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act), the Small Business Administration (SBA) was authorized to guarantee Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans used by borrowers for payroll and other permitted purposes. The SBA has provided a 100% guarantee and paid originators a processing fee ranging from 1% to 5%, based on the loan amount. We funded a total of $44.5 million of these loans for our customers through August 2020, when the funding period closed, and received $1.6 million in net fees from the SBA, which is being recognized as income over the terms of these loans. As of December 31, 2020, $994 thousand of these fees had been recognized in income. At December 31, 2020, $34.8 million of PPP loans remain. It is anticipated the SBA will forgive the majority of these loans. Through March 31, 2021, 407 loans have received forgiveness payments from the SBA totaling $24.7 million.
In January 2021, the United States Congress passed additional legislation providing economic relief related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This legislation included a second round of Paycheck Protection Loans. We are participating in this program and have funded 322 loans totaling $18.8 million through March 31, 2021
In response to the economic impact brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, banking and financial regulators provided guidance to financial institutions regarding borrower requests for forbearance. In general, short-term deferrals or other minor modifications extended to borrowers who were current in their loan obligations at December 31, 2019, were not considered troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) or impairments. These accommodations have been provided in the form of payment deferrals or conversion to interest only for a period of time, generally, three to six months. As of December 31, 2020, 688 loans which have received some form of forbearance in accordance within the applicable legislative and regulatory guidelines totaled $112.0 million, and virtually all of them have progressed through their forbearance period, with 15 accounts totaling $836 thousand in forbearance at year-end. In addition to loans receiving forbearance under the CARES Act, 36 accounts totaling $2.4 million at December 31, 2020, were existing or newly classified as TDRs, that received temporary forbearance. Of all accounts receiving forbearance, 82 accounts totaling $5.6 million were past due 30 days or more, including six loans totaling $332 thousand that were past due 90 days or more at December 31, 2020. No accounts past due 90 days or more are accruing interest.
The majority of the loans which obtained forbearance are within our general market area, with $73.3 million, $16.7 million and $26.9 million in Virginia, Tennessee and West Virginia, respectively. At December 31, 2020, these loans cover a number of industries, such as residential property rental of $21.4 million, commercial and other real estate rental of $16.0 million, hotels and motels of $11.0 million; coal mining and natural gas extraction $6.0 million and amusement and entertainment of $5.0 million. Consumer loans represent $40.5 million, with $39.5 million secured by real estate. Most of these loans have reached the end of their forbearance period and the vast majority of these borrowers have resumed their payments. While we believe that the majority of these borrowers will be able to repay their obligations, we cannot reasonably estimate the risk of loss should the adverse economic impact of the pandemic continue for an extended period of time.
In summary, the adverse economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been extensive and wide ranging, resulting in a steep decline in interest rates, an increase in unemployment and a resulting decline in economic output. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the term or intensity of any possible adverse impact on our financial position, operations or liquidity. Given the continuation in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations, economic recovery may be slow and uneven. However, we are encouraged by the recent vaccination programs and therapeutic treatments that have been developed and are becoming more available to the mass population.
Overview
The Company’s consolidated net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $2.9 million, or basic income per share of $0.12 as compared to a net income of $2.1 million, or basic income per share of $0.09, for the year ended December 31, 2019. This is an increase of $831 thousand, or $0.03 per share. This increase was driven primarily by a reduction of $2.0 million in non-interest expense and an increase of $167 thousand in net interest income, offset by a reduction of $505 thousand in non-interest income and an increase of $250 thousand in provision for loan losses. The $2.0 million reduction in non-interest expense is a 6.9% decrease and was driven by an $878 thousand decrease in salaries and benefits and a $1.1 million decrease in other operating expenses. The salaries and benefits reduction is a result of the restructure announced in May of 2020. The other operating expenses reduction is a result of renegotiated contracts and reductions in expenses related to loan collections and foreclosed assets. A moratorium on foreclosures during most of 2020 drove the reductions in loan collections and foreclosed asset expenses. The increase in net interest income resulted from a $919 thousand decline in interest income which was more than mitigated by a $1.1 million reduction in interest expense. Economic conditions during 2020 drove reductions in market interest rates which negatively affected our interest income and allowed us to reduce our deposit rates.
At December 31, 2020, total assets were $756.6 million, total loans were $575.6 million, and total deposits were $668.0 million. We closed $44.5 million in PPP loans in 2020, which, when combined with federal stimulus payments received by our deposit customers, drove increases in deposits.
The Company’s key performance indicators are as follows:
Highlights from the year 2020 include:
●
Total assets increased $49.9 million, or 7.1%, to $756.3 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $706.4 million at December 31, 2019;
●
Book value per share was $2.43 as of December 31, 2020 and $2.28 as of December 31, 2019;
●
Net income improved 40.4% to $2.9 million, or $0.12 per share, in 2020 compared to $2.1 million, or $0.09 per share, in 2019;
●
In the last quarter of 2019 we hired a consulting firm to help us improve efficiency and increase revenues, and when combined with other management efforts, this has helped produce in the last two quarters of 2020 the most profitable core earnings in several years;
●
Net interest income was $25.1 million, an increase of $167,000 compared to 2019, as described above;
●
The net interest margin was 3.66%, a reduction of 16 basis points compared to 3.82% for the year ended December 31, 2019;
●
Total loans increased $13.0 million, or 2.3%, to $575.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020;
●
Securities available for sale decreased $2.2 million, or 4.4%, to $48.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2020;
●
Total deposits increased $46.5 million, or 7.5%, to $668.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to PPP loan funds and federal stimulus payments, as discussed earlier;
●
Time deposits decreased $23.0 million or 8.9% during the year, to $234.4 million at December 31, 2020, largely due to decreased interest rates;
●
Noninterest income was $8.1 million, a decrease of $505,000 compared to 2019, primarily due to the non-recurring gain of $803 thousand in the prior year on the sale and leaseback of the Lebanon office, offset by a $300,000 increase in card processing and interchange income, which resulted from renegotiated contracts, plus a $220,000 bonus from a service provider for renewing a contract to retain their services;
●
Salaries and employee benefits expense was $13.2 million, a reduction of $878,000 compared to 2019, which was due mainly to the restructuring announced in May of 2020 and the overall reduction in staff;
●
ATM network expense was $1.5 million, a reduction of $357,000 compared to 2019, resulting from a renewed and renegotiated contract;
●
Loan related expenses were $353,000, a reduction of $228,000, or 39.2%, compared to 2019, mainly due to the moratorium on foreclosures, which reduced loan collection expense;
●
Expenses associated with foreclosed assets were $307,000, a reduction of $328,000, or 51.6%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, also due to the moratorium on foreclosures, and reduced levels of other real estate owned properties;
●
Nonperforming assets, which include nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned, totaled $8.9 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $332,000, or 3.9% during the year ended December 31, 2020;
●
Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets was 1.17% at December 31, 2020;
●
No accruing loans were past due 90 days or more and loans on nonaccrual totaled $5.5 million, for a total of $5.5 million in nonperforming loans, or 1.0% of total loans outstanding, at December 31, 2020;
●
Annualized net charge offs as a percentage of average loans were 0.08% during 2020, compared to 0.36% during 2019; and
●
The allowance for loan losses as a percentage to total loans was 1.25% at December 31, 2020, as compared to 0.95% at December 31, 2019.
The $49.9 million growth in total assets was driven primarily by an increase of $40.2 million in interest bearing deposits in other banks, which in turn was driven by a $46.5 million increase in total deposits. The increase in deposits was primarily due to PPP loans, which were dispersed into each loan customer’s checking account. Deposits also increased through federal stimulus payments received by customers into their checking accounts.
Total equity increased to $58.2 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $3.6 million, or 6.5%. The Bank’s capital ratios at December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019, respectively, were as follows: Tier 1 leverage ratio of 9.49% versus 9.43%; Tier 1 risk based capital ratio of 15.16% versus 13.72%; total risk based capital ratio of 16.41% versus 14.83%; and common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 15.16% versus 13.72%. The Bank is considered well-capitalized under regulatory guidelines.
Expenses related to OREO properties were $307 thousand in 2020 compared to $635 thousand in 2019. During 2020, we recorded write-downs on other real estate owned properties of $132 thousand compared to $214 thousand in 2019. During 2020, we had a net gain on the sale of OREO of $60 thousand compared to a net loss of $123 thousand in 2019.
Total loans increased $13.0 million in 2020, or 2.3%, to $575.6 million at December 31, 2020, as compared to $562.5 million at December 31, 2019. The main driver of this increase in total loans is the $44.5 million of PPP loans originated during 2020. Since PPP loans are generally commercial loans, they have supported our strategy to grow and diversify the loan portfolio. Total loans also increased as result of loan demand in the Tri-Cities market along with our initial efforts in the western North Carolina market. As evidenced in 2020, loan growth in general is subject to economic conditions, customer demand, and competition in our markets.
Nonperforming assets, which include nonaccrual loans, loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest and OREO increased $332 thousand, or 3.88%, to $8.9 million at year-end 2020 from $8.5 million at year-end 2019. Other real estate owned declined by $59 thousand during 2020 to $3.3 million. Nonaccrual loans increased $391 thousand to $5.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. Total nonperforming assets represented 1.17% and 1.21% of total assets at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. There were no loans past due 90 days or greater and still accruing interest at December 31, 2020 or 2019. The makeup of these assets is primarily related to commercial and residential real estate. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the largest foreclosed property, with a recorded balance of $1.6 million, was sold. We continue undertaking extensive and aggressive measures to work out problem credits and liquidate foreclosed properties. Our goal is to continue to reduce the nonperforming assets being mindful of the impact to earnings and capital; however, we may recognize some losses and reductions in the allowance for loan loss as we expedite the resolution of these problem assets.
Our allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2020 was $7.2 million, or 1.25%, of total loans, as compared to $5.4 million, or 0.95% of total loans at December 31, 2019. Impaired loans decreased $493 thousand, or 8.8%, to $5.4 million, with an estimated allowance of $1,052 thousand for potential losses, at December 31, 2020; as compared to $8.0 million in impaired loans, with an estimated allowance of $318 thousand, at the end of 2019. A provision for loan losses of $2.3 million was recorded in 2020, up from $2.1 million in 2019. Net loans charged off in 2020 were $477 thousand, or 0.08% of average loans, compared to $2.0 million, or 0.36% of average loans, in 2019. The losses recorded in 2019, were primarily related to some commercial loans extended to a few borrowers who ceased operations during that year. Two of these relationships accounted for $1.5 million of the losses recorded. The allowance for loan losses is being maintained at a level that management deems appropriate to absorb any potential future losses and known impairments within the loan portfolio, whether or not the losses are actually ever realized. We continue to adjust the allowance for loan loss model to best reflect the risks in the portfolio and the improvements made in our internal policies and procedures; however, future provisions may be deemed necessary.
Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin
The Company’s primary source of income is net interest income, which increased $167 thousand, or 0.7% in 2020 compared to 2019. While we had increases in both loans and overnight balances in interest-bearing deposits in other banks, the growth was not sufficient to offset the impact of decreases in interest rates, resulting in a decrease in interest income of $919 thousand. However, total interest expense decreased by $1.1 million, more than mitigating the decrease in interest income, due primarily to the reduction of interest rates paid on money market accounts, time deposits and trust preferred securities.
The decrease in interest income is due primarily to lower interest rates on loan accounts, which accounted for $896 thousand of the $919 thousand total decrease, even though average loan balances increased $23.2 million during 2020. Other contributing items to the decline in interest income was a $597 thousand decrease in interest income from deposits in other banks and a $355 thousand decrease in interest on investments. Although average balances of deposits in other banks grew by $22.1 million, the decline in yield to 0.34% from 2.06% in 2020 compared to 2019 drove the reduction in interest income from these deposits. The decline in interest income received from investments was driven by reductions in both rates and balances. Partially mitigating these decreases was a $933 thousand increase in loan fees, driven primarily by fees earned on PPP loans.
The decrease in interest expense of $1.1 million was driven primarily by a $598 thousand reduction in interest expense paid on money market deposit accounts, with both lower balances and lower rates contributing to the savings. Lower rates paid on trust preferred securities contributed $254 thousand toward reductions in interest expense, as lower market rates reduced the variable rates paid in these securities.
Overall, the net interest margin decreased 16 bps to 3.66% in 2020 compared to 3.82% in 2019. This reduction in interest rates was a direct result of actions taken by the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee, in response to the economic impact of the pandemic, which reduced the target federal funds rate twice in March 2020, by 150 bps. As a result of these actions the target federal funds rate now stands at 0.00% - 0.25% and the prime interest rate stands at 3.25%. Although the reduction of the federal funds rate in the first quarter of 2020 was an instantaneous move, it was in line with activity during the latter half of 2019, when the prime interest rate dropped three times by 25 bps each based on actions by the Federal Open Market Committee. During 2019 the prime interest rate fell from 5.50% to 4.75%. This was essentially full circle from the cycle in 2018 when the prime interest rate increased from 4.50% to 5.50%. Additionally, the yield on PPP loans is 1.00% (excluding the impact of deferred fee income), which reduces the overall average yield on loans. Fee revenue from the SBA on PPP loans only partially mitigates the low rate on these loans. Our yield on loans was 4.95% in 2020 compared to 5.15% in 2019. We have responded by lowering rates paid on deposit accounts, as evidenced by our 0.72% cost of funds in 2020 compared to 0.92% in 2019.
Another factor impacting the decrease in interest expense and the cost of funds was a significant deposit by a related party to our tiered premium money market account. Of the approximately $30 million of funds received during the first quarter of 2019 and intended as a temporary deposit, only approximately $5 million remained at December 31, 2020.
Due to the increased deposit balances, additional borrowings from the FHLB were unnecessary during 2020. Hence, interest paid on FHLB advances declined by $10 thousand in 2020 compared to 2019, due to maturities in 2019.
Unless we are able to continue to increase the volume of our interest-earning assets going forward, while controlling our cost of funds, we may continue to experience compression on the net interest margin. New and renewed loans are often being repriced at lower interest rates while we anticipate no increase in interest rates in the foreseeable future, due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Our future interest rate structure also may be impacted by the pending end of the use of LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate in 2021. We use LIBOR in pricing some of our interest earning assets and liabilities, including our trust preferred securities. At this time it appears that LIBOR will be replaced by the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), which is a transparent measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities. Because no there is not yet a consensus as to what rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to LIBOR, however, we cannot predict the effect of any such alternatives on the value of LIBOR-based variable-rate loans, as well as LIBOR-based securities, trust preferred securities, or other securities or financial arrangements. Regardless of whether SOFR or some other benchmark rate replaces LIBOR, we do not anticipate that the change will have a material impact on our ability to negotiate and price earning assets and liabilities. However, the transition to alternative reference rate for new contracts, or the implementation of a substitute index or indices for the calculation of interest rates under the Company’s existing loan agreements with borrowers or other financial arrangements, could change the Company’s market risk profile, interest margin, interest spread and pricing models, may cause the Company to incur significant expenses in effecting the transition, may result in reduced loan balances if borrowers do not accept a substitute index or indices, and may result in disputes or litigation with customers or other counter-parties over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute index or indices.
Nonaccrual loan balances increased $391 thousand during 2020 to $5.5 million at December 31, 2020, which negatively affect interest income as these loans are nonearning assets. Interest income and cash receipts on impaired loans are handled differently depending on whether or not the loan is on nonaccrual status. If the impaired loan is not on nonaccrual status, the interest income on the loan is computed using the effective interest method. When doubt about the collectability of a loan exists, it is the Bank’s policy to stop accruing interest on that loan under the following circumstances: (a) whenever we are advised by the borrower that scheduled payment or interest payments cannot be met, (b) when conditions indicate that payment of principal and interest can no longer be expected, or (c) when any such loan becomes delinquent for 90 days and is not both well secured and in the process of collection. All interest accrued but not collected on loans that are placed on nonaccrual is charged off and reversed against interest income in the current period. In the case of a nonaccrual loan that is well secured and in the process of collection, the interest accrued but not collected is not reversed. Interest received on these loans is accounted for on the cash basis or cost-recovery method until qualifying for return to accrual. Generally, loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current, six consecutive timely payments are made, and prospects for future contractual payments are reasonably assured.
The following table shows the rates paid on earning assets and deposit liabilities for the periods indicated.

(1) Non-accrual loans have been included in the average balance of loans outstanding.
(2) Loan fees have been included in interest income on loans.
(3) Tax exempt income is not significant and has been treated as fully taxable.
Net interest income is affected by changes in both average interest rates and average volumes of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The following table sets forth the amounts of the total changes in interest income and expense which can be attributed to rate (change in rate multiplied by old volume) and volume (change in volume multiplied by old rate) for the periods indicated.
Loans
Our primary source of income is interest earned on loans. Total loan balances increased $13.0 million during 2020, or 2.3%, to $575.6 million at December 31, 2020 as compared to $562.5 million at December 31, 2019. The main driver in this increase in total loans was a $32.0 million growth in commercial loans, driven by PPP loans. For the same year over year comparison, commercial loans secured by real estate and Multifamily residential loans grew $8.9 million and $2.9 million, respectively, but residential 1-4 family loans and real estate construction loans decreased $19.9 million and $6.1 million, respectively. Our strategy to grow and diversify the loan portfolio was accelerated by pandemic-related economic conditions, but the overall yield on loans suffered, as discussed above. Loans rated substandard or doubtful increased $276 thousand, or 5.4%, to $5.4 million at December 31, 2020 from $5.1 million at December 31, 2019.
Loans receivable outstanding are summarized as follows:
Our loan maturities as of December 31, 2020 are shown in the following table:
Provision for Loan Losses
The methodology we use to calculate the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting policy. The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based upon management’s judgment and analysis. The following factors are included in our evaluation of determining the adequacy of the allowance: risk characteristics of the loan portfolio, current and historical loss experience, concentrations, and internal and external factors such as general economic conditions. As a result of the severe economic downturn during the first quarter of 2020 related to the pandemic, we reassessed our allowance for loan losses methodology and adjusted qualitative factors for the potential future impact on our loan portfolio, which has resulted in additional provisions to the allowance.
The allowance for loan losses increased to $7.2 million at December 31, 2020 as compared to $5.4 million at December 31, 2019. The allowance for loan losses at the end of 2020 was approximately 1.25% of total loans as compared to 0.95% at the end of 2019. Provisions for loan losses of $2.3 million were recorded during 2020 and $2.1 million in 2019. Loans charged off, net of recoveries, totaled $477 thousand, or 0.08% of average loans, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $2.0 million, or 0.36% of average loans, in 2019. This large reduction in net charge-offs is primarily related to the moratorium on foreclosure that existed for most of 2020. The allowance for loan losses is being maintained at a level that management deems appropriate to absorb any potential future losses and known impairments within the loan portfolio whether or not the losses are actually ever realized. In response to the impact of the pandemic, changes to the allowance model included reviewing our internal scoring related to loan modifications and extensions, and external factors, specifically, unemployment and other economic factors. We continue to adjust the allowance for loan loss model to best reflect the risks in the portfolio and the improvements made in our internal policies and procedures; however, future provisions may be deemed necessary.
Nonaccrual loans present higher risks of default, and we have experienced an increase in these loans during 2020. At December 31, 2020, there were 75 nonaccruing loans totaling $5.5 million, or 0.96% of total loans. At December 31, 2019, there were 74 nonaccruing loans totaling $5.2 million, or 0.92% of total loans. The amount of interest income that would have been recognized on these loans had they been accruing interest was $494 thousand and $714 thousand in the years 2020 and 2019, respectively. In 2019, 94 nonperforming and under performing loans totaling $4.4 million were sold, resulting in a net recovery to the allowance for loans losses of $56 thousand, after determining that it was more cost effective to dispose of the accounts than to continue pursuing collection efforts. There were no loans past due 90 days or greater and still accruing interest at either December 31, 2020 or 2019. There are no commitments to lend additional funds to non-performing borrowers.
A majority of our loans are collateralized by real estate located in our market area. It is our policy to sufficiently collateralize loans to help minimize exposure to losses in cases of default. Increasing real estate values in our area have reduced this exposure somewhat. However, while we consider our market area to be somewhat diverse, certain areas are more reliant upon agriculture, coal mining and natural gas. As a result, increased risk of loan impairments is possible due to the volatile nature of the coal mining and natural gas industries. As a result of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of industries have been identified as posing increased risk. Specifically, residential and commercial rentals, hotels, restaurants and entertainment, and the coal and gas industries have been adversely impacted by the global and domestic economic slowdown. We are monitoring these industries and consider these segments to be the primary higher risks in the loan portfolio.
Commercial and commercial real estate loans are initially risk rated by the originating loan officer. If deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower and/or their capacity to repay the debt occurs, the loan may be downgraded by the loan officer. Guidance for risk rate grading is established by the regulatory authorities who periodically review the Bank’s loan portfolio for compliance. Classifications used by the Bank are Pass, Special Mention, Substandard, Doubtful and Loss.
With regard to the Bank’s consumer and consumer real estate loan portfolio, we use the guidance found in the Uniform Retail Credit Classification and Account Management Policy which affects our estimate of the allowance for loan losses. Under this approach, a consumer or consumer real estate loan must initially have a credit risk grade of Pass or better. Subsequently, if the loan becomes contractually 90 days past due or the borrower files for bankruptcy protection, the loan is downgraded to Substandard and placed in nonaccrual status. If the loan is unsecured upon being deemed Substandard, the entire loan amount is charged-off.
For non 1-4 family residential loans that are 90 days or more past due or in bankruptcy, the collateral value less estimated liquidation costs is compared to the loan balance to calculate any potential deficiency. If the collateral is sufficient, then no charge-off is necessary. If a deficiency exists, then upon the loan becoming contractually 120 days past due, the deficiency is charged-off against the allowance for loan loss. In the case of 1-4 family residential or home equity loans, upon the loan becoming 120 days past due, a current value is obtained and after application of an estimated liquidation discount, a comparison is made to the loan balance to calculate any deficiency. Subsequently, any noted deficiency is then charged-off against the allowance for loan loss when the loan becomes contractually 180 days past due. If the customer has filed bankruptcy, then within 60 days of the bankruptcy notice, any calculated deficiency is charged-off against the allowance for loan loss. Collection efforts continue by means of repossessions or foreclosures, and upon bank ownership, liquidation ensues.
All loans classified as substandard, doubtful or loss are individually reviewed for impairment in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 310-10-35. In evaluating impairment, a current appraisal is generally used to determine if the collateral is sufficient. Appraisals are typically less than a year old and must be independently reviewed to be relied upon. If the appraisal is not current, we perform a useful life review of the appraisal to determine if it is reasonable. If this review determines that the appraisal is not reasonable, then a new appraisal is ordered. Loans considered impaired decreased to $5.1 million with $2.5 million requiring a valuation allowance of $1.1 million at December 31, 2020 as compared to $5.6 million with $919 thousand requiring a valuation allowance of $323 thousand at December 31, 2019. Management is aggressively working to reduce the impaired credits at minimal loss.
In determining the component of our allowance in accordance with the Contingencies topic of the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC 450), we do not directly consider the potential for outdated appraisals since that portion of our allowance is based on the analysis of the performance of loans with similar characteristics, external and internal risk factors. We consider the overall quality of our underwriting process in our internal risk factors, but the need to update appraisals is associated with loans identified as impaired under the Receivables topic of the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC 310). If an appraisal is older than one year, a new external certified appraisal may be obtained and used to determine impairment. If an exposure exists, a specific allowance is directly made in the amount of the potential loss, in addition to estimated liquidation and disposal costs. The evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.
Following is a summary of non-accruing loans, loans past due longer than 90 days still accruing interest, and restructured loans:
Non-Accrual, Past Due, and Restructured Loans
(Dollars in thousands)
The above table includes $2.5 million and $570 thousand in nonaccrual loans as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which have been classified as troubled debt restructurings. No troubled debt restructurings were past due 90 days or more and still accruing as of December 31, 2020 or 2019. There were $4.0 million in loans classified as troubled debt restructurings as of December 31, 2020, as compared to $4.3 million in loans classified as troubled debt restructurings as of December 31, 2019.
In addition to impaired loans, the remaining loan portfolio is evaluated based on net charge-off history, economic conditions, and internal processes. To calculate the net charge-off history factor, we perform a 12-quarter look-back and use the average net charge offs as a percentage of the loan balances. To calculate the economic conditions factor, we use current economic data which includes national and local regional unemployment information, local housing price changes, gross domestic product growth, and interest rates. Lastly, we evaluate our internal processes of underwriting and consider the inherent risks present in the portfolio due to past and present lending practices. As economic conditions, performance of our loans, and internal processes change, it is possible that future increases or decreases may be needed to the allowance for loan losses. The following table provides a summary of the activity in the allowance for loan losses.
Analysis of the Allowance for Loan Losses
(Dollars in thousands)
We have allocated the allowance according to the amount deemed to be reasonably necessary to provide for the possibility of losses being incurred within each of the categories of loans. The allocation of the allowance as shown in the following table should not be interpreted as an indication that loan losses in future years will occur in the same proportions or that the allocation indicates future loan loss trends. Furthermore, the portion allocated to each loan category is not the total amount available for future losses that might occur within such categories since the total allowance is a general allowance applicable to the entire portfolio.
The allocation of the allowance for loan losses is based on our judgment of the relative risk associated with each type of loan. We have allocated 32% of the allowance to commercial real estate loans, which constituted 31.17% of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2020. This allocation increased when compared to the 23% in 2019 due primarily to the risks to businesses associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. We have allocated 34% of the allowance to commercial loans, which constituted 19.28% of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2020. This allocation percentage decreased compared to December 31, 2019 due to guarantees provided by the SBA on PPP loans, which resulted in their being excluded from the allowance assessment of commercial loans.
Both residential and commercial real estate loans are secured by real estate whose value tends to be easily ascertainable. These loans are made consistent with appraisal policies and real estate lending policies, which detail maximum loan-to-value ratios and maturities.
We have allocated 3% of the allowance to real estate construction loans, which constituted 4.35% of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2020. Construction loans are secured by real estate with values that are dependent upon market and economic conditions. Values may not always be easily ascertainable as evidenced by the current market conditions. These loans are made consistent with appraisal policies and real estate lending policies which detail maximum loan-to-value ratios and maturities.
We have allocated 29% of the allowance to residential real estate loans, which constituted 41.62% of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2020. Our allocation decreased as a percentage of the allowance for loan losses due to the $6.9 million decrease in residential real estate loans during 2020.
We have allocated 2% of the allowance to consumer installment loans, which constituted 3.58% of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2020, which declined $31 thousand compared to the 4% allocation we had in 2019.
The following table shows the balance and percentage of our allowance for loan losses (or ALLL) allocated to each major category of loans.

Other Real Estate Owned
Other real estate owned decreased $59 thousand, or 1.8%, to $3.3 million at December 31, 2020 from $3.4 million at December 31, 2019. All properties are available for sale by commercial and residential realtors under the direction of our Special Assets division. Our aim is to reduce the level of OREO in order to reduce the level of nonperforming assets at the Bank, while keeping in mind the impact to earnings and capital. In 2020 and 2019, pricing adjustments were made to make certain properties more marketable, which, in some cases, reduced the price below the fair value of the property (which is based on an appraisal less estimated disposition costs). During 2020, we recorded OREO writedowns of $132 thousand as compared to $214 thousand during 2019.
During 2020, we added $1.1 million in OREO properties as a result of settlement of foreclosed loans, offset by sales of $687 thousand with net gains of $60 thousand. As noted previously, a moratorium on foreclosures was initiated in Virginia during the first quarter of 2020 and remained in effect into the third quarter. During 2019, we added $811 thousand in OREO properties as a result of settlement of foreclosed loans, which was offset by sales of $1.3 million with net losses totaling $123 thousand. Additionally, during 2019, a closed branch office facility was transferred from Bank Premises to OREO at a value of $683 thousand. As previously discussed, we continue to take an aggressive approach toward liquidating properties to reduce our level of foreclosed properties by making pricing adjustments and holding auctions on some of our older properties. We expect to continue these efforts in 2021, which could result in additional losses, while reducing future carrying costs.
Although the properties remain for sale and are actively marketed, we do have lease agreements on certain other real estate owned properties which are generating rental income at market rates. Rental income on OREO properties was $54 thousand and $63 thousand in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Investment Securities
Total investment securities decreased $2.2 million, or 4.4%, to $48.4 million at December 31, 2020 from $50.6 million at December 31, 2019. All securities are classified as available-for-sale for liquidity purposes. Sales of securities during 2020 totaled $1.1 million, with $4 thousand in gains realized. No securities were sold during 2019. However, paydowns on mortgage backed securities totaled $11.0 million. Purchases of securities totaled $9.6 million during 2020. Investment securities with a carrying value of $6.8 million and $6.9 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were pledged to secure public deposits and for other purposes required by law.
Our strategy is to invest excess funds in investment securities, which typically yield more interest income than other short term investment options, such as federal funds sold and overnight deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, but which still provide liquidity. During 2020, since we had plenty of liquidity from increased customer deposit balances, purchases of investment securities essentially replaced maturities and paydowns of other securities. Due to loan demand during 2019, most funds resulting from securities maturities and repayments were used to fund the loan portfolio. We anticipate increasing the size of the portfolio during 2021, as we continue to seek ways of improving returns on liquid funds. The portfolio is comprised of what we believe to be short to mid-term investments, as mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations generally repay at a faster rate than their contractual maturities. The carrying values of investment securities and the different types of investments are shown in the following table:
Investment Securities Portfolio
(Dollars in thousands)
The fair value of our investment portfolio is substantially affected by changes in interest rates, which could result in realized losses if we need to sell the securities and recognize the loss in a rising interest rate environment due to Federal Reserve actions, U.S. fiscal policies or other factors affecting market interest rates. At December 31, 2020, we had a net unrealized gain in our investment portfolio totaling $938 thousand as compared to $72 thousand at December 31, 2019. We have reviewed our investment portfolio and no investment security is deemed to have other than temporary impairment. We monitor our portfolio regularly and use it to maintain liquidity, manage interest rate risk and enhance earnings.
The amortized cost, fair value and weighted average yield of investment securities at December 31, 2020 are shown in the following schedule by contractual maturity and do not reflect principal paydowns for amortizing securities. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.
Bank Owned Life Insurance
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had an aggregate total cash surrender value of $4.7 million and $4.6 million, respectively, on life insurance policies covering former key officers.
Total income for the policies during 2020 and 2019 was $77 thousand and $63 thousand, respectively.
Deposits
Total deposits were $668.0 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $46.5 million, or 7.5%, from $621.5 million at December 31, 2019. Most of the increase was driven by non-interest bearing demand deposits, which grew $52.9 million, or 31.0%, to $223.7 million during 2020, a result of PPP loan disbursements and federal stimulus payments received by deposit customers. Interest bearing demand deposits grew by $12.5 million, or 33.7%, to $49.7 million. Due to the large influx of non-interest bearing balances, we allowed attrition of time deposit balances, which decreased by $23.4 million and allowed us to reduce our average cost of funds.
Core deposits, which include the demand deposits mentioned in the last paragraph, also include other types of transaction accounts, such as commercial relationships and savings products. Savings accounts increased by $22.2 million to $95.1 million and money market deposits decreased $17.8 million to $40.1 million during 2020. The decrease in money market deposit accounts was primarily due to one customer whose balance we knew to be temporary. Overall, we continue to maintain core deposits through attractive consumer and commercial deposit products and strong ties with our customer base and communities.
Time deposits of $100,000 or more equaled approximately 17.0% of deposits at the end of 2020 and 19.5% of deposits at the end of 2019.
We held no brokered deposits at December 31, 2020 and 2019. Internet accounts are limited to customers located in our primary market area and the surrounding geographical area. The average balance of and the average rate paid on deposits is shown in the net interest margin analysis table in the “Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin” section above. Total Certificate of Deposit Registry Service (CDARS) time deposits were $9.6 million and $11.2 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Maturities of time deposits of $100,000 or more outstanding are summarized as follows:
Noninterest Income
For the year ended December 31, 2020, noninterest income declined $505 thousand, or 5.8%, to $8.1 million, or 1.10% of average assets, from $8.6 million, or 1.22% of average assets, for the same period in 2019. After excluding the $803 thousand gain on the sale and leaseback of our Lebanon, Virginia office recorded in 2019, noninterest income increased $298 thousand, due primarily to an increase of $300 thousand in card processing and interchange income, plus a $220 thousand bonus received during the first quarter of 2020 from a service provider for renewing and extending our service agreement.
Service charges decreased $388 thousand during 2020, primarily due to the reduced volume of overdraft activity, a direct result of increased deposit balances from PPP loan disbursements and federal stimulus payments. However, changes to our service fee schedule took effect in August of 2020, which has mitigated some of the decline in overdraft activity.
Financial services revenue for 2020 were $716 thousand, an increase of $53 thousand, or 8.0%, from the $663 thousand recognized in 2019. We continue to focus efforts on our financial services operations as we believe this segment continues to show potential for future growth.
In addition, secondary market mortgage origination revenue, included in other noninterest income, decreased approximately 17.0% to $205 thousand, another effect of the economic downturn related to the pandemic and restructuring changes in 2020. However, we remain focused on growing loans, including those sold into the secondary market, as evidenced by our expansion into new markets, like Boone, North Carolina, where population density and housing inventory provide additional opportunities to originate mortgage loans. We have also hired several seasoned lenders to serve the Tri-Cities and surrounding markets.
Noninterest Expense
Noninterest expenses decreased $2.0 million, or 6.9%, to $27.0 million at December 31, 2020, or 3.63% of average assets, compared to $29.0 million at December 31, 2019, or 4.09% of average assets. This decrease was due to reduced salary and benefit costs, which helped offset the impact of the restructuring costs incurred during the second quarter of 2020, combined with a decrease in consulting fees and related out-of-pocket costs.
Salaries and employee benefits decreased $878 thousand, or 6.2%, to $13.2 million in 2020 compared to $14.1 million 2019, even with the impact of the restructuring costs. In May 2020, we announced a restructuring which included a combination of eliminated positions, retirements or resignations representing 12% of the workforce. The estimated annual pre-tax savings resulting from this restructuring is $1.6 million. Affected employees received transitional support, including severance payments, assistance to aid in maintaining health insurance, and support in applying for unemployment benefits.
We retained an outside consulting firm during the fourth quarter of 2019 to review our products and procedures to identify areas where we could enhance revenue and better manage costs. During the fourth quarter of 2019, non-recurring fees of $233 thousand were recorded. Another $243 thousand was recognized during the first quarter of 2020. The vast majority of their recommendations have been implemented and we estimated pre-tax annual benefits will exceed $1.5 million. The only remaining recommendations in process relate to efficiency improvements in operating procedures.
Other operating expenses decreased $1.1 million, or 14.0%, to $6.7 million in 2020 from $7.8 million in 2019, due largely to reductions in expenses related to other real estate owned, loan collection, ATM processing, data circuits and telephone, which decreased $328 thousand, $227 thousand, $357 thousand, $47 thousand, and $67 thousand, respectively. Even with $132 thousand of write-downs, OREO costs benefited from $60 thousand of gains recognized on the sale of a foreclosed property. Loan collection costs reflect the impact of loan forbearance combined with the moratorium on foreclosures during most of 2020. Data circuits and telecommunication expenses benefited from contracts renegotiated in 2019. These savings offset non-recurring consulting costs of $265 thousand, plus other related out-of-pocket costs. The Commonwealth of Virginia ended the moratorium on foreclosures in September of 2020. We have since resumed foreclosures and anticipate these costs will rise.
Occupancy and equipment expenses remained essentially unchanged at $4.5 million in both 2020 and 2019. Depreciation expense decreased $122 thousand, or 5.3%, to $2.2 million in 2020 compared to 2019, due to the aging out of some of our equipment. Increases in utilities, property taxes, depreciation and repairs and maintenance related to our new Kingsport, Tennessee office negated the reductions in other depreciation expense. While a portion of this site’s operating costs are offset by rental income, we anticipate increasing tenant occupancy during 2021.
Our efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP measure, which is defined as noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income plus noninterest income, improved to 81.10% in 2020 compared to 86.23% in 2019. The decrease in this ratio is a result of improvements in both noninterest income and noninterest expense discussed above. We continue to seek opportunities to operate more efficiently through the use of technology, improving processes, reducing nonperforming assets and increasing productivity.
Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets
Income taxes were $1.1 million in 2020, compared to $522 thousand in 2019. The effective tax rates were 27.6%, and 20.2% for 2020 and 2019, respectively. The effective tax rate for the periods differed from the federal statutory rate of 21.0% principally due to tax-exempt income from loans as well as earnings from bank owned life insurance, as well as the impact of the recapture of operating loss carryforwards and applicable credits. The higher effective tax rate in 2020 when compared to 2019 is the result of the increase in pre-tax earnings in relation to the various tax preference items.
Deferred tax assets represent the future tax benefit of future deductible differences and, if it is more likely than not that a tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is required to reduce the recorded deferred tax assets to net realizable value. The Company has evaluated positive and negative evidence to assess the realizability of its deferred taxes. Based on the evidence, including taxable income projections, the Company believes it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will be realizable. Accordingly, the Company did not include a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2020 or 2019.
Tax positions are evaluated in a two-step process. The Company first determines whether it is more likely than not that a position will be sustained upon examination. If a tax position meets the more likely than not recognition threshold, it is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being recognized. The Company classifies interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had Federal and state net operating loss carry forward amounts of approximately $10.3 million and $1.0 million, respectively. These amounts are not limited pursuant to Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 382. The Company is subject to examination in the United States and multiple state jurisdictions. Open tax years for examination are 2017 - 2020.
Capital Resources
Our total capital at the end of 2020 was $58.2 million compared to $54.6 million at the end of 2019. The increase was $3.6 million, or 6.6%. Book value per common share was $2.43 at December 31, 2020 compared to $2.28 at December 31, 2019.
The Company meets the eligibility criteria to be considered a small bank holding company in accordance with the Federal Reserve’s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement issued in February 2015 and does not report consolidated regulatory capital. The Bank continues to be subject to various capital requirements administered by banking agencies.
The Bank is characterized as “well capitalized” under the “prompt corrective action” regulations pursuant to Section 38 of the FDIA. The capital adequacy ratios for the Bank are set forth below along with the minimum ratios to be considered “well capitalized” under such regulations:
Capital Adequacy Ratios
The Bank is also subject to the rules implementing the Basel III capital framework and certain related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rules require the Bank to comply with the following minimum capital ratios: (i) a CET1 ratio of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% “capital conservation buffer” (effectively resulting in a minimum CET1 ratio of 7%), (ii) a ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer (effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%), (iii) a ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer (effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5%), and (iv) a leverage ratio of 4%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets. The phase-in of the capital conservation buffer requirement began on January 1, 2016, at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets, increasing by the same amount each year until it was fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a CET1 ratio above the minimum but below the conservation buffer face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. As of December 31, 2020, the Bank meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject.
Total assets increased in 2020 and we anticipate asset levels to increase in the future due to an emphasis on growing the loan portfolio and the core deposit base of the Bank. Under current economic conditions, we believe it is prudent to continue to increase capital to support planned asset growth while being able to absorb potential losses that may occur if asset quality deteriorates further. Based upon projections, we believe our earnings will be sufficient to support the Bank’s planned asset growth.
No cash dividends have been paid historically and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends as long as the Company continues to have a retained deficit. Earnings will continue to be retained to build capital and position the Company to pay a dividend to its shareholders as soon as practicable.
Liquidity
We closely monitor our liquidity and our liquid assets in the form of cash, due from banks, federal funds sold and unpledged available-for-sale investments. Collectively, those balances were $134.0 million at December 31, 2020, up from $93.9 million at December 31, 2019. As discussed previously in this Form 10-K, this increase is a direct result of increases in our customers’ deposit balances. A surplus of short-term assets are maintained at levels management deems adequate to meet potential liquidity needs.
At December 31, 2020, all of our investments are classified as available-for-sale, providing an additional source of liquidity in the amount of $48.4 million, which is net of the $6.8 million of securities pledged as collateral. This will serve as a source of liquidity while yielding a higher return when compared to other short term investment options, such as federal funds sold and overnight deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. Total investment securities decreased $2.2 million, or 4.4%, during 2020 from $50.6 million at December 31, 2019.
Our loan to deposit ratio was 86.16% at December 31, 2020 and 90.52% at year-end 2019.
Available third-party sources of liquidity remain intact at December 31, 2020 which includes the following: our line of credit with the FHLB totaling $187.0 million, the brokered certificates of deposit markets, internet certificates of deposit, and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. We have $20.0 million in unsecured federal funds lines of credit from three correspondent banks as of December 31, 2020, which gives us an additional source of liquidity.
We have used our line of credit with FHLB to issue letters of credit totaling $12.0 million to the Treasury Board of Virginia for collateral on public funds. No draws on the letters of credit have been issued. The letters of credit are considered draws on our FHLB line of credit. An additional $169.9 million was available on December 31, 2020 on the $187.0 million line of credit, of which $136.7 million is secured by a blanket lien on our residential real estate loans.
While we have access to the brokered deposits market, we have no brokered deposits at December 31, 2020 or 2019. As of December 31, 2020, we have $9.6 million in reciprocal CDARS time deposits, compared to $11.2 million at December 31, 2019.
The Bank has access to additional liquidity through the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond’s Discount Window for overnight funding needs. We may collateralize this line with investment securities and loans at our discretion; however, we do not anticipate using this funding source except as a last resort.
With the on-balance sheet liquidity and other external sources of funding, we believe the Bank has adequate liquidity and capital resources to meet our requirements and needs for the foreseeable future. However, liquidity can be further affected by a number of factors such as, counterparty willingness or ability to extend credit, regulatory actions and customer preferences, some of which are beyond our control. With the economic downturn resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we have heightened our monitoring of our liquidity position, specifically cash on hand in order to meet customer demands related to usage of stimulus funds. Additionally, the Federal Reserve has taken actions to bolster liquidity in the markets.
Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk
The Bank is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. The contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement the Bank has in particular classes of financial instruments.
The Bank’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments.
A summary of the contract amount of the Bank’s exposure to off-balance-sheet risk as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:
Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer provided there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Bank evaluates each customer’s credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Bank upon extension of credit, is based on management’s credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, and income-producing commercial properties.
Unfunded commitments under lines of credit are commitments for possible future extensions of credit to existing customers. Those lines of credit may not actually be drawn upon to the total extent to which the Bank is committed.
Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing, and similar transactions. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Bank holds certificates of deposit, deposit accounts, and real estate as collateral supporting those commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary.
Interest Sensitivity
At December 31, 2020, we had a negative cumulative gap rate sensitivity ratio of 26.46% for the one year re-pricing period, compared to 31.36% at December 31, 2019. A negative cumulative gap generally indicates that net interest income would improve in a declining interest rate environment as liabilities re-price more quickly than assets. Conversely, net interest income would likely decrease in periods during which interest rates are increasing. The below table is based on contractual maturities and does not take into consideration prepayment speeds of investment securities and loans, nor does it consider decay rates for non-maturity deposits. When considering these prepayment speed and decay rate assumptions, along with our ability to control the repricing of a significant portion of the deposit portfolio, we are in a position to increase interest income in a rising interest rate environment. With the decreases in market rates experienced in 2020, we believe our current interest risk profile is increasing, but remains acceptable. Furthermore, we are implementing strategies to maintain the current profile, or moderate the adverse impact to our current interest rate risk profile, for what could be a sustained medium- to long-term low interest rate environment, despite a recent interest rate rise on the benchmark 10 year treasury during the first months of 2021.
