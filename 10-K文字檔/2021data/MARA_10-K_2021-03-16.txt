Business of the Company
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 23, 2010 under the name Verve Ventures, Inc. As of the date of this filing, our name has been changed to Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. On December 7, 2011, we changed our name to American Strategic Minerals Corporation and were engaged in exploration and potential development of uranium and vanadium minerals business. In June 2012, we discontinued our minerals business and began to invest in real estate properties in Southern California. In October 2012, we discontinued our real estate business when our former CEO joined the firm and we commenced our IP licensing operations, at which time the Company’s name was changed to Marathon Patent Group, Inc. On November 1, 2017, we entered into a merger agreement with Global Bit Ventures, Inc. (“GBV”), which is focused on mining digital assets. We have since purchased our cryptocurrency mining machines and established a data center in Canada to mine digital assets. Following the merger, we intended to add GBV’s existing technical capabilities and digital asset miners and expand our activities in the mining of new digital assets, while at the same time harvesting the value of our remaining IP assets. On June 28, 2018, the board has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to allow the Amended Merger Agreement to expire on its current termination date of June 28, 2018 without further negotiation or extension. The Board approved to issue 750,000 shares of our common stock to GBV as a termination fee for canceling the proposed merger between the two companies. The fair value of the common stocks was $2,850,000.
Recent Developments
Purchase of Digital Asset Mining Servers
On September 30, 2019, the Company consummated the purchase of 6000 S-9 Bitmain 13.5 TH/s Bitcoin Antminers (“Miners”) from SelectGreen Blockchain Ltd., a British Columbia corporation, for which the purchase price was $4,086,250 or 2,335,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $1.75 per share. As a result of an exchange cap requirement imposed in conjunction with the Company’s Listing of Additional Shares application filed with Nasdaq to the transaction, the Company issued 1,276,442 shares of its common stock which represented $2,233,773 of the $4,086,250 (constituting 19.9% of the issued and outstanding shares on the date of the Asset Purchase Agreement) and upon the receipt of shareholder approval, at the Annual Shareholders Meeting to be held on November 15, 2019, the Company can issue the balance of the 1,058,558 unregistered common stock shares. The shareholders did approve the issuance of the additional shares at the Annual Shareholders Meeting. The Company has issued and additional 474,808 at $0.90 per share. The $513,700 set forth on the balance sheet for mining servers payable reflects the fair value of 583,750 shares to be issued at $0.88 per share to conclude the purchase of the Miners at December 31, 2019. The Company recorded change in fair value of mining payable of $66,547 and $507,862 during the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.. There is no requirement for the Company to make a payment in cash in lieu of issuing the remaining shares. Subsequent to year end, on January 14, 2021, the Company sold its inventory of approximately 5,900 S9, 13.5 TH/s miners. As such, management determined that those crypto-currency machines were impaired by a total of $871,302 based upon an assessment as of December 31, 2020.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating this management discussion and analysis:
Digital Currencies
Digital currencies are included in current assets in the consolidated balance sheets as intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. Digital currencies are recorded at cost less impairment.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized but assessed for impairment annually, or more frequently, when events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired. Impairment exists when the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, which is measured using the quoted price of the digital currency at the time its fair value is being measured. In testing for impairment, the Company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. If it is determined that it is not more likely than not that an impairment exists, a quantitative impairment test is not necessary. If the Company concludes otherwise, it is required to perform a quantitative impairment test. To the extent an impairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted.
At December 31, 2020, we carried $2.272 million of digital assets on our balance sheet, consisting of the approximately 126 bitcoins, and held $141.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared to $0.001 million of digital assets and $0.7 million in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2019, reflecting the shift in our liquid assets. As of March 4, 2021, we held approximately 5,035 bitcoins, of which, 4,813 bitcoins were acquired at an aggregate purchase price of $150 million at an average purchase price of approximately $31,137 per bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses. We expect to purchase additional bitcoin in future periods, though we may also sell bitcoin in future periods as needed to generate Cash Assets for treasury management purposes.
Impairment of Long-lived Assets
Management reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Subsequent to year end, on January 14, 2021, the Company sold its inventory of approximately 5,900 S9, 13.5 TH/s miners. As such, management determined that those crypto-currency machines were impaired by a total of $871,302 based upon an assessment as of December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2019 we moved certain of our bitcoin miners to a new location in the United States and recorded an impairment of $447,776 in our leasehold improvements in Canada.
Recent Issued Accounting Standards
See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting standards and pronouncements.
Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019
We generated revenues of $4.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $1.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2019.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, this represented an increase of $4.5 million or 182%. Direct costs of revenue include depreciation and amortization expenses of the cryptocurrency mining machines and patents, contingent payments to patent enforcement legal costs, patent enforcement advisors and inventors as well as various non-contingent costs associated with enforcing the Company’s patent rights and otherwise in developing and entering into settlement and licensing agreements that generate the Company’s revenue.
We incurred other operating expenses of $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, this represented an increase of $4.3 million or 144%.

The operating expenses consisted of the following:
(1) Compensation expense and related taxes: Compensation expense includes cash compensation and related payroll taxes and benefits, and non-cash equity compensation expenses.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that it will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.

We believe that existing cash and cash equivalents held by us and cash and cash equivalents anticipated to be generated by us are sufficient to meet working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures, and contractual obligations for at least the next 12 months. As of December 31, 2020, we held approximately 125 bitcoins. Subsequent to year end, in January 2021, we purchased over 4,800 bitcoin for approximately $150 million. We do not believe we will need to sell any of our bitcoins within the next twelve months to meet our working capital requirements, although we may from time to time sell bitcoins as part of treasury management operations, including to increase our cash balances. The Bitcoin market historically has been characterized by significant volatility in its price, limited liquidity and trading volumes compared to sovereign currencies markets, relative anonymity, a developing regulatory landscape, susceptibility to market abuse and manipulation, and various other risks inherent in its entirely electronic, virtual form and decentralized network. During times of instability in the Bitcoin market, we may not be able to sell our bitcoins at reasonable prices or at all. As a result, our bitcoins are less liquid than our existing cash and cash equivalents and may not be able to serve as a source of liquidity for us to the same extent as cash and cash equivalents. In addition, upon sale of our bitcoin, we may incur additional taxes related to any realized gains or we may incur capital losses as to which the tax deduction may be limited.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
