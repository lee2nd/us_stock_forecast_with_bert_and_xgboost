Overview
General
Fiscal 2021 was a year marked by strong revenue and margin performance as Chase Corporation rebounded and grew over the COVID-19 impacted fiscal 2020. The Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment led the improvement by achieving both organic and inorganic growth, with sales into automotive, industrial, medical and consumer markets, and an upward trajectory in international markets. The results of both the Company’s current year acquisitions (the February 2021 acquisition of the operations of Emerging Technologies, Inc. (“ETi”) and the September 2020 acquisition of ABchimie) are reported under the Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment and combined provided accretive results for the year. The Industrial Tapes segment achieved recovery in sales over the prior year, with especially strong comparative results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Due to lower sales into the pipeline line and transportation infrastructure markets, the Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment sales fell short of the prior year.
All of Chase Corporation’s segments are currently facing global raw material inflationary pressures, supply chain challenges and an increasingly competitive landscape related to obtaining and retaining a manufacturing labor force. These challenges, most specifically those related to raw material costs and logistics complications, were seen in the Company’s fiscal third quarter and became even more pressing in its fourth fiscal quarter. Chase anticipates these trends to continue well into our fiscal 2022. Chase continues to meet its customers’ increasing demands by leveraging its global network, partnering with customers and suppliers and driving further efficiencies throughout the Company’s production and logistics processes. While the Company looks to drive cost savings, it will also continue to institute customer price adjustments as needed across all affected product lines to protect gross margins.
Business Development
Through mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, its marketing and product development efforts and its ability to rationalize and consolidate its operations, Chase Corporation remains focused on its core strategies for sustainable long-term growth.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2021, Chase announced to the employees at its Woburn, MA location that its adhesives systems operations would be consolidating into the Company’s existing O'Hara Township, PA location. This rationalization and consolidation initiative-related announcement aligns with the second quarter announcement of the Company’s plan to move its sealant systems production from Newark, CA to Hickory, NC. The Company completed the Newark, CA to Hickory, NC move in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, and anticipates completing the Woburn, MA to O’Hara Township, PA relocation during the first half of fiscal 2022. Chase Corporation obtained both the adhesive and sealants systems as part of its fiscal 2017 acquisition of the operations of Resin Designs.
On February 5, 2021, the Company acquired certain assets of Emerging Technologies, Inc. (“ETi”), a Greensboro, NC-located solutions provider and formulator of absorbent polymers for use in the packaging, recreational, consumer and sanitation markets. Following its fiscal 2018 acquisition of Zappa Stewart, the acquisition of ETi expands Chase Corporation’s market share in the growing superabsorbent polymers vertical. This second quarter acquisition comes following the September 1, 2020 (first day of fiscal 2021) purchase of ABchimie, a Corbelin, France-headquartered solutions provider for the cleaning and protection of electronic assemblies, that includes additional formulation, production, and research and development capabilities. Both the fiscal 2021 acquisitions were funded with available cash on hand and broaden the Company’s specialty chemical offerings within the Adhesives, Sealants, and Additives reporting segment with high performance, environmentally-friendly technologies that are complementary to Chase’s existing product offerings.
Revenue by Segment
The Company has three reportable operating segments summarized below:
(1) Formerly referred to as the specialty chemical intermediates product line
Revenue from the Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment increased in fiscal 2021 versus the prior year. Driven by Asian and European markets showing growth and the inorganic boost provided by the acquired operations of ABchimie, sales volumes within the electronic and industrial coatings product line increased. The Company’s North American-focused functional additives product line sales also experienced both organic and inorganic volume and price growth over the prior year, with the operations of ETi added to the product line following its February 5, 2021 acquisition.
Sales showed recovery in the Industrial Tapes segment over the COVID-19 impacted prior year, with the pulling and detection, electronic materials, and specialty products product lines driving top-line improvements for the year-to-date period. The segment’s cable materials, specialty products and pulling and detection product lines all have a North American concentration, and (in addition to the Asian-focused electronic materials product line) showed combined volume and price growth in the fourth quarter to move the segment into a favorable comparative position for the year.
The Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment’s sales fell short of the prior year in fiscal 2021. While the coating and lining systems and building envelope product lines sales were favorable to the prior year, declines in both domestic and international infrastructure markets resulted in lower sales volume in the pipeline coatings and bridge and highway product lines, and the segment as a whole.
Balance Sheet and Cash Flow
Chase Corporation’s balance sheet remained strong as of August 31, 2021, with cash on hand of $119,429,000, and a current ratio of 6.5. Cash provided by operating activities of $61,217,000 for fiscal 2021 surpassed the prior year mark of $55,734,000. The Company’s cash position remains healthy, with cash flow from operations more than offsetting the costs to acquire ETi and ABchimie, and to pay an annual dividend during the fiscal year.
The Company held no outstanding balance on its $200,000,000 revolving credit facility as of August 31, 2021. The revolving credit facility, which was amended and restated in July 2021 (fourth quarter of fiscal 2021) to increase its capacity from $150,000,000 to $200,000,000, allows for the Company to pay down debt with excess cash, while retaining access to immediate liquidity to fund future accretive activities, including mergers and acquisitions, as they are identified. The new facility also gives Chase the ability to request an increase in this amount by an additional $100,000,000 ($300,000,000 in total borrowing capacity) at the individual or collective option of any of the lenders. Through amending and restating the credit agreement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, Chase also extended the maturity date of the facility through July 2026.

(j) Includes $511 of pension-related settlement costs due to the timing of lump-sum distributions
Total Revenue
Total revenue in fiscal 2021 increased $32,174,000 or 12% to $293,336,000 from $261,162,000 in the prior year.
Revenue in our Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment increased $30,656,000 or 32% to $126,864,000 for the year ended August 31, 2021 compared to $96,208,000 in fiscal 2020. Organic revenue growth accounted $20,330,000 of the segment’s overall year-to-date period sales increase. The increase in revenue from the Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment in fiscal 2021 was primarily due to the electronic and industrial coatings product line’s $22,392,000 organic and inorganic increase. The operations of ABchimie, acquired September 1, 2020 (first day of fiscal 2021), provided the product line accretive top-line gains, while strong organic gains were seen both domestically and internationally. Also positively impacting the segment’s sales were organic and inorganic increases in revenue from the North American-focused functional additives product line totaling $8,264,000 in the current year. The functional additives product line sales totals included the operations of ETi, following its acquisition on February 5, 2021 (second quarter of fiscal 2021).
Revenue in our Industrial Tapes segment increased $1,913,000 or 2% to $120,873,000 for the year ended August 31, 2021 compared to $118,960,000 in fiscal 2020. The net increase in revenue for the segment was primarily due to the following: (a) the pulling and detection tapes product line saw sales growth of $867,000 over the prior year year-to-date period on a volume and price driven increase; (b) the electronic materials product line, which has a nearly exclusive Asian end-market, saw a volume-driven increase of $865,000 over the prior year-to-date period; and (c) a revenue increase of $329,000 for the year-to-date period for the specialty products product line, with current year growth achieved despite the Company ending its arrangement to provide low margin transitional toll manufacturing services in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 (prior year). Partially offsetting the segment’s sales growth was the North American-focused cable materials product line with a net sales decrease of $148,000 for the full year period.
Revenue from our Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment decreased $395,000 or 1% to $45,599,000 for the year ended August 31, 2021 compared to $45,994,000 for fiscal 2020. The segment’s sales decrease in the current year was predominantly driven by: (a) the pipeline coatings product line’s $2,183,000 largely volume-driven reduction as compared to the prior year to-date period, with the Company’s North American and Rye, U.K.-based facility’s negatively impacted in the current year by industry-wide material supply challenges and a tight labor market; and (b) the bridge and highway product line sales falling short of repeating prior year results by $1,408,000 on lower project demand. Positively affecting the results of the segment were volume and price sales increases of $2,076,000 and $1,120,000 by the coating and lining systems and the building envelope product lines, respectively.
Royalties and commissions in the Adhesive, Sealants and Additives and Industrial Tapes segments totaled $3,534,000 and $3,420,000 for the years ended August 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in royalties and commissions in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to increased sales of electronic and industrial coatings products by our licensed manufacturer in Asia.
Export sales from domestic operations to unaffiliated third parties were $33,439,000 and $30,067,000 for the years ended August 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in export sales in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 is reflective of the company-wide year-over-year increase in sales results, as the Company showed recovery and growth following the period most significantly affected by COVID-19.
Cost of Products and Services Sold
Cost of products and services sold increased $13,045,000 or 8% to $174,660,000 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021 compared to $161,615,000 in fiscal 2020. As a percentage of revenue, cost of products and services sold decreased to 60% in fiscal 2021 compared to 62% for fiscal 2020.
The following table summarizes the relative percentages of cost of products and services sold to revenue for our three operating segments:
Cost of products and services sold in our Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment was $71,805,000 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021 compared to $55,902,000 in fiscal 2020. As a percentage of revenue, cost of products and services sold in this segment decreased to 57% for fiscal 2021 compared to 58% for fiscal 2020. Cost of products and services sold in our Industrial Tapes segment was $77,013,000 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021 compared to $80,351,000 in fiscal 2020. As a percentage of revenue, cost of products and services sold in this segment decreased to 64% in fiscal 2021 compared to 68% for fiscal 2020. Cost of products and services sold in our Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment was $25,842,000 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021 compared to $25,362,000 in fiscal 2020. As a percentage of revenue, cost of products and services sold in this segment increased to 57% in fiscal 2021 compared to 55% in fiscal 2020. As a percentage of revenue, cost of products and services overall decreased primarily due to: (a) more favorable sales mixes in the Adhesives, Sealants and Additives and Industrial Tapes segments, as higher margin products and offerings constituted a comparatively higher portion of total sales; and (b) net production and operational efficiencies realized in the Adhesives, Sealants and Additives and Industrial Tapes segments in the current year, including those gained in part through the facility rationalization and consolidation initiative. All of Chase Corporation’s segments are subject to current global raw material inflationary pressures and supply chain and labor market challenges, and the Company, in line with customer agreements, is addressing this by instituting customer price adjustments across impacted product lines. However, most notably in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, raw material cost increases outpaced customer price adjustments given customer agreement required lead times for price adjustments. Chase Corporation continues to monitor and adjust prices as needed to protect margins in the intermediate and long-term periods.
With the composition of our finished goods and the markets we serve, the costs of certain commodities (including petroleum-based solvents, films, yarns, polymers and nonwovens, aluminum and copper foils, specialty papers, and various resins, adhesives and inks) both directly and indirectly affect the purchase price of our raw materials and the market demand for our product offerings. The Company diligently monitors raw material and commodities pricing across all its product lines in its efforts to preserve margins.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $2,736,000 or 6% to $52,100,000 during fiscal 2021 compared to $49,364,000 in fiscal 2020. As a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 18% of total revenue in fiscal 2021 compared to 19% for fiscal 2020. The Company continues to closely monitor spending with an emphasis on controlling costs and leveraging existing resources.
Research and Product Development Costs
Research and Product Development Costs increased $49,000 or 1% to $4,056,000 during fiscal 2021, compared to $4,007,000 in fiscal 2020. Research and development stayed relatively consistent from fiscal 2020 to 2021 as the Company continued focused development work on strategic product lines.
Operations Optimization Costs
During the third quarter of fiscal 2021, Chase announced to the employees at its Woburn, MA location that its adhesives systems operations, part of the Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment’s electronic and industrial coatings product line, would be consolidating into the Company’s existing O'Hara Township, PA location. This rationalization and consolidation initiative-related announcement aligns with the second quarter announcement of the Company’s plan to move its sealant systems production from Newark, CA to Hickory, NC, described in more detail below. Chase Corporation obtained both the adhesive and sealants systems as part of its fiscal 2017 acquisition of the operations of Resin Designs. No expense was recognized related to the adhesive systems initiative during fiscal 2021, with the majority of future costs anticipated to occur in the first half of fiscal 2022.
During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, Chase began moving the sealant systems operations, part of the Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment’s electronic and industrial coatings product line, from its Newark, CA location to its Hickory, NC facility. This is in line with the Company’s ongoing initiative to consolidate its manufacturing plants and streamline its existing processes. The sealant systems operations and Newark, CA location came to Chase Corporation as part of the fiscal 2017 acquisition of the operations of Resin Designs, and the Company’s lease there terminated in the current fiscal year. The Company recognized $977,000 in expense related to the move during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021. This project is now substantively completed, and any future costs related to this move are not anticipated to be significant to the consolidated financial statements.
During the third fiscal quarter of 2020, the Company implemented changes in its cost structure designed to address market changes brought on, in part, by COVID-19. These changes included a targeted reduction of approximately 4.5% of the Company’s global workforce. This reduction, which was contemplated pre-pandemic but catalyzed by COVID-19, resulted in the recognition of $183,000 in severance costs during the third quarter of fiscal 2020. The reduction in force, which impacted operations in the Blawnox, PA, Hickory, NC, Lenoir, NC, Evanston, IL, Oxford, MA and Westwood, MA facilities, was effective May 2020.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company commissioned third party led studies regarding the potential upgrading of the Company’s current worldwide ERP system. Chase is currently reviewing the data and recommendations provided by the study and may further utilize third-party engineering, IT and other professional services firms in the future for similar work, as well as work around the Company’s facilities rationalization and consolidation initiative. The Company recognized $150,000 in expense related to these services in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, Chase began moving the pulling and detection operations housed in its Granite Falls, NC location to its Hickory, NC facility. This is in line with the Company’s ongoing initiative to consolidate its manufacturing plants and streamline its existing processes. At the time, the pulling and detection operations were the only Chase-owned production operations in Granite Falls, NC, with the remaining portions of the building being either utilized for research and development or leased to a third party. The process of moving, including moving internal research and development capabilities, was substantially completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2020. The Company recognized $559,000 in expense related to the move in the first half of fiscal 2020, having recognized $526,000 in expense during the second half of fiscal 2019. This project is substantively completed. No costs were recorded in the second half of fiscal 2020 or in fiscal 2021, and any future costs related to this move are not anticipated to be significant to the consolidated financial statements.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, Chase commissioned engineering studies of certain legacy operations, machinery and locations related to the Company’s ongoing facility rationalization and consolidation initiative. Chase completed its review of the data and recommendations provided by the study in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 (prior year). The Company recognized $200,000 in expense related to these services in fiscal 2019, and a gain of $170,000 in fiscal 2020, as certain amounts expensed in fiscal 2019 were refunded. Chase may utilize third party engineering, IT and other professional services firms in the future for similar optimization-related work. Given the ongoing nature of the facility rationalization and consolidation initiative, an estimate of future costs cannot currently be determined.
During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company announced to its employees the planned closing of its Pawtucket, RI manufacturing facility effective August 31, 2018. The manufacture of products previously produced in the Pawtucket, RI facility was substantially moved to Company facilities in Oxford, MA and Lenoir, NC during a two-month transition period. The Company completed the sale of its Pawtucket, RI location to a third-party in April 2020, for net proceeds totaling $1,810,000. This transaction resulted in a gain of $760,000 which was recorded during the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Also, during the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company recognized $85,000 in final Pawtucket, RI transition and exit costs, with no further costs related to this initiative anticipated in future periods.
Acquisition-Related Costs
In the second quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company incurred $128,000 of costs related to our February 5, 2021 acquisition of Emerging Technologies, Inc (“ETi”). This acquisition was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with applicable accounting standards, and all related professional service fees (including legal, accounting and actuarial fees) were expensed as incurred within the second fiscal quarter of 2021.
In fiscal 2020, the Company incurred $274,000 of costs related to our acquisition of ABchimie. This acquisition was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with applicable accounting standards, and all related professional service fees (including banking, legal, accounting and actuarial fees) were expensed as incurred within the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2020. The transaction was consummated at the beginning of fiscal 2021.
Gain on Sale of Real Estate
In August 2020, the Company finalized the sale of its Randolph, MA property for net proceeds of $1,805,000. This transaction resulted in a gain of $1,791,000 which was recorded during the quarter ended August 31, 2020 (fiscal 2020).
In April 2020, the Company finalized the sale of its Pawtucket, RI location for net proceeds of $1,810,000. This transaction resulted in a gain of $760,000 which was recorded during the quarter ended May 31, 2020 (fiscal 2020).
Write-down of certain assets under construction
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company wrote down the value of certain non-operating production assets related to the pipeline coatings product line, within the Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment. Given the nature and prospects of the equipment, the Company determined its then carrying value exceeded its fair value and recognized an expense of $100,000 related to the machinery.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, given the results and recommendations of a commissioned engineering study, the Company wrote down the value of certain non-operating production assets related to the pipeline coatings product line, within the Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment. Given the nature and prospects of the equipment, the Company determined its then carrying value exceeded its fair value and recognized an expense of $405,000 related to the machinery.
Loss on Contingent Consideration
As a component of the September 1, 2020 acquisition of ABchimie, the Company incurred a performance-based earn out liability potentially worth an additional €7,000,000 (approximately $8,330,000 at the time of the transaction) in consideration. Following its initial recording of an accrual for $928,000 at the acquisition date, $1,664,000 in expense related to adjustments to the performance-based earn out accrual were recorded to the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended August 31, 2021.
Interest Expense
Interest expense increased $51,000 or 21% to $297,000 in fiscal 2021 compared to $246,000 in fiscal 2020. As the Company had no outstanding balance on its revolving debt facility for both periods, interest expense has remained relatively low.
Other Income (Expense)
Other expense was $760,000 in fiscal 2021 compared to other expense of $1,675,000 in fiscal 2020, a decrease of $915,000. Other income (expense) primarily includes foreign exchange gains (losses) caused by changes in exchange rates on transactions or balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries, non-service cost components of periodic pension expense (including pension-related settlement costs due to the timing of lump-sum distributions), interest income, rental income and other non-trade/non-royalty/non-commission receipts. The decrease in total other expense in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was largely due to the recognition of a smaller foreign exchange loss in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020.
Income Taxes
Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 was 23.3% as compared to 24.6% in fiscal 2020.
The current and prior years’ effective tax rates were most prominently affected by the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) in December 2017. For fiscal 2021 and 2020, the Company utilized the new 21% Federal tax rate enacted by the Tax Act. Please see Note 7 - “Income Taxes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the effects of the Tax Act.
Net Income
Net income increased $10,763,000 or 32% to $44,920,000 compared to $34,157,000 in fiscal 2020. The increase in net income in the year-to-date period was primarily due to higher sales and an improved relative gross margin.
Liquidity and Sources of Capital
Our cash balance increased $20,361,000 to $119,429,000 at August 31, 2021 from $99,068,000 at August 31, 2020. The increased cash balance was primarily attributable to cash from operations of $61,217,000, net of $22,241,000 utilized to acquire ABchimie on September 1, 2020, $8,997,000 utilized to acquire the operations of Emerging Technologies, Inc. (“ETi”) on February 5, 2021 and the $7,557,000 dividend paid in December 2020. Of the above noted balances, $26,309,000 and $42,615,000 were held outside the U.S. by Chase Corporation and our foreign subsidiaries as of August 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Given our cash position and borrowing capability in the United States and the potential for increased investment and acquisitions in foreign jurisdictions, prior to the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we did not have a history of repatriating a significant portion of our foreign cash. With the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) in the second fiscal quarter of 2018, significant changes in the Internal Revenue Code were enacted, changing the U.S. taxable nature of previously unrepatriated foreign earnings. We repatriated $10,499,000 in U.K. foreign earnings in fiscal 2018 and $17,230,000 in fiscal 2019. We do not currently take the position that undistributed foreign subsidiaries’ earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested. See Note 7 - “Income Taxes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for further discussion of the effects of the Tax Act.
Cash provided by operations was $61,217,000 for the year ended August 31, 2021 compared to $55,734,000 in fiscal 2020. Cash provided by operations during fiscal 2021 was primarily due to operating income and increased accounts payable, partially offset by an elevated level of accounts receivable (resulting from increased sales).
The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 6.5 as of August 31, 2021 compared to 7.7 as of August 31, 2020. The decrease in our current ratio in fiscal 2021 was primarily attributable to increased accounts payable on normal trade activity during the period.
Cash used in investing activities was $33,927,000 for the year ended August 31, 2021 compared to $2,077,000 in cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2020. During fiscal 2021, cash used in investing activities was largely due to the cash on hand purchases of both ABchimie and ETi and cash spent on capital purchases of machinery and equipment.
Cash used in financing activities was $8,248,000 for the year ended August 31, 2021 compared to $8,420,000 used in financing activities in fiscal 2020. Chase paid annual dividends of $7,557,000 and $7,539,000 in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
On November 15, 2021, Chase announced a cash dividend of $1.00 per share (totaling approximately $9,457,000) to shareholders of record on November 30, 2021 and payable on December 9, 2021.
On November 12, 2020, Chase announced a cash dividend of $0.80 per share (totaling $7,557,000) to shareholders of record on November 27, 2020 and payable on December 7, 2020.
On July 27, 2021 (the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021), the Company entered into the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “New Credit Agreement”) by and among the Company (the “Chase Borrower”), NEPTCO Incorporated (“NEPTCO”), the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, the financial institutions party thereto as Lenders, and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, with participation from Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., PNC Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The New Credit Agreement was entered into to amend, restate and extend the Company’s preexisting Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Prior Credit Agreement”), which had a maturity date of December 15, 2021 and is discussed in more detail below, and to provide for additional liquidity to finance acquisitions, working capital and capital expenditures, and for other general corporate purposes. Under the New Credit Agreement, Chase obtained an increased revolving credit loan (the “New Revolving Facility”), with borrowing capabilities not to exceed $200,000,000 at any time, with the ability to request an increase in this amount by an additional $100,000,000 at the individual or collective option of any of the Lenders. The applicable interest rate for the New Revolving Facility and New Term Loan (defined below) is based on the effective London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a range of 1.00% to 1.75%, depending on the consolidated net leverage ratio of Chase and its subsidiaries. At August 31, 2021, there was no outstanding principal balance, and as such, no applicable interest rate. The New Credit Agreement has a five-year term with interest payments due at the end of the applicable LIBOR period (but in no event less frequently than the three-month anniversary of the commencement of such LIBOR period) and principal payment due at the expiration
of the agreement, July 27, 2026. The New Credit Agreement contains provisions that may replace LIBOR as the benchmark index under certain circumstances. In addition, the Company may elect a base rate option for all or a portion of the New Revolving Facility, in which case interest payments shall be due with respect to such portion of the New Revolving Facility on the last business day of each quarter. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the New Credit Agreement, the Company may elect to convert all or a portion of the outstanding New Revolving Facility into a new term loan twice during the term of the New Revolving Facility (each, a “New Term Loan”, and collectively with the New Revolving Facility, the “New Credit Facility”), which New Term Loan shall be payable quarterly in equal installments sufficient to amortize the original principal amount of such Term Loan on a ten year amortization schedule. The outstanding balance on the New Credit Facility is guaranteed by all of Chase’s direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries. The New Credit Facility is subject to restrictive covenants under the New Credit Agreement, and financial covenants that require Chase and its subsidiaries to maintain certain financial ratios on a consolidated basis, including a consolidated net leverage ratio of 3.25 to 1.00 and a consolidated interest coverage ratio of 3.50 to 1.00 (both defined in the New Credit Agreement). Chase Corporation was in compliance with the debt covenants as of August 31, 2021. The New Credit Agreement also places certain Lender-approval requirements as to the size of permitted acquisitions which may be entered into by the Company and its subsidiaries, and allows for a temporary step-up in the allowed consolidated leverage ratio for the four fiscal quarters ending after certain designated acquisitions. Prepayment is allowed by the New Credit Agreement at any time during the term of the agreement, subject to customary notice requirements and the payment of customary LIBOR breakage fees.
In connection with entry into the New Credit Agreement, Chase amended and restated its Prior Credit Agreement, the full amount of which was substantially available as of July 27, 2021.
The Prior Credit Agreement was an all-revolving credit facility with a borrowing capacity of $150,000,000, which could be increased by an additional $50,000,000 at the request of the Company and the individual or collective option of any of the lenders, and with an interest rate based on the effective LIBOR plus an additional amount in the range of 1.00% to 1.75%, depending on our consolidated net leverage ratio or, at the Company’s option, at the bank’s base lending rate. At August 31, 2020 there was no outstanding principal balance, and as such, no applicable interest rate. Chase Corporation was in compliance with the covenants under the Prior Credit Facility as of August 31, 2020 (prior year).
The Company has several ongoing capital projects, as well as its facility rationalization and consolidation initiative, which are important to its long-term strategic goals. Machinery and equipment may be added as needed to increase capacity or enhance operating efficiencies in the Company’s production facilities.
During the second and third fiscal quarters of 2021, respectively, the Company announced plans to consolidate its Newark, CA operations into its Hickory, NC facility, and its Woburn, MA operations into its O’Hara Township, PA facility. The consolidation of the Newark, CA facility was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, and the consolidation of the Woburn, MA facility is anticipated to be completed in the first half of fiscal 2022. During the third fiscal quarter of 2020, the Company implemented changes in its cost structure designed to address market changes brought on, in part, by COVID-19. These changes included a targeted reduction of approximately 4.5% of the Company’s global workforce. During fiscal 2019, the Company announced it had begun moving the production of its pulling and detection products from its Granite Falls, NC location to its Hickory, NC location, with completion of the move occurring in the first half of fiscal 2020. During fiscal 2018, the Company announced the planned closing of its Pawtucket, RI manufacturing facility effective August 31, 2018. The manufacturing of products previously produced in the Pawtucket, RI facility was moved to Company facilities in Oxford, MA and Lenoir, NC, and the facility was subsequently sold in fiscal 2020. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company commissioned engineering studies to assess potential future operational changes and further plant rationalization and consolidation. These actions are in line with the Company’s ongoing efforts to consolidate its manufacturing plants and streamline its processes. A total of all potential future costs arising from any further plant rationalization and consolidation cannot be estimated at this time.
We may acquire companies or other assets in future periods which are complementary to our business. The acquisition of ABchimie included a potential earnout based on performance of up to an additional €7,000,000 (approximately $8,330,000 at the time of the transaction), which the Company expects to pay with cash on hand if the applicable conditions are met. The acquisition of ETi includes a $1,000,000 withholding, which is payable by the Company within eighteen months of the acquisition. The Company believes that its existing resources, including cash on hand and the New Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, together with cash generated from operations and additional bank borrowings, will be sufficient to fund its cash flow requirements through at least the next twelve months. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing, if needed, will be available on favorable terms, if at all.
To the extent that interest rates increase in future periods, we will assess the impact of these higher interest rates on the financial and cash flow projections of our potential acquisitions.
We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements.
Contractual Cash Obligations
The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at August 31, 2021 under operating leases and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (dollars in thousands):
We may be required to make payments related to our unrecognized tax benefits. Due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with these unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. Accordingly, the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits was $2,190,000 as of August 31, 2021. See Note 7 - “Income Taxes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
We also expect to make payments as needed to satisfy our funding obligations for our obligations for pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. As of August 31, 2021, we had recognized an accrued benefit plan liability of $10,981,000 representing the unfunded obligations of the pension benefit plans. See Note 9 - “Benefits and Pension Plans” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information, including expected pension benefit payments for the next 10 years.
The Company does not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed expected requirements or extend beyond one year.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
For discussion of the newly issued accounting pronouncements see “Recently Adopted Accounting Standards” in Note 1 - “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.
Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments, and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 - “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) requires companies to provide additional disclosure and commentary on their most critical accounting policies and estimates. The SEC has defined critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and operating results, and require management to make its most significant estimates and judgments in the preparation of its Consolidated Financial Statements. The SEC has defined critical accounting estimates as those estimates made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of a company.
Judgments, assumptions, and estimates are used for, but not limited to, the allowances for accounts receivable; inventory allowances; business combinations, goodwill, intangible assets, and other long-lived assets; revenue; income tax reserves; deferred income taxes; stock-based compensation; as well as discount and return rates used to calculate pension obligations. The accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates.
Business Combinations
We assign the value of the consideration transferred to acquire a business to the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired, and liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition. The Company’s assess the fair value of assets, including intangible assets, using a variety of methods, and each asset is measured at fair value from the perspective of a market participant. The method used to estimate the fair values of intangible assets incorporates significant assumptions regarding the estimates a market participant would make in order to evaluate an asset, including a market participant’s use of the asset and the appropriate discount rates for a market participant. Assets recorded from the perspective of a market participant that are determined to not have economic use for the Company are expensed immediately. Any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. Transaction costs and restructuring costs associated with a transaction to acquire a business are expensed as incurred.
Contingent Consideration
In connection with accounting for the ABchimie acquisition on September 1, 2020, the Company recorded a contingent consideration liability included within Other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The contingent consideration liability was valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model in an option pricing framework based on key inputs requiring significant judgments and estimates to be made by the Company, including forecasts of future earnings over the multiyear period encompassed by the earnout, and that are not all observable in the market, which represents a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. The Company assesses the fair value of the contingent consideration liability at each reporting period. Any subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the liability are reflected in Loss on contingent consideration on the consolidated statement of operations until the liability is settled. If fully realized, the contingent consideration due would total €7,000,000 (approximately $8,330,000 at the time of the initial transaction).
Impact of Inflation
Inflation has not had a significant long-term impact on our earnings, with the impact of the current inflationary period most acutely limited to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. In the event of significant inflation over an extended period of time, our continued efforts to recover cost increases could be hampered as a result of the competitive nature of the industries in which we operate. Future volatility of general price inflation or deflation and raw material cost and availability could adversely affect our financial results.
