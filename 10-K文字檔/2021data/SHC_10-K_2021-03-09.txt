Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including the factors we describe in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
OVERVIEW
We are a leading global provider of mission-critical sterilization and lab testing and advisory services to the medical device and pharmaceutical industries. We are driven by our mission: Safeguarding Global Health®. We provide end-to-end sterilization as well as microbiological and analytical lab testing and advisory services to help ensure that medical, pharmaceutical and food products are safe for healthcare practitioners, patients and consumers in the United States and around the world. Our customers include more than 40 of the top 50 medical device companies and eight of the top ten global pharmaceutical companies (based on revenue). Our services are an essential aspect of our customers’ manufacturing process and supply chains, helping to ensure sterilized medical products reach healthcare practitioners and patients. Most of these services are necessary for our customers to satisfy applicable government requirements. We give our customers confidence that their products meet regulatory, safety and effectiveness requirements. With a combined tenure across our businesses of nearly 200 years and our industry-recognized scientific and technological expertise, we help to ensure the safety of millions of patients and healthcare practitioners around the
world every year. Across our 64 facilities worldwide, we have nearly 3,000 employees who are dedicated to safety and quality. We are a trusted partner to more than 5,800 customers in over 50 countries.
We serve our customers throughout their product lifecycles, from product design to manufacturing and delivery, helping to ensure the sterility, effectiveness and safety of their products for the end user. We operate across two core businesses: sterilization services and lab services. Each of our businesses has a longstanding record and is a leader in its respective market, supported and connected by our core capabilities including deep end market, regulatory, technical and logistics expertise. The combination of Sterigenics, our terminal sterilization business, and Nordion, our Co-60 supply business, makes us the only vertically integrated global gamma sterilization provider in the sterilization industry. This provides us with additional insights and allows us to better serve our customers. For financial reporting purposes, our sterilization services business consists of two reportable segments, Sterigenics and Nordion, and our lab services business consists of one reportable segment, Nelson Labs.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded net revenues of $818.2 million, net loss of $37.5 million, Adjusted Net Income of $99.1 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $419.9 million. For the definition of Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures from net income (loss), please see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” More than 90% of our sterilization services revenues for year ended December 31, 2020 were from customers under multi-year contracts.
TRENDS AND KEY FACTORS AFFECTING OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
We expect that our performance and financial condition will continue to be driven by the key trends impacting our industries, customers and their end markets as outlined in Item 1, “Business”. In addition, we believe the following trends and key factors have underpinned our recent operating results and may continue to affect our performance and financial condition in future periods.
•Continue to drive organic growth. We drive organic growth through increasing utilization of our existing capacity and expanding our capacity and service offerings. In our Sterigenics business, we are investing in additional capacity at existing facilities and building new facilities. In our Nordion business, we are developing further supply relationships and expanding our capabilities to source Co-60 from additional reactors. In our Nelson Labs business, we are investing to expand our geographic reach, technical expertise and regulatory know-how to stay ahead of the dynamic and increasingly stringent regulatory landscape in the healthcare industry, and drive growth in our advisory services offering.
•Disciplined and strategic M&A activity. We have completed several strategic transactions that have expanded our addressable market and enhanced our global capabilities and footprint. In 2017, we acquired Toxikon Europe NV (now known as Nelson Laboratories Europe), a lab services business with extractable and leachables testing services. In 2018, we acquired Gibraltar Laboratories, Inc. (now known as Nelson Laboratories Fairfield, Inc.) (“Nelson Fairfield”), a provider of microbiological and analytical chemistry testing. In July 2020, we acquired Iotron Industries Canada, Inc. (“Iotron”), an E-beam processing services and equipment provider. In March 2021, we acquired BioScience Laboratories, LLC based in Bozeman, Montana, for approximately $15 million, bringing expertise in antimicrobial and virology testing to our Nelson Labs segment. We also completed the sale of our former Medical Isotopes business to a subsidiary of BWX Technologies, Inc. in 2018 to monetize a noncore asset, the proceeds from which we reinvested in our core businesses. We are continuing to pursue strategic acquisitions to grow our footprint and expand our capabilities.
•Business optimization and cost savings initiatives. We have conducted several business optimization and cost savings projects in connection with the integrations of Nordion and Nelson Labs and the creation of the Sotera Health “One Company” platform. These projects included consolidation of certain back office functions into a shared service model, optimization and harmonization of certain systems, insurance lines and benefits programs and rebranding the company under the name Sotera Health. Additionally, we have realigned our operating structure and made enhancements to certain processes. These projects have resulted in more efficient operations, working capital improvement and a more integrated and robust control and governance environment. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 we incurred $2.5 million and $4.2 million, respectively, in connection with implementing these projects. These measures have contributed in part to our 1.6% operating margin improvement and 2.5% of Adjusted EBITDA margin improvement in 2020, and our 12.8% operating margin improvement and 3.2% of Adjusted EBITDA margin improvement in 2019. For the definition of Adjusted EBITDA and the reconciliation of these measures from net income (loss), please see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”
•Exit activities and litigation costs. We are currently the subject of a series of tort lawsuits alleging personal injury by purported exposure to EO emitted by our facility in Willowbrook, Illinois. We are also the subject of tort lawsuits
alleging personal injury and property devaluation by purported exposure to EO emitted by our facility in Atlanta, Georgia. We deny these allegations and are vigorously defending against these claims. In addition, we have been involved in litigation with local officials related to claims of loss of neighboring property value. We have resumed operations at our Atlanta facility that had been temporarily suspended to facilitate enhancements to our EO emissions control equipment. We are also defendants in a lawsuit brought by the State of New Mexico Attorney General alleging that emissions of EO from our Santa Teresa facility constitute a public nuisance, have materially contributed to increased health risks suffered by residents in the area, and that injunctive relief should be awarded requiring us to cease any and all uncontrolled emissions or releases of EO from the Santa Teresa facility, including by making certain modifications to sterilization processes at the facility. We expect that our litigation costs will increase during the pendency of these cases, particularly as the per occurrence limit of our environmental liability insurance was reached for the Willowbrook litigation in the second quarter of 2020 and as we prepare for the commencement of the first personal injury trials for the Willowbrook litigation currently scheduled to occur in 2021. See Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” and Note 20, “Commitments and Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we recorded costs of $36.7 million and $11.2 million, respectively, relating to legal and other professional service costs associated with the Willowbrook, Atlanta, and Santa Teresa facilities. On September 30, 2019, we announced plans to exit our EO sterilization operations in Willowbrook and recorded a fixed asset impairment and have continued to incur certain transitional costs during the closure process including lease costs, payroll and utility expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we recorded costs of $2.6 million and $1.7 million, respectively, relating to the closure of our Willowbrook facility.
•Impacts of our IPO. We completed the initial public offering of our common stock in November 2020. The IPO generated net proceeds of $1.2 billion after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering costs. In conjunction with the IPO, we recognized $4.9 million of share based compensation expense as further described in Note 16, “Share-Based Compensation” to our consolidated financial statements. As a newly public company we will incur significant expenses on an ongoing basis that we did not incur as a private company. Those costs include additional board fees and director and officer liability insurance expenses, as well as third-party and internal resources related to accounting, auditing, Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance, legal, and investor and public relations expenses. These costs will generally be classified as Selling, General & Administrative (“SG&A”) expenses. Additionally, in connection with our IPO, we implemented the 2020 Plan (as previously defined in Item 1A, “Risk Factors”), a long-term equity incentive plan to align our equity compensation program with public company plans and practices.
•Borrowings, financing costs and financial leverage. In December 2019, SHH entered into new Senior Secured Credit Facilities (which consist of a senior secured first lien term loan and senior secured first lien revolving credit facility). The Senior Secured Credit Facilities were subsequently amended on December 17, 2020 to include a revolving commitment increase and additional letter of credit sublimits. In July 2020, SHH also issued $100.0 million of senior secured first lien notes to finance, in part, the Iotron acquisition. A portion of the net proceeds from our IPO were used to redeem all of the outstanding $770.0 million Second Lien Notes and to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under our Term Loan. For these two transactions combined, we wrote off $28.9 million of debt issuance and discount costs and recognized $15.4 million in premiums paid. The majority of our long-term debt, all of which is prepayable, is not due until 2026 or later. In January 2021, we closed on an amendment repricing our Term Loan which resulted in an effective reduction in current interest rates of 2.25% and expected cash interest savings of approximately $40.0 million per year. Interest savings will be partially offset by cash and non-cash charges incurred in the first quarter of 2021 associated with the repricing amendment. Going forward, absent any changes in interest rates, we expect a decrease in cash interest expense in future periods due to a combination of lower outstanding debt and reduced pricing.
•Impact of U.S. tax reform. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (“TCJA”) was signed into law. The legislation significantly changed U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates to 21%, implementing an inclusion item for global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) and limiting interest expense deductions to 30% of U.S. adjusted taxable income. The CARES Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020 and temporarily increases the interest expense deduction limitation to 50% of U.S. adjusted taxable income for both 2019 and 2020. On July 23, 2020, 951A final regulations were published that exempt income subject to a high rate of foreign tax from inclusion under GILTI for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017.
In 2020 and 2019, we recognized GILTI current tax expense of $2.6 million and $10.3 million, respectively, as a result of final 951A regulations. The TCJA limits the deductibility of interest expense in any given year and any amounts not currently deductible may be carried forward indefinitely. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $68.0 million and $41.5 million, respectively, of deferred tax assets relating to interest expense from 2020 and prior years that was not deductible in the originating period. Although the CARES Act provides for an increased interest expense deductibility limitation, the reduction in Adjusted Taxable Income (“ATI”) realized as a result of the final 951A regulations resulted
in a $43.8 million valuation allowance recorded in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $23.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. We do not expect to fully realize the benefit of interest expense incurred in future periods and therefore may recognize a valuation allowance on any related deferred tax assets generated in those future periods that will impact our annual effective income tax rate.
•Foreign currency exchange rates. As a result of our global operations, we generate a significant portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We translate the assets, liabilities, net revenues and expenses of all of our operations into U.S. dollars at applicable exchange rates, and therefore we experience gains and losses related to exchange rate fluctuations.
