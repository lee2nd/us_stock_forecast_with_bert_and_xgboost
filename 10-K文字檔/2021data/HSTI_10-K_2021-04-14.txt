Plan of Operation
Our plan of operation for the next 12 months is to: (i) market the licensing of the Company’s technology in states in the U.S. where cannabis and/or hemp has been legalized both for medicinal and/or recreational use, and in the Canadian provinces; and (ii) seek to raise additional equity funding so that the Company may pursue the construction and operation of a facility to produce and market hemp cigarettes to be located in Northern Nevada. During the next 12 months, our cash requirements include expenses to market our technology; expenses to construct and operate a facility to produce and market hemp cigarettes to be located in Northern Nevada; the payment of our SEC reporting and filing expenses, including associated legal and accounting fees; and costs incident to maintaining our good standing as a corporation in our state of organization. We anticipate that we will need to raise additional equity funds to successfully commence and operate a facility to produce and market hemp cigarettes. We have no commitments to raise any additional funds at the present time, and we can offer no assurance that we will be able to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to the Company.

Results of Operations
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared Year Ended December 31, 2019
We had no revenues during the year ended December 31, 2020. We hope to start earning revenues during the present fiscal year ending December 31, 2021.
We incurred general and administrative expenses of $222,561 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $22,531 over the $200,030 of general and administrative expenses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2019. We incurred depreciation of $35,350 in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $15,705 incurred in the year ended December 31, 2019. We sustained a crop loss of $246,914 in the year ended December 31, 2019 due to the poor quality of the seeds that were purchased. We had no crop loss expense in the year ended December 31, 2020.
We incurred interest expense of $42,955 in the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $29,926 from the $13,029 of interest expense incurred in the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is due to the increase in aggregate principal balance of the Notes Payable in the later period from increased borrowings, and increases in interest rates in some of the Notes Payable in the later period. We also incurred interest expense - related party of $4,645 in the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $4,076 from the $569 of interest expense - related party incurred in the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is due to the increase in aggregate principal balance of the Notes Payable-Related Party in the later period from increased borrowings, and increases in interest rates in some of the Notes Payable-Related Party in the later period.
We incurred a net loss of $305,511, or approximately $0.02 per share, in the year ended December 31, 2020, which is $170,736 less than the net loss of $476,247 incurred in the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in the net loss incurred in the later period is largely attributable to the reduction of $246,914 in crop loss in the later period, partially offset by increases of $22,531 in general and administrative expenses and increases in interest expense, interest expense-related party and depreciation incurred in the later period.

Going Concern
The Company’s financial statements have been presented on the basis that it is a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has sustained operating losses during the current year-to-date and may not achieve the level of profitable operations to sustain its activities. These factors raise substantial doubt as to its ability to obtain debt and/or equity financing and achieve profitable operations.
Management intends to raise additional operating funds to fund operations for the next 12 months through proceeds to be received from the planned sale of our hemp farming equipment, and through raising funds through equity and/or debt offerings. However, there can be no assurance management will be successful in its endeavors. Ultimately, the Company will need to achieve profitable operations in order to continue as a going concern.
There are no assurances that the Company will be able to either (1) achieve a level of revenues adequate to generate sufficient cash flow from operations; or (2) obtain additional financing through either private placement, public offerings and/or bank financing necessary to support its working capital requirements. To the extent that funds generated from operations and any private placements, public offerings and/or bank financing are insufficient, the Company will have to raise additional working capital. No assurance can be given that additional financing will be available, or if available, will be on terms acceptable to the Company. If adequate working capital is not available to the Company it may be required to curtail its operations.
Emerging Growth Company Critical Accounting Policy Disclosure

As an emerging grown company, the Company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. The Company may elect to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period in the future.
