Going Concern
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has a working capital deficit of $264,888 and has an accumulated deficit of $340,888. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders, the ability to raise equity or debt financing, and the attainment of profitable operations from the Company's future business. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
Trends
We are in the pre-development stage, have not generated any revenue and have no prospects of generating any revenue in the foreseeable future. We are unaware of any known trends, events or uncertainties that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on our business or income, either in the long term of short term.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to our stockholders.
Inflation
The effect of inflation on our revenues and operating results has not been significant.
Subsequent Events
On June 1, 2021, our board of directors approved changing our corporate name from Tactical Services, Inc. to CGS International, Inc. Additionally, on June 1, 2021, our Board of Directors approved a reverse stock split of our issued and authorized shares of common stock on the basis of 400 old shares for one (1) new share. When approved, our issued and outstanding capital will decrease from 76,000,000 shares of common stock to 190,000 shares of common stock. The $0.001 par value of our common shares will remain unchanged.
The resolutions of our Board of Directors approving the above described reverse stock split and name change are subject to the prior approval by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). In anticipation of submitting to FINRA, on June 7, 2021, we filed with the Nevada Secretary of State (i) a Certificate of Change Pursuant to NRS 78.209 reflecting the reverse stock split and (ii) a Certificate for Reinstatement via which we also filed an Application for Reinstatement or Revival form changing our name to CGS International, Inc., thereby effectively amending our Articles of Incorporation.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our financial statements are presented in United States dollars and are prepared using the accrual method of accounting which conforms to US GAAP.
Use of Estimates and Assumptions
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods presented. We are required to make judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Although, we believe our judgments and estimates are appropriate, actual future results may be different; if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be materially different from our reported results.
Income Taxes
The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax balances. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted or substantially enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the date of enactment or substantive enactment.
