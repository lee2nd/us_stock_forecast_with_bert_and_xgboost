Overview
We are a growth-oriented Transportation Services company focused on the domestic logistics market. Our primary business objective is to grow our operations and create value for our stockholders through organic growth and strategic acquisitions. We have implemented a Buy & Build growth strategy of acquiring middle market transportation companies and generating organic growth post-acquisition when possible by removing business constraints and strategic cross-selling of services benefiting us with higher equipment utilization and market share. We believe our business focus and equipment fleet position us to be significant participant in the domestic United States infrastructure market. Our wholly owned operating subsidiaries are:
Our wholly-owned operating subsidiaries are:
· 5J Trucking LLC
· 5J Oilfield Services LLC
· 5J Specialized LLC
· 5J Transportation LLC

Together these business units are referred to as the “5J Transportation Group”.
Our operating subsidiaries provide a range of Transportation Services such as:
·

In connection with our focus to expand our Transportation Services business and exit certain up-stream oil and gas (O&G) industrial-related businesses, the financial results of the following business have been classified as as discontinued operations on our consolidated financial statements for the following businesses:
· MG Cleaners LLC. The Company sold this business in December 2020
· Trinity Services LLC
We are headquartered in Houston, Texas with facilities in Tomball, Odessa, Floresville, Henderson, Victoria and Palestine, Texas. Our web site is www.SMGIndustries.com.
Acquisition, divestiture and wind-down of businesses
On February 27, 2020, we acquired one hundred percent of the membership interests of each of 5J Oilfield Services LLC (“5J Oilfield”) and 5J Trucking LLC (“5J Trucking”), combined referred to as “5J”. The aggregate purchase price of 5J was $12.7 million, consisting of a combination of cash, notes and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock.
In December 2020 we sold MG Cleaners LLC (“MG”), an O&G drilling rig cleaning company. The assets of MG are reflected on the December 31, 2019 Consolidated Balance Sheet as “assets of discontinued operations” and the results of operations are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 as “net loss from discontinued operations”.
In December 2020, the Company decided to sell Trinity Services LLC (“Trinity”), an O&G drilling pad dirt construction company, and is currently in the disposition process. The assets and operations of Trinity are reflected on the December 31, 2020 and 2019 Consolidated Balance Sheets as “assets of discontinued operations” and the results of operations are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 as “net loss from discontinued operations”.
Management believes certain comparisons of 2020 to 2019 are not meaningful as the variances are due almost entirely to the 5J acquisition. Where applicable, this analysis provides explanation of any meaningful causes of variances that are in addition to variances resulting from the 5J acquisition.
Results of Operations
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019
The Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2020 present the assets and liabilities of MG and Trinity as discontinued operations. The Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years end December 31, 2020 and 2019 present the results of MG and Trinity as Net loss from discontinued operations. The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years end December 31, 2020 and 2019 present operating, investing and financing activities of MG and Trinity as cash flows from or used in discontinued operations.
Sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased to $26,665,719 from $508,659 for the year ended December 31, 2019, driven primarily by from the acquisition of 5J in February 2020. The lower than expected revenues are the result of reduced customer activity from the global COVID pandemic and related variants and its economic affects in the markets we serve.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, cost of sales increased to $29,477,208, or 110.5% of sales, compared to $967,305, or 190.2% of sales for the 2019 period. The increase in cost of sales is due primarily to the 5J acquisition. The cost of sales exceeding revenues during 2020 and 2019 was the result of lower than expected revenues available to cover fixed costs within cost of sales. Cost of sales includes non-cash depreciation expense of $4,901,689 for the year ended a December 31, 2020, and $221,305 for the comparable period in 2019.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased to $5,267,186, or approximately 19.8% of revenues, compared to $1,707,982 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was due primarily to the 5J acquisition. Share based compensation expense included in SG&A expenses was $66,566 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $246,099 for the same period in 2019. Bad debt expense included in SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $474,708, as compared to bad debt expense of $52,737 in 2019 resulting from uncollectable accounts receivables from certain customers.
Impairment expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1,084,671 and $565,466 in the prior year. The expenses in 2020 related primarily to the full impairment of goodwill for the oil tools and the frac water equipment at Momentum. In 2019, the impairment expense of goodwill was associated with the oil tools.
Acquisition costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1,485,829 and were related to the acquisition of 5J in February 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2019, acquisition costs were $70,945 and related to the acquisition of Trinity.
Interest expense, net, increased to $3,801,020 during the year ended December 31, 2020 from $573,028 during the year ended December 31, 2019, resulting from increased borrowings to fund the 5J acquisition. Gain on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $94,339 related to forgiveness on PPP loans.
Loss on settlement of notes payable in the year end December 31, 2020 was $14,204, compared to a loss on settlement of liabilities in 2019 of $101,251 which resulted from the settlement of two notes payable during 2019.
Gain on sale of assets for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $220,315 was primarily related to the disposal of 5J assets.
The net loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $14,105,158 as compared to a net loss of $3,459,490 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our increase in net loss in 2020 was primarily attributable to lower than expected revenues to cover fixed costs due primarily to the COVID-19 pandemic, $1,084,671 of impairment expense, $1,485,829 of transaction costs of the 5J acquisition and $3,801,020 of net interest expense.
We plan to address our net loss and future operating results with a goal to achieve positive cash flow from operations by increasing sales organically or through acquisitions, covering more fixed costs within cost of sales, improving gross margins with better sales mix adding more higher margin service revenues such as super heavy haul, and reducing general and administrative costs including professional fees.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash used in investing activities consisted of $500,000 cash paid for the acquisition of Trinity and $28,107 of net capital expenditures.
Financing activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $11,759,723 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $886,010 for the year ended December 31, 2019, including $484,235 and $170,130, respectively, related to discontinued operations.

Our cash flows from operations are primarily funded through our financing activities, including our accounts receivable line of credit facility, notes and loans, stock sales, issuing our stock for services and various leases. Currently, we believe we will need to continue to utilize lines of credit, borrowings and stock sales to sufficiently sustain our current level of operations for the next 12 months. At present, we believe the industry and general domestic economic activity is still depressed given current commodity prices and the global COVID-19 pandemic that is prevalent in the markets we operate. We likely will require additional capital to maintain or expand operations. Additionally, we believe any material acquisition of another operating company would require additional outside capital consisting of debt or equity. Failure to secure additional funds could significantly hamper our ongoing operations particularly if a down cycle in our industry continues further. As the business cycle improves, and the pandemic dissipates in the markets we serve, we plan to improve our cash flows provided in operating activities by focusing on increasing sales by increasing utilization of the assets we have acquired and offering higher value services that receive higher gross margins. However, there can be no assurances given of industry improvement, pandemic relief or improved cash flows of our business.
Historically, we have funded our capital expenditures internally through cash flow, leasing and financing arrangements. We intend to continue to fund future capital expenditures through cash flow, as well as through capital available to us pursuant to our line of credit, capital from the sale of our equity securities and through commercial leasing and financing programs.
