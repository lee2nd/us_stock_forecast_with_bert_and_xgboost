Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Business Overview
Our Company
We are the leading party goods company by revenue in North America and, we believe, the largest vertically integrated supplier of decorated party goods globally by revenue. The Company is a popular one-stop shopping destination for party supplies, balloons, and costumes. In addition to being a great retail brand, the Company is a global, world-class organization that combines state-of-the-art manufacturing and sourcing operations, and sophisticated wholesale operations complemented by a multi-channel retailing strategy and e-commerce retail operations. The Company is a leading player in its category and vertically integrated in its breadth and depth. The Company designs, manufactures, sources and distributes party goods, including paper and plastic tableware, metallic and latex balloons, Halloween and other costumes, accessories, novelties, gifts and stationery throughout the world. The Company’s retail operations include 831 specialty retail party supply stores (including franchise stores) throughout the United States and Mexico operating under the names Party City and Halloween City, and e-commerce websites, including through the domain name PartyCity.com.
In addition to our retail operations, we are also one of the largest global designers, manufacturers and distributors of decorated consumer party products, with items found in retail outlets worldwide, including independent party supply stores, mass merchants, grocery retailers, e-commerce merchandisers and dollar stores. Our products are available or licensed in over 100 countries with the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), Canada, Germany, Mexico and Australia among the largest end markets for our products outside of the United States.
How We Assess the Performance of Our Company
In assessing the performance of our company, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures for our two operating segments, Retail and Wholesale. These key measures include revenues and gross profit, comparable retail same-store sales and operating expenses. We also review other metrics such as adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) per common share - diluted, and adjusted EBITDA. For a discussion of our use of these measures and a reconciliation of adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), please refer to Item 6, “Selected Consolidated Financial Data.”
Segments
Our retail segment generates revenue primarily through the sale of our party supplies, which are sold under the Amscan and Anagram brand names through Party City, Halloween City and PartyCity.com. During 2020, 82% of the product that was sold by our retail segment was supplied by our wholesale segment and 26% of the product that was sold by our retail segment was self-manufactured.
Our wholesale revenues are generated from the sale of decorated party goods for all occasions, including paper and plastic tableware, accessories and novelties, costumes, metallic and latex balloons and stationery. Our products are sold at wholesale to party goods superstores (including our franchise stores), other party goods retailers, mass merchants, independent card and gift stores, dollar stores and e-commerce merchandisers.
Intercompany sales between the Wholesale and the Retail segment are eliminated, and the wholesale profits on intercompany sales are deferred and realized at the time the merchandise is sold to the retail consumer. For segment reporting purposes, certain general and administrative expenses and art and development costs are allocated based on total revenues.
Financial Measures
Revenues. Revenue from retail store operations is recognized at the point of sale as control of the product is transferred to the customer at such time. Retail e-commerce sales are recognized when the consumer receives the product as control transfers upon delivery. We estimate future retail sales returns and record a provision in the period in which the related sales are recorded based on historical information. Retail sales are reported net of taxes collected.
Under the terms of our agreements with our franchisees, we provide both: 1) brand value (via significant advertising spend) and 2) support with respect to planograms, in exchange for a royalty fee that ranges from 4% to 6% of the franchisees’ sales. The Company records the royalty fees at the time that the franchisees’ sales are recorded.
For most of our wholesale sales, control transfers upon the shipment of the product as: 1) legal title transfers on such date and 2) we have a present right to payment at such time. Wholesale sales returns are not significant as we generally only accept the return of goods that were shipped to the customer in error or that were damaged when received by the customer. Additionally, due to our extensive history operating as a leading party goods wholesaler, we have sufficient history with which to estimate future sales returns and we use the expected value method to estimate such activity.
Intercompany sales from our wholesale operations to our retail stores are eliminated in our consolidated total revenues.
Comparable Retail Same-Store Sales. The growth in same-store sales represents the percentage change in same-store sales in the period presented compared to the prior year. Same-store sales exclude the net sales of a store for any period if the store was not open during the same period of the prior year. Acquired stores are excluded from same-store sales until they are converted to the Party City format and included in our sales for the comparable period of the prior year. Comparable sales are calculated based upon stores that were open at least thirteen full months as of the end of the applicable reporting period and do not exclude stores closed due to state regulations regarding COVID-19. When a store is reconfigured or relocated within the same general territory, the store continues to be treated as the same store. If, during the period presented, a store was closed, sales from that store up to and including the closing day are included as same-store sales as long as the store was open during the same period of the prior year. Same-store sales for the Party City brand include North American retail e-commerce sales.
Cost of Sales. Cost of sales at wholesale reflects the production costs (i.e., raw materials, labor and overhead) of manufactured goods and the direct cost of purchased goods, inventory shrinkage, inventory adjustments, inbound freight to our manufacturing and distribution facilities, distribution costs and outbound freight to get goods to our wholesale customers. At retail, cost of sales reflects the direct cost of goods purchased from third parties and the production or purchase costs of goods acquired from our wholesale segment. Retail cost of sales also includes inventory shrinkage, inventory adjustments, inbound freight, occupancy costs related to store operations (such as rent and common area maintenance, utilities and depreciation on assets) and all logistics costs associated with our retail e-commerce business.
Our cost of sales increases in higher volume periods as the direct costs of manufactured and purchased goods, inventory shrinkage and freight are generally tied to net sales. However, other costs are largely fixed or vary based on other factors and do not necessarily increase as sales volume increases. Changes in the mix of our products may also impact our overall cost of sales. The direct costs of manufactured and purchased goods are influenced by raw material costs (principally paper, petroleum-based resins and cotton), domestic and international labor costs in the countries where our goods are purchased or manufactured and logistics costs associated with transporting our goods. We monitor our inventory levels on an on-going basis in order to identify slow-moving goods.
Cost of sales related to sales from our wholesale segment to our retail segment are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements.
Wholesale Selling Expenses. Wholesale selling expenses include the costs associated with our wholesale sales and marketing efforts, including merchandising and customer service. Costs include the salaries and benefits of the related work force, including sales-based bonuses and commissions. Other costs include catalogues, showroom rent, travel and other operating costs. Certain selling expenses, such as sales-based bonuses and commissions, vary in proportion to sales, while other costs vary based on other factors, such as our marketing efforts, or are largely fixed and do not necessarily increase as sales volumes increase.
Retail Operating Expenses. Retail operating expenses include all of the costs associated with retail store operations, excluding occupancy-related costs included in cost of sales. Costs include store payroll and benefits, advertising, supplies and credit card costs. Retail expenses are largely variable but do not necessarily vary in proportion to net sales.
Franchise Expenses. Franchise expenses include the costs associated with operating our franchise network, including salaries and benefits of the administrative work force and other administrative costs. These expenses generally do not vary proportionally with royalties and franchise fees.
General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses include all operating costs not included elsewhere in the statement of operations and comprehensive (loss) income. These expenses include payroll and other expenses related to operations at our corporate offices, including occupancy costs, related depreciation and amortization, legal and professional fees.. These expenses generally do not vary proportionally with net sales.
Art and Development Costs. Art and development costs include the costs associated with art production, creative development and product management. Costs include the salaries and benefits of the related work force. These expenses generally do not vary proportionally with net sales.
Adjusted EBITDA. We define EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, net, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, as further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance. We caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other issuers, because not all issuers calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an appropriate measure of operating performance in addition to EBITDA because we believe it assists investors in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by eliminating the impact of items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. In addition, we use Adjusted EBITDA: (i) as a factor in determining incentive compensation, (ii) to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and (iii) because the credit facilities use Adjusted EBITDA to measure compliance with certain covenants.
Adjusted Net Income (Loss). Adjusted net income (loss) represents our net income (loss), adjusted for, among other items, intangible asset amortization, non-cash purchase accounting adjustments, amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts, equity-based compensation and impairment charges. We present adjusted net income because we believe it assists investors in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by eliminating the impact of items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance.
Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share - Diluted. Adjusted net income (loss) per common share - diluted represents adjusted net income (loss) divided by the Company’s diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. We present the metric because we believe it assists investors in comparing our per share performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by eliminating the impact of items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance.
Factors Affecting Our Results
Important events that have impacted or will impact the results presented in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” include:
Inventory Disposal. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company continued to make progress in improving inventory levels across its stores and distribution network. Consistent with the strategy of rationalizing in-store SKU count and improving working capital velocity, the Company has updated its seasonal assortment strategy to target higher in-season sell-through of merchandise and reduce annual inventory carry-over. The more edited and curated assortments are expected to improve the customer experience by making stores easier to shop and product selections more relevant to consumers, while also improving the efficiency of inventory management and reducing working capital needs. As a result, the Company disposed of $88,358 in inventory during the fourth quarter of 2020 that will not be required in future seasons.
Sale of International Operations. In January 2021, the Company closed the previously disclosed sale of a substantial portion of its international operations. The announced sale had a total transaction value of approximately $50.6 million. As of December 31, 2020, the assets and liabilities of the international operations are considered held for sale. As a result, the company recorded a loss reserve of $73,948.
Store Impairment and Restructuring Charges. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company performed a comprehensive review of its store locations aimed at improving the overall productivity of such locations (“store optimization program”) and, after careful consideration and evaluation of the store locations, the Company made the decision to accelerate the optimization of its store portfolio. In 2019, 55 stores were identified for closure, out of which 35 stores were closed in 2019 and 20 stores were closed in January 2020. In 2020, 21 stores identified for closure in the first quarter of 2020 and were closed in the third quarter. These closings should provide the Company with capital flexibility to expand into underserved markets. In addition, the Company evaluated the recoverability of long-lived assets at the open stores and recorded an impairment charge associated with the operating lease asset and property, plant and equipment for open stores where sales were affected due to the outbreak of, and local, state and federal governmental responses to, COVID-19. In conjunction with the store optimization program and store impairment, during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded charges as detailed in Note 3 - Store Impairment and Restructuring Charges, of Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
COVID-19. Our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity have been and may continue to be materially and adversely affected by COVID-19. Further, the disruption to the global economy and to our business, along with the decline in our stock price, may negatively impact the carrying value of certain assets, including inventories, accounts receivable, intangibles and goodwill. The full extent to which COVID-19 and the measures to contain it will impact our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity will depend on the severity and duration of the COVID-19 outbreak and other future developments related to the response to the virus, all of which are highly uncertain, and we expect this uncertainty to continue in 2021. Our results of operations may be affected by the uncertainty surrounding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we will continue to actively monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our expected losses. We have proactively managed our liquidity profile throughout the fiscal year and expect to continue to do so going forward. We expect to rely on cash on hand, cash generated by operations and borrowings available under our New ABL Facility to meet our working capital needs.
Goodwill and Intangibles Impairment. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, the Company identified intangible assets’ impairment indicators associated with its market capitalization and significantly reduced customer demand for its products due to COVID-19. As a result, the Company performed interim impairment tests on the goodwill at its retail and wholesale reporting units and its other indefinite lived intangible assets as of March 31, 2020. The interim impairment tests were performed using an income approach. The Company recognized non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charges at March 31, 2020 of $253,110 and $148,326 against the goodwill associated with its retail and wholesale reporting units, respectively. In addition, during the three months ended March 31, 2020, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $131,287 and $3,925 on its Party City and Halloween City tradenames, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2020 the Company has determined that the fair value of certain indefinite-lived intangible assets is lower than the related book values. Additionally, for certain long-lived assets it is more likely than not that those long-lived assets will be disposed significantly before the end of their previously estimated useful lives. As a result, impairment charges of $11,032, $2,423 and $31,277 were recorded in the third quarter on its business indefinite-lived trade name intangibles, finite-lived intangibles and tangible assets, respectively. During the three months ended December 31, 2020, there was no goodwill or intangibles impairment.
During the three months ended September 30, 2019, and the three months ended December 31, 2019, the Company identified an impairment indicator associated with its market capitalization and performed impairment tests on the goodwill at its wholesale and retail reporting units and its other indefinite lived intangible assets as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2019. The Company recognized non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charges at September 30, 2019 of $224,100 and $35,000 and at December 31, 2019, of $271,500 and $25,400, against the goodwill associated with its retail and wholesale reporting units, respectively. During 2019, there was no impairment on the Party City trade name and the Company recorded a Halloween City trade name impairment charge of $6,575.
Sale/Leaseback Transaction. In June 2019, the Company sold its main distribution center in Chester, New York, its metallic balloons manufacturing facility in Eden Prairie, Minnesota and its injection molded plastics manufacturing facility in Los Lunas, New Mexico. Simultaneously, the Company entered into twenty-year leases for each of the facilities. The aggregate sale price was $128.0 million and, during the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a $58.4 million gain on the sale, net of transaction costs, in the Company’s condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss.
Sale of Canadian-based Party City Stores. On October 1, 2019, the Company sold its Canadian-based Party City stores to a Canadian-based retailer for $131.7 million and entered into a 10-year supply agreement under which the acquirer agreed to purchase product from the Company for such Party City stores, as well as the acquirer’s other stores. The Company used the net proceeds to paydown debt.
Loans and Long-Term Obligations. As referenced in Note 11 - Loans and Notes Payable of Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K during April 2019, the Company amended the ABL Facility. Such amendment removed the seasonal component and made the ABL Facility a $640 million facility with no seasonal modification component. The Company further reduced the ABL revolving commitments and prepaid the outstanding ABL revolving loans, in an aggregate principal amount equal to $44,000 in accordance with the ABL Facility credit agreement.
As detailed in Note 12 - Long-Term Obligations, during August 2018, the Company executed a refinancing of its debt portfolio and issued $500 million of new senior notes at an interest rate of 6.625%. The notes will mature in August 2026. The Company used the proceeds from the notes to: (i) reduce the outstanding balance under its existing ABL Facility by $90 million and (ii) voluntarily prepay $400 million of the outstanding balance under its existing Term Loan Credit Agreement. Additionally, as part of the refinancing, the Company extended the maturity of the ABL Facility to August 2023.
Further, in July 2020, the Company and certain of its direct or indirect subsidiaries, including PCHI, Anagram Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned direct subsidiary of PCHI (“Anagram Holdings”), and Anagram International, Inc., a Minnesota corporation and wholly owned direct subsidiary of Anagram Holdings, completed certain refinancing transactions, including, among other things: (i) the exchange of $327,076 of 6.125% Senior Notes due 2023 (the “2023 Notes”) and $392,746 of 6.625% Senior Notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes” and, together with the 2023 Notes, the “Existing Notes”) issued by PCHI, in each case tendered in the Company’s offers to exchange pursuant to the terms described in a confidential offering memorandum, for (A) $156,669 of Senior Secured First Lien Floating Rate Notes due 2025 (the “First Lien Party City Notes”) issued by PCHI; (B) $84,687 of 10.00% PIK/Cash Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2026 (the “Second Lien Anagram Notes”) issued by Anagram Holdings and Anagram International (together, the “Anagram Issuers”); and (C) 15,942,551 shares of the Company’s common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the “Common Stock”); (ii) the issuance of $110,000 in the aggregate of 15.00% PIK/Cash Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2025 (the “First Lien Anagram Notes”) by the Anagram Issuers and an additional $5,000 of First Lien Party City Notes in connection with a rights offering and a private placement, as applicable; and (iii) the solicitations of certain consents with respect to the indentures governing Existing Notes.
Acquisitions. During 2018, we acquired 58 franchise and independent stores. The acquisitions increased net sales for our retail segment by approximately $67 million versus 2017. Additionally, these acquisitions decreased our third-party wholesale sales by $20 million as post-acquisition wholesale sales to such stores are now eliminated as intercompany sales.
Tax. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act (“the CARES Act”) was signed into law. The CARES Act is a $2 trillion legislative package intended to provide economic relief to companies impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and it enacted a number of Internal Revenue Code modifications which are of particular benefit to us, including: (1) 5-year net operating loss carryback, (2) temporary relaxation of the limitation on interest deductions by raising for 2019 and 2020 the business interest expense limitation from 30% to 50% of our Adjusted Taxable Income, and by allowing for the option to use the higher 2019 Adjusted Taxable Income to compute the 2020 limitation, (3) qualified improvement property eligible for 100% bonus depreciation, (4) employee retention tax credits, and (5) the deferral of the payment of most of the employer share of social security payroll tax incurred in 2020 until 2021 (50%) and 2022 (50%).
Results of Operations
The following tables set forth our operating results and operating results as a percentage of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Revenues
Total revenues for 2020 were $1,850.7 million and were $498.1 million, or 21.2% lower than 2019. The following table sets forth the Company’s total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Retail
Retail net sales during 2020 were $1,375.1 million and decreased $367.1 million, or 21.1%, compared to 2019. Retail net sales at our Party City stores totaled $1,367.4 million and were $324.1 million, or 19.2%, lower than 2019 primarily due to the unfavorable impact of COVID-19 in the second quarter of 2020 as stores were closed due to state mandated restrictions, the sale of our 65 Canadian retail stores prior to the Halloween season, the impact of reduced sales from 77 stores identified for closure in conjunction with our 2019 store optimization program, and impact from reduced sales from temporary Halloween City stores. Sales at our temporary Halloween stores (principally Halloween City) totaled $6.3 million and were $40.9 million lower than 2019, primarily due to reduction in store count (25 in 2020 versus 256 in 2019) During 2020, sales at other store formats totaled $1.4 million.
Same-store sales for the Party City brand decreased by 17.0% during 2020. Same-store sales percentages were not affected by foreign currency as such percentages are calculated in local currency.
Wholesale
Wholesale net sales during 2020 totaled $468.4 million and were $129.0 million, or 21.6 %, lower than 2019. Net sales to third parties totaled $165.8 million and were $66.0 million, or 28.5%, lower than during 2019. The decrease is primarily due to the unfavorable impact of COVID-19 as business closures due to state mandated restrictions as well as reduced social activities negatively impacted sales. Results also reflects closures and acquisitions of franchise stores throughout 2020. Net sales of metallic balloons to domestic distributors and retailers (including our franchisee network) totaled $78.3 million during 2020 and were $9.2 million, or 10.6%, lower than during 2019 primarily due to interruption of manufacturing operations related to COVID-19 restrictions and other business closures.
Intercompany sales to our retail affiliates totaled $471.9 million during 2020 and were $170.8 million lower than during the prior year. The decrease in 2020 intercompany sales principally reflects a lower store count compared to 2019 and a reduction in purchases impacted by COVID-19 temporary store closures, an initiative to reduce the overall product assortment, the sale of stores to Canadian tire, and the closure of retail stores in 2019 and 2020. The intercompany sales of our wholesale segment are eliminated against the intercompany purchases of our retail segment in the consolidated financial statements. Intercompany sales represented 51.8% of total wholesale sales during 2020, compared to 51.8% during 2019. The intercompany sales of our wholesale segment are eliminated against the intercompany purchases of our retail segment in the consolidated financial statements.
Royalties and franchise fees
Royalties and franchise fees during 2020 totaled $7.2 million and were $2.0 million lower than during 2019, reflecting the decreasing franchise store count as a result of our franchise store acquisitions, along with lower sales at franchise stores.
Gross Profit
The following table sets forth the Company’s gross profit for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.
The gross profit margin on net sales at retail during 2020 was 29.1% or 1,083 basis points lower than 40.0% during 2019. The decrease is primarily attributable to year-end inventory disposal, deleverage of store occupancy costs, along with markdowns related to the Company’s “store optimization program”, partially offset by reduction of spend on promotions. The manufacturing share of shelf at retail (i.e., the percentage of our retail product cost of sales manufactured by our wholesale segment) increased from 23.5% in 2019 to 26.0% during 2020, driven by the increased balloon production in our wholesale business. Our wholesale share of shelf at our Party City stores and our North American retail e-commerce operations (i.e., the percentage of our retail product cost of sales supplied by our wholesale segment) was 82.1% during 2020 compared to 79.6% during 2019.
The gross profit on net sales at wholesale during 2020 and 2019 was 15.9% and 23.8%, respectively. The decrease in comparison to 2019 is primarily due to inventory write-downs attributable to discontinuation of the gift line and the updated assortment strategy at our retail stores, as well as deleverage of distribution and manufacturing costs on the lower sales volumes.
Operating expenses
Wholesale selling expenses totaled $50.1 million during 2020 compared to $67.1 million during 2019. The decrease of $17.0 million, or 30.0%, was largely due to lower payroll costs as well as lower travel, trade show and commission expenses.
Retail operating expenses during 2020 were $387.4 million and were $53.0 million, or 13.7%, lower than in 2019. The decrease was principally due to disciplined cost controls, with lower advertising expense, lower store payroll due to lower store count from the 2019 store optimization, along with lower variable costs related to reduced sales impacted by COVID-19 temporary store closures. Retail operating expenses were 28.2% and 25.3% of net retail sales during 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Franchise expenses during 2020 and 2019 were $12.1 million and $13.2 million respectively.
General and administrative expenses during 2020 totaled $210.2 million and were $32.6 million, or 18.3%, higher than in 2019. The increase for 2020 was principally due to higher professional fees, increased depreciation, stock compensation, higher bad debt expense, and new executive leadership compensation partially offset by lower employee payroll from furloughs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and less travel. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 11.4% and 7.6% during 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Art and development costs were consistent at $17.6 million and $23.2 million during 2020 and 2019, respectively, consistent at 1.0% of total revenue. The decrease in 2020 was mainly due to lower employee payroll from furloughs, lower freelance spending and reductions related to the discontinuation of the gift line.
Development stage expenses represent start-up costs related to Kazzam (see Note 25, Kazzam LLC., of Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion).
Interest expense, net
Interest expense, net, totaled $77.0 million during 2020, compared to $114.9 million during 2019. The decrease in interest principally reflects lower amounts of debt outstanding as a result of the Company’s July 2020 refinancing (see Note - 11, Loans and Notes Payable, and Note 12 - Long-Term Obligations, of Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion) as well as 2020 paydown of debt from proceeds from the 2019 sale of Canadian stores.
Other expense, net
Other expense, net, totaled $3.7 million during 2020 and $1.9 million during 2019.
(Gain) on debt refinancing
As described in Note 12 - Long-Term Obligations, of Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company recognized a gain of $273.1 million on debt refinancing transactions.
Income tax expense
The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020, 22.9%, is different from the statutory rate, 21%, primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge of $401.4 million, offset by the CODI of $283.5 million excluded from taxable income, and the benefit from the CARES Act 5-year NOL carryback. See Note 17, Income Tax, of Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.
Gain on sale/leaseback transaction
In June 2019, the Company reported a $58.4 million gain from the sale and leaseback of its main distribution center in Chester, New York and its metallic balloons manufacturing facility in Eden Prairie, Minnesota. The aggregate sale price for the three properties was $128.0 million. Simultaneous with the sale, the Company entered into twenty-year leases for each of the facilities.
Store impairment and restructuring charges
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company performed a comprehensive review of its store locations aimed at improving the overall productivity of such locations (“store optimization program”) and, after careful consideration and evaluation of the store locations, the Company made the decision to accelerate the optimization of its store portfolio. In 2019, 55 stores were identified for closure, out of which 35 stores were closed in 2019 and 20 stores were closed in January 2020. In 2020, 21 stores identified for closure in the first quarter of 2020 and were closed in the third quarter. These closings provided the Company with capital flexibility to expand into underserved markets. In addition, the Company evaluated the recoverability of long lived assets at the open stores and recorded an impairment charge associated with the operating lease asset and property, plant and equipment for open stores where sales were affected due to the outbreak of, and local, state and federal governmental responses to, COVID-19. In conjunction with the store optimization program, during the 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded a$15.5 and a $14.9 million impairment charges for its operating lease asset, a $2.1 and a $4.7 million impairment charges for property, plant and equipment and a $4.9 and a $8.7 million of labor and other costs related to closing the stores, respectively. See Note 3, Store Impairment and Restructuring Charges, of Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
In both 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded non-cash pre-tax goodwill and intangibles impairment charges were the result of a sustained decline in the Company's market capitalization and, in early 2020, due to significantly reduced customer demand for its products due to COVID-19. The improved market capitalization later in 2020 resulted in the decrease of impairment versus 2019.
The following tables set forth our operating results and operating results as a percentage of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:
Revenues
Total revenues for 2019 were $2,348.8 million and were $78.7 million, or 3.2%, lower than 2018. The following table sets forth the Company’s total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.
Retail
Retail net sales during 2019 were $1,742.1 million and decreased $60.7 million, or 3.4%, compared to 2018. Retail net sales at our Party City stores totaled $1,527.5 million and were $55.7 million, or 3.5%, lower than 2018 principally due to the negative impact of helium shortages, the sale of our 65 Canadian retail stores prior to the Halloween season, the impact of reduced sales from 55 stores identified for closure in conjunction with our 2019 store optimization program, and soft Halloween sales at both our Party City and temporary Halloween stores. Global retail e-commerce sales totaled $162.4 million during 2019 and were $8.0 million, or 5.2%, higher than during 2018. Sales at our temporary Halloween stores (principally Halloween City) totaled $47.4 million and were $15.1 million lower than 2018. During 2019, sales at other store formats totaled $4.7 million.
Same-store sales for the Party City brand (including North American retail e-commerce sales) decreased by 3.0% during 2019. Excluding the impact of e-commerce, same-store sales decreased by 3.5%. Same-store sales percentages were not affected by foreign currency as such percentages are calculated in local currency.
Wholesale
Wholesale net sales during 2019 totaled $597.4 million and were $16.2 million, or 2.6%, lower than 2018. Net sales to domestic party goods retailers and distributors (including our franchisee network) totaled $231.7 million and were $8.7 million, or 3.6%, lower than during 2018. The decrease reflects our acquisition of franchise and independent stores throughout 2019; as post-acquisition sales to such stores in 2019 (approximately $13.7 million during the corresponding periods of 2018) were eliminated as intercompany sales. Net sales of metallic balloons to domestic distributors and retailers (including our franchisee network) totaled $78.3 million during 2019 and were $9.2 million, or 10.6%, lower than during 2018 principally due to the ongoing helium shortage. Our international sales (which include U.S. export sales and exclude U.S. import sales from foreign subsidiaries) totaled $287.4 million and were $1.7 million, or 0.6%, higher than in 2018 as sales growth of $12.3 million in constant currency was offset by a negative foreign currency impact of $10.6 million.
Intercompany sales to our retail affiliates totaled $642.7 million during 2019 and were $69.2 million lower than during the prior year. The decrease in 2019 intercompany sales principally reflects a lower store count compared to 2018 and a general reduction in retail purchases, in consideration of higher carryover inventory levels from the previous Halloween selling season. Intercompany sales represented 51.8% of total wholesale sales during 2019, compared to 53.7% during 2018. The intercompany sales of our wholesale segment are eliminated against the intercompany purchases of our retail segment in the consolidated financial statements.
Royalties and franchise fees
Royalties and franchise fees during 2019 totaled $9.3 million and were $1.8 million lower than during 2018, reflecting the decreasing franchise store count as a result of our franchise store acquisitions.
Gross Profit
The following table sets forth the Company’s gross profit for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.
The gross profit margin on net sales at retail during 2019 was 40.0% or 440 basis points lower than during 2018. The decrease reflects a combination of markdowns in conjunction with the Company’s “store optimization program” and provisions against inventory recorded in conjunction with such program (see “operating expenses” below for further discussion), the impact of an aggressive coupon program during the second half of 2019, the impact of the helium shortage on costs and sales mix, and a flow through of higher freight and distribution costs during the first three quarters of 2019, related to product acquired from the Company’s wholesale operations during the second half of 2018, as the China tariffs caused non-recurring logistical challenges. The manufacturing share of shelf at retail (i.e., the percentage of our retail product cost of sales manufactured by our wholesale segment) increased from 22.9% during 2018 to 23.5% during 2019, driven by the scaling up of recent acquisitions in our wholesale business. Our wholesale share of shelf at our Party City stores and our North American retail e-commerce operations (i.e., the percentage of our retail product cost of sales supplied by our wholesale segment) was 79.6% during 2019 compared to 78.9% during 2018.
The gross profit on net sales at wholesale during 2019 and 2018 was 23.8% and 29.3%, respectively. The decrease in comparison to 2018 principally reflects a decrease in high-margin sales of metallic balloons and higher margin sales to franchisees (due to the store acquisitions noted above) as well as, the deleveraging of distribution and manufacturing costs and the impact of foreign currency.
Operating expenses
Wholesale selling expenses totaled $67.1 million during 2019 compared to $71.5 million during 2018. The decrease of $4.4 million, or 6.2%, was due partially to the impact of foreign currency translation.
Retail operating expenses during 2019 were $440.4 million and were $14.4 million, or 3.4%, higher than in 2018. The increase was principally due to higher advertising, ecommerce and information technology related expenses compared to 2018. Retail operating expenses were 25.3% and 23.6% of net retail sales during 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Franchise expenses during both 2019 and 2018 were $13.2 million.
General and administrative expenses during 2019 totaled $177.7 million and were $4.9 million, or 2.8%, higher than in 2018. The increase for 2019 was principally due to increase legal and settlement costs. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 7.6% and 7.1% during 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Art and development costs were consistent at $23.2 million and $23.4 million during 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Development stage expenses represent start-up costs related to Kazzam (see Note 25 - Kazzam LLC., of Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion).
Interest expense, net
Interest expense, net, totaled $114.9 million during 2019, compared to $105.7 million during 2018. The increase in interest principally reflects the full year impact of the Company’s August 2018 refinancing as well as the impact of average borrowings and average rates under our ABL credit facility and Term Loan (see Note 11 - Loans and Notes Payable, of Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion).
Other expense, net
Other expense, net, totaled $1.9 million during 2019 and $11.0 million during 2018. The net decrease was principally due to non-recurring costs in 2018 associated with the Company’s August 2018 debt refinancing, including the write-off of $2.8 million of existing capitalized deferred finance costs and original issue discounts and the incurrence of $2.3 million in related third-party fees.
Income tax expense
The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019, 0.2%, is different from the statutory rate, 21%, primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge of $556.1 million, and the tax effects of the sale of the Canada Party City stores. See Note 17-Income Tax, of Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
ABL Facility
Prior to April 2019, the Company had a $540,000 asset-based revolving credit facility (with a seasonal increase to $640,000 during a certain period of each calendar year) (“ABL Facility”), which matures during August 2023 (subject to a springing maturity at an earlier date if the maturity date of certain of the Company’s other debt has not been extended or refinanced). It provides for (a) revolving loans, subject to a borrowing base described below, and (b) letters of credit, in an aggregate face amount at any time outstanding not to exceed $50,000. During April 2019, the Company amended the ABL Facility. Such amendment removed the seasonal component and made the ABL Facility a $640,000 facility with no seasonal modification component.
Under the ABL Facility, the borrowing base at any time equals (a) a percentage of eligible trade receivables, plus (b) a percentage of eligible inventory, plus (c) a percentage of eligible credit card receivables, less (d) certain reserves.
The ABL Facility generally provides for two pricing options: (i) an alternate base interest rate (“ABR”) equal to the greater of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or (c) the LIBOR rate plus 1%, in each case, on the date of such borrowing or (ii) a LIBOR based interest rate, in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin ranges from 0.25% to 0.50% with respect to ABR borrowings and from 1.25% to 1.50% with respect to LIBOR borrowings.
In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee of 0.25% per annum in respect of unutilized commitments. The Company must also pay customary letter of credit fees.
All obligations under the ABL Facility are jointly and severally guaranteed by PC Intermediate, PCHI and each existing and future domestic subsidiary of PCHI. PCHI and each guarantor has secured its obligations, subject to certain exceptions and limitations, including obligations under its guaranty, as applicable, by a first-priority lien on its accounts receivable, inventory, cash and certain related assets and a second-priority lien on substantially all of its other assets.
The facility contains negative covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, restrict the ability of PCHI to:
•
incur additional indebtedness;
•
pay dividends on capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire capital stock;
•
make certain investments, loans, advances and acquisitions;
•
engage in transactions with affiliates;
•
create liens; and
•
transfer or sell certain assets.
In addition, PCHI must comply with a fixed charge coverage ratio if excess availability under the ABL Facility on any day is less than the greater of: (a) 10% of the lesser of the aggregate commitments and the then borrowing base under the ABL Facility and (b) $40,000. The fixed charge coverage ratio is the ratio of (i) Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the facility) minus maintenance-related capital expenditures (as defined in the facility) to (ii) fixed charges (as defined in the facility).
The ABL Facility also contains certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default.
Senior secured term loan facility (“Term Loan Credit Agreement”)
The Term Loan Credit Agreement, as amended, provides for two pricing options for outstanding loans: (i) an ABR for any day, a rate per annum equal to the greater of (a) the prime rate in effect on such day, (b) the federal funds effective rate in effect on such day plus 0.5%, (c) the adjusted LIBOR rate plus 1% and (d) 1.75% or (ii) the LIBOR rate, with a LIBOR floor of 0.75%, in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin for ABR and LIBOR borrowings are 1.75% and 2.75%, respectively, and will drop to 1.50% and 2.50%, respectively, if PCHI’s Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, as defined by the agreement, falls below 3.2 to 1.0.
The term loans under the Term Loan Credit Agreement mature on August 19, 2022. The Company is required to repay installments on the loans in quarterly principal amounts of 0.25%, with the remaining amount payable on the maturity date.
Additionally, outstanding term loans are subject to mandatory prepayment, subject to certain exceptions, with (i) 100% of net proceeds above a threshold amount of certain asset sales/insurance proceeds, subject to reinvestment rights and certain other exceptions, (ii) 100% of the net cash proceeds of any incurrence of debt other than debt permitted under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, and (iii) 50% of Excess Cash Flow, as defined in the agreement, if any (reduced to 25% if PCHI’s first lien leverage ratio (as defined in the agreement) is less than 3.50 to 1.00, but greater than 2.50 to 1.00, and 0% if PCHI’s first lien leverage ratio is less than 2.50 to 1.00).
The term loans may be voluntarily prepaid at any time without premium or penalty, other than customary breakage costs with respect to loans based on the LIBOR rate.
All obligations under the agreement are jointly and severally guaranteed by PC Intermediate, PCHI and each existing and future domestic subsidiary of PCHI. PCHI and each guarantor has secured its obligations, subject to certain exceptions and limitations, by a first-priority lien on substantially all of its assets (other than accounts receivable, inventory, cash and certain related assets), including a pledge of all of the capital stock held by PC Intermediate, PCHI and each guarantor, and a second-priority lien on its accounts receivable, inventory, cash and certain related assets.
The Term Loan Credit Agreement contains certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default. Additionally, it contains negative covenants which, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, restrict the ability of PCHI to:
•
incur additional indebtedness;
•
pay dividends on capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire capital stock;
•
make certain investments, loans, advances and acquisitions;
•
engage in transactions with affiliates;
•
create liens; and
•
transfer or sell certain assets.

First Lien Party City Notes, First Lien Anagram Notes, Second Lien Anagram Notes
On July 30, 2020 (the “Settlement Date”), the Company and certain of its direct or indirect subsidiaries, including PCHI, Anagram Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned direct subsidiary of PCHI (“Anagram Holdings”), and Anagram International, Inc., a Minnesota corporation and wholly owned direct subsidiary of Anagram Holdings, completed certain refinancing transactions, including, among other things: (i) the exchange of $327,076 of 6.125% Senior Notes due 2023 (the “2023 Notes”) and $392,746 of 6.625% Senior Notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes” and, together with the 2023 Notes, the “Existing Notes”) issued by PCHI, in each case tendered in the Company’s offers to exchange pursuant to the terms described in a confidential offering memorandum, for (A) $156,669 of Senior Secured First Lien Floating Rate Notes due 2025 (the “First Lien Party City Notes”) issued by PCHI; (B) $84,687 of 10.00% PIK/Cash Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2026 (the “Second Lien Anagram Notes”) issued by Anagram Holdings and Anagram International (together, the “Anagram Issuers”); and (C) 15,942,551 shares of the Company’s common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the “Common Stock”); (ii) the issuance of $110,000 in the aggregate of 15.00% PIK/Cash Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2025 (the “First Lien Anagram Notes”) by the Anagram Issuers and an additional $5,000 of First Lien Party City Notes in connection with a rights offering and a private placement, as applicable; and (iii) the solicitations of certain consents with respect to the indentures governing Existing Notes.
The First Lien Party City Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of the Settlement Date, among PCHI, as issuer, certain guarantors party thereto (the “Party City Guarantors”) and Ankura Trust Company, LLC (“Ankura”), as trustee and collateral trustee. The First Lien Party City Notes were issued in an aggregate amount of $161,669 and will mature on July 15, 2025. Interest on the First Lien Party City Notes accrues from the Settlement Date at a floating rate equal to the 6-month London Inter-Bank Offered Rate plus 500 basis points (with a floor of 75 basis points) per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing January 15, 2021. The First Lien Party City Notes are senior secured obligations of PCHI and the Party City Guarantors. The First Lien Party City Notes are pari passu in right of payment with all of PCHI’s other senior indebtedness, including the existing senior secured term loan facility and the ABL Facility, and are structurally subordinated to the First Lien Anagram Notes and the Second Lien Anagram Notes, to the extent of the value of the Anagram Collateral (as defined below). The First Lien Party City Notes are secured by a first priority lien on collateral that includes liens on substantially all assets (other than certain accounts, inventory, deposit accounts, securities accounts, related assets and general intangibles) of the Party City Guarantors, in each case subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens.
The First Lien Anagram Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of the Settlement Date, among Anagram Holdings, as issuer, Anagram International, as co-issuer, certain guarantors party thereto (the “Anagram Guarantors”) and Ankura, as trustee and collateral trustee. The First Lien Anagram Notes were issued in an aggregate amount of $110,000 and will mature on August 15, 2025. Interest on the First Lien Anagram Notes accrues from the Settlement Date at (i) a rate of 10.00% per annum, payable in cash; and (ii) a rate of 5.00% per annum payable by increasing the principal amount of the outstanding First Lien Anagram Notes or issuing additional First Lien Anagram Notes, as the case may be, in each case payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing February 15, 2021. The First Lien Anagram Notes are senior secured obligations of the Anagram Issuers and are pari passu in right of payment with all of the Anagram Issuers’ other senior indebtedness. The First Lien Anagram Notes are secured by a first priority lien on collateral that consists of substantially all assets and properties of the Anagram Issuers and the Anagram Guarantors, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens (the “Anagram Collateral”). Such security interests are senior in priority to the security interests in such assets that secure the Second Lien Anagram Notes.
The Second Lien Anagram Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of the Settlement Date, among Anagram Holdings, as issuer, Anagram International, as co-issuer, the Anagram Guarantors and Ankura, as trustee and collateral trustee. The Second Lien Anagram Notes were issued in an aggregate amount of $84,687 and will mature on August 15, 2026. Interest on the Second Lien Anagram Notes accrues from the Settlement Date at (i)
a rate of 5.00% per annum, payable, at the Anagram Issuers’ option, entirely in cash or entirely by increasing the principal amount of the outstanding Second Lien Anagram Notes or issuing additional Second Lien Anagram Notes, as the case may be; and (ii) a rate of 5.00% per annum payable by increasing the principal amount of the outstanding Second Lien Anagram Notes or issuing additional Second Lien Anagram Notes, as the case may be, in each case payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing February 15, 2021; provided, however, that on August 15, 2025, interest will be required to be paid by increasing the principal amount of the Second Lien Anagram Notes or issuing the principal amount of the Second Lien Anagram Notes or issuing additional Second Lien Anagram Notes. On February 15, 2026, the Anagram Issuers will prepay in cash a portion of the Second Lien Anagram Notes then outstanding in an amount necessary such that the Second Lien Anagram Notes are not treated as “applicable high yield discount obligations” within the meaning of Section 163(i) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Second Lien Anagram Notes are senior secured obligations of the Anagram Issuers and are pari passu in right of payment with all of the Anagram Issuers’ other senior indebtedness. The Second Lien Anagram Notes are secured by a second priority lien on the Anagram Collateral. Such security interests are junior to the security interests in such assets that secure the First Lien Anagram Notes.
The Company evaluated the refinancing transaction in accordance with ASC 470-60 Troubled Debt Restructuring. The exchange of the 2023 Notes and 2026 Notes for the First Lien Party City Notes, Second Lien Anagram Notes and shares of Company Common Stock, as well as the concurrent purchase by the participants in the exchange of First Lien Anagram Notes represents a troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”). As the future undiscounted cash flows of the restructured debt were less than the net carrying value of the Existing Notes (including accrued interest and unamortized discount) adjusted for Common Stock issued to the participants in the exchange and such participants’ purchase of and lenders’ participation in the First Lien Anagram Notes, the Company recognized a gain of $273,149 which reflects $18,902 of third-party fees incurred, and $27,007 of Common Stock issued in the exchange. The Company received $39,544 of cash from the participants in the exchange related to $44,500 of principal amount of First Lien Anagram Notes with an undiscounted value of $82,160, which includes interest expense. Interest expense is not currently recognized for this portion of the restructured debt.
Another portion of the restructured debt related to one holder of Existing Notes did not result in gain recognition as the undiscounted cash flows of the restructured debt was higher than the carrying value of the existing debt. The carrying amount of this portion of the restructured debt is $32,328 and the interest expense will be recognized prospectively at a 3.5% effective interest rate. Amounts attributed to purchasers of the First Lien Anagram Notes who were not participants in the exchange (principal balance of $50,500) are recognized at consideration received less allocated transaction costs (netting to $45,678) and the effective interest method will be used to recognize interest expense prospectively.
Other Credit Agreements
At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, borrowings under the foreign facilities totaled $1.3 million and $1.4 million, respectively.
Other Indebtedness
Additionally, we have entered into various finance leases for machinery and equipment. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 the balances of such leases in our consolidated balance sheets were $15.0million and $14.9 million, respectively. We also have numerous non-cancelable operating leases for retail store sites, as well as leases for offices, distribution facilities and manufacturing facilities. These leases generally contain renewal options and require us to pay real estate taxes, utilities and related insurance costs.
Liquidity
We expect that cash generated from operating activities and availability under our credit agreements will be our principal sources of liquidity. Based on our current level of operations, we believe that these sources will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months. We cannot assure you, however, that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under the ABL Facility, the Term Loan Credit Agreement and Notes described earlier and in amounts sufficient to enable us to repay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. Refer to Note 11 - Loans and Notes Payable and Note 12 - Long-Term Obligations of Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and Company’s “Risks Related to Our Indebtedness” in Item 1A of this Annual Report for additional information.
Cash Flow Data - Year Ended December 31, 2020, Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019
Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $77.2 million during 2020, essentially flat to net cash provided by operating activities totaled $43.7 million during 2019.
Net cash used in investing activities totaled $54.3 million during 2020, as compared to $163.7 million provided by 2019 investing activities. Capital expenditures during 2020 and 2019 were $51.1 million and $61.7 million, respectively. Retail capital expenditures totaled $28.9 million during 2020 and were related to initiatives in technology and investments in our Next Gen store conversions. Wholesale capital expenditures during 2020 totaled $22.1 million and primarily related to printing plates and dyes, as well as machinery and equipment at the Company’s manufacturing operations and main distribution center. In addition, in 2019 our cash flow includes proceeds from disposal of assets of $246.3 million.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $93.7 million during 2020 due to proceeds from the Company’s debt refinancing in the third quarter of 2020. Net cash used in financing activities was $237.7 million during 2019.
Cash Flow Data - Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018
Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $43.7 million during 2019. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $101.9 million during 2018. Net cash flows provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities were $24.8 million during 2019, compared to $226.4 million during 2018. Changes in operating assets and liabilities during 2020 resulted in a source of cash of $18.9 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities during 2018 resulted in a use of cash of $124.5 million (see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 27, Restricted Cash, of Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion). The operating assets and liabilities year over year change was principally due to a reduction in inventory offset by a reduction in accounts payable.
Net cash provided by investing activities totaled $163.7 million during 2019, as compared to $150.9 million used in 2018. Investing activities during 2019 included $18.1 million paid in connection with acquisitions of foreign online retailers and franchise stores (see Note 9, Acquisitions, of Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion). Capital expenditures during 2019 and 2018 were $61.7 million and $85.7 million, respectively. In addition, in 2019 our cash flow includes proceeds from disposal of assets of $246.3 million. Retail capital expenditures totaled $32.2 million during 2019 and principally related to initiatives for improving store performance, web re-platforming, investments in new stores and spending on store conversions. Wholesale capital expenditures during 2019 totaled $29.5 million and primarily related to printing plates and dyes, as well as machinery and equipment at the Company’s manufacturing operations and main distribution center.
Net cash used in financing activities was $237.7 million during 2019. Net cash provided by financing activities was $56.2 million during 2018. The change in net cash used in financing activities was due to a paydown of debt using the net proceeds received from the Sale/Leaseback Transaction (see Note 5, Sale/Leaseback Transaction, of Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion) and the sale of Canadian-based Party City stores (see Note 6, Disposition of Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, of Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion).
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
Effects of Inflation
Although we expect that our operating results will be influenced by general economic conditions, we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations during the periods presented. However, there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future.
Critical Accounting Policies and Procedures
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies, many of which require estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in the financial statements and related notes. Since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty, the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates. Such differences could be material to the consolidated financial statements included herein.
We believe our application of accounting policies, and the estimates inherently required by these policies, are reasonable. These accounting policies and estimates are constantly re-evaluated and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change. Historically, we have found the application of accounting policies to be reasonable, and actual results generally do not differ materially from those determined using necessary estimates.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue Transactions - Retail
Revenue from retail store operations is recognized at the point of sale as control of the product is transferred to the customer at such time. Retail e-commerce sales are recognized when the consumer receives the product as control transfers upon delivery. Due to its extensive history operating as the largest party goods retailer in North America, the Company has sufficient history with which to estimate future retail sales returns and it uses the expected value method to estimate such activity.
The transaction price for the majority of the Company’s retail sales is based on either: 1) the item’s stated price or 2) the stated price adjusted for the impact of a coupon which can only be applied to such transaction. To the extent that the Company charges customers for freight costs on e-commerce sales, the Company records such amounts in revenue. The Company excludes all sales taxes and value-added taxes from revenue.
Under the terms of its agreements with its franchisees, the Company provides both: 1) brand value (via significant advertising spend) and 2) support with respect to planograms, in exchange for a royalty fee that ranges from 4% to 6% of the franchisees’ sales. The Company records the royalty fees at the time that the franchisees’ sales are recorded. Additionally, although the Company anticipates that future franchise store openings will be limited, when a franchisee opens a new store, the Company receives and records a one-time fee which is earned by the Company for its assistance with site selection and development of the new location. Both the sales-based royalty fee and the one-time fee are recorded in royalties and franchise fees in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive (loss) income.
Revenue Transactions - Wholesale
For most of the Company’s wholesale sales, control transfers upon the Company’s shipment of the product. Wholesale sales returns are not significant as the Company generally only accepts the return of goods that were shipped to the customer in error or that were damaged when received by the customer. Additionally, due to its extensive history operating as a leading party goods wholesaler, the Company has sufficient history with which to estimate future sales returns.
In most cases, the determination of the transaction price is fixed based on the contract and/or purchase order. To the extent that the Company charges customers for freight costs, the Company records such amounts in revenue. The Company excludes all sales taxes and value-added taxes from revenue.
The majority of the sales for the Company’s wholesale business are due within 30 to 120 days from the transfer of control of the product and substantially all of the sales are collected within a year from such transfer. For all transactions for which the Company expects to collect the transaction price within a year from the transfer of control, the Company does not adjust the consideration for the effects of a significant financing component.
Judgments
Although most of the Company’s revenue transactions consist of fixed transaction prices and the transfer of control at either the point of sale (for retail) or when the product is shipped (for wholesale), certain transactions involve a limited number of judgments. For transactions for which control transfers to the customer when the freight carrier delivers the product to the customer, the Company estimates the date of such receipt based on historical shipping times. Additionally, the Company utilizes historical data to estimate sales returns. Due to its extensive history operating as a leading party goods retailer, the Company has sufficient history with which to estimate such amounts.
Product Royalty Agreements
We enter into product royalty agreements that allow us to use licensed designs on certain of our products. These contracts require us to pay royalties, generally based on the sales of such product and may require guaranteed minimum royalties, a portion of which may be paid in advance. We match royalty expense with revenue by recording royalties at the time of sale, at the greater of the contractual rate or an effective rate calculated based on the guaranteed minimum royalty and our estimate of sales during the contract period. Guaranteed minimum royalties paid in advance are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets in either prepaid expenses and other current assets or other assets, depending on the nature of the royalties.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers and franchisees to make required payments. Judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables, including consideration of our history of receivable write-offs, the level of past due accounts and the economic status of our customers. In an effort to identify adverse trends relative to customer economic status, we assess the financial health of the markets we operate in and perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and ongoing reviews of account balances and aging of receivables. Amounts are considered past due when payment has not been received within the time frame of the credit terms extended. Write-offs are charged directly against the allowance for doubtful accounts and occur only after all collection efforts have been exhausted. Because we cannot predict future changes in economic conditions and in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates and could impact our allowance for doubtful accounts.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. In assessing the ultimate realization of inventories, we are required to make judgments regarding, among other things, future demand and market conditions, current inventory levels and the impact of the possible discontinuation of product designs.
We principally determine the cost of inventory using the weighted average method.
We estimate retail inventory shrinkage for the period between physical inventory dates on a store-by-store basis. Our inventory shrinkage estimate can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shortage trends. The shrinkage rate from the most recent physical inventory, in combination with historical experience, is the basis for estimating shrinkage.
Long-Lived and Intangible Assets (including Goodwill)
We review the recoverability of our long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets, whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. For purposes of recognizing and measuring impairment, we evaluate long-lived assets/asset groups, other than goodwill, based upon the lowest level of independent cash flows ascertainable to evaluate impairment. If an impairment indicator exists, we compare the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset/asset group to the carrying value of the asset/asset group. If the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset/asset group, we would calculate discounted future cash flows based on market participant assumptions. If the sum of discounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset/asset group, we would recognize an impairment loss. The impairment related to
long-lived assets is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset(s) exceeds the fair value of the asset(s). When fair values are not readily available, we estimate fair values using discounted expected future cash flows. Such estimates of fair value require significant judgment, and actual fair value could differ due to changes in the expectations of cash flows or other assumptions, including discount rates.
In the evaluation of the fair value and future benefits of finite long-lived assets attached to retail stores, we perform our cash flow analysis generally on a store-by-store basis. Various factors including future sales growth and profit margins are included in this analysis. To the extent these future projections or strategies change, the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from the current estimates.
Goodwill is reviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment. The Company performed annual impairment test on its wholesale and retail reporting units, respectively. In the analysis performed for the wholesale reporting unit, there was less than 10% excess fair value over carrying value. Should actual result differ from certain key assumptions used in impairment tests, including revenue and EDITDA growth, which are both impacted by economic conditions, or should other key assumptions change, including discount rates and market multiples, in subsequent periods the Company could record impairment change for goodwill.
For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, reporting units are determined by identifying individual operating segments within our organization which constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and is reviewed by management. Components within an operating segment are aggregated to the extent that they have similar economic characteristics. Based on this evaluation, we have determined that our operating segments, wholesale and retail, represent our reporting units for the purposes of our goodwill impairment test.
If it is concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit using a combination of a market approach and an income approach. If such carrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to such excess. The fair value of a reporting unit refers to the amount at which the unit as a whole could be sold in a current transaction between willing parties. The determination of such fair value is subjective, and actual fair value could differ due to changes in the expectations of cash flows or other assumptions including discount rates.
Income Taxes
Temporary differences arising from differing treatment of income and expense items for tax and financial reporting purposes result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are recorded on the balance sheet. These balances, as well as income tax expense, are determined through management’s estimations, interpretation of tax law for multiple jurisdictions and tax planning. However, inherent in the measurement of deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of enacted tax laws and published guidance with respect to applicability to our operations. If our actual results differ from estimated results due to changes in tax laws or tax planning, our effective tax rate and tax balances could be affected. As such, these estimates may require adjustment in the future as additional facts become known or as circumstances change. A valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740 prescribes a comprehensive model of how a company should recognize, measure, present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return. In accordance with these requirements, we recognize a tax benefit when a tax position is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination, based solely on its technical merits. We measure the recognized tax benefit as the largest amount of tax benefit that has greater than a 50% likelihood of being realized upon the ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. We reverse previously recognized tax benefits if we determine that the tax position no longer meets the more-likely-than-not threshold of being sustained. We accrue interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
Stock-Based Compensation
Accounting for stock-based compensation requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock-based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation expense over the service period for awards which are expected to vest.
The value of our stock-based awards is recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures. The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment and to the extent that actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates such revisions will be recorded as cumulative adjustments in the periods during which the estimates are revised. Actual results and future estimates may differ significantly from our current estimates.
The Company grants restricted stock units which vest if certain cash flow and earnings per share targets are met. We recognize compensation expense for such awards if it is probable that the awards will vest. Determining whether it is probable that such awards will vest requires judgment and to the extent that actual results, or revised estimates, differ from our current estimates, such revisions will be recorded as cumulative adjustments in the periods during which the estimates are changed. Actual results and future estimates may differ significantly from our current estimates.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-04, which provides guidance providing optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by the discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or by another reference rate expected to be discontinued. Additionally, in January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01, which allows entities to elect certain optional expedients and exceptions when accounting for derivative contracts and certain hedging relationships affected by changes in the interest rates. These ASUs are effective as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) - Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement”. The new guidance improves and clarifies the fair value measurement disclosure requirements of ASC 820. The new disclosure requirements include the disclosure of the changes in unrealized gains or losses included in other comprehensive (loss) income for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements held at the end of the reporting period and the explicit requirement to disclose the range and weighted average used to develop significant unobservable inputs for Level 3 fair value measurements. The other provisions of ASU 2018-13 also include eliminated and modified disclosure requirements. The guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company has adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2020, prospectively and the adoption and application of this standard did not have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements.
In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, “Compensation - Stock Compensation: Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting”. The ASU simplifies the accounting for non-employee share-based payments. The Company adopted the update during the first quarter of 2019. The pronouncement requires companies to record the impact of adoption, if any, as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the adoption date. Therefore, on January 1, 2019, the Company decreased retained earnings by $503. Additionally, the Company increased additional paid-in capital by $662 and recorded a $159 deferred income tax asset.
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, “Derivatives and Hedging: Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities”. The pronouncement amends the existing hedge accounting model in order to enable entities to better portray the economics of their risk management activities in their financial statements. The Company adopted the update during the first quarter of 2019 and such adoption had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In January 2017 the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, “Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment”, which eliminates the requirement to measure a goodwill impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. Under the amendments in ASU 2017-04, an entity will perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity will recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value; however, the loss recognized will not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Additionally, an entity will consider income tax effects from any tax-deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. The Company adopted ASU No. 2017-04 during the first quarter of 2019. See Note 4 - Goodwill.
In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, “Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash”. The pronouncement requires companies to show changes in the total of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. The Company adopted the pronouncement, which requires retrospective application, during the first quarter of 2018. The impact of such adoption was immaterial to the Company’s consolidated financial statements. See Note 27 - Restricted Cash, for further discussion.
In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments”. The pronouncement clarifies how entities should classify certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows. The Company adopted the pronouncement during the first quarter of 2018 and such adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses”. The ASU changes how entities will account for credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. The ASU requires that an entity measure and recognize expected credit losses at the time the asset is recorded, while considering a broader range of information to estimate credit losses including macroeconomic conditions that correlate with historical loss experience, delinquency trends and aging behavior of receivables, among others. The Company has adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2020, prospectively, with respect to its receivables, and the adoption and application of this standard did not have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements during the year ended 2020.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases”. The ASU requires that companies recognize assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by companies’ leases. The Company’s lease portfolio is primarily comprised of store leases, manufacturing and distribution facility leases, warehouse leases and office leases. Most of the leases are operating leases.
The Company adopted the new lease standard during the first quarter of 2019 and, to the extent required by the pronouncement, recognized a right of use asset and liability for its operating lease arrangements with terms of greater than twelve months. See the Company’s December 31, 2019 consolidated balance sheet for the impact of such adoption.
The pronouncement had no impact on the Company’s consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss and it did not impact the Company’s compliance with its debt covenants. Additionally, the standard requires companies to make certain disclosures. See Note 26 - Leases.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)”. The pronouncement contains a five-step model which replaces most existing revenue recognition guidance. The new standard became effective for the Company on January 1, 2018. The Company adopted the pronouncement using the modified retrospective approach. Therefore, on January 1, 2018, the Company adjusted its accounting for certain discounts which are related to the timing of payments by customers of its wholesale business and the Company recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment which reduced retained earnings by $46. Additionally, as of such date, the Company modified its accounting for certain metallic balloon sales of its wholesale segment and started to defer the recognition of revenue on such sales, and the related costs, until the balloons have been filled with helium. As a result, the Company recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment which increased retained earnings by $8. Finally, as of such date, the Company adjusted its accounting for certain discounts on wholesale sales of seasonal product and the Company recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment which reduced retained earnings by $40. See Note 24 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers, of Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the adoption of the pronouncement and the Company’s revenue recognition policy.
