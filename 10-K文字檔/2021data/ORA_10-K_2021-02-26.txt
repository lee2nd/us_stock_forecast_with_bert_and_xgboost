General
Overview of Fiscal Year 2020 Revenues
For the year ended December 31, 2020, our total revenues decreased by 5.5% (from $746.0 million to $705.3 million) over the previous year driven by lower revenues in the Product segment.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, Electricity segment revenues were $541.4 million, compared to $540.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of 0.2%. Product segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $148.1 million, compared to $191.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of 22.5%. Energy Storage segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $15.8 million, compared to $14.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 an increase of 7.6%.
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our consolidated power plants generated 6,043,993 MWh and 6,238,272 MWh, respectively, decreased of 3.1%. The average prices during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $89.6 and $86.6 per MWh, respectively.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, our Electricity segment generated 76.8% of our total revenues (72.4% in 2019), while our Product segment generated 21.0% of our total revenues (25.6% in 2019), and our Energy Storage segment generated 2.2% of our total revenues (2.0% in 2019).
For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 98.2% of our Electricity segment revenues were from PPAs with fixed energy rates which are not affected by fluctuations in energy commodity prices. We have variable price PPAs in California and Hawaii, which provide for payments based on the local utilities’ avoided cost, which is the incremental cost that the power purchaser avoids by not having to generate such electrical energy itself or purchase it from others, as follows:
●
The energy rates under the PPAs in California for each Heber 2 power plant in the Heber Complex and the G2 power plant in the Mammoth Complex, a total of between 30 to 40 MW, change primarily based on fluctuations in natural gas prices.
●
The prices paid for electricity pursuant to the 25 MW PPA for the Puna Complex in Hawaii change primarily as a result of variations in the price of oil as well as other commodities. In 2019, we signed a new PPA related to Puna with fixed prices, increased capacity and extended the term until 2052.
To comply with obligations under their respective PPAs, certain of our project subsidiaries are structured as special purpose, bankruptcy remote entities and their assets and liabilities are ring-fenced. Such assets are not generally available to pay our debt, other than debt at the respective project subsidiary level. However, these project subsidiaries are allowed to pay dividends and make distributions of cash flows generated by their assets to us, subject in some cases to restrictions in debt instruments, as described below.
Electricity segment revenues are also subject to seasonal variations and are affected by higher-than-average ambient temperatures, as described below under “Seasonality”.
Revenues attributable to our Product segment are based on the sale of equipment, EPC contracts and the provision of various services to our customers. Product segment revenues may vary from period to period because of the timing of our receipt of purchase orders and the progress of our equipment manufacturing and execution of the relevant project.
Revenues attributable to our Energy Storage segment are generated by several grid-connected BESS facilities that we own and operate from selling energy, capacity and/or ancillary services in merchant markets like PJM Interconnect, ISO New England, the ERCOT and CAISO. The revenues fluctuate over time since a large portion of such revenues are generated in the merchant markets where price volatility is inherent.
Our management assesses the performance of our operating segments differently. In the case of our Electricity segment, when making decisions about potential acquisitions or the development of new projects, management typically focuses on the internal rate of return of the relevant investment, technical and geological matters and other business considerations. Management evaluates our operating power plants based on revenues, expenses, and EBITDA, and our projects that are under development based on costs attributable to each such project. Management evaluates the performance of our Product segment based on the timely delivery of our products, performance quality of our products, revenues and costs actually incurred to complete customer orders compared to the costs originally budgeted for such orders. We evaluate Energy Storage segment performance similar to the Electricity segment with respect to projects that we own and operate and similar to the Product segment when we provide services to third parties.
Recent Developments
The most significant recent developments for our company and business during 2019 and 2020 to date are described below.
•
As of February 2021, the Puna power plant that was shut down following the Kilauea volcano eruption in May 2018, has resumed operation and currently is operating at approximately 13 MW. On the field side, the Company connected one new production well to the power plant and the Company continues its field recovery work, which includes drilling new wells and expects a gradual increase in generation to full capacity by the middle of 2021, assuming field recovery is successfully achieved.
•
In December 2020, we announced that we completed the acquisition of a shovel-ready energy storage asset in Upton County, Texas. We acquired the asset from Con Edison Development. Ormat’s wholly owned subsidiary will design, build, own and operate a 25 MW BESS project at the site. Ormat is targeting commercial operation of the BESS before the end of 2021.
•
In December Ormat announced several departures and appointments in its executive management team:
◦
Zvi Krieger announced that he will step down from his role as Executive Vice President-Electricity Segment on March 31, 2021 and will continue to perform certain duties until his June 30, 2022 retirement date.
◦
Shimon Hatzir was appointed to the role of Executive Vice President-Electricity Segment, effective April 1, 2021.
◦
Shlomi Argas, Executive Vice President-Operations and Products of Ormat, was appointed to serve as a President of Ormat, effective January 1, 2021.
•
In October and December of 2020, the Company entered into two settlement agreements with the KRA in relation to three the NoAs which were previously issued by the KRA, totaling approximately $200 million, including interest and penalties. The settlement agreements covered tax years from 2013 through 2019, included deferral of tax benefits to be utilized in years subsequent to 2019 in an amount of approximately $28 million and resulted in a tax payment of approximately $29.5 million, including interest and penalties which was made in 2020. This concluded all open audits and NoAs with the KRA.
•
In November 2020, we announced that we closed a public offering of 4,150,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $74.00 per share and fully exercised the underwriters' option to purchase an additional 622,500 shares of common stock at the same price. We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures, and for potential acquisitions, including complementary businesses, technologies or assets.
•
In October 2020, we announced the signing of two Resource Adequacy Agreements, each for 50% of our 5 MW / 20 MWh Tierra Buena battery energy storage project currently under development in Sutter County, northern California. The agreements were signed with two Community Choice Aggregators, Redwood Coast Energy Authority and Valley Clean Energy.
•
In September 2020, we announced that ENEE, our customer for our Platanares geothermal power plant in Honduras, had paid the $20 million overdue payment that was outstanding from prior years.
•
In July 2020, we completed the acquisition of the Pomona energy storage asset in California from Alta Gas for a total net consideration of $43.3 million. The Pomona energy storage facility has been in commercial operation since December 31, 2016 under a 10-year energy storage resource adequacy agreement with Southern California Edison Company. It also participates in the energy and ancillary services markets run by the California Independent System Operator.
•
In July 2020, we issued approximately $290.0 million of bonds (the "Bonds") that were issued in New Israeli Shekels and were converted to U.S. Dollars using a cross-currency swap transaction (the “Swap”) at an effective fixed interest rate of 4.34%. The $290 million of bonds will mature in June 2031 and bear, prior to the Swap, a fixed interest rate of 3.35% per annum, payable semi-annually starting December 2020. The Bonds will be repaid in 10 equal installments starting June 2022, unless prepaid earlier by Ormat pursuant to the terms and conditions of the trust instrument that will govern the Bonds. The Bonds received a rating of ilAA- from Maloot S&P in Israel with a stable outlook. In April and May 2020, we also raised approximately $130 million of new corporate debt from existing lenders.
•
In June 2020, we completed the enhancement of our Steamboat Hills complex and increased its generating capacity by 19MW to a total of 84MW. Enhancement work included the replacement of all old generating unit equipment with new, state-of-the-art equipment and resource modifications. The new equipment will increase the productivity and efficiency of the power plant and is expected to reduce maintenance costs per kWh. The Steamboat Hills power plant continues to sell its electricity under the current 25-year long term portfolio power purchase agreement with SCPPA, with 100% of the capacity going to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.
•
In April 2020, we announced the commercial operation of the Rabbit Hill Battery Energy Storage System ("BESS") facility, providing required ancillary services and energy optimization to the wholesale markets managed by ERCOT. The facility is located in the City of Georgetown, Texas, and it is sized to provide approximately 10 MW of fast responding capacity to the ERCOT market.
•
In February 2020, we announced a transition of our senior management. Mr. Isaac Angel retired from his position as Chief Executive Officer a in July 1, 2020, after six years of service and became a member of Ormat’s Board of Directors and its chairman. Ormat’s Board of Directors has appointed Mr. Blachar as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Mr. Assaf Ginzburg as the Chief Financial Officer.
•
In January 2020, we signed two similar PPAs with Silicon Valley Clean Energy ("SVCE") and Monterey Bay Community Power ("MBCP"). Under the PPAs, SVCE and MBCP will each purchase 7 MW (for a total of 14 MW) of power generated by the expected 30 MW Casa Diablo-IV ("CD4") geothermal project located in Mammoth Lakes, California that is under construction. The PPAs are for a term of 10 years and have a fixed MWh price, which includes energy, capacity, environmental attributes, and all other ancillary benefits. The remaining 16 MW of generating capacity will be sold under an additional PPA with SCPPA, which was signed in early 2019. The CD4 power plant is expected to be on-line in Q1 2022, and will be the first geothermal power plant built within the CAISO balancing authority in the last 30 years and will be the first in Ormat’s portfolio that will sell its output to a Community Choice Aggregator.
COVID 19 Update
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the novel coronavirus ("COVID-19") a pandemic.
The Company implemented significant measures both to comply with government requirements and to preserve the health and safety of its employees. These measures include working remotely where possible and operating separate shifts in its power plants, manufacturing facilities and other locations while trying to continue operations as close to full capacity in all locations. During the year and subsequently, the Company's power plants, manufacturing facility and storage facilities have been operating at close to full capacity and there has been no material impact on our operations as a result of these measures. With respect to our employees, we have not laid-off or furloughed any employees due to the COVID-19 and continued to pay full salaries.
We experienced the following impacts on our segment operations:
•
In our Electricity segment, almost all of our revenues in 2020 were generated under long term contracts and the majority have a fixed energy rate. As a result, despite logistical and other challenges, we experienced limited impact of COVID-19 on our Electricity segment. Nevertheless, we received two notices declaring a force majeure event in Kenya from KPLC and in Honduras from ENEE, both had an immaterial impact on our revenues and removed. In addition, we experienced a higher rate of curtailments during the first half of 2020 by KPLC in the Olkaria complex that was reduced in the second half of 2020. The impact of the curtailments is limited because of the structure of the PPA which secures the vast majority of our revenues with fixed capacity payments and is unrelated to the electricity actually generated (in 2019 and 2020, capacity payments represented 70.1% and 74.4% of our revenues, respectively). ENEE has initiated discussions with several IPPs, including Ormat, on potential changes in their existing PPAs. However, our Platanares geothermal power plant has one of the lowest rates of renewable energy in the country, and we expect this fact to have positive implications for our discussions with ENEE. In addition, our future growth in the Electricity segment is and would be adversely impacted by delays we are experiencing in receiving the required development and construction permits, as well as by the implications of global and local restrictions on our ability to procure raw materials and ship to our products. Furthermore, our future growth in the Electricity segment might be adversely impacted by a lack of funding for projects, a decrease in demand for electricity, delays in permitting and the implications of global and local restrictions on our ability to procure raw material and ship our products.
•
Our Product segment revenues are generated from sales of products and services pursuant to contracts, under which we have a right to payment for any product that was produced for the customer. Recognition of revenue under these contracts is impacted by delays in the progress of the third-party projects into which our products and services are incorporated. We experienced delays and significant cost increases in one of the projects in the Product segment that adversely impacted our results of operations during 2020. We had a product backlog of $33.4 million as of February 24, 2020, which includes revenues for the period between January 1, 2021 and February 24, 2020, compared to $141.9 million as of February 25, 2020. We believe that the decline in backlog resulted mainly from the impact of COVID-19 and the unwillingness of potential customers to enter into new commitments at this time. Nevertheless, for the reasons set out above, restrictions on travel and because our customers are deferring their decision to purchase, we expect that 2021 product segment revenues will be significantly lower than revenues of 2020.
•
Our Energy Storage segment generates revenues mainly from participating in the energy and ancillary services markets, run by regional transmission operators and independent system operators in the various markets where our assets operate. Therefore, the revenues these assets generate is directly impacted by the prevailing market prices for energy and/or ancillary services.
•
In addition, we experience delays in the permitting for new projects in all segments that may create penalties and cause a delay in those projects.
Despite our efforts to provide insight into the performance of our business and the trends affecting it, as of the date of this filing, significant uncertainty exists concerning the magnitude of the impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. We may continue to become subject to any of the following impacts:
•
limitations on the ability of our suppliers to obtain raw materials that are required for the manufacturing of the products we either sell to third parties or build for ourselves or to meet delivery requirements and commitments that may result in penalty payments;
•
impact on our efforts to sign new contracts for our Product segment due to operational and travel restrictions and availability of our customers and their willingness to enter into new agreements;
•
limitations on the ability of our customers to pay us on a timely basis;
•
additional declarations of COVID-19 as force majeure by our customers and suppliers;
•
a reduction in the demand for electricity and for our products;
•
change in regulations, taxes and levies that may affect our operations and cost structure;
•
risk of infection among employees that may impact the day-to-day operations;
•
delays in obtaining the required permits that may create penalties and impact our ability to implement our growth plan;
•
limited ability to oversee remote operation due to travel restrictions.
Opportunities, Trends and Uncertainties
Different trends, factors and uncertainties may impact our operations and financial condition, including many that we do not or cannot foresee. However, we believe that our results of operations and financial condition for the foreseeable future will be primarily affected by the following trends, factors and uncertainties that are from time to time also subject to market cycles:
•
There has been increased demand for energy generated from geothermal and other renewable resources in the United States as costs for electricity generated from renewable resources have become more competitive. Much of this is attributable to legislative and regulatory requirements and incentives, such as state RPS and federal tax credits such as PTCs or ITCs (which are discussed in more detail in the section entitled “Government Grants and Tax Benefits” below). We believe that future demand for energy generated from geothermal and other renewable resources in the United States will be driven primarily by further commitment to, and implementation of, state RPS and greenhouse gas reduction initiatives.
•
We expect that a variety of local governmental initiatives will create new opportunities for the development of new projects with the potential to realize higher returns on our equity as well as to create additional markets for our products. These initiatives include the award of long-term contracts to independent power generators, the creation of competitive wholesale markets for selling and trading energy, capacity and related energy products and the adoption of programs designed to encourage “clean” renewable and sustainable energy sources.
•
In the Electricity segment, we expect intense domestic competition from the solar, hybrid solar and energy storage and wind power generation industries to continue and increase as well as increased competition from the solar combined with storage projects. While we believe the expected demand for renewable energy will be large enough to accommodate increased competition, any such increase in competition, including increasing amounts of renewable energy under contract as well as any further decline in natural gas prices attributable to increased production and reduction in energy storage costs are contributing to a reduction in electricity prices. However, despite increased competition from the solar and wind power generation industries, we believe that firm and flexible, base-load electricity, such as geothermal-based energy, will continue to be an important source of renewable energy in areas with commercially viable geothermal resources.
•
In the Product segment, we see new opportunities in New Zealand, Turkey, the U.S., Asia Pacific and Central and South America. We have experienced increased competition from binary power plant equipment suppliers including the major steam turbine manufacturers. While we believe that we have a distinct competitive advantage based on our technology, accumulated experience and current worldwide share of installed binary generation capacity, an increase in competition may impact our ability to secure new purchase orders from potential customers. The increased competition may also lead to further reductions in the prices that we are able to charge for our binary equipment
•
The average price per MWh, which is one of the metrics some investors may use to evaluate power plant revenues, can fluctuate from period to period. Based on our Electricity segment, we earned, on average, $89.6 and $86.6 per MWh in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Oil and natural gas prices, together with other factors that affect our Electricity segment revenues, could cause changes in our average price per MWh in the future.
•
Turkey’s geothermal market is one of the fastest growing markets in the geothermal industry worldwide, mainly due to governmental and regulatory support. Turkey is ranked fourth globally with an installed geothermal capacity of over 1,600 MW. In 2020 we had less revenue exposure to the Turkish market, due to a slowdown in project development in that market, with further impacts from the COVID-19 outbreak. The continued deterioration in that Turkish economy, devaluation in the Turkish Lira and increase in local interest rates or a decline in government support for the development of geothermal power in the country could affect local demand for the geothermal equipment and services we provide, collection from our customers or the prices we may charge for such equipment and services. In February 2021, the incentive plan and regulation for renewable energy generation in Turkey was renewed and the updated FIT is lower than the previous one. This recent update and the economic status of the country lead us to estimate that the slowdown in development of new sites will continue. In addition, the impact of threatened or actual U.S. sanctions on the Turkish economy and the straining of U.S.-Turkey diplomatic relations may harm regional demand or price competitiveness for the geothermal equipment and services we provide in the Turkish market, in turn decreasing our Product segment profit margins, cash flows and financial condition. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we derived 9% and 44% of our Total revenues and Product revenues, respectively, from our Turkish operations. We are monitoring any change in the political and business environments that may affect our future business and operations in the country.
•
Ormat established a manufacturing facility in Turkey in order to locally produce several power plant components that entitle our customers to increased incentives under the renewable energy laws. The use of local equipment in renewable energy based generating facilities in Turkey entitles such facilities to significant benefits under Turkish law, provided such facilities have obtained an RER Certificate from EMRA, which requires the issuance of a local certificate. If we do not obtain the local certificate, then some of our customers under the relevant supply agreements in Turkey may not be issued a RER Certificate based on the equipment we supply to them, and we will be required to make a payment to such customers equal to the amount of the expected lost benefit.
Revenues
Sources of Revenues
We generate our revenues from the sale of electricity from our geothermal and recovered energy-based power plants; the design, manufacture and sale of equipment for electricity generation; the construction, installation and engineering of power plant equipment; and the sale of energy storage services and electricity from our operating energy storage facilities .
Revenues attributable to our Electricity segment are derived from the sale of electricity from our power plants pursuant to long-term PPAs. While approximately 98.2% of our Electricity revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 were derived from PPAs with fixed price components and the balance from variable price PPAs in California and Hawaii. Accordingly, our revenues from those power plants may fluctuate.
Our Electricity segment revenues are also subject to seasonal variations, as more fully described in “Seasonality” below.
Our PPAs generally provide for energy payments alone, or energy and capacity payments. Generally, capacity payments are payments calculated based on the amount of time and capacity that our power plants are available to generate electricity. Some of our PPAs provide for bonus payments in the event that we are able to exceed certain capacity target levels and the potential forfeiture of payments if we fail to meet certain minimum capacity target levels. Energy payments, on the other hand, are payments calculated based on the amount of electrical energy delivered to the relevant power purchaser at a designated delivery point. Our more recent PPAs generally provide for energy payments alone with an obligation to compensate the off-taker for its incremental costs as a result of shortfalls in our supply.
Revenues attributable to our Product segment fluctuate between periods, primarily based on our ability to receive customer orders, the status and timing of such orders, delivery of raw materials and the completion of manufacturing. Larger customer orders for our products are typically the result of our sales efforts, our participation in, and winning tenders or requests for proposals issued by potential customers in connection with projects they are developing and orders by returning customers. Such projects often take a significant amount of time to design and develop and are subject to various contingencies, such as the customer’s ability to raise the necessary financing for a project. Consequently, we are generally unable to predict the timing of such orders for our products and may not be able to replace existing orders that we have completed with new ones. As a result, revenues from our Product segment fluctuate (sometimes extensively) from period to period.
Revenues attributable to our Energy Storage segment are generated by several grid-connected BESS facilities that we own and operate from selling energy, capacity and/or ancillary services in merchant markets like PJM Interconnect, ISO New England, ERCOT and CAISO. The revenues fluctuate over time since a large portion of such revenues are generated in the merchant markets, where price volatility is inherent.
We are pursuing the development of additional grid-connected BESS projects in multiple regions, with expected revenues coming from providing energy, capacity and/or ancillary services on a merchant basis, and/or through bilateral contracts with load serving entities, investor owned utilities, publicly owned utilities and community choice aggregators. We also pursue financial instruments, where appropriate, to hedge some of the merchant risk.
The following table sets forth a breakdown of our revenues for the years indicated:
Geographic Breakdown of Results of Operations
The following table sets forth the geographic breakdown of the revenues attributable to our Electricity, Product and Energy Storage segments for the years indicated:
In 2020, 2019 and 2018, 49%, 49% and 54% of our revenues were derived from international operations of all 3 segments combined, respectively, and our international operations were more profitable than our U.S. operations in each of those years. A substantial portion of international revenues came from Kenya and Turkey and, to a lesser extent, from Honduras, Guadeloupe, Guatemala and other countries. Our operations in Kenya contributed disproportionately to gross profit and net income. The contribution to combined pre-tax income of our domestic and foreign operations within our Electricity segment and Product segment differ in a number of ways.
Electricity Segment. Our Electricity segment domestic revenues were approximately 63%, 62% and 60% of our total Electricity segment for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. However, domestic operations in our Electricity segment have higher costs of revenues and expenses than the foreign operations in our Electricity segment. Our foreign power plants are located in lower-cost regions, like Kenya, Guatemala, Honduras and Guadeloupe, which favorably impact payroll and maintenance expenses among other items. They are also newer than most of our domestic power plants and therefore tend to have lower maintenance costs and higher availability factors than our domestic power plants. Consequently, in 2020 the international operations of the segment accounted for 51% of our total gross profits, 70% of our net income and 45% of our EBITDA. However, financing costs related to the international projects are higher than financing costs related to our domestic activity.
Product Segment. Our Product segment foreign revenues were 96%, 84% and 93% of our total Product segment revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our Product segment foreign activity also benefits from lower costs of revenues and expenses than Product segment domestic activity such as labor and transportation costs. Accordingly, our Product segment foreign activity contributes more than our Product segment domestic activity to our pre-tax income from operations.
Seasonality
Electricity generation from some of our geothermal power plants is subject to seasonal variations; in the winter, our power plants produce more energy primarily attributable to the lower ambient temperature, which has a favorable impact on the energy component of our Electricity segment revenues and the prices under many of our contracts are fixed throughout the year with no time-of-use impact. The prices paid for electricity under the PPAs for the Heber 2 power plant in the Heber Complex, the Mammoth Complex and the North Brawley power plant in California, the Raft River power plant in Idaho and the Neal Hot Springs power plant in Oregon, are higher in the months of June through September. The higher payments payable under these PPAs in the summer months partially offset the negative impact on our revenues from lower generation in the summer attributable to a higher ambient temperature. As a result, we expect the revenues and gross profit in the winter months to be higher than the revenues and gross profit in the summer months.
Breakdown of Cost of Revenues
Electricity Segment
The principal cost of revenues attributable to our operating power plants are operation and maintenance expenses comprised of salaries and related employee benefits, equipment expenses, costs of parts and chemicals, costs related to third-party services, lease expenses, royalties, startup and auxiliary electricity purchases, property taxes, insurance, depreciation and amortization and, for some of our projects, purchases of make-up water for use in our cooling towers. In our California power plants, our principal cost of revenues also includes transmission charges and scheduling charges. In some of our Nevada power plants we also incur transmission and wheeling charges. Some of these expenses, such as parts, third-party services and major maintenance, are not incurred on a regular basis. This results in fluctuations in our expenses and our results of operations for individual power plants from quarter to quarter. Payments made to government agencies and private entities on account of site leases where power plants are located are included in cost of revenues. Royalty payments, included in cost of revenues, are made as compensation for the right to use certain geothermal resources and are paid as a percentage of the revenues derived from the associated geothermal rights. Royalties constituted approximately 3.8% and 4.1% of Electricity segment revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Product Segment
The principal cost of revenues attributable to our Product segment are materials, salaries and related employee benefits, expenses related to subcontracting activities, and transportation expenses. Sales commissions to sales representatives are included in selling and marketing expenses. Some of the principal expenses attributable to our Product segment, such as a portion of the costs related to labor, utilities and other support services are fixed, while others, such as materials, construction, transportation and sales commissions, are variable and may fluctuate significantly, depending on market conditions. As a result, the cost of revenues attributable to our Product segment, expressed as a percentage of total revenues, fluctuates. Another reason for such fluctuation is that in responding to bids for our products, we price our products and services in relation to existing competition and other prevailing market conditions, which may vary substantially from order to order.
Energy Storage Segment
The principal cost of revenues attributable to our Energy Storage segment are direct costs attributable to providing services to our customers, direct costs associated with software development and the direct cost of BESS that we own. Direct costs include labor costs of our network operations center, the labor of software development effort and the labor associated with operations and maintenance of owned BESS. Cost of revenues attributable to our Energy Storage segment also include cost of equipment sold to customers in delivering our automated demand response and software services at a customer’s location.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions
Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8 of this annual report. However, certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to an understanding of our financial position and results of operations. In applying these critical accounting estimates and assumptions, our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in making certain estimates. Such estimates are based on management’s historical experience, the terms of existing contracts, management’s observance of trends in the geothermal industry, information provided by our customers and information available to management from other outside sources, as appropriate. Such estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and, as a result, actual results could differ from our estimates. Our critical accounting policies include:
•
Revenues and Cost of Revenues. Revenues generated from the construction of geothermal and recovered energy-based power plant equipment and other equipment on behalf of third parties (Product revenues) are recognized using the percentage of completion method, which requires estimates of future costs over the full term of product delivery. Such cost estimates are made by management based on prior operations and specific project characteristics and designs. If management’s estimates of total estimated costs with respect to our Product segment are inaccurate, then the percentage of completion is inaccurate resulting in an over- or under-estimate of gross margins. As a result, we review and update our cost estimates on significant contracts on a quarterly basis, and at least on an annual basis for all others, or when circumstances change and warrant a modification to a previous estimate. Changes in job performance, job conditions, and estimated profitability, including those arising from the application of penalty provisions in relevant contracts and final contract settlements, may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. Provisions for estimated losses relating to contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Revenues generated from engineering and operating services and sales of products and parts are recorded once the service is provided or product delivery is made, as applicable.
•
Property, Plant and Equipment. We capitalize all costs associated with the acquisition, development and construction of power plant facilities. Major improvements are capitalized and repairs and maintenance (including major maintenance) costs are expensed. We estimate the useful life of our power plants to range between 25 and 30 years. Such estimates are made by management based on factors such as prior operations, the terms of the underlying PPAs, geothermal resources, the location of the assets and specific power plant characteristics and designs. Changes in such estimates could result in useful lives which are either longer or shorter than the depreciable lives of such assets. We periodically re-evaluate the estimated useful life of our power plants and revise the remaining depreciable life on a prospective basis.
We capitalize costs incurred in connection with the exploration and development of geothermal resources beginning when we acquire land rights to the potential geothermal resource. Prior to acquiring land rights, we make an initial assessment that an economically feasible geothermal reservoir is probable on that land using available data and external assessments vetted through our exploration department and occasionally outside service providers. Costs incurred prior to acquiring land rights are expensed. It normally takes two to three years from the time we start active exploration of a particular geothermal resource to the time we have an operating production well, assuming we conclude the resource is commercially viable.
In most cases, we obtain the right to conduct our geothermal development and operations on land owned by the BLM, various states or with private parties. In consideration for certain of these leases, we may pay an up-front non-refundable bonus payment which is a component of the competitive lease process. This payment and other related costs are capitalized and included in construction-in-process. Once we acquire land rights to the potential geothermal resource, we perform additional activities to assess the commercial viability of the resource. Such activities include, among others, conducting surveys and other analysis, obtaining drilling permits, creating access roads to drilling sites, and exploratory drilling which may include temperature gradient holes and/or slim holes. Such costs are capitalized and included in construction-in-process. Once our exploration activities are complete, we finalize our assessment as to the commercial viability of the geothermal resource and either proceed to the construction phase for a power plant or abandon the site. If we decide to abandon a site, all previously capitalized costs associated with the exploration project are written off.
Our assessment of economic viability of an exploration project involves significant management judgment and uncertainties as to whether a commercially viable resource exists at the time we acquire land rights and begin to capitalize such costs. As a result, it is possible that our initial assessment of a geothermal resource may be incorrect and we will have to write off costs associated with the project that were previously capitalized. Due to the uncertainties inherent in geothermal exploration, historical impairments may not be indicative of future impairments. Included in construction-in-process are costs related to projects in exploration and development of $51.5 million and $84.6 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Included in these amounts at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, are $5.3 million and $17.0 million, respectively, which relate to up-front bonus payments.
•
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of. We evaluate long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment and construction-in-process for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Factors which could trigger an impairment include, among others, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in our use of assets or our overall business strategy, negative industry or economic trends, a determination that an exploration project will not support commercial operations, a determination that a suspended project is not likely to be completed, a significant increase in costs necessary to complete a project, legal factors relating to our business or when we conclude that it is more likely than not that an asset will be disposed of or sold.
We test our operating plants that are operated together as a complex for impairment at the complex level because the cash flows of such plants result from significant shared operating activities. For example, the operating power plants in a complex are managed under a combined operation management generally with one central control room that controls all of the power plants in a complex and one maintenance group that services all of the power plants in a complex. As a result, the cash flows from individual plants within a complex are not largely independent of the cash flows of other plants within the complex. We test for impairment of our operating plants which are not operated as a complex, as well as our projects under exploration, development or construction that are not part of an existing complex, at the plant or project level. To the extent an operating plant becomes part of a complex in the future, we will test for impairment at the complex level.
Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. The significant assumptions that we use in estimating our undiscounted future cash flows include (i) projected generating capacity of the power plant and rates to be received under the respective PPA and (ii) projected operating expenses of the relevant power plant. Estimates of future cash flows used to test recoverability of a long-lived asset under development also include cash flows associated with all future expenditures necessary to develop the asset. If future cash flows are less than the assumptions we used in such estimates, we may incur impairment losses in the future that could be material to our financial condition and/or results of operations.
If our assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. We believe that for the year ended December 31, 2020, no impairment exists for any of our long-lived assets; however, estimates as to the recoverability of such assets may change based on revised circumstances. Estimates of the fair value of assets require estimating useful lives and selecting a discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows.
•
Goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of consideration transferred in the business combination transactions over the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired, net of the fair value of liabilities assumed and the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquisitions. Goodwill is not amortized but rather subject to a periodic impairment testing on an annual basis (on December 31 of each year) or if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. Additionally, we are permitted to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary. Further testing is only required if the entity determines, based on the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. Otherwise, no further impairment testing is required. An entity has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to step one of the quantitative goodwill impairment test. This would not preclude the entity from performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), which was adopted by us in 2018, under which step two of the goodwill impairment test was eliminated. Step two measured a goodwill impairment test by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. Under ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value as calculated under step one described above. However, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
•
Obligations Associated with the Retirement of Long-Lived Assets. We record the fair market value of legal liabilities related to the retirement of our assets in the period in which such liabilities are incurred. These liabilities include our obligation to plug wells upon termination of our operating activities, the dismantling of our power plants upon cessation of our operations, and the performance of certain remedial measures related to the land on which such operations were conducted. When a new liability for an asset retirement obligation is recorded, we capitalize the costs of such liability by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. Such liability is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. At retirement, we either settle the obligation for its recorded amount or report either a gain or a loss with respect thereto. Estimates of the costs associated with asset retirement obligations are based on factors such as prior operations, the location of the assets and specific power plant characteristics. We review and update our cost estimates periodically and adjust our asset retirement obligations in the period in which the revisions are determined. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions used in estimating our asset retirement obligations, we may incur additional losses that could be material to our financial condition or results of operations.
•
Accounting for Income Taxes. Significant estimates are required to arrive at our consolidated income tax provision. This process requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and to make an assessment of temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes. Such differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. For those jurisdictions where the projected operating results indicate that realization of our net deferred tax assets is not more likely than not, a valuation allowance is recorded.
We evaluate our ability to utilize the deferred tax assets quarterly and assess the need for a valuation allowance. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we estimate future taxable income, including the impacts of the enacted tax law, the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax credits and tax loss carryforwards. Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes in tax laws, statutory tax rates, and future taxable income. We have recorded a partial valuation allowance related to our U.S. deferred tax assets. In the future, if there is sufficient evidence that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in the United States, we may be required to reduce this valuation allowance, resulting in income tax benefits in our consolidated statement of operations.
In the ordinary course of business, there can be inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions. We assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, which is greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information, we recognize between 0 to 100% of the tax benefit. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we do not recognize any tax benefit in the consolidated financial statements. Resolution of uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
New Accounting Pronouncements
See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8 of this annual report for information regarding new accounting pronouncements.
Results of Operations
Our historical operating results in dollars and as a percentage of total revenues are presented below.
Results as a percentage of revenues
Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2020 and the Year Ended December 31, 2019
Total Revenues
Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $705.3 million, compared to $746.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which represented a 5% decrease from the prior year period. This decrease was attributable to a $42.9 million or 22% decrease in our Product segment revenues compared to the corresponding period in 2019, as discussed below. The decrease was partially offset by a slight increase in our Electricity segment revenues and Energy Storage segment revenues.
Electricity Segment
Revenues attributable to our Electricity segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $541.4 million, compared to $540.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing a 0.2% increase from the prior period.
Power generation in our power plants decreased by 3.1% from 6,238,272 MWh for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 6,043,993 MWh in the year ended December 31, 2020, due to the lower generation at some of our power plants, including our OREG facilities and Olkaria complex that were impacted by lower demand due to COVID-19. However, revenues remained unchanged due to higher average energy rate per MWh of our entire portfolio.
Product Segment
Revenues attributable to our Product segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $148.1 million, compared to $191.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing a 22.5% decrease from the prior period. The decrease in our Product segment revenues was mainly due to projects in Turkey and the U.S., which were completed in 2019 and accounted for $75.9 million in revenues in the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was partially offset by other projects in Turkey, New Zealand and Chile, which started in 2019, and provided $98.3 million in revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $86.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, and other projects in mainly in Turkey, which started in 2020 and provided $29.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The overall decrease in Product revenues is also attributable to the impact of COVID-19 which resulted in delays in the progress of the third-party projects as well as unwillingness of potential customers to enter into new commitments.
Energy Storage Segment
Revenues attributable to our Energy Storage segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $15.8 million compared to $14.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing a 7.6% increase. The increase was mainly driven by $4.8 million of revenues from the acquisition of the Pomona energy storage asset as well as the commissioning of Rabitt Hill in Texas, offset by $2.8 million in revenues from a one-time EPC project in the year ended December 31, 2019.
Total Cost of Revenues
Total cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $429.1 million compared to $476.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which represented a 10.0% decrease. This decrease was attributable to a decrease of $12.8 million, or 4.1%, in cost of revenues from our Electricity segment, a decrease of $31.0 million, or 21.3%, in cost of revenues from our Product segment and a decrease of $3.9 million, or 21.5%, in cost of revenues from our Energy Storage segment, all as discussed above. As a percentage of total revenues, our total cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased to 60.8% from 63.9% for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Electricity Segment
Total cost of revenues attributable to our Electricity segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $300.1 million, compared to $312.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing a 4.1% decrease from the prior period. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in cost of revenues at our Puna power plant that was shut down immediately following the Kilauea volcanic eruption on May 3, 2018, as the cost of revenues at our Puna power plant for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes a decrease in lease expense of $5.4 million due to the termination of the lease transaction. The decrease was also due to lower operational costs in some of our power plants in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Cost of revenues at our Puna power plant included business interruption recovery of $7.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $9.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. As a percentage of total Electricity revenues, the total cost of revenues attributable to our Electricity segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 55.4%, compared to 57.9% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The cost of revenues attributable to our international power plants was 21.5% of our Electricity segment cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Product Segment
Total cost of revenues attributable to our Product segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $114.9 million, compared to $146.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing a 21.3% decrease from the prior period. This decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in Product segment revenues, different product scope and different margins in the various sales contracts we entered into mainly in Turkey, New Zealand and Chile for the Product segment during these periods. As a percentage of total Product segment revenues, our total cost of revenues attributable to our Product segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 77.6%, compared to 76.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase is mainly related to the higher cost of revenues related to the Nawgha project that we are constructing in New Zealand and that was impacted, among other things, by the restrictions and limitations in the country associated with COVID-19.
Energy Storage Segment
Cost of revenues attributable to our Energy Storage segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $14.1 million as compared to $17.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was mainly driven by cost of revenues from a one-time EPC project in the amount of $2.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, and a decrease in payroll, professional fees and consulting, offset partially by $3.1 million in cost of revenues from the acquisition of the Pomona energy storage asset. The Energy Storage segment includes cost of revenues related to the delivery of energy storage services.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $5.4 million, compared to $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is mainly due to new development projects that took place during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Selling and Marketing Expenses
Selling and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $17.4 million, compared to $15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was mainly due to an increase in sales commissions due to different product mix and increase in marketing activities. Selling and marketing expenses constituted 2.5% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2019.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $60.2 million, compared to $55.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in professional fees, and $1.3 million in costs associated with one of our legal claims, partially offset by a $1.3 million gain from the sale of a concession in one of our foreign locations. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 constituted 8.5% of total revenues for such period, compared to 7.5%, excluding the earn out adjustment, for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Business Interruption Insurance Income
Business interruption insurance income for the year ended December 31, 2020 is attributable to business interruption recoveries relating to the Puna power plant. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized business insurance income of $28.6 million which was included in cost of revenues up to the amount covering the related costs and the remainder, totaling $20.7 million, was included as a business interruption insurance income under operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.
Interest Expense, Net
Interest expense, net, for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $78.0 million, compared to $80.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing a 3.0% decrease from the prior period. This decrease was primarily due to (i) $2 million decrease in interest related to the sale of tax benefits; and (ii) $7 million increase in interest capitalized to projects. The decrease was partially offset by interest expense from: (i) $79.4 million of proceeds from a senior unsecured bonds series 3 received in April and May 2020; (ii) $50.0 million of proceeds from a senior unsecured loan received in April 2020; and (iii) $289.9 million of proceeds from bonds series 4 received in July 2020.
Derivatives and Foreign Currency Transaction Gains (Losses)
Derivatives and foreign currency transaction gains for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $3.8 million, compared to $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Derivatives and foreign currency transaction gains for the year ended December 31, 2020 were attributable primarily to gains from foreign currency forward contracts, which were not accounted for as hedge transactions.
Income Attributable to Sale of Tax Benefits
Income attributable to the sale of tax benefits for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $25.7 million, compared to $20.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Tax equity is a form of financing used for renewable energy projects. This income primarily represents the value of PTCs and taxable income or loss generated by certain of our power plants allocated to investors under tax equity transactions.
Other Non-Operating Income (Expense), Net
Other non-operating income, net for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1.4 million, compared to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Other non-operating income for the year ended December 31, 2020 mainly includes income of $0.6 million for property damage recovery related to the Puna power plant. Other non-operating income for the year ended December 31, 2019 mainly includes income of $1.0 million from the sale of PG&E receivables relating to the January 2019 monthly invoice which was not paid as it occurred before PG&E filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
Income from operations, before income taxes and equity in earnings of investees
Income from operations, before income taxes and equity in earnings of investees for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $168.7 million, compared to $137.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an 22.9% increase from the prior period. This increase was mainly driven by business interruption insurance income of $20.7 million, as described above.
Income Taxes
Income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2020, was $67.0 million, an increase of $21.4 million compared to an income tax provision of $45.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, was 39.7% and 33.2%, respectively. The effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 21% for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to: (i) the mix of business in various countries with higher statutory tax rates than the federal statutory tax rate, and (ii) a net increase in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to U.S. tax attributes, offset by the release of uncertain tax positions in foreign jurisdictions.
Equity in Earnings (losses) of investees, net
Equity in earnings (losses) of investees, net in the year ended December 31, 2020 was $0.1 million, compared to $1.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. Equity in earnings of investees, net is primarily derived from our 12.75% share in the earnings or losses in the Sarulla complex and indirect costs related to our 49% ownership interest in the Ijen project, both located in Indonesia. The decrease was mainly attributable to a lower result of operations due to well-field issues in the NIL power plant which resulted in lower generation. Sarulla is currently developing a remediation plan with a target to increase generation in the near-term. We are following the remediation plans in Sarulla as well as the potential accounting impact on our financial statements in respect of our investment in Sarulla.
Net Income attributable to the Company’s Stockholders
Net income attributable to the Company’s stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $85.5 million, compared to $88.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which represents a decrease of $2.6 million. This decrease was attributable to a $10.9 million in net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, which increased mainly due to the business interruption recovery of the Puna power plant in Hawaii, offset partially by an increase in net income of $8.3 million, all as discussed above.
Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2019 and the year ended December 31, 2018
A discussion of changes in our results of operations in 2019 compared to 2018 has been omitted from this Form10-K, but may be found in “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on March 2, 2020, which is available free of charge on the SECs website at www.sec.gov and at www.Ormat.com, by clicking “Investors” located at the top of the home page.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our principal sources of liquidity have been derived from cash flows from operations, proceeds from third party debt such as borrowings under our credit facilities, private offerings and issuances of debt securities, equity offerings, project financing and tax monetization transactions, short term borrowing under our lines of credit, and proceeds from the sale of equity interests in one or more of our projects. We have utilized this cash to develop and construct power plants, fund our acquisitions, pay down existing outstanding indebtedness, and meet our other cash and liquidity needs.
As of December 31, 2020, we had access to: (i) $448.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which $42.4 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries; and (ii) $389.4 million of unused corporate borrowing capacity under existing lines of credit with different commercial banks.
Our estimated capital needs for 2021 include approximately $445 million for capital expenditures on new projects under development or construction including storage projects, exploration activity and maintenance capital expenditures for our existing projects. In addition, we expect $78.6 million for long-term debt repayments.
As of December 31, 2020, $190.3 million in the aggregate was outstanding under credit agreements with several banks as detailed below under “Letters of Credits under the Credit Agreements”.
We expect to finance these requirements with: (i) the sources of liquidity described above; (ii) positive cash flows from our operations; and (iii) future project financings and re-financings (including construction loans and tax equity). Management believes that, based on the current stage of implementation of our strategic plan, the sources of liquidity and capital resources described above will address our anticipated liquidity, capital expenditures, and other investment requirements.
During 2019, we have revised our assertion to no longer indefinitely reinvest foreign funds held by our foreign subsidiaries, with the exception of a certain balance held in Israel and have accrued the incremental foreign withholding taxes. As a result, we have further liquidity to move funds freely.
Letters of Credits under the Credit Agreements
Some of our customers require our project subsidiaries to post letters of credit in order to guarantee their respective performance under relevant contracts. We are also required to post letters of credit to secure our obligations under various leases and licenses and may, from time to time, decide to post letters of credit in lieu of cash deposits in reserve accounts under certain financing arrangements. In addition, our subsidiary, Ormat Systems, is required from time to time to post performance letters of credit in favor of our customers with respect to orders of products.
Restrictive covenants
Our obligations under the credit agreements, the loan agreements, and the trust instrument governing the bonds described above, are unsecured, but we are subject to a negative pledge in favor of the banks and the other lenders and certain other restrictive covenants. These include, among other things, a prohibition on: (i) creating any floating charge or any permanent pledge, charge or lien over our assets without obtaining the prior written approval of the lender; (ii) guaranteeing the liabilities of any third party without obtaining the prior written approval of the lender; and (iii) selling, assigning, transferring, conveying or disposing of all or substantially all of our assets, or a change of control in our ownership structure. Some of the credit agreements, the term loan agreements, and the trust instrument contain cross-default provisions with respect to other material indebtedness owed by us to any third party. In some cases, we have agreed to maintain certain financial ratios, which are measured quarterly, such as: (i) equity of at least $750 million and in no event less than 25% of total assets; (ii) 12-month debt, net of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term bank deposits to Adjusted EBITDA ratio not to exceed 6.0; and (iii) dividend distributions not to exceed 50% of net income in any calendar year. As of December 31, 2020: (i) total equity was $1,941.4 million and the actual equity to total assets ratio was 49.9% and (ii) the 12-month debt, net of cash and cash equivalents to Adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.36. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we distributed interim dividends in an aggregate amount of $22.5 million. The failure to perform or observe any of the covenants set forth in such agreements, subject to various cure periods, would result in the occurrence of an event of default and would enable the lenders to accelerate all amounts due under each such agreement.
As described above, we are currently in compliance with our covenants with respect to the credit agreements, the loan agreements and the trust instrument, and believe that the restrictive covenants, financial ratios and other terms of any of our full-recourse bank credit agreements will not materially impact our business plan or operations.
Future minimum payments
Future minimum payments under long-term obligations, excluding revolving credit lines with commercial banks, as of December 31, 2020, are detailed under the caption Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments, below.
Third-Party Debt
Our third-party debt consists of (i) non-recourse and limited-recourse project finance debt or acquisition financing that we or our subsidiaries have obtained for the purpose of developing and constructing, refinancing or acquiring our various projects and (ii) full-recourse debt incurred by us or our subsidiaries for general corporate purposes.
Non-Recourse and Limited-Recourse Third-Party Debt
(1) LIBOR Rate cannot be lower than 1.25%. Margin of 4.35% as long as the Company’s guaranty of the loan is outstanding (current situation) or 4.75% otherwise. Current interest is 5.6%.
(2) Secured by equity interest.
(3) Secured by the assets.
(4) Loan in Euros and issued amount is EUR 8.0 million
Full-Recourse Third-Party Debt
(1) Bonds issued in total aggregate principal amount of NIS 1.0 billion.
For additional description of our long term debt, see Note 11, Long-term Debt, Credit Agreements and Commercial Paper to our consolidated financial statements.
Liquidity Impact of Uncertain Tax Positions
As discussed in Note 17 - Income Taxes, to our consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8 of this annual report, we have a liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties in the amount of approximately $2.0 million as of December 31, 2020. This liability is included in long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet, because we generally do not anticipate that settlement of the liability will require payment of cash within the next 12 months. We are not able to reasonably estimate when we will make any cash payments required to settle this liability.
Dividends
We have adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which we currently expect to distribute at least 20% of our annual profits available for distribution by way of quarterly dividends. In determining whether there are profits available for distribution, our Board will take into account our business plan and current and expected obligations, and no distribution will be made that in the judgment of our Board would prevent us from meeting such business plan or obligations.
The following are the dividends declared by us during the past two years:
Historical Cash Flows
The following table sets forth the components of our cash flows for the relevant periods indicated:
For the Year Ended December 31, 2020
Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $265.0 million, compared to $236.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase of $28.5 million resulted primarily from (i) a decrease in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billing on uncompleted contracts, net of $22.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to an increase of $11.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, as a result of timing of billing to our customers; (ii) a decrease of $3.5 million in receivables in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to an increase of $15.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 because of timing of collections from our customers. and (iii) a withholding tax payment of approximately $8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $14 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, because of a distribution from OSL.
Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $386.0 million, compared to $254.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The principal factors that affected our net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 were: (i) capital expenditures of $320.7 million, primarily for our facilities under construction that support our growth plan; (ii) cash paid for the acquisition of the Pomona energy storage asset in California from Alta Gas for a total net consideration of $43.4 million; and (iii) an investment in an unconsolidated company of $21.0 million.
Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $503.5 million, compared to $5.8 million used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019. The principal factors that affected net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 were: (i) Proceeds from issuance of common stock, net of stock issuance costs of $339.5 million; (ii) $289.9 million of proceeds from bonds series 4; (iii) $79.4 million of proceeds from a senior unsecured bonds series 3; and (iv) $50.0 million of proceeds from a senior unsecured loan, partially offset by: (i) the repayment of commercial paper debt of $50.0 million; (ii) net payment of $40.6 million from our revolving credit lines with commercial banks which were withdrawn primarily to secure cash in hand in order to meet our capital needs in light of the uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic, (iii) the repayment of long-term debt in the amount of $135.4 million; (iv) a $22.5 million cash dividend payment and (v) $9.7 million cash paid to a noncontrolling interest.
For the Year Ended December 31, 2019
A discussion of changes in our cash flows in 2019 compared to 2018 has been omitted from this Form10-K, but may be found in “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on March 2, 2020, which is available free of charge on the SECs website at www.sec.gov and at www.Ormat.com, by clicking “Investors” located at the top of the home page.
Total EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
We calculate EBITDA as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for (i) termination fees, (ii) impairment of long-lived assets, (iii) write-off of unsuccessful exploration activities, (iv) any mark-to-market gains or losses from accounting for derivatives, (v) merger and acquisition transaction costs, (vi) stock-based compensation, (vii) gain or loss from extinguishment of liabilities, (viii) gain or loss on sale of subsidiary and property, plant and equipment and (ix) other unusual or non-recurring items. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of financial performance or liquidity under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or as a measure of liquidity or an alternative to net earnings as indicators of our operating performance or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our Board of Directors and senior management use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our financial performance. However, other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do.
This information should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP or other non-GAAP financial measures.
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $101.8 million, compared to $93.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $110.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $420.2 million, compared to $384.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $368.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
The following table reconciles net income to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:
EBITDA includes the proportionate share (12.75%) of net depreciation, interest and tax expenses from our unconsolidated investment in the Sarulla complex that is accounted for under the equity method.
On May 2014, the Sarulla consortium (“SOL”) closed $1,170 million in financing. As of December 31, 2020, the credit facility has an outstanding balance of $1,010.0 million. Our proportionate share in the SOL credit facility is $128.8 million. In October 2020, Sarulla has not met its debt service coverage ratio under the credit facility agreement and is undergoing negotiations with its lenders for a waiver covering this non-compliance as well as a remediation plan aiming to achieve compliance in the future.
Capital Expenditures
Our capital expenditures primarily relate to the enhancement of our existing power plants and the exploration, development and construction of new power plants.
We have budgeted approximately $454 million in capital expenditures for construction of new projects and enhancements to our existing power plants, of which we had invested $177 million as of December 31, 2020. We expect to invest approximately $200 million in 2021 and the remaining approximately $77 million on thereafter.
In addition, we estimate approximately $245 million in additional capital expenditures in 2021 to be allocated as follows: (i) approximately $150 million for the exploration and development of new projects and enhancements of existing power plants that are not yet released for full construction; (ii) approximately $40 million for maintenance of capital expenditures to our operating power plants including drilling in our Puna power plant; (iii) approximately $45 million for the construction and development of storage projects; and (iv) approximately $10.0 million for enhancements to our production facilities.
In the aggregate, we estimate our total capital expenditures for 2021 to be approximately $445 million.
Exposure to Market Risks
Based on current conditions, we believe that we have sufficient financial resources to fund our activities and execute our business plans. However, the cost of obtaining financing for our project needs may increase significantly or such financing may be difficult to obtain.
We, like other power plant operators, are exposed to electricity price volatility risk. Our exposure to such market risk is currently limited because many of our long-term PPAs (except for the 25 MW PPA for the Puna Complex and the between 30 MW and 40 MW PPAs in the aggregate for the Heber 2 power plant in the Heber Complex and the G2 power plant in the Mammoth Complex) have fixed or escalating rate provisions that limit our exposure to changes in electricity prices. Our energy storage projects sell on "merchant" and are exposed to changes in the electricity market prices.The energy payments under the PPAs of the Heber 2 power plant in the Heber Complex and the G2 power plant in the Mammoth Complex are determined by reference to the relevant power purchaser’s SRAC. A decline in the price of natural gas will result in a decrease in the incremental cost that the power purchaser avoids by not generating its electrical energy needs from natural gas, or by reducing the price of purchasing its electrical energy needs from natural gas power plants, which in turn will reduce the energy payments that we may charge under the relevant PPA for these power plants. The Puna Complex is currently benefiting from energy prices which are higher than the floor under the 25 MW PPA for the Puna Complex.
As of December 31, 2020, 97.2% of our consolidated long-term debt was fixed rate debt and therefore was not subject to interest rate volatility risk and 2.8% of our long-term debt was floating rate debt, exposing us to interest rate risk in connection therewith. As of December 31, 2020, $40.8 million of our long-term debt remained subject to interest rate risk.
We currently maintain our surplus cash in short-term, interest-bearing bank deposits, money market securities and commercial paper with a minimum investment grade rating of AA by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services.
Our cash equivalents are subject to interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted by a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. As a result of these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectations because of changes in interest rates, or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value because of changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2020, we do not hold such securities.
We are also exposed to foreign currency exchange risk, in particular the fluctuation of the U.S. dollar versus the NIS in Israel and Euro. Risks attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates can arise when we or any of our foreign subsidiaries borrow funds or incur operating or other expenses in one type of currency but receive revenues in another. In such cases, an adverse change in exchange rates can reduce such subsidiary’s ability to meet its debt service obligations, reduce the amount of cash and income we receive from such foreign subsidiary, or increase such subsidiary’s overall expenses. In Kenya, the tax asset is recorded in KES similar to the tax liability, however any change in the exchange rate in the KES versus the USD has an impact on our financial results. Risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can also arise when the currency denomination of a particular contract is not the U.S. dollar. Substantially all of our PPAs in the international markets are either U.S. dollar-denominated or linked to the U.S. dollar except for our operations on Guadeloupe, where we own and operate the Boulliante power plant which sells its power under a Euro-denominated PPA with Électricité de France S.A. Our construction contracts from time to time contemplate costs which are incurred in local currencies. The way we often mitigate such risk is to receive part of the proceeds from the contract in the currency in which the expenses are incurred. Currently, we have forward and cross-currency swap contracts in place to reduce our NIS/Dollar currency exposure and expect to continue to use currency exchange and other derivative instruments to the extent we deem such instruments to be the appropriate tool for managing such exposure.
On July 1, 2020, we concluded an auction tender and accepted subscriptions for senior unsecured bonds comprised of NIS 1.0 billion aggregate principal amount (the “Senior Unsecured Bonds - Series 4”). The Senior Unsecured Bonds - Series 4 were issued in New Israeli Shekels and converted to approximately $290 million using a cross-currency swap transaction shortly after the completion of such issuance.We performed a sensitivity analysis on the fair values of our long-term debt obligations, and foreign currency exchange forward contracts. The foreign currency exchange forward contracts listed below principally relate to trading activities. The sensitivity analysis involved increasing and decreasing forward rates at December 31, 2020 and 2019 by a hypothetical 10% and calculating the resulting change in the fair values.
At this time, the development of our strategic plan has not exposed us to any additional market risk. However, as the implementation of the plan progresses, we may be exposed to additional or different market risks.
The results of the sensitivity analysis calculations as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 are presented below:
In July 2019, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear whether or not LIBOR will cease to exist at that time and/or whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it will continue to exist after 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a new SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities.
We have evaluated the impact of the transition from LIBOR, and currently believe that the transition will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Effect of Inflation
We expect that inflation will not be a significant risk in the near term, given the current global economic conditions, however, that could change in the future. To address the possibility of rising inflation, some of our contracts include certain provisions that mitigate inflation risk.
In connection with the Electricity segment, none of our U.S. PPAs, including the SCPPA Portfolio PPA, are directly linked to the CPI. Inflation may directly impact an expense we incur for the operation of our projects, thereby increasing our overall operating costs and reducing our profit and gross margin. The negative impact of inflation would be partially offset by price adjustments built into some of our PPAs that could be triggered upon such occurrences. The energy payments pursuant to our PPAs for some of our power plants such as the Brady power plant, the Steamboat 2 and 3 power plants and the McGinness Complex, increase every year through the end of the relevant terms of such agreements, although such increases are not directly linked to the CPI or any other inflationary index. Lease payments are generally fixed, while royalty payments are generally calculated as a percentage of revenues and therefore are not significantly impacted by inflation. In our Product segment, inflation may directly impact fixed and variable costs incurred in the construction of our power plants, thereby increasing our operating costs in the Product segment. We are more likely to be able to offset all or part of this inflationary impact through our project pricing. With respect to power plants that we build for our own electricity production, inflationary pricing may impact our operating costs which may be partially offset in the pricing of the new long-term PPAs that we negotiate.
Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments
The following tables set forth our material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands):
(1)
See interest rates and maturity dates under Liquidity and Capital Resources section above.
(2)
The above amounts were determined based on employees’ current salary rates and the number of years’ service that will have been accumulated at their expected retirement date. These amounts do not include amounts that might be paid to employees that will cease working with us before reaching their expected retirement age.
(3)
We purchase raw materials for inventories, construction-in-process and services from a variety of vendors. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help assure adequate supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure goods and services based upon specifications defined by us, or that establish parameters defining our requirements. At December 31, 2020, total obligations related to such supplier agreements were approximately $159.9 million (approximately $77.8 million of which relate to construction-in-process). All such obligations are payable in 2021.
The table above does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $2.0 million, the timing of which is uncertain. Refer to Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8 of this annual report for additional discussion of unrecognized tax benefits. The above table also does not reflect a liability associated with the sale of tax benefits of $111.5 million, the timing of which is uncertain and other long-term liabilities of $6.2 million that are deemed immaterial. Refer to Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements as set forth in Item 8 of this annual report for additional discussion of our liability associated with the sale of tax benefits.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Our credit risk is currently concentrated with the following major customers: Sierra Pacific Power Company and Nevada Power Company (subsidiaries of NV Energy), KPLC and SCPPA. If any of these electric utilities fail to make payments under its PPAs with us, such failure would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition. Also, by implementing our multi-year strategic plan we may be exposed, by expanding our customer base, to different credit profile customers than our current customers.
The Company's revenues from its primary customers as a percentage of total revenues are as follows:
We have historically been able to collect on substantially all of our receivable balances. As of December 31, 2020, the amount overdue from KPLC in Kenya was $48.9 million of which $16.2 million was paid in January and February of 2021. These amounts are an average of 78 days overdue. In Honduras, the Company successfully collected during the year an overdue debt from Empresa Nacional de Energía Eléctrica ("ENEE") of $20.1 million that was related to the period from October 2018 to April 2019. However, due to continuing restrictive measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic in Honduras, the Company may experience delays in collection. As of December 31, 2020, the total amount overdue from ENEE of $2.9 million was collected in January 2021. In addition, on April 30, 2020, the Company also received from ENEE a notice declaring a force majeure event in Honduras due to the impact of COVID-19 that was ultimately withdrawn.
Government Grants and Tax Benefits
The U.S. federal government encourages production of electricity from geothermal resources or solar energy through certain tax subsidies:
•
PTC - the PTC rules provide an income tax credit for each kWh of electricity produced from certain renewable energy sources, including geothermal, and sold to an unrelated person during a taxable year. The PTC was first introduced in 1992 and has since been revised a number of times. The PTC, which in 2020 was 2.5 cents per kWh, is adjusted annually for inflation and may be claimed for 10 years on the net electricity output sold to third parties after the project is first placed in service. The tax extender package signed into law in December 2020 provides that any qualifying project that starts construction by December 31, 2021 would be eligible for PTC. The qualifying project must ordinarily be placed in service within four years after the end of the year in which construction started or show continued construction to qualify for PTC. The PTC is not available for power produced from geothermal resources for projects that started construction on or after January 1, 2022.
•
The ITC rules have been amended a number of times. A qualified new geothermal power plant in the United States that starts construction by the end of 2021 would be eligible to claim an ITC of 30% of the project eligible cost. New solar projects that were under construction by December 31, 2019 will qualify for a 30% ITC. The credit will phase down to 26% for solar PV projects starting construction by the end of 2022 and to 22% for solar PV projects starting construction in 2023. Projects that were under construction before these deadlines must be placed in service by December 31, 2025 to qualify for the ITC at these rates. Solar projects placed in service after December 31, 2025 will only qualify for a 10% ITC. Under current tax rules, any unused tax credit has a one-year carry back and a twenty-year carry forward.
We are also permitted to depreciate most of the cost of a new geothermal power plant. In cases where we claim the one-time 30% (or 10%) ITC, our tax basis in the plant that is eligible for depreciation is reduced by one-half of the ITC amount. In cases where we claim the PTC, there is no reduction in the tax basis for depreciation. Projects that were placed in service in 2016 and 2017 were eligible for “bonus” depreciation of 50% of the cost of that equipment in the year the power plant was placed in service. Following the Tax Act, projects that were or will be placed in service after September 27, 2017, could qualify for a 100% bonus depreciation with respect to its qualifying assets. After applying any depreciation bonus that is available, we can depreciate the remainder of our tax basis in the plant, if any, mostly over five years on an accelerated basis, meaning that more of the cost may be deducted in the first few years than during the remainder of the depreciation period. We will continue to analyze this new provision under the Act and determine if an election is appropriate as it relates to our business needs.
Ormat Systems received “Benefited Enterprise” status under Israel’s Law for Encouragement of Capital Investments, 1959 (the Investment Law), with respect to two of its investment programs through 2011. In January 2011, new legislation amending the Investment Law was enacted. Under the new legislation, a uniform rate of corporate tax will apply to all qualified income of certain industrial companies, as opposed to the previous law’s incentives that are limited to income from a “Benefited Enterprise” during their benefits period. As a result, we now pay a uniform corporate tax rate of 16% with respect to that qualified income. In January 2021, Ormat Systems received an approval from the Israeli Innovation Authority that it owns an "Innovation Promoting Enterprise" and therefore is eligible for a reduced corporate tax rate of 12% on its "Preferred Technological Income" for the tax years 2019 and 2020 (effective tax rate of approximately 13% for 2019 and 2020). This impact will be recorded in the first quarter of 2021. See Note 24 to our consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8 of this annual report for further information.
Kenya tax audit
The Company was audited by the Kenya Revenue Authority ("KRA") for income tax years 2013 to 2017 for which it had received during 2019 and 2020 three separate Notices of Assessments ("NoA") detailing different issues relating to certain findings in respect of the KRA review of such years.
On October 19, 2020, the Company entered into a settlement agreement in relation to the second NoA that was issued by the KRA on December 4, 2019 totaling approximately $190 million of proposed adjustments, including interest and penalties. The settlement agreement extended the audit period for the issues addressed within the assessment, to cover the period from 2013 through 2019 and resulted in a total settlement payment of approximately $28 million, including interest and penalties, related to late payment in respect of 2019 taxable income. Additionally, the settlement included a deferral of tax benefits to be utilized in years subsequent to 2019 in an amount of approximately $28 million. The assessment was paid on October 27, 2020.
On December 21, 2020, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the KRA in relation to the first and third NoA's that were issued by the KRA on June 28, 2019 and May 12, 2020, respectively, totaling approximately $9 million, including interest and penalties. The total settlement amount reflected in the agreement was $1.5 million, which was paid on December 28, 2020. This concluded all open audits and NoAs with the KRA.
