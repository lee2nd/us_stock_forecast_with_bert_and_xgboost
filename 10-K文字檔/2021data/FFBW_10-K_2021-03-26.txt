ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
This discussion and analysis reflects our financial statements and other relevant statistical data, and is intended to enhance your understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. The information in this section has been derived from the audited and unaudited financial statements, which appear beginning on page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Business Strategy
Our goal is to provide long-term value to our stockholders, customers and employees and the communities we serve by executing a safe and sound business strategy that produces increasing earnings. We believe there is a significant opportunity for a community-focused bank to provide a full range of financial services to commercial and retail customers in our market area.
Our current business strategy consists of the following:
● Grow organically while managing operating expense and risk. As a result of our executive management team and infrastructure, increased loan personnel and enhanced loan policies and procedures and credit administration processes, and given our attractive market area, we believe we are well-positioned to increase the size of our balance sheet without a proportional increase in overhead expense or operating risk.
● Grow through opportunistic bank or branch acquisitions or de novo branching. In addition to our expected organic growth, we intend to pursue a business strategy to grow through whole bank and/or branch acquisitions, in each case where we believe the acquisition would enhance over a relatively short period of time the value of our franchise and yield potential financial benefits for our stockholders. Although we believe opportunities exist to increase our market share in our historical markets, we expect to continue to expand into nearby markets in southeastern Wisconsin. We will consider expanding our branch network by establishing new (“de novo”) branches and/or adding loan production offices. We believe that the capital raised in the 2020 offering provides us the opportunity to make additional acquisitions of other financial institutions or branches thereof, and will help fund improvements in our operating facilities, credit reporting and customer delivery services in order to enhance our competitiveness. Our board of directors has a Mergers & Acquisitions Committee in order to enhance our ability to review and assess future merger and acquisition opportunities. Additionally, we believe that our experienced management team, led by our president and chief executive officer Edward H. Schaefer, will enable us to seek and review these opportunities in an efficient and prudent manner.
● Grow our loan portfolio prudently with a focus on diversifying the portfolio, particularly in commercial real estate and commercial and industrial lending. Our principal business activity historically has been the origination of residential mortgage loans for retention in our loan portfolio, and we intend to retain our presence as a mortgage lender in our market area. In recent years, we believe that we have implemented a stronger sales culture in our institution and we intend to continue to increase our emphasis on the origination of commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans. Since 2016 we have added four new loan officers, including two commercial loan officers, and a senior vice president of lending and we intend to add additional lenders as we grow the Company. Additionally, in recent years we have conducted an extensive review of, and have enhanced, our credit, underwriting, information technology and compliance operations. We believe all of these actions have properly positioned our institution to achieve prudent, organic and consistent growth in the future. The capital we raised in our stock offering which closed in January 2020 will continue to support an increase in our lending limits, which will enable us to originate larger loans to new and existing customers.
● Continue to increase core deposits, with an emphasis on low cost commercial demand deposits. We seek core deposits to provide a stable source of funds to support loan growth at costs consistent with improving our net interest rate spread and margin. Core deposits also help us maintain loan-to-deposit
ratios at levels consistent with regulatory expectations. We consider our core deposits to include checking accounts, money market accounts, statement savings and health savings accounts. As part of our focus on commercial loan growth, our lenders are expected to source business checking accounts from our borrowers. In addition to these core relationships, we expect to continue to utilize non-core funding sources, such as brokered deposits and borrowings, as needed, to fund future loan growth and our operations.
● Manage credit risk to maintain a low level of non-performing assets. We believe strong asset quality is a key to our long-term financial success. Our strategy for credit risk management focuses on having an experienced team of credit professionals, well-defined policies and procedures, appropriate loan underwriting criteria and active credit monitoring. In recent years we have conducted an extensive review of, and have enhanced, our credit, underwriting and loan processing policies and procedures. Our nonperforming assets to total assets ratio was 0.35% at December 31, 2020, compared to 0.39% at December 31, 2019. We will continue to increase our investment in our credit review function, both in personnel as well as ancillary systems, as necessary, in order to be able to evaluate more complex loans and better manage credit risk, which will also support our intended loan growth.
Critical Accounting Policies
The discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income and expenses. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions that we use are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations.
The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. As an “emerging growth company” we may delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.
The following represent our critical accounting policies:
Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is the estimated amount considered necessary to cover inherent, but unconfirmed, credit losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses which is charged against income. In determining the allowance for loan losses, management makes significant estimates and has identified this policy as one of our most critical accounting policies.
Management performs a quarterly evaluation of the allowance for loan losses. Consideration is given to a variety of factors in establishing this estimate including, but not limited to, current economic conditions, delinquency statistics, geographic and industry concentrations, the adequacy of the underlying collateral, the financial strength of the borrower, results of internal loan reviews and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change.
The analysis has two components, specific and general allowances. The specific allowance is for unconfirmed losses related to loans that are determined to be impaired. Impairment is measured by determining the present value of expected future cash flows or, for collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral, adjusted for market conditions and selling expenses. If the fair value of the loan is less than the loan’s carrying value, a charge is recorded for the difference. The general allowance, which is for loans reviewed collectively, is determined by segregating the remaining loans by type of loan, risk weighting (if applicable) and payment history. We also analyze historical loss experience, delinquency trends, general economic conditions and geographic and industry concentrations. This analysis
establishes historical loss percentages and qualitative factors that are applied to the loan groups to determine the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessary for loans that are reviewed collectively. The qualitative component is critical in determining the allowance for loan losses as certain trends may indicate the need for changes to the allowance for loan losses based on factors beyond the historical loss history. Not incorporating a qualitative component could misstate the allowance for loan losses. Actual loan losses may be significantly more than the allowances we have established which could result in a material negative effect on our financial results.
Deferred Tax Assets. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets. These judgments require us to make projections of future taxable income. The judgments and estimates we make in determining our deferred tax assets, which are inherently subjective, are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets.
Fair Value Measurements. The fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. First Federal Bank of Wisconsin estimates the fair value of a financial instrument and any related asset impairment using a variety of valuation methods. Where financial instruments are actively traded and have quoted market prices, quoted market prices are used for fair value. When the financial instruments are not actively traded, other observable market inputs, such as quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, may be used, if available, to determine fair value. When observable market prices do not exist, we estimate fair value. These estimates are subjective in nature and any imprecision in estimating these factors can impact the amount of gain or loss recorded. A more detailed description of the fair values measured at each level of the fair value hierarchy and the methodology utilized by the Bank can be found in Note 15 of the Financial Statements “ - Fair Value.”
Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019
Total Assets. Total assets increased $46.8 million, or 16.0%, to $339.0 million at December 31, 2020 from $292.2 million at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily a result of increases in net loans of $25.4 million, an increase in available for sale securities of $16.1 million, and an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $2.1 million.
Cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents increased $2.1 million, or 5.3%, to $41.5 million at December 31, 2020 from $39.4 million at December 31, 2019. The increase was a result of the acquisition in December 2020 offset by deployment of cash received as a result of the stock offering which closed in January 2020.
Net Loans. Net loans increased $25.4 million, or 13.4%, to $214.7 million at December 31, 2020 from $189.3 million at December 31, 2019. The increase resulted from net of increases in commercial and industrial loans of $7.1 million, or 51.7%, commercial real estate loans of $19.0 million, or 27.7%, one-to-four family owner-occupied loans of $1.2 million , or 4.0%, and one-to-four family investor-owned loans of $4.6 million, or 16.2% offset by decreases of $4.1 million, or 22.7%, in commercial development loans, $228,000, or 0.8%, in multifamily loans and $1.2 million, or 13.7%, in consumer loans.
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we sold $22.3 million and $19.1 million, respectively, of one-to-four family owner-occupied residential real estate loans, on a servicing-released basis. Subject to market and economic conditions, management intends to continue this sales activity in future periods to generate gain on sale of loans income.
Available for sale securities. Available for sale securities increased $16.0 million, or 33.3%, to $64.2 million at December 31, 2020 from $48.2 million at December 31, 2019. The increase resulted primarily from deploying funds received from the stock offering which closed in January 2020.
Premises and equipment. Premises and equipment increased $787,000, or 16.4%, to $5.6 million at December 31, 2020 from $4.8 million at December 31, 2019. The purchased assets of Mitchell Bank resulted in an increase of $1.0 million, primarily in land and buildings.
Other equity investments. Other equity investments increased $449,000, or 64.0%, to $1.3 million at December 31, 2020 from $780,000 at December 31, 2019. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in Bankers’ Bank stock of $248,000 and an increase in FHLB stock outstanding of $251,000.
Deposits. Deposits increased $9.2 million, or 4.26%, to $226.5 million at December 31, 2020 from $217.3 million at December 31, 2019. Non-interest-bearing checking accounts increased $31.1 million, or 149.9%, to $51.8 million from $20.7 million at December 31, 2019, interest-bearing checking accounts increased $4.0 million, or 57.0%, to $10.9 million at December 31, 2020 from $6.9 million at December 31, 2019, money market accounts increased $23.8 million, or 51.0%, to $70.5 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $46.7 million at December 31, 2019, statement savings accounts increased $19.6 million, or 158.7% to $32.0 million from $12.4 million at December 31, 2019 and health savings accounts increased $184,000, or 1.7%, to $10.9 million from $10.7 million at December 31, 2019. Partially offsetting these increases, certificates of deposit decreased $16.7 million, or 24.9%, to $50.2 million as of December 31, 2020 from $67.2 million as of December 31, 2019 and there was a decrease of 100% in stock offering subscription deposits of $52.6 million. Included in the certificates of deposit were brokered deposits of $1 million as of December 31, 2020 and $8 million as of December 31, 2019.
Borrowings. Borrowings, consisting entirely of FHLB advances, totaled $7.5 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $11.5 million at December 31, 2019. The aggregate cost of outstanding advances from the FHLB was 0.9% at December 31, 2020, compared to the Bank’s cost of deposits of 0.8% at that date.
Other liabilities. Other liabilities increased $66,000, or 4.4%, to $1.6 million at December 31, 2020 from $1.5 million at December 31, 2019.
Total Equity. Total equity increased $41.4 million, or 66.9%, to $103.3 million at December 31, 2020 from $61.9 million at December 31, 2019. The increase resulted primarily from $40.1 million of net proceeds from the stock offering which closed in January 2020 and net income of $1.8 million for 2020.
Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019
General. We had net income of $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net income of $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $278,000, or 17.7%. The increase in net income was the net effect of an increase in net interest income after provision for loan losses of $745,000, or 9.0%, and an increase in noninterest income of $94,000, or 9.0%, offset in part by an increase in noninterest expense of $500,000, or 6.9%.
Interest and dividend income. Interest and dividend income decreased $106,000, or 0.9%, to $11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $11.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $187,000 decrease in interest on loans, partially offset by an increase in interest on available for sale securities of $36,000.
Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased $1.2 million, or 42.0%, to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits decreased $1.0 million, or 41.3%, year to year. The average cost of our interest-bearing deposits decreased 52 basis points to 1.01% from 1.5%, while the average balance of interest-bearing deposits decreased by $17.6 million, or 11.0%, during the same period. Interest expense on borrowings, consisting entirely of FHLB advances, decreased $160,000, or 46.6%, to $183,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020 from $343,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019, as the average balance of borrowings decreased $2.2 million to $13.2 million for the 2020 period from $15.6 million for 2019, and the cost of borrowings decreased 81 basis points to 1.3% for 2020 from 2.1% for 2019.
Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased $1.1 million, or 12.6%, to $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Average net interest-earning assets increased $46.0 million to $116.6 million for 2020 from $70.6 million for 2019. Our net interest rate spread increased to
3.04% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 2.97% for the year ended December 31, 2019, and our net interest margin increased to 3.48% for 2020 from 3.42% for 2019.
Provision for Loan Losses. We recorded a provision for loan losses of $520,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a $201,000 provision for the year ended December 31, 2019. The allowance for loan losses was $2.8 million, or 1.29% of total loans at December 31, 2020, compared to $2.3 million, or 1.18% of total loans, at December 31, 2019. Classified (substandard, doubtful and loss) loans increased to $992,000 at December 31, 2020 from $638,000 at December 31, 2019. Total nonperforming loans were $1.0 million at December 31, 2020 and $1.1 million at December 31, 2019. There were ($27,000) of net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $55,000 for the prior year period. At December 31, 2020, $341,000, or 32.6%, of the nonperforming loans were contractually current.
Noninterest Income. Noninterest income increased $94,000, or 9.0% in 2020 versus 2019. The increase was primarily due to the gain on sale of loans increasing $106,000 in 2020 compared to 2019.
Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense increased $500,000, or 6.9%, to $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was due primarily to an increase of $393,000, or 65.7%, in data processing expense to $991,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $598,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 and an increase of $141,000, or 36.6%, in professional fees to $526,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $385,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increases resulted primarily from expenses paid for the acquisition and conversion of Mitchell Bank.
Income Tax Expense. We recorded an income tax expense of $566,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $502,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $64,000, or 12.7%, due to an increase in income before income taxes of $339,000.
Average balances and yields. The following tables sets forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs, and certain other information at and for the periods indicated. No tax-equivalent yield adjustments were made, as the effect thereof was not material. All average balances are daily average balances. Non-accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances, but have been reflected in the table as loans carrying a zero yield. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or interest expense.
(1)
Interest rate spread represents the difference between the yield on average interest-earning assets and the cost of average interest-bearing liabilities.
(2)
Net interest-earning assets represents total interest-earning assets less total interest-bearing liabilities.
(3)
Net interest margin represents net interest income divided by total interest-earning assets.
Rate/Volume Analysis
The following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the periods indicated. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in average rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior period average rate). The total column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately, based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.
Management of Market Risk
General. Our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk because, as a financial institution, the majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Therefore, a principal part of our operations is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of our financial condition and results of operations to changes in market interest rates. Our Asset/Liability Committee is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate, given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the policy and guidelines approved by our board of directors.
Our asset/liability management strategy attempts to manage the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income, our primary source of earnings. Among the techniques we use to manage interest rate risk are:
● originating commercial real estate, multifamily and commercial and industrial loans, all of which tend to have shorter terms and higher interest rates than one-to-four family owner-occupied residential real estate loans, and which generate customer relationships that can result in larger noninterest-bearing checking accounts;
● selling substantially all of our conforming and eligible jumbo, longer-term, fixed-rate one-to-four owner-occupied residential real estate loans and retaining the non-conforming and shorter-term, fixed-rate and adjustable-rate one-to-four family residential real estate loans that we originate, subject to market conditions and periodic review of our asset/liability management needs; and
● reducing our dependence on certificates of deposit to support lending and investment activities and increasing our reliance on core deposits, including checking accounts and savings accounts, which are less interest rate sensitive than certificates of deposit.
Our board of directors is responsible for the review and oversight of our executive management team and other essential operational staff which are responsible for our asset/liability analysis. These officers act as an asset/liability committee and are charged with developing and implementing an asset/liability management plan, and they meet at least quarterly to review pricing and liquidity needs and assess our interest rate risk. We currently utilize a third-party modeling program, prepared on a quarterly basis, to evaluate our sensitivity to changing interest rates, given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the board of directors.
We do not engage in hedging activities, such as engaging in futures, options or swap transactions, or investing in high-risk mortgage derivatives, such as collateralized mortgage obligation residual interests, real estate mortgage investment conduit residual interests or stripped mortgage-backed securities.
Net Portfolio Value. The Office of the Comptroller of Currency requires the computation of amounts by which the net present value of an institution’s cash flow from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items (the institution’s net portfolio value or “NPV”) would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates.
The tables below set forth, as of December 31, 2020, the estimated changes in our NPV that would result from the designated instantaneous changes in market interest rates. Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions including relative levels of market interest rates, loan prepayments and deposit decay, and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results.
(1)
Assumes an immediate uniform change in interest rates at all maturities.
(2)
NPV is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts.
(3)
Present value of assets represents the discounted present value of incoming cash flows on interest-earning assets.
(4)
NPV Ratio represents NPV divided by the present value of assets.
The tables above indicate that at December 31, 2020, in the event of a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates, we would have experienced a .06% increase in NPV. In the event of a 200 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2020, we would have experienced a 3.48% increase in NPV.
Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurement. Modeling changes in NPV requires making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the NPV table presented assumes that the composition of our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the NPV table provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on NPV and will differ from actual results.
NPV calculations also may not reflect the fair values of financial instruments. For example, decreases in market interest rates can increase the fair values of our loans, deposits and borrowings.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, proceeds from the sale of loans, and proceeds from maturities of securities. We also have the ability to borrow from the FHLB-Chicago. At December 31, 2020, we had $7.5 million outstanding in advances from the FHLB-Chicago. At December 31, 2020 we had $13.9 million available additional FHLB-Chicago advances based on the FHLB stock owned.
Additionally, at December 31, 2020 we had a $7 million federal funds rate line of credit with the Bankers’ Bank of Wisconsin, of which $0 was drawn at December 31, 2020.
While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale investment securities. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period.
Our cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.8 million and $2.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Net cash provided by investing activities, which consists primarily of disbursements for loan originations and the purchase of investment securities, offset by principal collections on loans, the sale of securities and proceeds from maturing securities, pay downs on securities and cash received from acquisitions, was $13.9 million and $5.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities, consisting of activity in deposit accounts and FHLB advances, was ($13.6 million) and $26.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
We are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position. We monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. Based on our current strategy to change our mix of deposits to become less reliant on certificates of deposit, we anticipate that we will continue to allow a significant portion of higher-costing certificates of deposit to run off at maturity. We also anticipate continued use of FHLB-Chicago advances as well as continuing to utilize brokered certificates of deposit and online sources, as needed, to fund future loan growth and our operations.
At December 31, 2020, we exceeded all of our regulatory capital requirements with a Tier 1 leverage capital level of $73.7 million, or 25.2% of adjusted total assets, which is above the well-capitalized required level of $14.6 million, or 5.0%; and total risk-based capital of $76.4 million, or 34.3% of risk-weighted assets, which is above the well-capitalized required level of $22.3 million, or 10.0%. Management is not aware of any conditions or events since December 31, 2020, that would change our category.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations
Commitments. As a financial services provider, we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risks, such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit. While these contractual obligations represent our potential future cash requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans we make. For additional information, see Note 11 - "Commitments and Contingencies" of the Notes to the Financial Statements beginning on page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Contractual Obligations. In the ordinary course of our operations, we enter into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include operating leases for premises and equipment, agreements with respect to borrowings and deposits, and agreements with respect to securities.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
For a discussion of the impact of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 1- "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of the notes to our financial statements beginning on page of this this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices
The financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates, generally, have a more significant impact on a financial institution’s performance than does inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.
