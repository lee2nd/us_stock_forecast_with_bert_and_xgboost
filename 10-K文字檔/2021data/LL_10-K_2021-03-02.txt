Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Overview
Lumber Liquidators (“LL Flooring” or “Company”) is one of North America’s leading specialty retailers of hard-surface flooring, with 410 stores as of December 31, 2020. We seek to offer the best customer experience online and in stores, with more than 400 varieties of hard-surface floors featuring a range of quality styles and on-trend designs. Our online tools also help empower customers to find the right solution for the space they’ve envisioned. Our extensive selection includes water-resistant vinyl plank, solid and engineered hardwood, laminate, bamboo, porcelain tile, and cork, with a wide range of flooring enhancements and accessories to complement. Our stores are staffed with flooring experts who provide advice, pro partnership services and installation options for all of LL Flooring’s products, the majority of which is in stock and ready for delivery. We offer delivery and in-home installation services through third-party independent contractors for customers who purchase our floors.
Our vision is to be the customer’s first choice in hard-surface flooring by providing the best experience, from start to finish. We offer a wide selection of high-quality, stocked products and the accessible flooring expertise and service of a local store, with the scale, omni-channel convenience and value of a national chain. We plan to leverage this advantage to differentiate ourselves in the highly fragmented flooring market. We launched our new digital platform, LLFlooring.com, in December 2020. This mobile-friendly site features inspirational content, highlights our digital tools like Picture It! and Floor Finder and promotes our services such as installation, free flooring samples and delivery.
To supplement the financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: (i) Adjusted Gross Profit; (ii) Adjusted Gross Margin; (iii) Adjusted SG&A; (iv) Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales; (v) Adjusted Operating Income; (vi) Adjusted Operating Margin; (vii) Adjusted Earnings and (viii) Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share. The non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. These supplemental measures may vary from, and may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures by other companies.
The non-GAAP financial measures are presented because management and analysts use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our operating performance and management, in certain cases, uses them to determine incentive compensation and/or to address questions it receives. Therefore, we believe that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information to, and facilitates additional analysis by, investors. The presented non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that management does not believe reflect our core operating performance, which include regulatory and legal settlements and associated legal and operating costs, and changes in antidumping and countervailing duties from prior periods, as such items are outside of our control or due to their inherent unusual, non-operating, unpredictable, non-recurring, or non-cash nature.
Executive Summary
Fiscal 2020 was a dynamic and challenging year due to the uncertainties around the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite COVID-19, we were able to progress on our transformation plan to elevate the experience for all of our customers which positioned us to take advantage of a robust home improvement spending environment in the second half of the year. Our transformation plan includes the four strategic pillars of people and culture, improving the customer experience, driving traffic and transactions in our stores and online, and improving profitability.
Highlights for the year ended December 31, 2020 were as follows:
● Net sales increased $5.1 million, or 0.5%, to $1,098 million in 2020 from $1,093 million in 2019, which includes a $10 million increase in non-comparable store net sales partially offset by a decrease of $5.3 million, or 0.5%, in comparable store net sales. Following a 20% decrease in net sales in the second quarter due to the impact of COVID-19, the Company recovered to deliver a strong second-half performance. For the full year, net merchandise sales increased 2% while net services sales (install and freight) decreased 10% over the prior year. The Company closed nine net stores in 2020, and as of December 31, 2020, operated 410 stores.
● Gross profit of $428 million in 2020 increased $24 million from 2019 and, as a percent of sales, gross margin in 2020 increased to 39.0% from 36.9% in 2019. Both 2020 and 2019 were impacted by the net of anti-dumping and countervailing duty rate changes. Additionally, 2020 included costs related to Canadian and US store closures. When excluding items in the table that follows in Results of Operations, Adjusted Gross Profit (a non-GAAP measure) of $426 million in 2020 increased $22 million versus 2019 and Adjusted Gross Margin (a non-GAAP measure) in 2020 increased to 38.8% from 37.0% in 2019. This 180-basis point improvement in adjusted gross margin was due primarily to merchandising sourcing and cost-out efforts, and selective retail price increases.
● Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses of $371 million in 2020 decreased $16 million from 2019, and as a percentage of net sales, SG&A decreased to 33.8% in 2020, compared to 35.4% in 2019. When excluding items in the table that follows in Results of Operations, Adjusted SG&A (a non-GAAP measure) of $363 million in 2020 decreased $17 million from 2019 and, as a percentage of net sales (a non-GAAP measure), was 33.0% in 2020, a decrease of 170 basis points from 34.7% in 2019. The decrease in adjusted SG&A was primarily due to lower advertising expense as the Company reduced its promotional cadence in response to COVID-19 and then optimized its marketing efforts, pivoting towards more efficient digital channels, as well as $2.5 million from the final settlement in 2020 of the business interruption insurance claim related to the August 2019 network security incident and lower travel and entertainment expense. These savings were partially offset by higher bonus and commission reflecting the Company’s strong financial performance, and higher benefits expense.
● Operating income was $56 million in 2020, compared to operating income of $17 million in 2019. When excluding items in the table that follows in Results of Operations, Adjusted Operating Income (a non-GAAP measure) was $64 million and Adjusted Operating Margin (a non-GAAP measure) was 5.8% in 2020, compared to $25 million, or 2.3%, in 2019. The primary driver of the increase was the Company’s execution on its profitability initiatives, which increased adjusted gross margin and reduced advertising expense.
● The Company had other expense of $2.6 million and $3.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The expense in both years primarily reflected interest on borrowings on our Credit Agreement. The expense in 2020 was partially offset by a favorable adjustment of $1.1 million for the reversal of interest expense associated with anti-dumping and countervailing duty rate changes.
● Income tax benefit was $7.8 million in 2020 compared to income tax expense of $3.3 million in 2019. 2020 included the partial release of $20 million of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets.
● Net income was $61 million, or $2.10 per diluted share, in 2020 compared to net income of $9.7 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, in 2019.
● Earnings per diluted share was $2.10 for 2020 versus $0.34 in 2019. 2020 Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share (a non-GAAP measure) increased $1.74 to $2.28 compared to $0.54 for 2019.
Other Items
Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic
In March 2020, the World Health Organization announced that infections of COVID-19 had become a pandemic and the U.S. President announced a National Emergency relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. Starting as of the week of March 22, 2020 the Company closed as many as 56 stores for a period of time while all other stores operated under reduced hours and/or warehouse only conditions, offering curbside pickup and job site delivery for our Pro and DIY customers. During the third and fourth quarters of 2020 the Company’s stores remained open except for temporary closures necessitated by local market conditions. Net sales for the first half of 2020 were substantially impacted in a negative way by COVID-19 due to the store closures and general uncertainty. The progress on the Company’s
transformation plan and a healthy consumer demand for home improvement projects during the second half of 2020 mostly offset the impact of COVID-19 on the first half of 2020.
Section 301 Tariffs
The Company’s financial statements have been impacted by Section 301 tariffs on certain products imported from China in recent years. A subset of these imports for certain click vinyl and other engineered products (the “Subset Products”) received an exemption that was made retroactive to the beginning of the Section 301 Tariffs for a period of time. The Company has deployed strategies to mitigate tariffs and improve gross margin, including alternative country sourcing, partnering with current vendors to lower costs and introduce new products, and adjusting its pricing. The following chart provides a timeline and tariff levels for the key events related to Section 301 Tariffs.
1 On November 7, 2019, the U.S. Trade Representative granted a retroactive exclusion to September 2018 on Subset Products as defined in the Section 301 Tariffs section above bringing the rate to 0%.
The Company recorded a benefit of approximately $13 million of gross profit and $11 million of operating income in the fourth quarter of 2019 as a result of the retroactive exclusion of these tariffs, which did not repeat in the fourth quarter of 2020.
During the fourth quarter of 2020, the August reinstatement of tariffs began to flow through the income statement as these products were sold. This impact was partially offset by the Company’s mitigation strategies.
The future impact of the reinstatement of tariffs is dependent on several factors including: 1) ongoing Company mitigation efforts for which the outcome is uncertain, 2) inventory turnover rates which were affected by COVID-19 in 2020, and 3) behavior of consumers and competitors as prices for products adjust based on supply/demand and as consumer preferences shift among product categories impacting both product sourcing and inventory turnover. It is still too early to predict the outcome of such measures adopted by the Company.
Canadian and US Store Closure Costs
During the third quarter of 2020, the Company conducted a comprehensive review of its real estate portfolio. Following the conclusion of this review, the Company made the decision to close its Canadian operations, including all eight stores in Canada, and six underperforming US locations by the end of 2020. The Company will continue to monitor store performance on an ongoing basis. The Company incurred expense of $3.8 million to close these stores in the second half of 2020. All 14 stores were closed by year end although certain clean-up activities will not be fully completed until early in 2021.
Network Security Incident
In August 2019, the Company experienced a network security incident caused by malware that prevented access to several of the Company’s information technology systems and data. Stores remained open and operating throughout
the incident, but the Company utilized manual back-up processes for approximately six days. The Company estimated the disruption caused by the event negatively impacted total revenue for the third quarter of 2019 in the range of approximately $6 million to $8 million with an attendant reduction in gross margin. The Company maintains cybersecurity and other insurance coverage and received an initial recovery from insurance in excess of $2 million in 2019. As of December 31, 2019, the Company recorded approximately $0.8 million as a receivable related to further anticipated insurance recovery. The receivable did not include any potential business interruption recovery or voluntary gains. It was recorded in “Other Current Assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2019 and was collected during 2020. In 2020 the Company recorded $2.5 million from the final settlement of the business interruption insurance claim in SG&A during the third quarter of 2020.
Working Capital and Liquidity
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had liquidity of $214 million, consisting of excess availability under its Credit Agreement of $44 million, and cash and cash equivalents of $170 million. This represents an increase in liquidity of $103 million from December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had $111 million in liquidity, comprised of $9 million of cash and $102 million in availability under the Credit Agreement. In addition, the Company’s debt balance as of December 31, 2020 was $101 million, unchanged since amending the Credit Agreement on April 17, 2020, and up $19 million from December 31, 2019. The increase in liquidity at December 31, 2020 from the year earlier was driven by improved operating performance along with disciplined working capital management. The working capital benefit included a 15% reduction in inventory due to strong sales and supply chain disruptions, collection of tariff receivables, growth in customer deposits, and higher accounts payable. The accounts payable balance was higher at the end of 2020 due to the increased in-transit inventory and extended payment terms with vendors and other service providers. In 2021, we expect inventory to return to the $270-$290 million range and other working capital accounts like customer deposits to return to more traditional levels. We also expect to maintain cash balances higher than we have historically carried until the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 eases.
Results of Operations
We believe the selected sales data, the percentage relationship between Net Sales and major categories in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of each of the items presented below are important in evaluating the performance of our business operations.
1 Average sale is defined as the average invoiced sales order, measured quarterly, excluding returns as well as transactions under $100 (which are generally sample orders or add-on/accessories to existing orders).
2 Average retail price per unit (square feet for flooring and other units of measures for moldings and accessories) sold is calculated on a total company basis and excludes non-merchandise revenue.
3 A store is generally considered comparable on the first day of the thirteenth full calendar month after opening.
4 Change in number of customers invoiced is calculated by applying the average sale to total net sales at comparable stores.
5 A relocated store remains a comparable store as long as it is relocated within the primary trade area.
A detailed discussion of the 2020 year-over-year changes can be found below and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements presented in this report. A detailed discussion of the 2019 year-over-year changes can be found in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the Form 10-K filed on February 25, 2020.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $5.1 million, or 0.5%, to $1,098 million in 2020 from $1,093 million in 2019, which includes a $10.4 million increase in non-comparable store net sales partially offset by a decrease of $5.3 million, or 0.5%, in comparable store net sales. Following a 20% decrease in net sales in the second quarter due to the impact of COVID-19, the Company recovered to deliver a strong second-half performance. For the full year, comparable store
sales slightly declined due to a decrease in average ticket of 2.6% driven by the lower attachment of installation mostly offset by a 2.1% increase in customers invoiced. Net merchandise sales increased 2%. By major category, manufactured products grew from 41% of sales in 2019 to 46% of sales in 2020, partially offset by a decline in solid and engineered hardwood products. The vinyl sub-category within manufactured products continues to drive growth due to its outstanding aesthetics, high resilience, and water-resistant characteristics. Net services sales (install and freight) decreased 10% over the prior year as the second quarter was impacted by customers’ willingness to have contractors enter their home. The Company closed nine net stores in 2020, and as of December 31, 2020, operated 410 stores.
Gross Profit
Gross profit of $428 million in 2020 increased $24 million from 2019 and, as a percent of sales, gross margin in 2020 increased to 39.0% from 36.9% in 2019. Both years were impacted by the net of anti-dumping and countervailing duty rate changes, with a favorable adjustment of $2.2 million in 2020 and an unfavorable adjustment of $1.1 million in 2019. Additionally, 2020 included costs related to Canadian and US store closures and 2019 included favorable classification adjustments related to Harmonized Tariff Schedule (“HTS”) duty categorization. When excluding those items in the table that follows, Adjusted Gross Profit (a non-GAAP measure) of $426 million in 2020 increased $22 million versus 2019 and Adjusted Gross Margin (a non-GAAP measure) in 2020 increased to 38.8% from 37.0% in 2019. This 180-basis point improvement in adjusted gross margin was due primarily to merchandising sourcing and cost-out efforts and, to a lesser extent, selective retail price increases. The growth of higher-margin manufactured products as a percent of sales from 2019 to 2020 also favorably impacted adjusted gross margin.
We believe that the following items set forth in the table below can distort the visibility of our ongoing
performance and that the evaluation of our financial performance can be enhanced by use of supplemental presentation of our results that exclude the impact of these items.
1 Amounts may not sum due to rounding.
2 Represents countervailing and antidumping expense associated with applicable prior-year shipments of engineered hardwood from China.
3 Represents classification adjustments related to the HTS duty categorization in prior periods during the full year ended December 31, 2019.
4 Represents the inventory write-offs related to the Canadian and U.S. store closures described more fully in Item 8. Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
SG&A expenses of $371 million in 2020 decreased $16 million from 2019, and as a percentage of net sales, SG&A decreased to 33.8% in 2020, compared to 35.4% in 2019. When excluding items in the table that follows, Adjusted SG&A (a non-GAAP measure) of $363 million in 2020 decreased $17 million from 2019 and, as a percentage of net sales (a non-GAAP measure), was 33.0% in 2020, a decrease of 170 basis points from 34.7% in 2019. The decrease in adjusted SG&A was primarily due to lower advertising expense of $13 million as the Company reduced its promotional cadence in response to COVID-19 and then optimized its marketing efforts, pivoting toward more efficient digital channels, as well as $2.5 million from the final settlement of the business interruption insurance claim related to the August 2019 network security incident and lower travel and entertainment expense. These savings were partially offset by higher bonus and commission reflecting the Company’s strong financial performance, and higher benefits expense.
We believe that the following items set forth in the table below can distort the visibility of our ongoing
performance and that the evaluation of our financial performance can be enhanced by use of supplemental presentation of our results that exclude the impact of these items.
5 Amounts may not sum due to rounding.
6 This amount represents expense of $2 million related to the Gold matter in the third quarter of 2020 partially offset by a $0.5 million insurance recovery in the second quarter of 2020 of legal fees related to certain significant legal action. 2019 reflects a $4.75 million expense for the Kramer employment case and $0.3 million for certain Related Laminate Matters partially offset by a $1.1 million insurance recovery of legal fees related to certain significant legal action. These matters are described more fully in Item 8. Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.
7 Represents charges to earnings related to our defense of certain significant legal actions during the period. This does not include all legal costs incurred by the Company.
8 Represents the inventory write-offs related to Canadian and U.S. store closures described more fully in Item 8. Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
Operating Income and Operating Margin
Operating income was $56 million in 2020, compared to operating income of $17 million in 2019. When excluding items in the table that follows, Adjusted Operating Income (a non-GAAP measure) was $64 million and Adjusted Operating Margin (a non-GAAP measure) was 5.8% in 2020, compared to $25 million, or 2.3%, in 2019. The primary driver of the increase was the Company’s execution on its transformation plan, which increased adjusted gross margin and reduced advertising expense.
We believe that the following items set forth in the table below can distort the visibility of our ongoing
performance and that the evaluation of our financial performance can be enhanced by use of supplemental presentation of our results that exclude the impact of these items.
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 See the Gross Profit and SG&A sections above for more detailed explanations of these individual items.
Other Expense
The Company had other expense of $2.6 million and $3.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The expense in both years primarily reflected interest on borrowings on our Credit Agreement. The expense in 2020 was partially offset by a favorable adjustment of $1.1 million for the reversal of interest expense associated with anti-dumping and countervailing duty rate changes.
Provision for Income Taxes
We record tax expense each period for income taxes incurred for US federal tax, in certain states, and in foreign jurisdictions resulting in an effective tax rate of (14.5)% and 25.4% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as 2020 included the partial release of $20 million of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets.
As of December 31, 2019, the Company had a full valuation allowance of $27 million recorded against its net deferred assets as the Company was in a consolidated cumulative three-year loss position, and the Company was not relying upon projections of future taxable income in assessing their recoverability. The Company assesses the available evidence on a quarterly basis to determine if, based on the weight of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company was no longer in a consolidated cumulative three-year loss position at December 31, 2020. Based on the Company’s evaluation at a jurisdictional level as of December 31, 2020, the Company released valuation allowances of $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 in jurisdictions where the Company believes sufficient future taxable income, including consideration of future performance, market or economic conditions, will be generated to use existing deferred tax assets. This release of the valuation allowance resulted in noncash income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2020 of $20 million. At December 31, 2020 the Company’s remaining valuation allowance was $5.6 million including the release of the valuation allowance and a $1.7 million adjustment to valuation allowances associated with deferred taxes for foreign operations. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable could be adjusted in future periods if evidence warrants such a change.
On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act, among other things, permits NOL carryovers and carrybacks to offset 100% of taxable income for taxable years beginning before 2021. In addition, the CARES Act allows NOLs incurred in 2018, 2019, and 2020 to be carried back to each of the five preceding taxable years to generate a refund of previously paid income taxes. The Company amended its 2018 tax return with respect to CARES Act items and carried the 2018 NOL back to 2013 resulting in a cash tax refund of $5 million, received in the third quarter 2020.
We file income tax returns with the United States federal government and various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities. During 2017, the Internal Revenue Service completed audits of our income tax returns through 2016.
Diluted Earnings per Share
Net income was $61 million, or $2.10 per diluted share, in 2020 compared to net income of $9.7 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, in 2019. 2020 Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share (a non-GAAP measure) increased $1.74 to $2.28 compared to $0.54 for 2019. Net income in 2020 benefited from the noncash income tax benefit of $20 million from the partial release of the valuation allowance.
We believe that each of the items below can distort the visibility of our ongoing performance and that the evaluation of our financial performance can be enhanced by use of supplemental presentation of our results that exclude the impact of these items.
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 See the Gross Profit and SG&A sections above for more detailed explanations of these individual items.
These items have been tax affected at the Company’s federal incremental rate of 26.1%.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Throughout 2020, we have sustained focus on maximizing liquidity as a result of the impacts of COVID-19.
We took the following actions during the year to provide financial flexibility including:
- Negotiating new terms with merchandise vendors, landlords and other service providers to allow for longer
payment terms and/or reductions in fees
- Renegotiating our Credit Agreement (See Item 8. Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements)
- Replacing our largest annual sale event with alternative promotions
- Eliminating spending on certain capital and operating activities including the opening of new stores
- Taking advantage of opportunities in Federal, State, and Local regulatory changes (e.g., the CARES Act)
Our focus on liquidity remains. COVID-19 continues to create a great deal of uncertainty and there are related risks from renewed shut downs and consumer spending preferences once, and if, people become more mobile during 2021 as vaccines are distributed and administered. Throughout 2020 we continued to manage the uncertainty by retaining cash we have generated through ongoing operations. We have chosen to maintain a high cash balance, with cash and cash equivalents of $170 million as of December 31, 2020 and the same $101 million of borrowings that we had on April 17, 2020, as we entered into the temporary expansion of our Credit Agreement.
Our principal sources of liquidity at December 31, 2020 were cash from our ongoing operations, $170 million of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet and $44 million of availability under our Revolving Loan. As of December 31, 2020, the outstanding balance of the revolving loan was $76 million, and it carried an average interest rate of 3.75%. As of December 31, 2020, the outstanding balance of the first-in-last-out term loan was $25 million and it carried an interest rate of 5.125%.
During 2020, we received $23 million in cash payments from United States Customs relating to the November 2019 tariff exclusion. The remaining receivable of $4.1 million is expected to be received during 2021. Similar to 2019, 2020 was impacted by cash payments related to legal settlements. During the fourth quarter of 2020 we funded the
remaining $13 million of the cash portion of the settlement of the Gold Litigation as discussed in Item 8. Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, $4.75 million was paid in April 2020 for the Kramer settlement.
The DOJ and SEC settlements, discussed in Item 8. Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, totaled $33 million and were paid in the second quarter of 2019 along with other, smaller settlements. Additionally, we funded $1 million of the cash portion of the settlement of the Gold Litigation in the fourth quarter of 2019.
We plan to increase our inventories to between $270 and $290 million and we expect our customer deposits to return to more traditional levels. We also plan to increase our capital expenditure investments to support our growth initiatives as well as the opening of 12 to 15 new stores in 2021. We currently expect capital expenditure investments of up to $24 million to $28 million, if our business results support the broad scale rebranding of our store fleet, the opening of 12 to 15 new stores and investments in digital.
Our focus and discipline over the past year has allowed us to build a strong liquidity position to navigate the COVID-19 environment, and our business is generating solid cash flow. We believe that cash and cash equivalents balance and cash flows from operations, together with the liquidity under our Credit Agreement will be sufficient to meet our obligations, fund our settlements, operations, and anticipated capital expenditures for the next 12 months. We prepare our forecasted cash flow and liquidity estimates based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable but are also inherently uncertain. Actual future cash flows could differ from these estimates.
Merchandise Inventories
Merchandise inventory is our most significant asset and is considered either “available for sale” or “inbound in-transit,” based on whether we have physically received and inspected the products at an individual store location, in our distribution centers or in another facility where we control and monitor inspection.
Merchandise inventories and available inventory per store in operation on December 31 were as follows:
Available inventory per store at December 31, 2020 was lower than available inventory per store at December 31, 2019. The 15% reduction in total inventory from last year was primarily driven by managing our inventory purchases as a direct result of COVID-19, followed by supply chain disruptions on replenishment and strong second half sales that kept inventory below our targeted level for year end. Our teams are working diligently to receive new inventory in the face of supply chain disruption and we are working toward rebuilding inventory to a more normal range of $270 to $290 million in 2021.
Cash Flows
The following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:
Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $157 million in 2020 and was primarily due to a an increase of $52 million in net income, a $39 million decrease in inventory, cash received from United States Customs for tariff receivables of $23 million, growth in customer deposits of $20 million and an increase in accounts payable of $9.9 million. These were somewhat offset by payments for legal matters and settlements of $18 million.
In 2019 net cash provided by operating activities was $0.3 million and was primarily due to a $15 million decrease in inventory, net of payables. Net income in 2019 of $9.7 million was also a factor for the net cash provided by operating activities. These were mostly offset by payments for legal matters and settlements of $35 million.
Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $15 million in 2020 and $19 million in 2019. 2020 included investments in our new digital platform, LLFlooring.com, six new stores, and maintenance to our existing stores. Investments in 2019 included our corporate headquarters move to Richmond, Virginia, and 11 new store openings.
Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $19 million in 2020 and was primarily attributable to $19 million in net borrowings on the Credit Agreement. Net cash provided by financing activities was $16 million in 2019 and was primarily attributable to $17 million in net borrowings on the Credit Agreement.
Credit Agreement
Information with respect to this item may be found in Note 4, “Credit Agreement”, to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or other financing activities with special-purpose entities.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Critical accounting policies are those that we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and we might obtain different estimates if we used different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.
Loss Contingencies
We are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is
both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and a loss or range of the loss can be estimated, we disclose such amounts. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount of any loss or range of loss. We assess each legal matter and any related provisions at least quarterly and adjust them accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.
Until a final resolution related to loss contingencies for legal and other contingencies is reached, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount we have recorded, and such amounts could be material, either individually or in the aggregate, to our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period, could be materially adversely affected.
Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets
We account for income taxes and the related accounts in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”). Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the differences reverse. We periodically assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets and reflect any changes in estimates in the valuation allowance. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had a full valuation allowance of $27 million recorded against its net deferred assets as the Company was in a consolidated cumulative three-year loss position, and the Company was not relying upon projections of future taxable income in assessing their recoverability. The Company assesses the available evidence on a quarterly basis to determine if, based on the weight of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company was no longer in a consolidated cumulative three-year loss position at December 31, 2020. Based on the Company’s evaluation at a jurisdictional level as of December 31, 2020, the Company released valuation allowances of $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 in jurisdictions where the Company believes sufficient future taxable income, including consideration of future performance, market or economic conditions, will be generated to use existing deferred tax assets. This release of the valuation allowance resulted in noncash income tax benefit of $20 million. The Company continues to maintain valuation allowances of approximately $5.6 million based on expected future taxable income supporting the realizability of a portion, but not all, of the deferred tax assets. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable could be adjusted in future periods if evidence warrants such a change.
Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets, if any. Management considers estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income in assessing the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets. Our actual effective tax rate and income tax expense could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including changes in income tax laws, tax planning and the Company’s forecasted financial condition and results of operations in future periods. Although management believes current estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates.
Recognition of Net Sales
We recognize net sales for products purchased at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise. We recognize service revenue, which consists primarily of installation revenue and freight charges for in-home delivery, when the service has been rendered. We report sales exclusive of sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental taxing authorities. Net sales are reduced by an allowance for anticipated sales returns that we estimate based on historical and current sales trends and experience. We believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns. Any reasonably likely changes that may occur in the assumptions underlying our allowance estimates would not be expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or operating performance. Actual sales returns did not vary materially from estimated amounts for 2020, 2019 or 2018.
In addition, customers who do not take immediate delivery of their purchases are generally required to pay a deposit, equal to approximately half of the retail sales value, with the balance payable when the customer takes
possession of the merchandise. These customer deposits benefit our cash flow and return on investment capital, because we receive partial payment for our customers’ purchases immediately. We record these deposits as a liability on our balance sheet in Customer Deposits and Store Credits until the customer takes possession of the merchandise.
Vouchers for Legal Settlements
As discussed in Item 8. Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the administrator of the MDL settlement issued $14 million in store-credit vouchers on December 30, 2020 under the March 2018 MDL settlement agreement. In addition, based on the current court order, the administrator of the Gold Settlement is expected to issue those vouchers late in the second quarter of 2021. As vouchers are redeemed, the transaction will not be a sale. Rather the Company will relieve the liability for the full amount, relieve inventory at its cost, and the remaining amount -- the gross margin for the items sold -- will be recorded as a reduction in SGA expense. Most of the vouchers expire 3 years from date of issuance although vouchers issued to recipients in certain states have longer expiration including 7 states with no expiration date as stipulated in the legal settlement. The Company recorded no forfeiture estimate as of December 31, 2020 as there is not yet a history of voucher redemption upon which to record a forfeiture estimate. The Company will monitor and evaluate the redemption of vouchers on a quarterly basis. In order to reach an estimate, the Company will consider redemption velocity and patterns, remaining value - both on individual vouchers as well as collectively - of vouchers, and the passage of time. The Company will also consider consumer behaviors across both the MDL and Gold Settlements. The Company’s current expectation is that recipients bargained for this compensation as part of the settlement and therefore will redeem their voucher for product as intended.
