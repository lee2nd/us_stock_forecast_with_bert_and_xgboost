ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Plan of Operation
New Jersey Mining Company is a gold producer focused on diversifying and building its asset base and cash flows through a portfolio of mineral properties located in historic producing gold districts in Idaho and Montana.
The Company’s plan of operation is to generate positive cash flow, increase its gold production and asset base over time while being mindful of corporate overhead. The Companies management is focused on utilizing its in-house technical and operating skills to build a portfolio of producing mines and milling operations with a primary focus on gold and secondary focus on silver and base metals.
The Company’s properties include: the Golden Chest Mine (currently in production), the New Jersey Mill (majority ownership interest), and a 50% carried to production interest in the past producing Butte Highlands Mine located in Montana. In addition to its producing and near-term production projects, New Jersey Mining Company has additional gold exploration prospects, including the McKinley-Monarch and Eastern Star located in Central Idaho, and additional holdings near the Golden Chest in the Murray Gold Belt. Recently, the Company added two rare earth element properties in Idaho to its portfolio of exploration properties in an effort to diversify its holdings towards the anticipated demand for these elements in the electrification of motorized vehicles.
Highlights for 2020 include:
·For the year ending December 31, 2020 39,880 dry metric tonnes (dmt) were processed at the Company’s New Jersey Mill with an average gold head grade of 3.03 grams per tonne gold (gpt).
·NJMC produced a total of 3,755 ounces of gold contained in concentrates.
·Mined 27,690 tonnes of ore from the open pit at an average grade of 1.73 gpt gold with an average stripping ratio of 9.1 and an average daily mining rate of 1,480 tonnes per day (tpd). Tonnes and grade were lower than expected because of unmapped historic stopes where the old-timers mined portions of the veins.
·Mined 12,190 tonnes of ore from the underground mine at an average grade of 5.98 gpt gold, placed 1,828 cubic meters of cemented rockfill (CRF) and completed 75 meters of Main Access Ramp (MAR) to access new stopes.
·Added additional mining equipment and a second crew of miners in the third quarter of 2020 to increase underground mine production and initiate underground development of the Main Access Ramp. A wireless communication system was also installed underground to improve communication and safety.
·Added two rare earth element properties in central Idaho to its portfolio, the Diamond Creek and Roberts Projects.
·Acquired the Alder Gulch Project which contains 368 acres of patented, prospective land just west of the Golden Chest.
Results of Operations
Our financial performance for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is summarized below:
·Revenue from gold concentrate sales was $5,674,947 for the year ending December 31, 2020 compared to $6,119,512 for the comparable period in 2019. The decrease in revenue from mining operations is the result of fewer tonnes processed at the mill due to less tonnes and lower grade mineralized material being mined in the open pit in 2020 compared to 2019.
·Gross profit in 2020 was $67,546 compared to a gross profit of $738,548 in 2019 also because of fewer tonnes and lower grade mineralized material being mined in the open pit in 2020 compared to 2019.
·The Company had a net loss of $739,939 in 2020 compared to a net loss of $726,507 for the same period in 2019.
·The consolidated net loss included non-cash charges of $236,493 ($1,112,434 in 2019) as follows: depreciation and amortization of $575,671 ($580,005 in 2019), accretion of asset retirement obligation of $9,632 ($9,077 in 2019), stock based compensation of none ($190,019 in 2019), loss on abandonment of mineral property of none ($333,333 in 2019), loss on write off of equipment $9,536 (none in 2019), gain on forgiveness of CARES Act loan of $358,346 (none in 2019).
·Net loss attributable to New Jersey Mining Company was $642,876 and $609,605 in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
·Pre-development expenses decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 as the underground operations were commenced.
·Exploration expenses increased in 2020 compared to 2019 as funds became available. These exploration costs were primarily associated with core drilling and rare earth exploration.
Cash Costs and All In Sustaining Costs Reconciliation to GAAP-Reconciliation of cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization (GAAP) to cash cost per ounce and all-in sustaining costs (AISC) per ounce (non-GAAP).
The table below presents reconciliations between the most comparable GAAP measure of cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization to the non-GAAP measures of cash cost per ounce produced and all in sustaining costs per ounce produced for the Company’s gold production for the years ended December 31, 2020
and 2019. The cost per ounce calculations are based on ounces produced. Upon sale, the Company typically receives payment at an average rate of 91% of ounces produced after smelting and refining charges are deducted.
Cash cost per ounce is an important operating measure that we utilize to measure operating performance. AISC per ounce is an important measure that we utilize to assess net cash flow after costs for pre-development, exploration, reclamation, and sustaining capital. Current GAAP measures used in the mining industry, such as cost of goods sold do not capture all of the expenditures incurred to discover, develop, and sustain gold production.

The Company has accumulated deficit of approximately $12.7 million at December 31, 2020 and incurred a consolidated net loss in 2020 of $739,939. The Company’s working capital at December 31, 2020 is $2,226,162. The Company is currently producing from the open-pit and underground at the Golden Chest. During 2020, production generated negative cash flow from operations of $482,418 compared to positive cash flow used in operations of $206,407 in 2019. Planned production for the next 18 months indicates a positive cash flow from operations will be renewed as underground mining overtakes the open pit as the primary source of mineralized material. In prior years, the Company has been successful in raising required funds for ongoing operations from sale of its common stock or borrowing. Management believes it has the ability to meet its contractual obligations with continuing cash flows from operations, existing cash, and potential financings for the next 12 months.
