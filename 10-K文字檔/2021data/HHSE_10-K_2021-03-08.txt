ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Forward Looking Statements
The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. Readers are also urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us which attempt to advise interested parties of the factors which affect our business, including without limitation the disclosures made in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors.”
Results of Operations for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020
Calendar year 2020 was utilized by management primarily with a focus on three (3) key projects of corporate priority: 1). The preparation and satisfaction of documentation and reporting requirements relating to the company’s Form 10 Registration and S1 Offering; 2). The development of the MyFlix streaming service, including the ongoing on-boarding of new titles and metadata; and 3). The completion of the final filming scenes for the movie “WILDFIRE” as well as post-production editing, music, effects and distribution activities for that production. It should be noted that item “1” of these priorities includes the resolution of various legal and accounting issues that comprise material issues or disclosures for the Company’s registration. Revenues for the year showed an improvement over 2018 results, but were still very modest compared to results from 5+ years ago when DVD sales were still strong at retail stores. Revenue results for 2020 are impressive when consideration is made that these results occurred despite a total cessation of new release activities for physical home video products and films to theatres (both as a result of retail and theatre closures and shopping practices resulting from COVID-19 shut downs and protocols). Gross sales of $489,101 for the year with net income of $73,121 compares to gross sales in 2019 of $188,135 and net income in 2019 of $1,415. Despite the modest results in terms of dollars, percentage wise, the 2020 Gross Sales were up 159% over 2019 and the 2020 Net Income results were a marked improvement over 2019. The Gross Sales of $489,101 were comprised of approximately $249,772 in MyFlix related mastering and on-boarding charges to supplier studios, and approximately $126,442 in revenues that were paid as direct assignments for the benefit of HHSE titles (including, but not limited to: “Twelve” from 20th Century Fox, “Getting Grace” and “Sleeper Cell” from Random Media / Sony / AEC and “Toys in the Attic” from Entertainment Studios).
Cost of Revenue
The total cost-of-goods incurred during calendar year 2020 which impacted the G&A or Income Statement for this annual period were $1,236, comprised of net third party royalties paid.
Gross & Net Profits
For the applicable annual reporting period, Company posted a Gross Profit of $487,865, which after interest and operational expenses resulted in a net income of $73,121. Due to tax-loss carry-forward, no provision for income taxes has been included in this quarterly assessment of net income
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses for the quarterly reporting period ending 12-31-2020 were $36,131 - and were $95,543 for the full 12-month period ending 12-31-2020. The increase in G&A expense that occurred during the last three months of 2020 was almost entirely due to enhanced costs from the Company’s outside audit activities as well as legal expenses involved in the dispute, settlement or dismissal of litigation matters.
Interest expense.
Interest expense was significantly increased to $297,733 for the three-month period ended December 31, 2020, as a result of accounting reconciliations and recognition of interest rates and applicable debts for which interest is required to be applied (but for which had not previously been applied, or had been calculated at the wrong interest rate). Despite this interest charge and adjustment being applied to the Q4 and 2020 results for the Company, it is important to note that these charges actually date back to 7 and 9 years respectively, and are not indicative of a sudden and repeating spike in interest costs for the Company.
Liquidity & Capital Resources
The company had limited and minimal liquidity during the three-month period ended December 31, 2020, and for the twelve-months ending 12-31-2020. The majority of operating capital from the Company for the year was obtained from loans received in 2020 from Graham Financial Services, Inc. (totaling $98,421.98), as well as from DSM LLC (totaling $69,000.00) and from Eric F. Parkinson (totaling $25,728.76). Other revenues were received from Video-On-Demand licenses and wholesale distributors of books and home video products.
As of the December 31, 2020, Company had cash of $9,067 as compared to $403 as of September 30, 2020, representing an increase of $8,664.
This filing includes a summary of Cash Flows for the Company during both the applicable quarterly reporting periods ending 12-31-2020.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). GAAP requires the use of estimates; assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenues and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information regarding contingencies, risk and financial condition. We believe our use if estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP and are consistently and conservatively applied. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements.
Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 of our financial statements. While all these significant accounting policies impact its financial condition and results of operations, we view certain of these policies as critical. Policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Our management believes that given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would cause effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not currently have any off-balance sheet arrangements, financings, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons, also known as “special purpose entities”. There is an existing obligation of $100,000 (plus 7% interest from March, 2019 for a current total balance of $117,499.94) due to Riot Act LLC (or their designees) regarding Company’s obligations with the film “The Riot Act” (2018). Company intends to retire the Riot Act, LLC obligation in full from initial proceeds of the S1 Registration offering.
