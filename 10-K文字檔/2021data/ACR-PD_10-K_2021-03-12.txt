ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this annual report on Form 10-K.
We have omitted discussion of the earliest of the three years covered by our consolidated financial statements presented in this report as that disclosure is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on March 10, 2020. You are encouraged to reference the discussion and analysis of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” within that report.
Overview
We are a Maryland corporation and an externally managed real estate investment trust (“REIT”) that is primarily focused on originating, holding and managing commercial real estate (“CRE”) mortgage loans and other commercial real estate-related debt investments. On July 31, 2020, our management contract was acquired from Exantas Capital Manager Inc., a subsidiary of C-III Capital Partners LLC, by ACRES Capital, LLC (the “Manager”), a subsidiary of ACRES Capital Corp. (collectively, “ACRES”), a private commercial real estate lender exclusively dedicated to nationwide middle market CRE lending with a focus on multifamily, student housing, hospitality, office and industrial in top United States (“U.S.”) markets (the “ACRES acquisition”). Our Manager draws upon the management team of ACRES and its collective investment experience to provide its services. Our objective is to provide our stockholders with total returns over time, including quarterly distributions and capital appreciation, while seeking to manage the risks associated with our investment strategies as well as to maximize long-term stockholder value by maintaining stability through our available liquidity and diversified CRE loan portfolio.
In connection with the ACRES acquisition:
•
We entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Management Agreement (the “Management Agreement”) which was amended and restated to (i) extend its term to July 21, 2023, (ii) allow for board designation rights that give the Manager the right to designate not less than two nominees for election to our board of directors (“Board”), (iii) provide for a termination fee to be payable to the Manager upon its termination of the Management Agreement due to our default in the performance of any material term, condition or covenant in the Management Agreement, (iv) provide for a minimum monthly base management fee through July 31, 2022 and (v) revise the computation of incentive compensation with respect to each fiscal quarter commencing with the quarter ended December 31, 2022.
•
We entered into separate agreements with Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company (“MassMutual”) and a fund managed by Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. (“Oaktree”) for new capital commitments aggregating up to $375 million. The asset-based revolving loan facility of up to $250.0 million can be used to finance our core CRE lending business and is not subject to mark-to-market provisions. The senior Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement (the “Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement”) of up to $125.0 million can be used for general corporate purposes. See further discussion of these commitments in “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
•
We entered into a $12.0 million promissory note (the “Promissory Note”) as lender with ACRES to partially fund the acquisition of our management contract.
An important aspect of the ACRES acquisition was that it delivered operational liquidity in order to substantially mitigate additional potential margin call risk, allowing us to focus on asset management within the existing portfolio and restart loan originations and underwriting. Additionally, our Manager expects to leverage the complementary nature of our lending platforms, its experience and its network of relationships to generate a CRE pipeline to improve and grow book value and earnings.

In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) was identified. The resulting spread of COVID-19 throughout the globe led the World Health Organization to designate COVID-19 as a pandemic and numerous countries, including the U.S., to declare national emergencies. Many countries have responded to the outbreak by instituting quarantines and restrictions on travel and limiting operations of non-essential offices and retail centers, which has resulted in the closure or remote operation of non-essential businesses and increased rates of unemployment. While certain countries around the world have eased restrictions and financial markets have stabilized to some degree, the pandemic continues to cause uncertainty surrounding its ultimate impact on the global economy, generally, and the CRE business in particular. We continue to actively and responsibly manage corporate liquidity and operations in light of the market disruptions caused by COVID-19. Additionally, nationwide restrictions placed on most businesses in response to COVID-19 are expected to cause significant cash flow disruptions across the economy that will likely impact our borrowers and their ability to stay current with their debt obligations in the near term. We have used and continue to expect to use a variety of legal and structural options to manage that risk effectively, including through forbearance and extension provisions or agreements. It is inherently difficult to accurately assess the impact of COVID-19 on our revenues, profitability and financial position due to uncertainty of the severity and duration of the pandemic. In response, in the near-term, we are focused on prudently retaining and managing sufficient liquidity. We, therefore, have not paid distributions on our common shares in 2020. We continuously monitor the effects of COVID-19 on our operations and financial position to ensure that we remain responsive and adaptable to the dynamic environment that has been created by the pandemic. For additional discussion with respect to the potential impact of COVID-19 on our liquidity and capital resources, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
Historically, we maintained a portfolio of commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”), including senior and subordinated investment grade CMBS, below investment grade CMBS and unrated CMBS, that we primarily financed using short-term repurchase agreements. However, the COVID-19 pandemic produced material and previously unforeseeable liquidity shocks to the real estate credit markets that led to the receipt of substantial margin calls, and subsequently some default notices, from our CMBS repurchase agreement counterparties. In April 2020, we completed the sale of substantially all of our portfolio of CMBS and settlements were reached on all of our remaining CMBS-related obligations, which were paid in full in April 2020. The repayment of all of our CMBS repurchase agreements in April 2020 signifies that we have no further exposure to financings related to CMBS. We realized a loss of $180.3 million on the aforementioned disposition of our CMBS portfolio.
At December 31, 2020, we retained two unencumbered CMBS that previously had fair values below their cost bases with a collective fair value of $2.1 million for which we recognized an unrealized loss of $6.1 million in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Our CRE loan portfolio, which had a $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion carrying value at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, comprised:
•
First mortgage loans, which we refer to as whole loans. These loans are typically secured by first liens on CRE property, including the following property types: office, multifamily, self-storage, retail, hotel, healthcare, student housing, manufactured housing, industrial and mixed-use. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, our whole loans had a carrying value of $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, or 98.0% and 98.3%, respectively, of the CRE loan portfolio.
•
Mezzanine debt that is senior to borrower’s equity but is subordinated to other third-party debt. These loans are subordinated CRE loans, usually secured by a pledge of the borrower’s equity ownership in the entity that owns the property or by a second lien mortgage on the property. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, our mezzanine loans had a carrying value of $4.4 million and $4.7 million, respectively, or 0.3% of the CRE loan portfolio at each date.
•
Preferred equity investments that are subordinate to first mortgage loans and mezzanine debt. These investments may be subject to more credit risk than subordinated debt but provide the potential for higher returns upon a liquidation of the underlying property and are typically structured to provide some credit enhancement differentiating it from the common equity in such investments. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, our preferred equity investments had a carrying value of $26.0 million and $26.1 million, respectively, or 1.7% and 1.4% respectively of the CRE loan portfolio.
We generate our income primarily from the spread between the revenues we receive from our assets and the cost to finance our ownership of those assets, including corporate debt and, to a lesser extent, from hedging interest rate risks.
While the CRE whole loans included in the CRE loan portfolio are entirely composed of floating-rate loans benchmarked to the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), asset yields are protected through the use of LIBOR floors and minimum interest periods that typically range from 12 to 18 months at the time of a loan’s origination. In a lower interest rate environment, our LIBOR floors provide asset yield protection when LIBOR falls below an in-place LIBOR floor. In addition, our net investment returns are enhanced by a decline in the cost of our floating-rate liabilities that do not have LIBOR floors. At December 31, 2020, our $1.5 billion floating-rate CRE loan portfolio, at par, has a weighted average LIBOR floor of 1.88% and weighted average spread over LIBOR of 3.56%. We expect to see a meaningful benefit to interest income as the forward LIBOR curve projects to remain low in the near term in 2021.

Our portfolio comprised loans with a diverse array of collateral types and locations. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, 83.3% and 81.6%, respectively, of our CRE loans were collateralized by multifamily, office, self-storage, manufactured housing and industrial properties, with the remaining 16.7% and 18.4%, respectively, collateralized by hotel and retail properties. These properties are located throughout the U.S., with one National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries (“NCREIF”) region in excess of 20% (Mountain at 21.4%) at December 31, 2020 and no individual region making up more than 20% of the total CRE loan portfolio at December 31, 2019.
In June 2020 we sold one CRE whole loan note for $17.4 million that resulted in a realized loss of $1.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Except for four loans (two of which were paid currently as of February 2021), all of our loans were current on debt service at December 31, 2020. Additionally, we have provided relief in the form of forbearance agreements, term extensions and other modifications on 25 loans during the year ended December 31, 2020. Thirteen of these loans were given forbearances, with a weighted average forbearance period of five months. Eighteen loans were extended by a weighted average of 10 months in exchange for $891,000 of extension fees, in an effort to manage credit risk that was created in connection with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Our CRE mezzanine loan and preferred equity investments earn interest at fixed rates and were current on debt service at December 31, 2020.
We use leverage to enhance our returns. The cost of borrowings to finance our investments is a significant part of our expenses. Our net interest income depends on our ability to control these expenses relative to our revenue. Our CRE loans may initially be financed with term facilities, such as CRE loan warehouse financing facilities, in anticipation of their ultimate securitization. We ultimately seek to finance our CRE loans through the use of non-recourse long-term, match-funded CRE debt securitizations.
In September 2020, with an improved liquidity profile, we repaid the outstanding balances on all of our CRE warehouse financing facilities, and in October 2020, we amended all three of our CRE loan warehouse financing facilities to revise a covenant definition to be in line with other market participants as well as, at our request, to reduce the maximum borrowing capacity from $400.0 million to $250.0 million on one warehouse financing facility as well as to extend the maturity of that same warehouse facility one year. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had an outstanding balance of $12.3 million and $544.9 million, respectively, on our CRE loan warehouse financing facilities, representing 0.94% and 29.1%, respectively, of total outstanding borrowings. We expect to utilize our CRE loan warehouse financing facilities to fund our loan origination pipeline in 2021 alongside the equity we will invest. We also expect to utilize CRE securitization financing alternatives as market conditions permit in 2021.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had outstanding balances of $1.0 billion and $746.4 million, respectively, on CRE debt securitizations, or 78.8% and 39.9%, respectively, of total outstanding borrowings. In March 2020, we closed a CRE debt securitization that financed CRE loans of $522.6 million at a weighted average cost of LIBOR plus 1.43%. In September 2020, we closed a CRE debt securitization that financed $297.0 million of CRE loan commitments at a weighted average cost of LIBOR plus 3.13%. We anticipate that we will close CRE debt securitizations of between $500.0 million and $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021.
In September 2020, we liquidated our 2018 CRE debt securitization by refinancing loans with our senior secured financing facility obtained as a result of the ACRES acquisition. At December 31, 2020, we had an outstanding principal balance on our senior secured financing facility of $33.4 million. Also in conjunction with the ACRES acquisition, we issued $50.0 million in 12.00% senior unsecured notes due 2027 (“Senior Unsecured Notes due 2027”) and warrants to purchase 466,661 shares of our common stock to improve and stabilize our corporate liquidity.
In January 2020, we adopted updated accounting guidance that replaced the incurred loss approach with the current expected credit losses (“CECL”) model for the determination of our allowance for credit losses and write-offs on our investment securities available-for-sale. Upon adoption on January 1, 2020, we recorded an initial CECL reserve of approximately $4.5 million, of which $3.0 million, or $0.29 per share, was recorded as a charge to retained earnings. The estimated CECL reserve represented 0.25% of the aggregate outstanding principal balance of our $1.8 billion commercial loan portfolio at December 31, 2019. We reevaluate our CECL reserves quarterly, incorporating our current expectations of macroeconomic factors considered in the determination of our CECL reserves. At December 31, 2020, the CECL reserves on our CRE loan portfolio was $34.3 million or 2.21% of our $1.5 billion loan portfolio, which reflects weakened macroeconomic factors, including increased unemployment, declining CRE values and less liquidity in CRE capital markets since the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020.
We historically used derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk associated with our borrowings. We generally sought to minimize interest rate risk with a strategy that is expected to result in the least amount of volatility under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) while still meeting our strategic economic objectives and maintaining adequate liquidity and flexibility. These hedging transactions may include interest rate swaps, collars, caps or floors, puts, calls and options.

In April 2020 we terminated all interest rate hedges in conjunction with the disposition of our financed CMBS portfolio. At termination, we recognized a realized loss in equity of $11.8 million that will be amortized into interest expense over the remaining life of the debt. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized amortization expense on these terminated contracts of $1.3 million.
We target originating transitional floating-rate CRE loans between $10.0 million and $80.0 million. In March 2020, due to the market disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we halted loan originations to manage our liquidity. In conjunction with the capital commitments secured through the ACRES acquisition, we resumed originating floating-rate CRE loans in November 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we originated 19 floating-rate CRE whole loans with total commitments of $287.5 million.
We anticipate that our CRE loan originations and other CRE-related investments for the year ended December 31, 2021 will be between $500.0 million and $1.0 billion.
Common stock book value was $20.57 per share at December 31, 2020, a $21.43 per share decrease from December 31, 2019 and reflects the effect of our one-for-three reverse stock split that was announced in February 2021.
Impact of COVID-19
As discussed in the “Overview” above, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. and globally has, and will continue to, adversely impact us, our borrowers and their tenants, the properties securing our investments and the economy as a whole. The COVID-19 pandemic could have a continued and prolonged adverse impact on economic and market conditions and the fluidity of this situation precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact of the pandemic on economic and market conditions. While the discovery and initial distribution of vaccines has had a positive impact on projected macroeconomic indicators, the full extent and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on companies continues to evolve rapidly and will depend on future developments, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, the extension of quarantines and restrictions on travel, the further discovery of successful treatments and the ensuing reactions by consumers, companies, governmental entities and global markets. The impact of the pandemic has had, and we expect will continue to have, a long-term and material impact on our results of operations, financial condition and our liquidity and capital resources during the fiscal year 2020 and in future quarters. Further discussion of the potential impacts on our business from the COVID-19 pandemic is provided below in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Results of Operations
Our net loss allocable to common shares for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $208.1 million, or $(19.33) per share-basic ($(19.33) per share-diluted), as compared to net income allocable to common shares of $25.6 million, or $2.45 per share-basic ($2.43 per share-diluted), for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Net Interest Income
The following table analyzes the change in interest income and interest expense for the comparative years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 by changes in volume and changes in rates. The changes attributable to the combined changes in volume and rate have been allocated proportionately, based on absolute values, to the changes due to volume and changes due to rates (dollars in thousands, except amounts in footnotes):
(1)
Percent change is calculated as the net change divided by the respective interest income or interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019.
(2)
Includes decreases in fee income of approximately $1.2 million, $49,000 and $9,000 recognized on our floating-rate CRE whole loans, legacy CRE loan and CRE preferred equity investments, respectively, that were due to changes in volume.
(3)
Includes the change in interest income recognized on one legacy CRE loan with an amortized cost of $11.4 million and $11.5 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, classified as a CRE loan on the consolidated balance sheet.
(4)
Includes a decrease from net accretion income of approximately $2.1 million that was due to changes in volume.
(5)
Includes decreases of net amortization expense of approximately $400,000, $330,000 and $279,000 on our securitized borrowings, CRE - term warehouse financing facilities and trust certificates - term repurchase facilities, respectively, and increases of approximately $258,000, $54,000 and $136,000 on our senior secured financing facility, convertible senior notes and Senior Unsecured Notes due 2027, respectively, that were due to changes in volume.
Net Change in Interest Income for the Comparative Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Aggregate interest income decreased by $36.6 million for the comparative years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. We attribute the change to the following:
CRE whole loans. The decrease of $17.1 million for the comparative years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was primarily attributable to decreases in the yields on floating-rate CRE whole loans, attributable to declines in the spreads on the originated CRE whole loans over the comparative periods and to a decrease in one-month LIBOR, the benchmark interest rate for our floating-rate CRE whole loans, over the comparative periods. The effect of the decrease in LIBOR over the comparative periods is mitigated by our LIBOR floors, which provide asset yield protection. At December 31, 2020, our floating-rate CRE whole loan portfolio had a weighted average LIBOR floor of 1.88%
(Back to Index)
(Back to Index)
CRE preferred equity investments. The increase of $439,000 for the comparative years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was attributable to the closing of our June 2019 investment in a preferred equity interest with an outstanding principal balance of $6.5 million and an 11.00% interest rate at December 31, 2020.
Securities. The net decrease of $19.5 million for the comparative years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was primarily attributable to the disposition of our entire CMBS portfolio as of April 2020, except for two CMBS securities retained with a total fair value of $2.1 million at December 31, 2020.
Net Change in Interest Expense for the Comparative Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Aggregate interest expense decreased by $25.8 million for the comparative years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. We attribute the change to the following:
Securitized borrowings. The total net decrease of $6.7 million for the comparative years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was primarily attributable to a decrease in one-month LIBOR, the benchmark interest rate for our securitized borrowings, over the comparative periods. The net rate decrease for the comparative years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was partially offset by an net increase in volume attributable to the issuances of Exantas Capital Corp. 2019-RSO7, Ltd. (“XAN 2019-RSO7”), Exantas Capital Corp. 2020-RSO8, Ltd. (“XAN 2020-RSO8”) and Exantas Capital Corp. 2020-RSO9, Ltd. (“XAN 2020-RSO9”), which closed in April 2019, March 2020 and September 2020, respectively, offset by the liquidations of Resource Capital Corp. 2017-CRE5, Ltd. (“RCC 2017-CRE5”) and Exantas Capital Corp. 2018-RSO6, Ltd. (“XAN 2018-RSO6”) in July 2019 and September 2020, respectively.
Unsecured junior subordinated debentures. The net decrease $785,000 for the comparative years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was attributable to a decrease in three-month LIBOR, the benchmark interest rate for our unsecured junior subordinated debentures, over the comparative periods.
Convertible senior notes. The net decrease of $1.6 million for the comparative years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was primarily attributable to the payoff of our 8.00% convertible senior notes upon maturity in January 2020.
Senior Unsecured Notes due 2027. The increase of $2.7 million for the comparative years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was attributable to the execution and borrowings on of the Senior Unsecured Notes due 2027 in July 2020.
Senior secured financing facility. The increase of $2.0 million for the comparative years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was attributable to the execution and borrowings on the senior secured financing facility in July 2020.
CRE - term warehouse financing facilities. The decrease of $12.5 million for the comparative years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was primarily attributable to payoffs of our CRE term warehouse financing facilities in connection with the close of the senior secured financing facility, XAN 2020-RSO8 and XAN 2020-RSO9 and a decrease in the weighted average one-month LIBOR over the comparative periods.
Trust certificates - term repurchase facilities. The decrease of $1.9 million for the comparative years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was primarily attributable to the repayment of the RSO Repo SPE Trust 2017 facility in July 2019.
CMBS - short-term repurchase agreements. The decrease of $8.5 million for the comparative years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was primarily attributable to our CMBS - short term agreements being paid off in full as of April 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on real estate securities markets in March 2020. See “Senior Secured Financing Facility, Term Warehouse Financing Facilities and Repurchase Agreements” for additional information.
Hedging. The increase of $1.4 million for the comparative years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was primarily attributable to amortization expense on terminated interest rate swaps during the year ended December 31, 2020. In April 2020, in conjunction with the disposition of our CMBS portfolio financed with short-term repurchase agreements, we terminated all interest rate swap contracts hedging that portfolio. At termination, we realized a loss of $11.8 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded net amortization expense, reported in interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations, of $1.3 million related to the terminated interest rate swaps.

The remaining losses and gains, reported in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income on the consolidated balance sheets, will be accreted over the remaining life of the debt.
Operating Expenses
Year Ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019
The following table sets forth information relating to our operating expenses for the years presented (dollars in thousands):
Aggregate operating expenses increased by $33.0 million for the comparative years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. We attribute the changes to the following:
(Back to Index)
(Back to Index)
Management fees. The decrease of $2.9 million for the comparative years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was primarily attributable to a decrease in our base management fees during the year ended December 31, 2020. Our monthly base management fee was equal to 1/12th of the amount of our equity multiplied by 1.50% in accordance with our prior management agreement. In March 2020, our equity decreased in connection with the losses incurred on the disposition of our financed CMBS portfolio. Additionally, our management fees decreased due to incentive compensation of $606,000 that was incurred during the year ended December 31, 2019. No incentive compensation was payable during the year ended December 31, 2020. As of July 31, 2020, as part of the amended Management Agreement, the monthly base management fee was amended to be the greater of 1/12th of the amount of our equity multiplied by 1.50% or $442,000 through July 31, 2022.
Equity compensation. The increase of $924,000 for the comparative years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was primarily attributable to the acceleration of all unvested stock awards at July 31, 2020 upon the close of the ACRES acquisition.
Real Estate operating expense. The increase of $298,000 for the comparative years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was attributable to expenses recorded on a real estate owned (“REO”) property delivered as collateral in a deed in lieu of foreclosure transaction in November 2020.
General and administrative. General and administrative expenses increased by $3.9 million for the comparative years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The following table summarizes the information relating to our general and administrative expenses for the years presented (dollars in thousands):
The increase in general and administrative expenses for the comparative years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was primarily attributable to (i) an increase in professional services in connection with legal fees and advisory fees for services rendered as part of the ACRES acquisition as well as legal fees incurred in 2020 primarily related to the settlement of our CMBS repurchase agreements and (ii) an increase in wages and benefits allocated to us by our Manager. The increase in professional services for the comparative periods was offset by an increase in professional services during the year ended December 31, 2019 in connection with expenses incurred on a non-consummated transaction.
Provision for credit losses, net. The increase of $30.8 million in provisions for credit losses for the comparative years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was primarily attributable to the updated estimates of losses calculated in our CECL model. The CECL model, adopted on January 1, 2020, measures the allowance for credit losses using an expected credit losses approach, as compared to the incurred credit losses approach utilized during the year ended December 31, 2019. The CECL model projected significantly increased expected credit losses during the year ended December 31, 2020 in connection with the adverse market conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Other Income (Expense)
Year Ended December 31, 2020 as compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019
The following table sets forth information relating to our other expense for the years presented (dollars in thousands):
Aggregate other expense increased $190.1 million for the comparative years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. We attribute the change to the following:
Net realized and unrealized (loss) gain on investment securities available-for-sale and loans and derivatives. The increase in losses of $186.6 million for the comparative years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was primarily attributable to a loss of $180.3 million on the disposition of our CMBS portfolio that was financed with our CMBS - short-term repurchase facilities during year ended December 31, 2020. Additionally, the increase was attributable to a loss of $6.1 million recorded to mark our two remaining investment securities available-for-sale to fair value during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Fair value adjustments on financial assets held for sale. The change of $4.1 million for the comparative years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was primarily attributable to charges of $8.8 million and $4.7 million, respectively, incurred on the remaining legacy CRE asset held for sale, which included protective advances to cover borrower operating losses of $2.7 million and $1.2 million, respectively. The remaining asset held for sale was sold in December 2020.
Gain on conversion of real estate. The gain of $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and was attributable to the receipt of a deed in lieu of foreclosure on one CRE whole loan with an appraised value of $39.8 million, which was above our loan basis, in November 2020.
Other income. The decrease of $937,000 for the comparative years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was primarily attributable to the recovery of $647,000 of the reserve for the Pearlmark Mezzanine Realty Partners IV, L.P. (“Pearlmark Mezz”) indemnification during the year ended December 31, 2019.
Financial Condition
Summary
Our total assets were $1.7 billion at December 31, 2020 as compared to $2.5 billion at December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to the disposition of our financed CMBS portfolio, completed in April 2020, in connection with the receipt of default notices from certain CMBS - short-term repurchase agreement counterparties (see “Senior Secured Financing Facility, Term Warehouse Financing Facilities and Repurchase Agreements”) and the payoffs and paydowns on our CRE whole loans as well as macroeconomic outlook and uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Beginning in April 2023, we have the right to unilaterally force the sale of the Prospect Hackensack JV LLC’s underlying property. Beginning in June 2022, we have the right to unilaterally force the sale of WC Newhall MM, LLC’s underlying property.
(9)
Our floating-rate CRE loan portfolio of $1.5 billion had a weighted-average one-month LIBOR floor of 1.88% at December 31, 2020.
At December 31, 2020, approximately 21.4%, 17.9% and 16.1% of our CRE loan portfolio was concentrated in the Mountain, Southwest and Southeast regions, respectively, based on carrying value, as defined by the NCREIF. At December 31, 2019, approximately 19.5%, 19.4% and 17.6% of our CRE loan portfolio was concentrated in the Mountain, Southwest and Southeast regions, respectively, based on carrying value. No single loan or investment represented more than 10% of our total assets and no single investment group generated over 10% of our total revenue.
CMBS. Beginning in the first quarter of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic produced material and previously unforeseeable liquidity shocks to credit markets. As a result of the receipt of default notices with respect to some of our CMBS (see “Senior Secured Financing Facility, Term Warehouse Financing Facilities and Repurchase Agreements”) and the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we disposed of our entire CMBS portfolio, except for two CMBS securities with an amortized cost and fair value of $2.1 million, as of December 31, 2020.

The following table summarizes our CMBS investments earning coupon interest at fixed-rates or floating-rates at December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in thousands, except amounts in the footnote):
(1)
Face value includes $25.9 million, with a total cost basis of $106,000, of CMBS that have been subject to other-than-temporarily-impairment charges at December 31, 2019.
Investments in unconsolidated entities. Our investments in unconsolidated entities at December 31, 2020 and 2019 comprised a 100% interest in the common shares of Resource Capital Trust I (“RCT I”) and RCC Trust II (“RCT II”), respectively, with a value of $1.5 million in the aggregate, or 3.0% of each trust. We record our investments in RCT I’s and RCT II’s common shares as investments in unconsolidated entities using the cost method, recording dividend income when declared by RCT I and RCT II. During years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded dividends from the investments in RCT I’s and RCT II’s common shares, reported in other revenue on the consolidated statement of operations, of $77,000 and $100,000, respectively.
Financing Receivables
The following tables show the activity in the allowance for credit losses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands, except amount in the footnote):
(1)
Our mezzanine loan and preferred equity investments were evaluated individually for impairment during the year ended December 31, 2019 and were determined to have no evidence of impairment.
(2)
Excludes the recovery of credit losses on one bank loan with no amortized cost or carrying value at December 31, 2020 and 2019 that received a payment of approximately $1,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019.
(3)
The allowance for credit losses included a realized loss of $997,000 that was charged to the allowance related to one CRE loan sale that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2020. There was no such charge off as of December 31, 2019.
The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the losses assumed in our CECL computations during the year ended December 31, 2020. CECL losses in the CRE loan portfolio were negatively impacted by higher expected unemployment and increased volatility in CRE asset pricing and liquidity.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we individually evaluated a hotel loan in the Northeast region with a $37.9 million principal balance for which disclosure was deemed probable. In November 2020, as a result of discussions with the borrower, we received the deed in lieu of foreclosure on the property. In conjunction with receiving the deed in lieu of foreclosure, we obtained an updated appraisal that indicated an as-is appraised value of $39.8 million and consequently reversed the $8.0 million CECL allowance that was previously established for the loan that was based on the estimated sales value of the collateral, less estimated costs to sell.
Also at December 31, 2020, we individually evaluated an office loan in the North East Central region with a $19.9 million principal balance and a hotel loan in the Northeast region with a $14.0 million par balance for which foreclosure was determined to be probable. At December 31, 2020, we determined that these loans had CECL allowances of $1.9 million and $0, respectively, which was calculated as the difference between the as-is appraised values and the loans’ amortized costs.
(Back to Index)
(Back to Index)
In June 2020, we sold one CRE whole loan note for $17.4 million, which resulted in a realized loss of $1.0 million recorded in the provision for credit losses during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Credit quality indicators
Commercial Real Estate Loans
CRE loans are collateralized by a diversified mix of real estate properties and are assessed for credit quality based on the collective evaluation of several factors, including but not limited to: collateral performance relative to underwritten plan, time since origination, current implied and/or re-underwritten loan-to-collateral value (“LTV”) ratios, loan structure and exit plan. Depending on the loan’s performance against these various factors, loans are rated on a scale from 1 to 5, with loans rated 1 representing loans with the highest credit quality and loans rated 5 representing the loans with the lowest credit quality. The factors evaluated provide general criteria to monitor credit migration in our loan portfolio; as such, a loan’s rating may improve or worsen, depending on new information received.
The criteria set forth below should be used as general guidelines and, therefore, not every loan will have all of the characteristics described in each category below.
Risk Rating
Risk Characteristics
• Property performance has surpassed underwritten expectations.
• Occupancy is stabilized, the property has had a history of consistently high occupancy, and the property has a diverse and high quality tenant mix.
• Property performance is consistent with underwritten expectations and covenants and performance criteria are being met or exceeded.
• Occupancy is stabilized, near stabilized or is on track with underwriting.
• Property performance lags behind underwritten expectations.
• Occupancy is not stabilized and the property has some tenancy rollover.
• Property performance significantly lags behind underwritten expectations. Performance criteria and loan covenants have required occasional waivers.
• Occupancy is not stabilized and the property has a large amount of tenancy rollover.
• Property performance is significantly worse than underwritten expectations. The loan is not in compliance with loan covenants and performance criteria and may be in default. Expected sale proceeds would not be sufficient to pay off the loan at maturity.
• The property has a material vacancy rate and significant rollover of remaining tenants.
• An updated appraisal is required upon designation and updated on an as-needed basis.
All CRE loans are evaluated for any credit deterioration by debt asset management and certain finance personnel on at least a quarterly basis. Mezzanine loans and preferred equity investments may experience greater credit risks due to their nature as subordinated investments.
For the purpose of calculating the quarterly provision for credit losses under CECL, we pool CRE loans based on the underlying collateral property type and utilize a probability of default and loss given default methodology for approximately one year after which we immediately revert to a historical mean loss ratio. In order to calculate the historical mean loss ratio, we utilize our full, 14 year underwriting history in the determination of historical losses, along with the market loss history from a selected population from an engaged third-party provider’s database that were similar to our loan types, loan sizes, durations, interest rate structure and general LTV profiles.
Prior to the implementation of CECL, whole loans were first individually evaluated for impairment; and to the extent not deemed impaired, a general reserve was established. The allowance for credit loss was computed as (i) 1.5% of the aggregate face values of loans rated as a 3, plus (ii) 5.0% of the aggregate face values of loans rated as a 4, plus (iii) specific allowances measured and determined on loans individually evaluated, which were loans rated as a 5. While the overall risk rating was generally not the sole factor used in determining whether a loan was impaired, a loan with a higher overall risk rating would tend to have more adverse indicators of impairment, and therefore would be more likely to experience a credit loss.

Credit risk profiles of CRE loans, at amortized cost, were as follows (in thousands, except amounts in footnotes):
(1)
The total amortized cost of CRE loans excluded accrued interest receivable of $7.3 million and $6.7 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
(2)
Our mezzanine loan and preferred equity investments were evaluated individually for impairment at December 31, 2019.
Credit risk profiles of CRE loans by origination year at amortized cost were as follows (in thousands):
(1)
The total amortized cost of CRE loans excluded accrued interest receivable of $7.3 million and $6.7 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
(2)
Acquired CRE whole loans are grouped within each loan’s year of issuance.
In November 2019, we foreclosed on our remaining legacy CRE loan included in assets held for sale and obtained ownership of the underlying property, which remained classified as an asset held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets recorded at the lower of cost or fair market value. An appraisal was received on the property in February 2020 and concluded its fair value, less estimated costs to sell, was $16.5 million, the effect of which was recorded as of December 31, 2019. In the third quarter of 2020, we received a new offer of $11.0 million on the property. Net of approximately $715,000 of estimated costs to sell, the asset was valued at $10.3 million. The CRE asset held for sale was sold in December 2020 for proceeds of $10.3 million.
(Back to Index)
(Back to Index)
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we incurred fair value adjustments on the remaining CRE asset held for sale to reduce the carrying value of $8.8 million and $4.7 million, respectively, which included protective advances to cover borrower operating losses of $2.7 million and $1.2 million, respectively, recorded in fair value adjustments on financial assets held for sale on the consolidated statements of operations. The adjustments during the year ended December 31, 2020 included fair value charges of $6.2 million in connection with the offers received and the subsequent sale of the asset.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had one mezzanine loan included in assets held for sale that had no fair value.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded an increase in the reserve of $29.8 million. The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the losses assumed in our CECL computations during year ended December 31, 2020. CECL losses in the CRE loan portfolio were negatively impacted by higher expected unemployment and increased volatility in CRE asset pricing and liquidity. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a increase in the reserve of $59,000, which was primarily attributable to two loans that migrated from a risk rating of 2 to a risk rating of 3, in which performance lagged behind underwritten expectations, and partially offset by two loans risk rated as a 3 that repaid and loan paydowns on one loan risk rated as a 3 and one loan risk rated as a 4.
Loan Portfolios Aging Analysis
The following table presents the CRE loan portfolio aging analysis as of the dates indicated for CRE loans, at amortized cost and a legacy CRE loan held for sale at the lower of cost or fair value (in thousands, except amounts in footnotes):
(1)
Includes one whole loan, with an amortized cost of $11.4 million and $11.5 million, in maturity default at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The loan is performing with respect to debt service due in accordance with a forbearance agreement at December 31, 2020 and 2019. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized interest income of $670,000 and $747,000, respectively, on this whole loan.
(2)
Includes two whole loans that entered technical default in December 2020, with total amortized costs of $28.3 million at December 31, 2020.
(3)
The total amortized cost of CRE loans excluded accrued interest receivable of $7.3 million and $6.7 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had three and one CRE loans, respectively, in maturity default, including two CRE loans that entered maturity default in the fourth quarter of 2020, with total amortized costs of $39.7 million and $11.5 million, respectively.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, the sponsor of our $6.5 million preferred equity investment in a self-storage CRE property located in Southern California did not make its October and November senior loan debt service payments constituting an event of default under the related senior loan documents. As of December 31, 2020, we were notified that the senior loan debt service was brought current.
Troubled-Debt Restructurings (“TDRs”)
The following table summarizes TDRs during the year ended December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands):
(1)
In November 2020, we received the deed in lieu of foreclosure on the collateral property on one loan that underwent a troubled debt restructuring in the third quarter 2020.
(Back to Index)
(Back to Index)
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we entered into 18 extension agreements that had a weighted average period of 10 months and 13 forbearance agreements that had a weighted average period of five months. As of December 31, 2020, 25 borrowers received payment timing relief in connection with these agreements. Three borrowers with formerly forborne interest are now current and two borrowers continue to perform in accordance with their forbearance agreements at December 31, 2020. Two formerly forborne borrowers and one borrower performing in accordance with a forbearance agreement were in maturity default at December 31, 2020. Except as previously disclosed, no other loan modifications during the year ended December 31, 2020 resulted in TDRs.
Restricted Cash
At December 31, 2020, we had restricted cash of $38.4 million, which consisted of $38.4 million held within our six consolidated securitization entities and $33,000 held in various reserve accounts. At December 31, 2019, we had restricted cash of $14.5 million, which consisted of $13.9 million of restricted cash held as margin, $532,000 held within three of our five consolidated securitizations and $22,000 held in various reserve accounts. The increase of $23.9 million was primarily attributable to an increase in the restricted cash outstanding at our consolidated securitization entities, including a future fundings advance reserve account at XAN 2020-RSO9 of $18.6 million, offset by cash paid for settlements on our CMBS portfolio and fundings made on existing commitments on our CRE portfolio.
Accrued Interest Receivable
The following table summarizes our accrued interest receivable at December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):
The $670,000 decrease in accrued interest receivable was primarily attributable to the decrease of $1.1 million in accrued interest receivable from securities attributable to the disposition of our CMBS portfolio, offset by an increase of $564,000 in accrued interest receivable from loans, which was primarily attributable to loans that were operating in accordance with forbearance agreements during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Other Assets
The following table summarizes our other assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):
The increase of $5.5 million in other assets was primarily attributable to the origination of two fixed-rate CRE whole loans during the year ended December 31, 2020 with a total carrying value of $4.8 million at December 31, 2020. The increase in other assets was also attributable to a $688,000 increase in other receivables, resulting from an increase in fee income receivable, and a $181,000 increase in unsettled trades receivable, resulting from the repurchase of $181,000 of our common stock which settled in January 2021. The increase in other assets was offset by a $267,000 decrease in other prepaid expenses, primarily attributable to August 2019 expenses incurred on a legacy CRE loan held for sale.
Deferred Tax Assets
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, our net deferred tax asset was zero, resulting from a full valuation allowance of $21.2 million and $9.9 million, respectively, on our gross deferred tax asset as we believed it was more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets would not be realized. We will continue to evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating results, the reversal of existing temporary differences, taxable income in prior carry back years (if permitted) and the availability of tax planning strategies.

Core and Non-Core Asset Classes
Our investment strategy targets the following core asset class:
CRE/Core Asset Class
Principal Investments
Commercial real estate-related assets
●
Floating and fixed-rate first mortgage loans, which we refer to as whole loans;
●
First priority interests in first mortgage loans, which we refer to as A-notes;
●
Subordinated interests in first mortgage loans, which we refer to as B-notes;
●
Mezzanine debt related to CRE that is senior to the borrower’s equity position but subordinated to other third-party debt;
●
Preferred equity investments related to CRE that are subordinate to first mortgage loans and are not collateralized by the property underlying the investment;
●
CMBS; and
●
CRE equity investments.
In November 2016, we received approval from our Board to execute the plan to focus our strategy on CRE debt investments (the “Plan”). The Plan contemplated disposing of certain legacy CRE debt investments, exiting underperforming non-core asset classes and establishing a dividend policy based on sustainable earnings. Legacy CRE loans are loans underwritten prior to 2010. In December 2020, we sold our last remaining CRE asset held for sale. The non-core asset classes in which we had historically invested are described below:
Non-Core Asset Classes
Principal Investments
Residential real estate-related assets
●
Residential mortgage loans; and
●
Residential mortgage-backed securities, which comprise our available-for-sale portfolio.
Commercial finance assets
●
Middle market secured corporate loans and preferred equity investments;
●
Asset-backed securities, backed by senior secured corporate loans;
●
Debt tranches of collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”) and collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”), and sometimes, collectively, as CDOs;
●
Structured note investments, which comprise our trading securities portfolio;
●
Syndicated corporate loans; and
●
Preferred equity investment in a commercial leasing enterprise that originates and holds small- and middle-ticket commercial direct financing leases and notes.
Derivative Instruments
A significant market risk to us is interest rate risk. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control. Changes in the general level of interest rates can affect net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest-earning assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with the interest-bearing liabilities, by affecting the spread between the interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in the level of interest rates also can affect the value of our interest-earning assets and our ability to realize gains from the sale of these assets. A decline in the value of our interest-earning assets pledged as collateral for borrowings could result in the counterparties demanding additional collateral pledges or liquidation of some of the existing collateral to reduce borrowing levels.
Historically, we have sought to manage the extent to which net income changes as a fluctuation of changes in interest rates by matching adjustable-rate assets with variable-rate borrowings. We have sought to mitigate the potential impact on net income (loss) of adverse fluctuations in interest rates incurred on our borrowings by entering into hedging agreements.
Historically, we have classified our interest rate hedges as cash flow hedges, which are hedges that eliminate the risk of changes in the cash flows of a financial asset or liability. We recorded changes in fair value of derivatives designated and effective as cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), and recorded changes in fair value of derivatives designated and ineffective as cash flow hedges in earnings.
Historically, we have sought to mitigate the market price risk in connection with our fixed-rate CRE whole loans by entering into interest rate swap contracts in which we pay a fixed rate of interest in exchange for a variable rate benchmark, usually three-month LIBOR. Unrealized gains and losses on the value of these swap contracts were recorded in other income on the consolidated statements of operations.

Senior Secured Financing Facility, Term Warehouse Financing Facilities and Repurchase Agreements
Borrowings under our senior secured financing facility, term warehouse financing facilities and repurchase agreements are guaranteed by us or one or more of our subsidiaries. The following table sets forth certain information with respect to our senior secured financing and term warehouse financing facilities and repurchase agreements (dollars in thousands, except amounts in footnotes):
(1)
Includes $4.0 million of deferred debt issuance costs at December 31, 2020 and no deferred debt issuance costs at December 31, 2019.
(2)
Outstanding borrowings includes accrued interest payable.
(3)
Includes $607,000 of deferred debt issuance costs at December 31, 2019.
(4)
Includes $817,000 of deferred debt issuance costs at December 31, 2019.
(5)
Includes $1.3 million and $1.3 million of deferred debt issuance costs at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which includes $678,000 of deferred debt issuance costs at December 31, 2020 from other term warehouse financing facilities with no balance.
We were in compliance with all covenants in the respective agreements at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Senior Secured Financing Facility
On July 31, 2020, our indirect, wholly owned subsidiary (“Holdings”), along with its direct wholly owned subsidiary (the “Borrower”), entered into a $250.0 million Loan and Servicing Agreement (the “MassMutual Loan Agreement”) with MassMutual and the other lenders party thereto (the “Lenders”). The asset-based revolving loan facility (the “MassMutual Facility”) provided under the MassMutual Loan Agreement will be used to finance our core CRE lending business. The MassMutual Facility has an interest rate of 5.75% per annum payable monthly. The MassMutual Facility matures on July 31, 2027. We paid a commitment fee as well as other reasonable closing costs. The loans under the MassMutual Facility are available for drawing during the first two years of the MassMutual Facility (the “Availability Period”). During the Availability Period, an unused commitment fee of 0.50% per annum (payable monthly) on unused commitments under the MassMutual Loan Agreement is payable for each day on which less than 75% of the total commitment is drawn.
Pursuant to the MassMutual Loan Agreement, the Borrower’s obligations under the MassMutual Loan Agreement are secured by the Borrower’s assets and Holdings’ equity interests in the Borrower, including all distributions, proceeds and profits from Holdings’ interests in the Borrower.
In September 2020, the MassMutual Loan Agreement was amended pursuant to which (i) the initial portfolio assets were revised and an agreed advance rate for each initial portfolio asset (each, an “Initial Portfolio Asset Advance Rate”) was set, and (ii) the revolving loan facility under the MassMutual Loan Agreement was amended to require the initial lender (currently MassMutual) to provide a specific advance rate for any future eligible portfolio assets and to limit the aggregate total amount of advances outstanding at any time to both the total facility amount and, in lieu of a 55% LTV, a borrowing base as of any required date of determination equal to the sum of, in each case, the product of the advance rate for such eligible portfolio asset (including in respect of the initial portfolio assets, the applicable Initial Portfolio Asset Advance Rate therefor) and the then determined value of such eligible portfolio asset.
(Back to Index)
(Back to Index)
In connection with the MassMutual Loan Agreement, we entered into a Guaranty (the “MassMutual Guaranty”) among ourselves, Exantas Real Estate Funding 2018-RSO6 Investor, LLC (“RSO6”), Exantas Real Estate Funding 2019-RSO7 Investor, LLC (“RSO7”), and Exantas Real Estate Funding 2020-RSO8 Investor, LLC (collectively with RSO6 and RSO7, the “Additional Subsidiaries”), each our indirect, wholly owned subsidiary, in favor of the secured parties under the MassMutual Loan Agreement. Pursuant to the MassMutual Guaranty, we fully guaranteed all payments and performance of Holdings and the Borrower under the MassMutual Loan Agreement. Additionally, the Additional Subsidiaries and we made certain representations and warranties and agreed to not incur debt or liens, each subject to certain exceptions, and agreed to provide the Lenders with certain information.
The MassMutual Loan Agreement contains events of default, subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods, customary for this type of financing arrangement. The remedies for such events of default are also customary for this type of transaction.
CRE - Term Warehouse Financing Facilities
In July 2018, our wholly-owned subsidiary entered into an amended and restated master repurchase agreement (the “2018 Facility”), originally executed in February 2012, with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (“Wells Fargo”) to finance the origination of CRE loans. In May 2020, Wells Fargo revised the minimum equity financial covenant required of us as of March 31, 2020 and provided a framework to avoid credit-based markdowns for approximately four months, ending September 4, 2020. In July 2020 and September 2020, the maturity date of the 2018 Facility was extended to September 3, 2020 and October 3, 2020, respectively. In October 2020, the 2018 Facility was amended, at our request, to reduce the 2018 Facility’s maximum amount from $400.0 million to $250.0 million, extend the funding expiration date and revise covenant definitions so that credit losses are determined in accordance with a risk rating-based methodology. In connection with the amendment to the 2018 Facility, we exercised the first of three options to extend the termination date for a one year period thereby extending the maturity date to October 2, 2021. The 2018 Facility charges interest rates of one-month LIBOR plus spreads ranging from 1.75% to 2.50%.
In April 2018, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary entered into a master repurchase agreement (the “Barclays Facility”) with Barclays Bank PLC (“Barclays”) to finance the origination of CRE loans. In connection with the Barclays Facility, we entered into a guaranty agreement (the “Barclays Guaranty”) pursuant to which we fully guaranteed all payments and performance under the Barclays Facility. In May 2020, we entered into an amendment to the Barclays Guaranty that revised its minimum equity financial covenant as of March 1, 2020. Barclays also provided a framework to avoid credit-based markdowns for approximately four months, ending August 31, 2020. In October 2020, we entered into an amendment to the Barclays Guaranty that revised a covenant definition to be in line with other market participants so that credit losses are determined in accordance with a risk rating-based methodology. The Barclays Facility has a maximum facility amount of $250.0 million, charges interest of one-month LIBOR plus a spread between 2.00% and 2.50% and matures in April 2021, subject to certain one-year extension options in accordance with the facility’s terms. In March 2021, we amended the Barclay’s Facility to extend the revolving period through October 2021.
In October 2018, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary entered into a master repurchase agreement (the “JPMorgan Chase Facility”) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to finance the origination of CRE loans. In connection with the JPMorgan Chase Facility, we entered into a guarantee agreement (the “JPMorgan Chase Guarantee”) pursuant to which we fully guaranteed all payments and performance under the JPMorgan Chase Facility. In May 2020, we entered into an amendment to the JPMorgan Chase Guarantee that revised its minimum equity financial covenant as of February 29, 2020. In October 2020, we entered into an amendment to the JPMorgan Chase Guarantee that revised a covenant definition so that credit losses are determined in accordance with a risk rating-based methodology. The JPMorgan Chase Facility has a maximum facility amount of $250.0 million, charges interest of one-month LIBOR plus a spread between 2.00% and 2.25% and matures in October 2021, subject to two one-year extension options in accordance with the facility’s terms.
Trust Certificates - Term Repurchase Facility
In September 2017, a wholly-owned subsidiary entered into a repurchase and securities agreement (the “2017 Term Repurchase Trust Facility”) with RSO Repo SPE Trust 2017, a structure that provides financing under a structured sale of trust certificates to qualified institutional buyers through an offering led by Wells Fargo Securities. In July 2019, we paid off the outstanding balance of the 2017 Term Repurchase Trust Facility in connection with the redemption of RCC 2017-CRE5.
CMBS - Short-Term Repurchase Agreements
The COVID-19 pandemic produced material and previously unforeseeable liquidity shocks in credit markets causing significant declines in the pricing of our investment securities available-for-sale that were collateral for our CMBS short-term repurchase facilities. As a result, in March 2020, we received written notices from RBC Capital Markets, LLC, RBC (Barbados) Trading Bank Corporation and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. alleging that events of default had occurred under our associated repurchase agreements as a result of not meeting certain margin calls. These notices were subsequently either withdrawn or rescinded. We had no outstanding balances on our CMBS - short-term repurchase agreements at December 31, 2020.

Securitizations
RCC 2017-CRE5
In July 2017, we closed RCC 2017-CRE5, a $376.7 million CRE securitization transaction that provided financing for transitional CRE loans. In May 2019, we paid off all of the outstanding third-party owned senior notes from the payoff proceeds of certain of the securitization’s assets. In July 2019, we exercised the optional redemption feature of the securitization.
XAN 2018-RSO6
In June 2018, we closed XAN 2018-RSO6, a $514.2 million CRE securitization transaction that provided financing for transitional CRE loans. In September 2020, we executed the optional liquidation of XAN 2018-RSO6, and all of the outstanding senior notes were paid off from the sales proceeds of certain of the securitization’s assets.
XAN 2019-RSO7
In April 2019, we closed XAN 2019-RSO7, a $687.2 million CRE securitization transaction that provided financing for transitional CRE loans. XAN 2019-RSO7 issued a total of approximately $585.8 million of senior notes at par to unrelated investors. A subsidiary of ACRES Realty Funding, Inc. (“ACRES RF”), formerly RCC Real Estate, Inc., purchased 20.4% of the Class D senior notes and 100% of the Class E and Class F notes. In addition, a subsidiary of ACRES RF purchased an equity interest representing 100% of the outstanding preference shares. All of the notes issued mature in April 2036, although we have the right to call the notes any time after May 2021 until maturity.
XAN 2020-RSO8
In March 2020, we closed XAN 2020-RSO8, a $522.6 million CRE debt securitization transaction that provided financing for CRE loans. XAN 2020-RSO8 issued a total of $435.7 million of non-recourse, floating-rate notes at par, of which ACRES RF purchased 100% of the Class D and Class E notes. Our investments in the Class D and Class E notes were financed by CMBS short-term repurchase agreements and were sold in conjunction with the disposition of our CMBS portfolio in April 2020. Additionally, ACRES RF purchased 100% of the Class F and Class G notes and a subsidiary of ACRES RF purchased 100% of the outstanding preference shares. The notes purchased by ACRES RF are subordinated in right of payment to all other senior notes issued by XAN 2020-RSO8, but are senior in right of payment to the preference shares. The preference shares are subordinated in right of payment to all other securities issued by XAN 2020-RSO8. All of the notes issued mature in March 2035, although we have the right to call the notes any time after March 2022.
XAN 2020-RSO9
In September 2020, we closed XAN 2020-RSO9, a $297.0 million CRE debt securitization transaction that provided financing for CRE loans. XAN 2020-RSO9 issued a total of $245.8 million of non-recourse, floating-rate notes at par. Additionally, ACRES RF retained 100% of the Class E and Class F notes and a subsidiary of ACRES RF retained 100% of the outstanding preference shares. The notes purchased by ACRES RF are subordinated in right of payment to all other senior notes issued by XAN 2020-RSO9, but are senior in right of payment to the preference shares. The preference shares are subordinated in right of payment to all other securities issued by XAN 2020-RSO9. All of the notes issued mature in April 2037, although we have the right to call the notes any time after September 2022.
At December 31, 2020, we retain equity in the following securitizations (in thousands):
(1)
The designated principal reinvestment period is the period in which principal repayments can be utilized to purchase loans held outside of the respective securitization that represent the funded commitments of existing collateral in the respective securitization that were not funded as of the date the respective securitization was closed.
(2)
A designated principal reinvestment period is excluded from the terms of XAN 2020-RSO9’s indenture. XAN 2020-RSO9 includes a future advances reserve account of $18.6 million at December 31, 2020 to fund unfunded commitments, which is reported in restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet.

Corporate Debt
4.50% Convertible Senior Notes and 8.00% Convertible Senior Notes
We issued $100.0 million aggregate principal of our 8.00% Convertible Senior Notes and $143.8 million aggregate principal of our 4.50% convertible senior notes due 2022 (“4.50% Convertible Senior Notes”) in January 2015 and August 2017, respectively (together, the “Convertible Senior Notes”). In conjunction with the issuance of our 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes, we extinguished $78.8 million aggregate principal of our 8.00% Convertible Senior Notes. In January 2020, the remaining 8.00% Convertible Senior Notes were paid off upon maturity.
The following table summarizes the Convertible Senior Notes at December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands, except the conversion prices and amounts in the footnotes):
(1)
Includes the amortization of the market discounts and deferred debt issuance costs, if any, for the 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes recorded in interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations.
(2)
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 the effective interest rate for the 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes was 7.43%.
(3)
Represents the number of shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes’ principal outstanding, subject to adjustment as provided in the Third Supplemental Indenture (the “4.50% Convertible Senior Notes Indenture”).
(4)
The conversion rate and conversion price of the 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes at December 31, 2020 are adjusted to reflect quarterly cash dividends in excess of a $0.30 dividend threshold, as defined in the 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes Indenture.
The 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes are convertible at the option of the holder at any time up until one business day before the maturity date and may be settled in cash, our common stock or a combination of cash and our common stock, at our election. We may not redeem the 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes prior to maturity. The closing price of our common stock was $11.97 on December 31, 2020, which did not exceed the conversion price of our 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes at December 31, 2020.
Unsecured Junior Subordinated Debentures
During 2006, we formed RCT I and RCT II for the sole purpose of issuing and selling capital securities representing preferred beneficial interests. RCT I and RCT II are not consolidated into our consolidated financial statements because we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of these entities. In connection with the issuance and sale of the capital securities, we issued junior subordinated debentures to RCT I and RCT II of $25.8 million each, representing our maximum exposure to loss. The debt issuance costs associated with the junior subordinated debentures for RCT I and RCT II were included in borrowings and were amortized into interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations using the effective yield method over a ten year period.
There were no unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the junior subordinated debentures for RCT I and RCT II outstanding at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The interest rates for RCT I and RCT II, at December 31, 2020, were 4.19% and 4.16%, respectively. The interest rates for RCT I and RCT II, at December 31, 2019, were 5.91% and 5.89%, respectively.
The rights of holders of common securities of RCT I and RCT II are subordinate to the rights of the holders of capital securities only in the event of a default; otherwise, the common securities’ economic and voting rights are pari passu with the capital securities. The capital and common securities of RCT I and RCT II are subject to mandatory redemption upon the maturity or call of the junior subordinated debentures held by each. Unless earlier dissolved, RCT I will dissolve in May 2041 and RCT II will dissolve in September 2041. The junior subordinated debentures are the sole assets of RCT I and RCT II, which mature in June 2036 and October 2036, respectively, and may currently be called at par.
Senior Unsecured Notes
12.00% Senior Unsecured Notes Due 2027
On July 31, 2020, we entered into the Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement with Oaktree and MassMutual pursuant to which we may issue to Oaktree and MassMutual from time to time up to $125.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Unsecured Notes due 2027. The Senior Unsecured Notes due 2027 have an annual interest rate of 12.00%, payable up to 3.25% (at our election) as pay-in-kind interest and the remainder as cash interest. On July 31, 2020, we issued to Oaktree $42.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Senior Unsecured Notes due 2027. In addition, on July 31, 2020, we issued to MassMutual $8.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Senior Unsecured Notes due 2027. We recorded a discount of $3.1 million (the offset of which was recorded in additional paid-in capital) on the Senior Unsecured Notes due 2027 that reflects the difference between the proceeds received less the fair value of the notes as if they were issued without the detachable warrants. The market discounts and deferred debt issuance costs are amortized into interest expense on the consolidated statements of operation on an effective interest basis over the period ending in July 2027. The effective interest rate is 13.65%. At any time and from time to time prior to January 31, 2022, we may elect to issue to Oaktree and MassMutual up to $75.0 million aggregate principal amount of additional Senior Unsecured Notes due 2027.

The Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement contains events of default, subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods.
Stockholders’ Equity
Total stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2020 was $334.4 million and gave effect to $10.0 million of net unrealized losses on our cash flow hedges, shown as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2019 was $556.4 million and gave effect to $4.0 million of unrealized gains on our cash flow hedges and $5.8 million of net unrealized losses on our available-for-sale portfolio, shown as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The decrease in stockholders’ equity during the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily attributable to a decrease in retained earnings in connection with an increase in net losses, primarily attributable to the losses incurred on the disposition of our financed CMBS portfolio.
Balance Sheet - Book Value Reconciliation
The following table rolls forward our common stock book value for the three months and year ended December 31, 2020 (in thousands, except per share data amounts in footnotes):
(1)
Per share calculations and share amounts in the above table and the following tabular footnotes retrospectively reflect the three-for-one reverse stock split effective February 16, 2021.
(2)
Per share calculations exclude unvested restricted stock, as disclosed on the consolidated balance sheet, of 11,610, 11,610 and 140,320 shares at December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, and include warrants to purchase up to 466,661 shares of common stock at December 31, 2020. The denominator for the calculation is 10,617,340, 11,152,831 and 10,486,544 at December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively.
(3)
The per share amounts are calculated with the denominator referenced in footnote (2) at December 31, 2020. We calculated net income per common share-diluted of $1.95 and net losses per common share-diluted of $19.33 using the weighted average diluted shares outstanding during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020.
(4)
We issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 466,661 shares of common stock to Oaktree and MassMutual in connection with the issuance of the Senior Unsecured Notes due 2027. Upon issuance, the warrants were fair valued and recorded as a discount to the outstanding borrowings, offset in additional paid-in capital.
(5)
Our Board authorized and approved the continued use of the share repurchase program to repurchase up to $20.0 million of the currently outstanding common stock through June 30, 2021 or until the authorized $20.0 million is fully deployed. We purchased 535,485 shares for $5.4 million through December 31, 2020
(6)
We calculated common stock book value as total stockholders’ equity of $334.4 million less preferred stock equity of $116.0 million at December 31, 2020.
Management Agreement Equity
Our monthly base management fee, as defined in our Management Agreement, is equal to the greater of (i) 1/12th of the amount of our equity multiplied by 1.50% or (ii) $442,000 through July 31, 2022 and is calculated and paid monthly in arrears.
The following table summarizes the calculation of equity, as defined in the Management Agreement (in thousands):
(1)
Deducts underwriting discounts and commissions and other expenses and costs relating to such issuances.
(2)
Excludes non-cash equity compensation expense incurred to date.

Core Earnings
Core Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure that we use to evaluate our operating performance.
Core Earnings exclude the effects of certain transactions and adjustments in accordance with GAAP that we believe are not necessarily indicative of our current CRE loan portfolio and other CRE-related investments and operations. Core Earnings exclude income (loss) from all non-core assets such as commercial finance, middle market lending, residential mortgage lending, certain legacy CRE assets and other non-CRE assets designated as assets held for sale at the initial measurement date of December 31, 2016.
Core Earnings, for reporting purposes, is defined as GAAP net income (loss) allocable to common shares, excluding (i) non-cash equity compensation expense, (ii) unrealized gains and losses, (iii) non-cash provisions for credit losses, (iv) non-cash impairments on securities, (v) non-cash amortization of discounts or premiums associated with borrowings, (vi) net income or loss from a limited partnership interest owned at the initial measurement date, (vii) net income or loss from non-core assets, (1)(2) (viii) real estate depreciation and amortization, (ix) foreign currency gains or losses and (x) income or loss from discontinued operations. Core Earnings may also be adjusted periodically to exclude certain one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain non-cash items.
Although pursuant to the Management Agreement we calculate incentive compensation using Core Earnings that exclude incentive compensation payable to our Manager, we include incentive compensation payable to our Manager in calculating Core Earnings for reporting purposes.
The following table provides a reconciliation from GAAP net income (loss) allocable to common shares to Core Earnings allocable to common shares for the periods presented (dollars in thousands, except amounts in the footnotes):
(1)
Substantially comprises unrealized losses on two unencumbered CMBS investments of $6.1 million at December 31, 2020.
(2)
Income tax expense (benefit) from non-core investments and net realized gain on non-core assets are components of net income or loss from non-core assets.
(3)
Non-core assets are investments and securities owned by us at the initial measurement date in (i) commercial finance, (ii) middle market lending, (iii) residential mortgage lending, (iv) legacy CRE assets designated as held for sale and (v) other non-CRE assets included in assets held for sale.
Core Earnings in accordance with the Management Agreement, which excludes incentive compensation payable, was $3.0 million, or $0.28 per common share outstanding, for the three months ended December 31, 2020. There was no incentive compensation payable for the three months ended December 31, 2020.

(Back to Index)
Incentive Compensation Hurdle
In accordance with the Management Agreement, incentive compensation is earned by our Manager when our Core Earnings per common share (as defined in the Management Agreement) for such quarter exceeds an amount equal to: (1) the weighted average of (a) book value (as defined in the Management Agreement) as of the end of such quarter divided by 10,293,783 shares and (b) the price per share (including the conversion price, if applicable) paid for common shares in each offering (or issuance, upon the conversion of convertible securities) by us subsequent to September 30, 2017, in each case at the time of issuance, multiplied by (2) the greater of (a) 1.75% and (b) 0.4375% plus one-fourth of the ten year treasury rate, as defined in the Management Agreement, for such quarter (the “Incentive Compensation Hurdle”).
For the three months ended December 31, 2020, our Core Earnings, as defined in the Management Agreement, did not exceed the Incentive Compensation Hurdle.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity is a measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to pay dividends, fund investments, repay borrowings and provide for other general business needs, including payment of our base management fee and incentive compensation. Our ability to meet our on-going liquidity needs is subject to our ability to generate cash from operating activities and our ability to maintain and/or obtain additional debt financing and equity capital together with the funds referred to below.
On July 31, 2020, in conjunction with the ACRES acquisition, we secured new capital commitments of up to $375.0 million through the execution of the senior secured financing facility and the Senior Unsecured Notes due 2027. The senior secured financing facility has an interest rate of 5.75% and advance rates determined by property type with credit specific adjustments. Additionally, the senior secured financing facility has a two-year revolving period followed by a five-year term period and was utilized to repay our term warehouse financing facilities and repurchase agreements and is not subject to mark-to-market adjustments. The Senior Unsecured Notes due 2027 have an interest rate of 12.00% and can be used for general corporate purposes. The Senior Unsecured Notes due 2027 also give Oaktree and MassMutual warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to 1.2 million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.03 per share. We issued $50.0 million of the Senior Unsecured Notes and issued warrants to purchase 466,661 shares of our common stock at the closing of the ACRES acquisition to Oaktree and MassMutual in the aggregate. We expect these proceeds will provide balance sheet flexibility as well as enhance our liquidity position. A total of $75.0 million remains issuable under the Senior Unsecured Notes due 2027 at December 31, 2020 from which we may draw, at our election, prior to January 31, 2022.
Also, in conjunction with the closing of the ACRES acquisition, we provided a $12.0 million loan to ACRES Capital Corp., the parent of our Manager, as evidenced by the Promissory Note. The note bears interest at 3.00% per annum, payable monthly, and matures in six years, subject to two one-year extensions, at ACRES Capital Corp.’s option, and amortizes at a rate of $25,000 per month.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, our principal sources of liquidity were: (i) proceeds of $128.5 million of financing sourced from our senior secured financing facility, (ii) net proceeds of $99.5 million from our CRE - term warehouse financing facilities, (iii) net proceeds of $89.1 million from repayments on our CRE loan portfolio, (iv) proceeds of $50.0 million from the issuance of the Senior Unsecured Notes due 2027, (v) net proceeds of $47.3 million from the close of XAN 2020-RSO8 and XAN 2020-RSO9, (vi) net proceeds of $27.7 million from the sales of one CRE whole loan and one CRE asset held for sale, and (vii) proceeds of $21.4 million from our CRE securitizations that used principal paydowns to invest in CRE loan future funding commitments. These sources of liquidity, offset by the liquidation of XAN 2018-RSO6, paydowns on our CRE term warehouse facilities, elective paydowns on our senior secured financing facility, pay off of our 8.00% Convertible Senior Notes, margin calls received, net settlements on CMBS repurchase agreements, deployments in CRE debt investments, repurchases of common stock, distributions on our common and preferred stock and ongoing operating expenses, substantially resulted in the $29.4 million of unrestricted cash we held at December 31, 2020.

We utilize a variety of financing arrangements to finance certain assets. We generally utilize the following three types of financing arrangements:
1.
Senior Secured Financing Facility: Our senior secured financing facility allows us to borrow against loans that we own. During an initial revolving period, additional loans may be financed on the senior secured financing facility. After the revolving period, the senior secured financing facility transitions to a term period over the remaining life of the facility. We pay a fixed rate of interest on the senior secured financing facility as well as an unfunded commitment fee when the facility has borrowings below a certain threshold as a percentage of the total commitment.
2.
Term Warehouse Financing Facilities (CRE loans) and Short-Term Repurchase Agreements (CMBS): Term warehouse financing facilities and short-term repurchase agreements effectively allow us to borrow against loans and securities, respectively, that we own. Under these agreements, we transfer loans and securities to a counterparty and agree to purchase the same loans and securities from the counterparty at a price equal to the transfer price plus interest. The counterparty retains the sole discretion over both whether to purchase the loan or security from us and, subject to certain conditions, the collateral value of such loan or security for purposes of determining whether we are required to pay margin to the counterparty. Generally, if the lender determines (subject to certain conditions) that the value of the collateral in a repurchase transaction has decreased by more than a defined minimum amount, we would be required to repay any amounts borrowed in excess of the product of (i) the revised collateral or market value multiplied by (ii) the applicable advance rate. During the term of these agreements, we receive the principal and interest on the related loans and securities and pay interest to the counterparty.
3.
Securitizations: We seek non-recourse long-term financing from securitizations of our investments in CRE loans. The securitizations generally involve a senior portion of our loan but may involve the entire loan. Securitization generally involves transferring notes to a special purpose vehicle (or the issuing entity), which then issues one or more classes of non-recourse notes pursuant to the terms of an indenture. The notes are secured by the pool of assets. In exchange for the transfer of assets to the issuing entity, we receive cash proceeds from the sale of non-recourse notes. Securitizations of our portfolio investments might magnify our exposure to losses on those portfolio investments because the retained subordinate interest in any particular overall loan would be subordinate to the loan components sold and we would, therefore, absorb all losses sustained with respect to the overall loan before the owners of the senior notes experience any losses with respect to the loan in question.
As discussed in “Overview,” the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic produced material and previously unforeseeable liquidity shocks to global financial markets that resulted in substantial margin calls to us by our CMBS repurchase lenders and led to the ultimate disposition of our financed CMBS portfolio to satisfy our outstanding obligations with those lenders. In April 2020, the outstanding CMBS short-term repurchase agreement liability of $175.9 million was repaid in full. As such, we have no further exposure to losses related to CMBS repurchase agreements.
We were in compliance with all of our covenants at December 31, 2020 in accordance with the terms provided in agreements with our lenders that reduced our minimum equity requirements.
We are continuing to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on us, the borrowers underlying our commercial real estate-related loans (and their tenants), our financing sources, and the economy as a whole. Because the severity, magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic consequences are uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult to predict, the pandemic’s impact on our operations and liquidity remains uncertain and difficult to predict. Further discussion of the potential impacts on us from the COVID-19 pandemic is provided in the section entitled “Risk Factors-Impact of Current Economic Conditions” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

At December 31, 2020, we had a senior secured financing facility and term warehouse financing facilities as summarized below (in thousands, except amounts in footnotes):
(1)
Facility principal outstanding excludes deferred debt issuance costs of $4.0 million at December 31, 2020.
(2)
Facilities principal outstanding excludes accrued interest payable of $16,000 and deferred debt issuance costs and discounts of $1.3 million at December 31, 2020.
The following table summarizes the average principal outstanding on our senior secured financing facility, term warehouse financing facilities and short-term repurchase agreements during the three months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and the principal outstanding on our senior secured financing facility, term warehouse financing facilities and short-term repurchase agreements at December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands, except amounts in footnotes):
(1)
Excludes accrued interest payable on the senior secured financing facility collateralized by CRE loans of $75,000 and deferred debt issuance costs of $4.0 million at December 31, 2020.
(2)
Excludes accrued interest payable on term warehouse financing facilities collateralized by CRE loans of $16,000 and $810,000 and deferred debt issuance costs and discounts of $1.3 million and $2.7 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
(3)
Excludes accrued interest payable on repurchase agreements collateralized by CMBS of $470,000 at December 31, 2019.
The following table summarizes the maximum month-end principal outstanding on our senior secured financing facility, term warehouse financing facilities and short-term repurchase agreements during the periods presented (in thousands):
(1)
Increases in the maximum month-end outstanding principal balances for the periods presented resulted from the originations and acquisitions of CRE loans and CMBS.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, our principal sources of liquidity were proceeds of: (i) $863.5 million (net) from financing sourced from our CRE - term warehouse financing facilities and CMBS - short-term repurchase agreement proceeds, (ii) $123.4 million from net repayments on our CRE loan portfolio, (iii) $46.3 million from our CRE securitizations that used repaid principal to invest in CRE loan future funding commitments and (iv) $31.5 million from the close of XAN 2019-RSO7. These sources of liquidity, offset by our deployments in CRE debt investments, distributions on our common and preferred stock and operating expenses, substantially resulted in the $80.0 million of unrestricted cash we held at December 31, 2019.

Historically, we financed the acquisition of our investments through CDOs and securitizations that essentially match the maturity and repricing dates of these financing vehicles with the maturities and repricing dates of our investments. In the past, we have derived substantial operating cash from our equity investments in our CDOs and securitizations, which will cease if the CDOs and securitizations fail to meet certain tests. Through December 31, 2020, we did not experience difficulty in maintaining our existing CDO and securitization financing and passed all of the critical tests required by these financings.
The following table sets forth the distributions received by us and coverage test summaries for our active securitizations at the periods presented (in thousands, except amount in footnotes):
(1)
Overcollateralization cushion represents the amount by which the collateral held by the securitization issuer exceeds the minimum amount required.
(2)
The designated principal reinvestment period for XAN 2019-RSO7 and XAN 2020-RSO8 is the period in which principal repayments can be utilized to purchase loans held outside of the respective securitization that represent the funded commitments of existing collateral in the respective securitization that were not funded as of the date the respective securitization was closed. Additionally, the indenture for each securitization does not contain any interest coverage test provisions.
(3)
XAN 2020-RSO9 includes a future advances reserve account, which had a balance of $18.6 million at December 31, 2020, to fund commitments that were not funded as of the closing date. Additionally, the indenture does not contain any interest coverage test provisions.
The following table sets forth the distributions made by and liquidation details for our liquidated securitizations for the periods presented (in thousands):
(1)
The remaining assets at the liquidation date were distributed to us in exchange for our notes owned and preference shares in the respective securitization.
(2)
Whitney CLO I, Ltd. was substantially liquidated in September 2013.
(3)
Apidos CDO I, Ltd. was substantially liquidated in October 2014.
At February 28, 2021 our liquidity consisted of $37.2 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, $78.1 million of unlevered financeable CRE loans and $75.0 million of availability under the Oaktree and MassMutual Senior Unsecured Notes due 2027.
Our leverage ratio, defined as the ratio of borrowings to stockholders’ equity, may vary as a result of the various funding strategies we use. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, our leverage ratio under GAAP was 3.9 and 3.4 times, respectively. The leverage ratio increase through December 31, 2020, was primarily attributable to a net decrease in stockholder’s equity due to the disposition of our financed CMBS portfolio combined with increases in our CECL allowance for credit losses offset by a net decrease in borrowings outstanding.
Distributions
We did not pay distributions on our common shares during the year ended December 31, 2020 as we were focused on prudently retaining and managing sufficient excess liquidity in connection with the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As we continue to take steps necessary to stabilize our financial condition and capital position in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, our Board will establish a plan for the prudent resumption of the payment of common share distributions. We intend to continue to make regular quarterly distributions to holders of our preferred stock.
U.S. federal income tax law generally requires that a REIT distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income annually, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and that it pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it annually distributes less than 100% of its taxable income. Before we pay any dividend, whether for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise, we must first meet both our operating and debt service requirements on our repurchase agreements and other debt payable. If our cash available for distribution is less than our taxable income, we could be required to sell assets or borrow funds to make cash distributions, or we may make a portion of the required distribution in the form of a taxable stock distribution or distribution of debt securities.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments
(1)
Contractual commitments exclude $22.3 million and $23.0 million of estimated interest expense payable through maturity, in June 2036 and October 2036, respectively, on our trust preferred securities.
(2)
Contractual commitments exclude $10.6 million of interest expense payable through maturity, in August 2022, on our 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes.
(3)
Contractual commitments exclude $39.5 million of interest expense payable through maturity, in July 2027, on our Senior Unsecured Notes due 2027.
(4)
Contractual commitments exclude $75,000 of accrued interest payable at December 31, 2020 on our senior secured financing facility.
(5)
Contractual commitments include $16,000 of accrued interest payable at December 31, 2020 on our term warehouse financing facilities.
(6)
Unfunded commitments on our originated CRE whole loans generally fall into two categories: (i) pre-approved capital improvement projects and (ii) new or additional construction costs subject, in each case, to the borrower meeting specified criteria. Upon completion of the improvements or construction, we would receive additional interest income on the advanced amount. At December 31, 2020, we had unfunded commitments on 51 CRE whole loans and one CRE preferred equity investment. At December 31, 2020, XAN 2020-RSO9 includes a future advances reserve account of $18.6 million to fund unfunded commitments.
(7)
Base management fees presented are based on an estimate of base management fees payable to our Manager over the next 12 months. As of July 31, 2020, the minimum base management fee is $442,000 per month under the terms of the Management Agreement. Our Management Agreement also provides for an incentive compensation arrangement that is based on operating performance. The incentive compensation is not a fixed and determinable amount, and therefore it is not included in this table.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
General
At December 31, 2020, we did not maintain any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships that were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or contractually narrow or limited purposes, although we do have interests in unconsolidated entities not established for those purposes. Except as set forth below, at December 31, 2020, we had not guaranteed obligations of any unconsolidated entities or entered into any commitment or letter of intent to provide additional funding to any such entities.
Unfunded CRE Loan Commitments
In the ordinary course of business, we make commitments to borrowers whose loans are in our CRE loan portfolio to provide additional loan funding in the future. Disbursement of funds pursuant to these commitments is subject to the borrower meeting pre-specified criteria. These commitments are subject to the same underwriting requirements and ongoing portfolio maintenance as are the on-balance sheet financial investments that we hold. Since these commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Whole loans had $67.2 million and $98.0 million in unfunded loan commitments at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Preferred equity investments had $2.5 million and $3.0 million in unfunded investment commitments at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Guarantees and Indemnifications
In the ordinary course of business, we may provide guarantees and indemnifications that contingently obligate us to make payments to the guaranteed or indemnified party based on changes in the value of an asset, liability or equity security of the guaranteed or indemnified party. As such, we may be obligated to make payments to a guaranteed party based on another entity’s failure to perform or achieve specified performance criteria, or we may have an indirect guarantee of the indebtedness of others.
As part of our May 2017 sale of our equity interest in Pearlmark Mezz, we entered into an indemnification agreement whereby we indemnified the purchaser against realized losses of up to $4.3 million on one mezzanine loan until its final maturity date in 2020. As a result of the indemnified party’s partial sale of the mezzanine loan, our maximum exposure was reduced to $536,000 in 2019. In October 2020, the mezzanine loan paid off its balance to the indemnified party, resulting in the extinguishment of our liability. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded a reversal of our reserve for probable losses of $56,000 and $647,000, respectively. At December 31, 2019, we had a contingent liability, reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, of $56,000 outstanding as a reserve for probable losses on the indemnification.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared by management in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, and our financial results. We believe that certain of our policies are critical because they require us to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. The critical policies summarized below relate to valuation of investment securities, accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities, income taxes, allowance for credit losses and variable interest entities (“VIEs”). We have reviewed these accounting policies with our Board and believe that all of the decisions and assessments upon which our financial statements are based were reasonable at the time made based upon information available to us at the time.
Allowance for Credit Losses
We maintain an allowance for credit loss on our loans held for investment. CRE loans that are held for investment are carried at cost, net of unamortized acquisition premiums or discounts, loan fees and origination costs as applicable. Effective January 1, 2020, we determine our allowance for credit losses, consistent with GAAP, by measuring the CECL on the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis. We utilize a probability of default and loss given default methodology over a reasonable and supportable forecast period after which it reverts to its historical mean loss ratio, utilizing a blended approach sourced from its own historical losses and the market losses from an engaged third party’s database, to be applied for the remaining estimable period. The CECL model requires us to make significant judgements, including: (i) the selection of a reasonable and supportable forecast period, (ii) the selection of appropriate macroeconomic forecast scenarios, (iii) projections for the amounts and timing of future fundings of committed balances and prepayments on CRE investments, (iv) the determination of the risk characteristics in which to pool financial assets, and (v) the appropriate historical loss data to use in the model. Unfunded commitments are not considered in the CECL reserve if they are unconditionally cancellable by us.
We measure the loan portfolio’s credit losses by grouping loans based on similar risk characteristics under CECL, which is typically based on the loan’s collateral type. We regularly evaluate the risk characteristics of our loan portfolio to determine whether a different pooling methodology is more accurate. Further, if we determine that foreclosure of a loan’s collateral is probable or repayment of the loan is expected through sale or operation of the collateral and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, expected credit losses are measured as the difference between the current fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost of the loan. Fair value may be determined based on (i) the present value of estimated cash flows; (ii) the market price, if available; or (iii) the fair value of the collateral less estimated disposition costs.
While a loan exhibiting credit quality deterioration may remain on accrual status, the loan is placed on non-accrual status at such time as (i) management believes that scheduled debt service payments will not be met within the coming 12 months; (ii) the loan becomes 90 days past due; (iii) management determines the borrower is incapable of, or has ceased efforts toward, curing the cause of the credit deterioration; or (iv) the net realizable value of the loan’s underlying collateral approximates our carrying value for such loan. While on non-accrual status, we recognize interest income only when an actual payment is received if a credit analysis supports the borrower’s principal repayment capacity. When a loan is placed on non-accrual, previously accrued interest is reversed from interest income.
We utilize the contractual life of our loans to estimate the period over which we measure expected credit losses. Estimates for prepayments and extensions are incorporated into the inputs for our CECL model. Modifications to loan terms, such as a modification in connection with a TDR, where a concession is granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, may result in the extension of the loan’s life and an increase in the allowance for credit losses. In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) concurred with a joint statement of federal and state banking regulators that eased the requirements to classify a modification as a TDR if the modification was granted in connection with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The measurement of the impact of TDRs on the expected credit losses occurs when a TDR is reasonably expected. If the concession granted on a TDR can only be captured through a discounted cash flow analysis, then we will individually assess the loan for expected credit losses using the discounted cash flow method.
In order to calculate the historical mean loss ratio applied to the loan portfolio, we utilize historical losses from our full underwriting history, along with the market loss history of a selected population of loans from a third party’s database that are similar to our loan types, loan sizes, durations, interest rate structure and general LTV profiles. We may make adjustments to the historical loss history for qualitative or environmental factors if we believe there is evidence that the estimate for expected credit losses should be increased or decreased.
We record write-offs against the allowance for credit losses if we deem that all or a portion of a loan’s balance is uncollectible. If we receive cash in excess of some or all of the amounts we previously wrote off, we record a recovery to increase the allowance for credit losses.

As part of the evaluation of the loan portfolio, we assess the performance of each loan and assigns a risk rating based on the collective evaluation of several factors, including but not limited to: collateral performance relative to underwritten plan, time since origination, current implied and/or re-underwritten LTV ratios, risk inherent in the loan structure and exit plan. Loans are rated “1” through “5,” from less risk to greatest risk, in connection with this review.
Prior to the implementation of CECL, we calculated its allowance for credit losses through the calculation of general and specific reserves. The general reserve, established for loans not determined to be impaired individually, was based on our loan risk ratings. We recorded a general reserve equal to 1.5% of the aggregate face values of loans with a risk rating of “3,” plus 5.0% of the aggregate face values of loans with a risk rating of “4.” Loans with a risk rating of “5” were individually measured for impairment to be included in a specific reserve on a quarterly basis.
We considered a loan to be impaired if at least one of two conditions exists. The first condition was if, based on our evaluation as part of the loan risk rating process, management believed that a loss event had occurred that made it probable that we would be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The second condition was that the loan was deemed to be a TDR. These TDRs may not have had an associated specific credit loss allowance if the principal and interest amount was considered recoverable based on market conditions, appraisals of the underlying collateral, expected collateral performance and/or guarantees made by the borrowers.
When a loan was impaired under either of these two conditions, the allowance for credit losses was increased by the amount of the excess of the amortized cost basis of the loan over its fair value. When a loan, or a portion thereof, was considered uncollectible and pursuit of collection was not warranted, we recorded a charge-off or write-down of the loan against the allowance for credit losses.
Investment in Real Estate
Acquired investments in real estate assets are recorded initially at fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We allocate the purchase price of our acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on the relative fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
Investments in real estate are carried net of accumulated depreciation. We depreciate real property and furniture, fixtures, and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We amortize any acquired intangible assets, including but not limited to franchise agreement and customer list assets, using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets. We amortize the value allocated to lease right of use assets and related in-place lease liabilities, when determined to be operating leases, using the straight-line method over the remaining lease term. The value allocated to any associated above or below market lease intangible asset or liability is amortized to lease expense over the remaining lease term.
Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Costs related to the improvement of the real property are capitalized and depreciated over their useful lives.
We depreciate investments in real estate and amortize intangible assets over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:

Revenue Recognition
Interest income from our loan portfolio is recognized over the life of each loan using the effective interest method and is recorded on the accrual basis. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted into income using the effective yield method. If a loan with a premium or discount is prepaid, we immediately recognize the unamortized portion as a decrease or increase to interest income. In addition, we defer loan origination and extension fees and loan origination costs and recognize them over the life of the related loan against interest income using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective yield method. Income recognition is suspended for loans at the earlier of the date at which payments become 90 days past due or when, in our opinion, a full recovery of principal and income becomes doubtful. When the ultimate collectability of the principal is in doubt, all payments received are applied to principal under the cost recovery method. When the ultimate collectability of the principal is not in doubt, contractual interest is recorded as interest income when received, under the cash method, until an accrual is resumed when the loan becomes contractually current and performance is demonstrated to be resumed.
Variable Interest Entities
We consolidate entities that are VIEs where we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of such entities. Once it is determined that we hold a variable interest in a VIE, management performs a qualitative analysis to determine (i) if we have the power to direct the matters that most significantly impact the VIE’s financial performance; and (ii) if we have the obligation to absorb the losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive the benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. If our variable interest possesses both of these characteristics, we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and would be required to consolidate the VIE. This assessment must be done on an ongoing basis.
At December 31, 2020, we determined that we are the primary beneficiary of six VIEs that are consolidated.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Accounting Standards Adopted in 2020
In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance that changes how credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are measured at fair value through net income are determined. The new guidance replaced the incurred loss approach with a CECL model for instruments measured at amortized cost. For available-for-sale debt securities, the guidance requires recording allowances rather than reducing the carrying amount, as we were previously under the other-than-temporary impairment model. It also simplifies the accounting model for debt securities and loans with evidence of credit quality deterioration.
On January 1, 2020, we adopted the above-mentioned accounting guidance and recorded an initial CECL allowance of approximately $4.5 million, of which $3.0 million, or $0.29 per share, was recorded as a charge to retained earnings on such date. The estimated CECL reserve represented 0.25% of the aggregate outstanding principal balance of our $1.8 billion commercial loan portfolio at December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded an additional CECL reserve of $29.8 million for a total CECL reserve of $34.3 million, or 2.21% of the aggregate outstanding principal balance of our $1.5 billion commercial loan portfolio at December 31, 2020.
In August 2018, the FASB issued guidance to modify the fair value measurement disclosure requirements, including: disclosures on changes in unrealized gains and losses, the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements, the policy for timing of transfers between levels and the narrative description of measurement uncertainty. Adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Accounting Standards to be Adopted in Future Periods
In March 2020, the FASB issued guidance that provides optional expedients and exceptions to GAAP requirements for modifications on debt instruments, leases, derivatives and other contracts, related to the expected market transition from the LIBOR, and certain other floating-rate benchmark indices to alternative reference rates. The guidance generally considers contract modifications related to reference rate reform to be an event that does not require contract remeasurement at the modification date nor a reassessment of a previous accounting determination. The guidance is optional and may be elected over time, through December 31, 2022, as reference rate reform activities occur. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of this guidance.
In August 2020, the FASB issued guidance that removes certain separation models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock that require the separation into a debt component and an equity or derivative component. Consequently, a convertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost, as long as no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives and the convertible instrument are not issued with substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital. By removing those separation models, the interest rate of convertible debt instruments typically will be closer to the coupon interest rate. The guidance also revises the derivative scope exception for contracts in an entity’s own equity and improves the consistency of EPS calculations. The guidance is effective for larger public business entities’ annual periods, and interim periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2021 and for smaller reporting entities after December 15, 2023. Early application is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of this guidance.

Inflation
Virtually all of our assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive in nature. As a result, interest rates and other factors influence our performance far more than does inflation. Changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and our distributions are determined by our Board based primarily on our maintaining our REIT qualification; in each case, our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost and/or fair market value without considering inflation.
