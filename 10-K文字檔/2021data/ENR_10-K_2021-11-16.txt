Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion is a summary of the key factors management considers necessary in reviewing the Company's results of operations, operating segment results, and liquidity and capital resources. Statements in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) that are not historical may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
You should read the following MD&A in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and corresponding notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This MD&A contains forward-looking statements. The matters discussed in these forward-looking statements are subject to risk, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in the forward-looking statements. Please see Part I. Item 1A “Risk Factors” above and “Forward-Looking Statements” for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements.
All amounts discussed are in millions of U.S. dollars, unless otherwise indicated.
Forward-Looking Statements
This document contains both historical and forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts but instead reflect our expectations, estimates or projections concerning future results or events, including, without limitation, the future sales, gross margins, costs, earnings, cash flows, tax rates and performance of the Company. These statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking words or phrases such as "believe," "expect," "expectation," "anticipate," "may," "could," "intend," "belief," "estimate," "plan," "target," "predict," "likely," "should," "forecast," "outlook," or other similar words or phrases. These statements are not guarantees of performance and are inherently subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated by those statements. We cannot assure you that any of our expectations, estimates or projections will be achieved. The forward-looking statements included in this document are only made as of the date of this document and we disclaim any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. All forward-looking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their inherent uncertainty. Numerous factors could cause our actual results and events to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements including, but not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors," as updated from time to time in the Company’s SEC filings.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users with additional meaningful comparisons to the corresponding historical or future period. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that are not reflective of the Company's on-going operating performance, such as acquisition and integration costs and related items, an acquisition earn out, loss on extinguishment of debt, settlement loss on pension plan termination and the one-time impact of Tax structuring, Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act and the December 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017 tax reform). In addition, these measures help investors to analyze year over year comparability when excluding currency fluctuations, acquisition activity as well as other company initiatives that are not on-going. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are an enhancement to assist investors in understanding our business and in performing analysis consistent with financial models developed by research analysts. Investors should consider non-GAAP measures in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, the comparable GAAP measures. In addition, these non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items being adjusted.
We provide the following non-GAAP measures and calculations, as well as the corresponding reconciliation to the closest GAAP measure:
Segment Profit. This amount represents the operations of our two reportable segments including allocations for shared support functions. General corporate and other expenses, global marketing expenses, R&D expenses, amortization expense, interest expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, other items, net, charges related to acquisition and integration, acquisition earn out and settlement loss on pension plan termination have all been excluded from segment profit.
Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations and Adjusted Diluted net earnings per common share - continuing operations (EPS). These measures exclude the impact of the costs related to acquisition and integration, an acquisition earn out, loss on extinguishment of debt, the settlement loss on pension plan terminations, and the one-time impact of tax structuring, the CARES Act and 2017 tax reform.
Non-GAAP Tax Rate. This is the tax rate when excluding the after tax impact of acquisition and integration, acquisition earn out, the loss on extinguishment of debt and the settlement loss on pension plan terminations calculated utilizing the statutory rate for where the impact was incurred, as well as the one-time impact of the tax structuring, CARES Act and 2017 tax reform.
Organic. This is the non-GAAP financial measurement of the change in revenue or segment profit that excludes or otherwise adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, change in Argentina operations and the impact of currency from the changes in foreign currency exchange rates as defined below:
Impact of acquisitions. Energizer completed two acquisitions in the first fiscal quarter of 2021, a battery plant in Indonesia on October 1, 2020 and a formulation company in the United States on December 1, 2020 (Formulations Acquisition), the Auto Care Acquisition on January 28, 2019, the Battery Acquisition on January 2, 2019, and the Nu Finish Acquisition on July 2, 2018. These adjustments include the impact each acquisition's on-going operations contributed to each respective income statement caption for the first year's operations directly after the acquisition date. This does not include the impact of acquisition and integration costs or the one-time inventory fair value step up costs associated with the acquisitions.
Change in Argentina Operations. The Company is presenting separately all changes in sales and segment profit from our Argentina affiliate due to the designation of the economy as highly inflationary as of July 1, 2018.
Impact of currency. The Company evaluates the operating performance of our Company on a currency neutral basis. The impact of currency is the difference between the value of current year foreign operations at the current period ending USD exchange rate, compared to the value of the current year foreign operations at the prior period ending USD exchange rate.
Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin and adjusted Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A) as a percent of sales. Details for adjusted gross margin and adjusted SG&A as a percent of sales are also supplemental non-GAAP measure disclosures. These measures exclude the impact of costs related to acquisition and integration, acquisition earn outs and inventory step up from purchase accounting.
Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a global pandemic. The COVID-19 health crisis poses significant and widespread risks to the Company’s business as well as to the business environment and the markets in which the Company operates.
During these challenging times, the Company is operating with two enduring principles - ensuring the health and safety of our colleagues and business continuity. We are following the guidelines issued by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization and have instituted work from home for our office locations. We have also instituted additional measures at our production facilities, including temperature monitoring, enhanced facility cleaning, visual cues to aid in social distancing, and staggered shifts to minimize the number of colleagues on-site at any given time. We encourage colleagues to stay home if they or their family members are ill.
During natural disasters and other crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, our battery products are needed not only by consumers who have purchased devices for working at home and entertaining their families, but as well as healthcare professionals and others who are directly combatting COVID-19, including doctors, nurses and first responders. This has been evident in the increased demand for our battery products in the U.S. across nearly all retail channels. Energizer provides batteries that power medical devices, including touchless thermometers, blood pressure, heart and fall monitors and pulse oximeters, and other products that are critical during the COVID-19 outbreak. Energizer’s batteries also power devices and equipment that enable consumers to work, study as well as for entertainment at home, such as computer accessories, smart doorbells, and security cameras, toys, games, smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors.
Initially, auto care products were negatively impacted by COVID-19 due to shelter in place orders that negatively impacted auto travel. However, as countries and states began to reopen, the use of automobiles increased as consumers avoided public transportation, including turning to car travel versus air for vacations. During this time, consumers turned their focus to Do It Yourself versus Do It for Me with strong demand for wipes and cleaning products as the year progressed. If countries return to shelter-in-place orders, work and travel restrictions or other similar measures in order to contain the virus, this could have a negative impact on our auto care products.
Our core batteries and auto care businesses had strong organic net sales growth in fiscal 2021. However, we also experience higher operating costs due to the global supply chain constraints, and higher input costs, including labor shortages and higher transportation and commodity costs. Higher tariffs have also been impacting our margins. Although our direct incremental costs of COVID-19 have gone down from last year, our operating costs are continuing to rise in the current operating environment. In order to serve our customers, we have taken a proactive approach to invest in incremental safety stock given the continued volatility of the global supply network-including uncertainty around product sourcing, transportation challenges and labor availability.
While the full impact of COVID-19 is uncertain as new variations continue to develop, we believe we have multiple options to further mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and preserve our financial flexibility in light of current uncertainty in the global markets, including the deferral or reduction of capital expenditures and reduction or delay of overhead expenses and other expenditures. Such delays could slow future growth or impact our business plan. The full impact of COVID-19 on our financial and operating performance will depend significantly on the duration and severity of the outbreak, the actions taken to contain or mitigate its impact, including the administration of approved vaccines, disruption to our global supply chain (including the ability of suppliers to keep pace with any demand increases), and the pace with which customers and consumers return to more normalized purchasing behavior, among others factors beyond our knowledge or control. See the section entitled “Risk Factors” in this Report for further considerations.
Fiscal Year 2021 Acquisitions
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with FDK Corporation to acquire its subsidiary PT FDK Indonesia, a battery manufacturing facility (FDK Acquisition). On October 1, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition for a contractual purchase price of $18.2. After contractual and working capital adjustments, the Company paid cash of $16.9 and a working capital adjustment of $0.7 during fiscal 2021. The acquisition of the FDK Indonesia facility increased the Company's alkaline battery production capacity and allows us to avoid future planned capital expenditures.
On December 1, 2020 the Company acquired a North Carolina-based company that specializes in developing formulations for cleaning tasks. Their products are both sold to customers directly and licensed to manufacturers. This acquisition is expected to bring significant innovation capabilities in formulations to our organization. The purchase price and total cash paid for the acquisition was $51.2. Subsequent to year-end, the working capital settlement was finalized, reducing the purchase price by $0.4 that will be paid to Energizer and the Company will finalize the purchase price accounting with this adjustment in the first fiscal quarter of 2022.
For fiscal year 2021, the incremental revenues and segment profit from these acquisitions was $27.0 and $2.5, respectively.
Battery Acquisition
On January 2, 2019, the Company acquired Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc.'s (Spectrum) global battery, lighting and portable power business (Battery Acquisition) including the brands Rayovac® and Varta® (Acquired Battery Business). The acquisition expanded our battery portfolio globally with the addition of a strong value brand. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, the revenue and segment profit from the Acquired Battery Business was $125.5 and $27.9, respectively, relating to the three months of activity for which they were not owned in the comparable periods in fiscal 2019. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, the revenue and segment profit from the Acquired Battery Business was $338.9 and $62.7, respectively.
On January 2, 2020, the Company sold the Varta® consumer battery business in the Europe, Middle East and Africa regions, including manufacturing and distribution facilities in Germany (Varta Divestiture or Divestment Business) to VARTA Aktiengesellschaft (VARTA AG). These operations were included as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
Auto Care Acquisition
On January 28, 2019, the Company acquired Spectrum’s global auto care business, including Armor All®, STP®, and A/C PRO® brands (Auto Care Acquisition). For the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, the revenue and segment profit associated with the Auto Care Acquisition was $85.1 and $17.1, respectively, relating to the four months of activity for which they were not owned in the comparable periods in fiscal 2019. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, the revenue and segment profit associated with the Auto Care Acquisition was $315.8 and $76.8, respectively.
Nu Finish Acquisition
On July 2, 2018, the Company acquired all of the assets of Reed-Union Corporation's automotive appearance business, including Nu Finish Car Polish® and Scratch Doctor® brands (Nu Finish Acquisition). The revenue in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 associated with the Nu Finish acquisition was $5.9 and segment profit was $2.0, respectively.
Acquisition and Integration Costs
The Company incurred pre-tax acquisition and integration costs related to the above acquisitions of $68.9, $68.0 and $188.4 in the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
Pre-tax costs recorded in Costs of products sold were $33.7 and $32.0 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which primarily related to the integration restructuring costs of $31.9 and $29.3 as discussed in Note 6, Restructuring. Pre-tax costs recorded in Costs of products sold for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019 were $58.7, which primarily related to the inventory fair value adjustment of $36.2 and integration restructuring costs of $12.1.
Pre-tax acquisition and integration costs recorded in SG&A were $40.0, $38.8 and $82.3 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In fiscal 2021 and 2020 these expenses primarily related to costs of integrating the information technology systems of the Battery and Auto Care Acquisition businesses, consulting fees for the 2020 restructuring program, and success incentives. In fiscal 2019 these expenses primarily related to acquisition success fees and legal, consulting and advisory fees to assist with obtaining regulatory approval around the globe and to plan for the closing and integration of the Battery Acquisition and Auto Care Acquisition.
For the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 the Company recorded $1.1, $1.3 and $1.1 in research and development, respectively.
Also included in the pre-tax acquisition costs for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019 was $65.6 of interest expense, including ticking fees, related to the escrowed debt for the Battery Acquisition and the financing fees incurred related to amending and issuing the debt for the Battery and Auto Care Acquisitions.
Included in Other items, net was pre-tax income of $5.9, $4.1, and $19.3 in the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The pre-tax income recorded in fiscal 2021 was primarily driven by a gain on the sale of assets of $3.3, which was part of the 2019 restructuring program discussed in Note 6.
The pre-tax income recorded in fiscal 2020 was primarily driven by pre-acquisition insurance proceeds of $4.9, a $1.0 gain on the sale of assets and $0.9 of transition services income, offset by a $2.2 loss related to the hedge contract on the proceeds from the Varta Divestiture and $0.5 of other items.
The pre-tax income of $19.3 recorded in fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by the escrowed debt funds held in restricted cash prior to the closing of the Battery Acquisition. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $9.0 related to the favorable movement in the escrowed USD restricted cash held in our European Euro functional entity. The Company also recorded interest income of $5.8 earned on the Restricted cash funds held in escrow associated with the Battery Acquisition. The Company recorded a gain of $4.6 related to the hedge contract on the expected proceeds from the anticipated Varta Divestiture and recorded income on transition services agreements of $1.4 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019. These income items were offset by $1.5 of expense to settle hedge contracts of the acquired business.
Restructuring Costs
In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2019, the Company began implementing restructuring related integration plans for our manufacturing and distribution networks. These plans include the closure and combination of distribution and manufacturing facilities in order to reduce complexity and realize greater efficiencies in our manufacturing, packaging and distribution processes. All activities within this plan are expected to be substantially complete by December 31, 2021.
In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2020, the Company initiated a new restructuring program with a primary focus on reorganizing our global end-to-end supply chain network and ensuring accountability by category. This program includes streamlining the Company’s end-to-end supply chain model to enable rapid response to category specific demands and enhancing our ability to better serve our customers. Planning and execution of this program began in fiscal year 2021, with completion of activities by December 31, 2021.
The total pre-tax expense related to these restructuring plans for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $36.8, $30.3, and $12.1, respectively. These consisted of charges for employee severance, retention, related benefit costs, accelerated depreciation, asset write-offs, relocation, environmental investigatory and mitigation costs, consulting costs and other exit costs, partially offset by a gain on sale of fixed assets. The costs were reflected in Cost of products sold, Selling, general and administrative expense, Research and development, and Other items, net on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. The restructuring costs for fiscal year 2021 were included within the Americas and International segments in the amount of $34.7 and $2.1, respectively. The restructuring costs for fiscal year 2020 were included within the Americas and International segments in the amount of $27.5 and $2.8, respectively. The restructuring costs for fiscal year 2019, were incurred within the Americas and International segments in the amount of $6.0 and $6.1, respectively.
Total pre-tax charges relating to the 2019 restructuring program since inception were $61.2. We expect to incur additional severance and related benefit costs and other exit-related costs associated with these plans of approximately $6 through the end of calendar 2021. Total pre-tax charges relating to the 2020 restructuring program since inception are $18.0. We expect to incur an additional approximately $2 in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.
These programs are expected to generate approximately $55 to $60 of total cost savings annually by the end of fiscal 2022, primarily within Cost of products sold. The Company has already begun realizing cost savings from the 2019 restructuring program (approximately $34 program to date), and began realizing cost savings from the 2020 restructuring program in fiscal 2021 (approximately $2.6 program to date). The Company believes it is on track to achieve the planned program savings.

Financial Results
Net earnings from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 was $160.9, or $2.11 per diluted common share, compared to $46.8, or $0.44 per diluted common share, and $64.7, or $0.78 per diluted common share, for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Net earnings from continuing operations and diluted net earnings from continuing operations per common share for the time periods presented were impacted by certain items related to acquisition and integration costs, an acquisition earn out, loss on extinguishment of debt, settlement loss on pension plan termination, and the one-time impact of the Tax structuring, CARES Act and 2017 tax reform as described in the tables below. The impact of these items on reported net earnings from continuing operations and reported diluted net earnings from continuing operations per common share are provided below as a reconciliation to arrive at respective non-GAAP measures. See disclosure under Non-GAAP Financial Measures above.
(1) Acquisition and integration costs were included in the following lines in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Comprehensive Income:
(2) This represents the estimated earn out achieved through September 30, 2021 under the incentive agreements entered into with the Formulations Acquisition and is recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Comprehensive Income.
(3) Represents the actuarial losses that were previously recorded to Other comprehensive loss, and then recognized to Other items, net upon the termination of the Ireland pension plan in 2019.
(4) Represents the impact of a reduction to deferred tax liabilities due to tax structuring activities.
(5) The effective tax rate for the Adjusted - Non-GAAP Net earnings from continuing operations and Diluted net earnings from continuing operations per common share was 22.6%, 23.3% and 18.5% for the years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as calculated utilizing the statutory rate for where the costs were incurred.
(6) For the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, the conversion of the mandatory convertible preferred stock is not dilutive and the mandatory preferred stock dividends are included in the adjusted dilution calculation. For the twelve month ended September 30, 2019 calculation, the Adjusted Weighted average shares of common stock - Diluted assumes conversion of the preferred shares as those results are more dilutive. The shares have been adjusted for the 4.7 million share conversion and the preferred dividend has been excluded from the net earnings.
Operating Results
Net Sales
Net sales for the year ended September 30, 2021 increased 10.1%. The increase was driven by the increase in organic sales of $200.5, or 7.3%, the favorable impact of currency of $42.4, or 1.6%, the impact of the FY21 Acquisitions which added $27.0, or 1.0% and favorable change in Argentina's operations of $6.8, or 0.2%.
Organic net sales increased 7.3% primarily due to:
•New distribution in both segments and across all categories, contributed approximately 3.9% of the increase;
•Increased year over year global demand contributed approximately 2.6%, driven by higher battery sales earlier in the fiscal year and increased auto care sales throughout the fiscal year; and
•Favorable pricing contributed approximately 0.8% to the organic increase.
Net sales for the year ended September 30, 2020 increased 10.0%. The increase was driven by the impact of the
acquisitions which added $210.6, or 8.4%, the increase in organic sales of $61.4, or 2.5%, and favorable change in Argentina's
operations of $1.6, or 0.1%. These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency of $23.3, or 1.0%.
Organic net sales increased 2.5% primarily due to:
•Distribution gains contributed 2.7% of the increase;
•Favorable carryover impact of the fiscal 2019 price increases, together with the net COVID-19 pandemic impact driven by North America battery, contributed 1.0% of the increase; and
•Lower replenishment volume early in the year, and the year-over-year impact of lower storm activity partially offset the increases.
For further discussion regarding net sales in each of our geographic segments, including a summary of reported versus organic changes, please see the section titled “Segment Results” provided below.
Gross Profit
Gross profit dollars were $1,161.4 in fiscal 2021 versus $1,081.9 in fiscal 2020. Excluding the current and prior year acquisition and integration costs of $33.7 and $32.0, respectively, gross profit dollars were $1,195.1 in fiscal 2021 versus $1,113.9 in fiscal 2020. The increase in gross profit dollars was due to the organic revenue growth discussed above, impact of FY21 acquisitions and approximately $50 of synergies achieved during the year, partially offset by the higher input costs, including labor, commodities, tariffs and transportation costs, consistent with ongoing inflationary trends.
Gross margin as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2021 was 38.4% versus 39.4% in the prior year. Excluding the current and prior year acquisition and integration costs, gross margin was 39.6%, down 100 basis points from prior year. The decrease was driven by the higher product input cost impacts (280 basis points), unfavorable mix (60 basis points), lower margin rate profile of the FY21 acquisitions (20 basis points), partially offset by synergy realization (180 basis points), a net reduction in incremental COVID-19 costs over prior year (60 basis points) and favorable currency (20 basis points).
Gross profit dollars were $1,081.9 in fiscal 2020 versus $1,003.8 in fiscal 2019. Excluding the current and prior year
acquisition and integration costs of $32.0 and $22.5, respectively, and the fiscal year 2019 inventory step up resulting from purchase accounting of $36.2, gross profit dollars were $1,113.9 in fiscal 2020 versus $1,062.5 in fiscal 2019. The increase in gross profit dollars was due to the impact of our acquisitions and synergies achieved during the year, as well as the increase in net sales mentioned earlier, partially offset by incremental COVID-19 costs and unfavorable movement in foreign currencies and tariffs.
Gross margin as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2020 was 39.4% versus 40.2% in the prior year. Excluding the current
and prior year acquisition and integration costs and prior year inventory step up resulting from purchase accounting, gross
margin was 40.6%, down 200 basis points from prior year. The decrease was driven by the lower margin rate profile of the
Battery and Auto Care Acquisitions, which accounted for 80 basis points, unfavorable movement in foreign currencies and tariffs (60 basis points) and a shift in market, customer and product mix as well as $29 of incremental costs to serve, both of which were driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and decreased margin by 190 basis points. Partially offsetting these impacts was the realization of synergies, which contributed 130 basis points.
Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A)
SG&A expenses were $487.2 in fiscal 2021, or 16.1% of net sales as compared to $483.3, or 17.6% of net sales for fiscal 2020 and $515.7, or 20.7% of net sales for fiscal 2019. Included in SG&A in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 were acquisition and integration costs of $40.0, $38.8 and $82.3, respectively. Fiscal 2021 also included an acquisition earn out of $3.4 related to the Formulations Acquisition. Excluding the impacts of these items, SG&A as a percent of net sales was 14.7% in fiscal 2021 as compared to 16.2% in fiscal 2020 and 17.4% in fiscal 2019.
In fiscal 2021, SG&A excluding acquisition and integration costs was $443.8 compared to fiscal 2020 of $444.5. The decrease, as a percent of Net sales, was driven by synergy realization and higher net sales while SG&A expense remained consistent with prior year.
In fiscal 2020, SG&A excluding acquisition and integration costs was $444.5 compared to fiscal 2019 of $433.4. The changes were due to incremental SG&A of approximately $26 due to the Battery and Auto Care Acquisitions partially offset by synergy realization and reduced spending.
Advertising and Sales Promotion (A&P)
A&P was $162.1 in fiscal 2021, up $15.0 as compared to fiscal 2020. A&P as a percent of net sales was 5.4%, 5.4% and 5.1% in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in absolute dollars in the current year was due to planned incremental investment in our product portfolio as we continue to invest in support of our brands and innovation.
A&P was 5.4% of sales for fiscal 2020, an increase of 30 basis points, or $19.8 as compared to fiscal 2019. The increase over prior year is driven by incremental spending of $3.5 due to the Battery and Auto Care Acquisitions, which was primarily for product and packaging innovation and promotional support for our auto care brands, in addition to planned incremental investment in our branded product portfolio.
Research and Development
R&D expense was $34.5 in fiscal 2021, $35.4 in fiscal 2020, $32.8 in fiscal 2019. As a percent of net sales, R&D expense was consistent as a percentage of sales at 1.1% in fiscal 2021, 1.3% in fiscal 2020, and 1.3% in fiscal 2019.
Amortization Expense
Amortization expense for fiscal 2021 was $61.2 compared to $56.5 in fiscal 2020 and $43.2 in fiscal 2019. The fiscal 2021 results included the full year of amortization on the Custom Accessories Europe (CAE) acquisition, as well as amortization for the Formulations Acquisition, discussed in Note 4. The fiscal 2020 results included the full year of amortization on the Acquired Battery and Auto Care businesses, as well as a partial year of amortization for the CAE acquisition, discussed in Note 4.
Interest expense
Interest expense for fiscal 2021 was $161.8, as compared to fiscal 2020 expense of $195.0 and $226.0 in fiscal 2019. The Company took advantage of favorable debt markets in fiscal 2021 and 2020 and refinanced its long-term debt resulting in a decline of interest expense of $33.2 in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020.
Interest expense for fiscal 2019 included $65.6 for ticking and debt commitment fees related to the Battery and Auto Care acquisitions. Excluding the fiscal 2019 acquisition costs of $65.6, fiscal 2020 interest expense increased $34.6 attributable to higher debt associated with the acquisitions, which was outstanding the full fiscal year 2020.
Loss on extinguishment of debt
The Loss on extinguishment of debt was $103.3 for fiscal year 2021 and relates to the Company's refinancing of its €650.0 Senior Notes due in 2026 in June 2021, the redemption of the $600.0 Senior Notes due in 2027 in January 2021 and the term loan refinancing in December 2020. The Company also amended certain covenants in its credit agreement, which created additional capacity and flexibility.
The Loss on the extinguishment of debt was $94.9 for fiscal year 2020 and relates to the Company's July 2020 redemption of its $600.0 Senior Notes due in 2025 and the redemption of the $750.0 Senior Notes due in 2026, which were redeemed subsequent to year-end on October 16, 2020. The loss also includes the write off of deferred financing fees related to the term loan refinancing in December 2019.
Other Items, Net
Other items, net was income of $2.9, expense of $2.0 and income of $14.3 in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and is summarized below:
(1) Represents the interest income earned on the restricted cash held for the Battery Acquisition.
(2) Represents the actuarial losses that were previously recorded to Other comprehensive income, and then recognized to Other items, net upon the termination of the Ireland pension plan in 2019.
(3) The loss for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 related to the hedge contract on the proceeds from the Varta Divestiture. The gain for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, includes $9.0 related to currency movement in the escrowed USD funds held in our European Euro functional currency entity and $4.6 related to the gain on our hedge contract for the expected proceeds from the anticipated sale of the Divestment Business.
(4) The pre-acquisition insurance proceeds are related to assets from the Battery Acquisition that were damaged after signing the acquisition agreement, but prior to closing on the acquisition.
(5) Settlement of acquired business hedging contracts that were terminated upon the Company's request at the acquisition date.
Income Taxes
For fiscal 2021, the effective tax rate was a benefit of 4.3%. The current year rate was favorably impacted by tax structuring resulting in a reduction to a deferred tax liability and the favorable tax impact resulting from the refinancing of the €650.0 Senior Notes due in 2026 in June 2021. Excluding the impact of our non-GAAP adjustments, the year to date adjusted effective tax rate was 22.6% as compared to 23.3% in the prior year. The decrease in the rate versus prior year is due to the favorable return to provision adjustments and decreases in certain limited expenses.
For fiscal 2020, the effective tax rate was 30.9%. The current year rate includes costs related to acquisition and integration in addition to the unfavorable impact of $1.8 for the CARES Act, which was signed into law on March 27, 2020 and provides, among other things, increased interest deduction limitations to companies which can decrease overall cash taxes paid. Excluding the impact of these non-GAAP adjustments, the year to date adjusted effective tax rate was 23.3% as compared to 18.5% in the prior year. The increase in the rate versus prior year is due to the country mix of earnings which drove a higher foreign tax rate as well as the expiration of certain tax holidays in foreign jurisdictions.
For fiscal 2019, the effective tax rate was 11.5%. The current year rate was favorably impacted by lower overall foreign tax rates and a return to provision benefit slightly offset by disallowed transaction costs. Excluding the impact of all of our non-GAAP adjustments, the adjusted effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 18.5% as compared to 23.1% in the prior year. The decrease in the rate is driven primarily by the new 21% statutory U.S. rate that is now effective for all of fiscal year 2019
compared to the statutory rate of 24.5% in fiscal year 2018 as well as more favorable return to provision adjustments in the current fiscal year.
Energizer’s effective tax rate is highly sensitive to the mix of countries from which earnings or losses are derived. Declines in earnings in lower tax rate countries, earnings increases in higher tax rate countries, repatriation of foreign earnings or foreign operating losses in the future could increase future tax rates. In addition, the enactment of legislation implementing changes in the U.S. on the taxation of international business activities or the adoption of other U.S. tax reform could impact our effective tax rate in the future.
Argentina Hyperinflation
Effective July 1, 2018, the financial statements for our Argentina subsidiary are consolidated under the rules governing the translation of financial information in a highly inflationary economy. Under U.S. GAAP, an economy is considered highly inflationary if the cumulative inflation rate for a three year period meets or exceeds 100 percent. The Argentina economy exceeded the three year cumulative inflation rate of 100 percent as of June 2018. If a subsidiary is considered to be in a highly inflationary economy, the financial statements of the subsidiary must be remeasured into the Company’s reporting currency (U.S. dollar) and future exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities are reflected in current earnings, rather than exclusively in the equity section of the balance sheet, until such time as the economy is no longer considered highly inflationary. It is difficult to determine what continuing impact the use of highly inflationary accounting for Argentina may have on our consolidated financial statements as such impact is dependent upon movements in the applicable exchange rates between the local currency and the U.S. dollar and the amount of monetary assets and liabilities included in our affiliates balance sheet.
Segment Results
Operations for Energizer are managed via two major geographic reportable segments: Americas and International. Segment performance is evaluated based on segment operating profit, exclusive of general corporate expenses, share-based compensation costs, acquisition and integration activities, acquisition earn outs, amortization costs, business realignment activities, research & development costs, settlement loss on pension plan termination, and other items determined to be corporate in nature. Financial items, such as interest income and expense and the loss on extinguishment of debt, are managed on a global basis at the corporate level. The exclusion of substantially all acquisition, integration, restructuring and realignment costs from segment results reflects management’s view on how it evaluates segment performance.
Energizer’s operating model includes a combination of standalone and shared business functions between the geographic segments, varying by country and region of the world. Shared functions include IT and finance shared service costs. Energizer applies a fully allocated cost basis, in which shared business functions are allocated between segments. Such allocations are estimates, and do not represent the costs of such services if performed on a standalone basis.
Total net sales for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 increased 10.1%, including organic sales increase of $200.5, or 7.3%, sales related to the FY21 acquisitions of $27.0, or 1.0%, a $6.8 increase from our Argentina operations, which were deemed to be highly inflationary, and favorable impact of currency of $42.4, or 1.6%. Segment sales results for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 are as follows:
•Americas net sales improved 9.3% versus the prior fiscal year, including the impact of the FY21 acquisitions which increased net sales by 1.0%, a 0.3% increase due to our Argentina operations, and a favorable currency impact on sales of 0.1%. Excluding the impact of Argentina, currency movement and the acquisitions, organic net sales increased 7.9% driven by distribution gains in both the auto care and battery categories in North America and Latin America as well as strong auto replenishment.
•International net sales improved 12.0% versus the prior fiscal year, which included an increase of 1.0% from the impact of the FY21 acquisitions and favorable foreign currency movements of 5.2%. Excluding the impacts of the acquisitions and foreign currency movements, organic net sales grew 5.8% driven by increased distribution gains in both auto care and battery categories and strong replenishment due to elevated COVID-19 demand levels.
Total net sales for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 increased 10.0%, including organic sales
increase of $61.4, or 2.5%, sales related to the Battery and Auto Care acquisitions of $210.6, or 8.4% and a $1.6 increase from our Argentina operations, which were deemed to be highly inflationary. These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency of $23.3, or 1.0%. Segment sales results for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 are as follows:
• Americas net sales improved 13.6% versus the prior fiscal year, including the impact of the acquisitions which increased net sales by 10.5%, a 0.1% increase due to our Argentina operations, and an unfavorable currency impact on sales of 1.0%. Excluding the impact of Argentina, currency movement and the acquisitions, organic net sales increased 4.0% driven by distribution gains, favorable carryover impact of the fiscal 2019 price increases and the beneficial net impacts of COVID-19. These increases were partially offset by lower replenishment volume early in the year and the year-over-year impact of lower storm activity.
• International net sales improved 1.8% versus the prior fiscal year, which included an increase of 3.9% from the impact of the acquisitions and unfavorable foreign currency movements of 1.0%. Excluding the impacts of the acquisitions and foreign currency movements, organic net sales declined 1.1% as the impact of COVID-19, particularly on our developing and distributor markets, more than offset the positive impact from distribution gains.
Refer to Note 10, Segments, in the Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation from segment profit
to earnings before income taxes.
Total segment profit in fiscal 2021 was $727.1, an increase of 11.1% versus the prior fiscal year, driven by an increase of $2.5, or 0.4% from the impact of FY21 acquisitions, organic segment profit improvement of 7.7%, favorable movement in foreign currency of $14.1, or 2.1% and $5.8, or 0.9%, of favorable changes in Argentina operations. Segment operating profit results for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 are as follows:
•Americas segment profit was $563.8, an increase of $65.3, or 13.1%, versus the prior fiscal year inclusive of the $2.3 increase due to the FY21 acquisitions and $5.8 of favorable changes in Argentina operations, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency movements of $4.1. Excluding the impact of currency movements, the acquisitions, and changes in Argentina operations, segment profit increased $61.3, or 12.3%. The organic increase was driven by top-line growth and realized synergies resulting in decreased SG&A. This was partially offset by higher operating costs, which unfavorably impacted gross margin as well as planned higher A&P spending.
•International segment profit was $163.3, an increase of $7.5, or 4.8%, versus the prior fiscal year inclusive of the positive impact of the FY21 acquisitions of $0.2 and the favorable $18.2 impact of currency movements. Excluding the impact of the acquisitions and currency movements, segment profit decreased $10.9, or 7.0%. The organic decline was driven by increased input costs and an unfavorable mix shift to our auto care products, which negatively impacted gross margin and offset the organic revenue growth. The segment profit was further impacted by higher overhead spending and planned higher A&P spending in the period.
Total segment profit in fiscal 2020 was $654.3, an increase of 3.6% versus the prior fiscal year, driven by an increase of $45.0, or 7.1% from the acquisitions. This increase was partially offset by organic segment profit decline of 1.2%, unfavorable movement in foreign currency of $14.0, or 2.2% and by $0.6, or 0.1%, of unfavorable changes in Argentina operations. Segment operating profit results for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 are as follows:
•Americas segment profit was $498.5, an increase of $41.9, or 9.2%, versus the prior fiscal year inclusive of the $37.6 increase due to the acquisitions. This increase was partially offset by $0.6 of unfavorable changes in Argentina operations and unfavorable foreign currency movements of $9.9. Excluding the impact of currency movements, the acquisitions, and changes in Argentina operations, segment profit increased $14.8, or 3.2%. The increase was driven by the net sales increase and realized synergies. These increases were partially offset by higher planned incremental A&P investment and incremental costs related to COVID-19, which impacted gross margin.
•International segment profit was $155.8, a decrease of $19.1, or 10.9%, versus the prior fiscal year inclusive of the positive impact of the acquisitions of $7.4 as well as the unfavorable $4.1 impact of currency movements. Excluding the impact of the acquisitions and currency movements, segment profit decreased $22.4, or 12.8%, as the impact of the top-line organic decline was compounded by incremental costs related to Covid-19 costs and increased A&P investment, primarily in our modern markets.
For fiscal 2021, general corporate expenses were $96.0, a decrease of $7.8 compared to fiscal 2020 expense of $103.8. The decrease was driven by synergy realization, a reduction in compensation expense and reduced spending, due in part to travel restrictions imposed as a result of COVID-19. These decreases were partially offset by higher legal and corporate development costs and mark to market expenses on our deferred compensation plans. For fiscal 2020, general corporate expenses were $103.8, a decrease of $7.7 compared to fiscal 2019 expense of $111.5. The decrease was driven by TSA exits, reduced travel and other expenses due to COVID-19 as well as reduced stock compensation expense.
Global marketing expenses were $41.9 in fiscal 2021, $28.2 in fiscal 2020, and $18.2 in fiscal 2019. The global marketing expense represents a center led approach to managing global marketing activities in support of our brands. The increase was primarily driven by planned incremental investment in our branded product portfolio.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Energizer’s primary future cash needs are centered on operating activities, working capital and strategic investments. We believe that our future cash from operations, together with our access to capital markets, will provide adequate resources to fund our short-term and long-term operating and financing needs. Our access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms in the future will be affected by many factors, including, but not limited to: (i) our financial condition and prospects, (ii) for debt, our credit rating, (iii) the liquidity of the overall capital markets and (iv) the current state of the economy. There can be no assurances that we will continue to have access to capital markets on terms acceptable to us. See “Risk Factors” for a further discussion.
Cash is managed centrally with net earnings reinvested locally and working capital requirements met from existing liquid funds. At September 30, 2021, Energizer had $238.9 of cash and cash equivalents, approximately 95% of which was outside of the U.S. Given our extensive international operations, a significant portion of our cash is denominated in foreign currencies. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. The repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences or be subject to regulatory capital requirements, however, those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations.
On December 22, 2020, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (2020 Credit Agreement) which provided for a 5-year $400.0 revolving credit facility (2020 Revolving Facility) and a $1,200.0 Term Loan due December 2027. In December 2020, $550.0 was used to pay down the remaining balances on the Term Loan A facility due in 2022, Term Loan B facility due in 2025 and the amounts outstanding on the existing 2018 Revolving Credit Facility. In January 2021, the remaining $650.0 of proceeds were utilized to fund the redemption of the Company’s $600.0 7.750% Senior Notes due in 2027 at a redemption price equal to 110.965% of the aggregate principal amount.
The borrowings under the Term Loan require quarterly principal payments at a rate of 0.25% of the original principal balance. Borrowings under the 2020 Revolving Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the option of the Company, LIBOR or the Base Rate (as defined) plus the applicable margin. The Term Loan bears interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the option of the Company, LIBOR or Base Rate (as defined) plus the applicable margin.
The 2020 Revolving Facility replaced the previously outstanding Revolving Credit Facility entered into in 2018. As of September 30, 2021, the Company had outstanding borrowings of $105.0 under the 2020 Revolving Facility and $7.7 of outstanding letters of credit. Taking into account outstanding letters of credit, $287.3 remained available as of September 30, 2021.
Debt Covenants
The agreements governing the Company's debt contain certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and provisions relating to events of default. If the Company fails to comply with these covenants or with other requirements of these agreements, the lenders may have the right to accelerate the maturity of the debt. Acceleration under one of these facilities would trigger cross defaults to other borrowings. As of September 30, 2021, the Company was, and expects to remain, in compliance with the provisions and covenants associated with its debt agreements.
Operating Activities
Cash flow from operating activities from continuing operations is the primary funding source for operating needs and capital investments. Cash flow from operating activities was $179.7 in fiscal 2021, $389.3 in fiscal 2020, and $142.1 in fiscal 2019.
Cash flow from operating activities from continuing operations was $179.7 in fiscal 2021 as compared to $389.3 in the prior fiscal year. This decrease of $209.6 was primarily driven by working capital changes year over year of approximately $282, partially offset by the increase in cash earnings of approximately $97. The working capital change of approximately $282 was primarily a result of the following:
•Approximately $172 in increased inventory investment compared to the prior year as we have taken a proactive approach to invest in incremental safety stock given the continued volatility of the global supply network-including uncertainty around product sourcing, transportation challenges and labor availability;
•Approximately $45 due to changes in accounts payable and accrued interest driven by timing of payments;
•Approximately $38 in accounts receivable due to higher current year sales compared to prior year; and
•The prior year receipt of approximately $30 related to the agreement and final cash settlement from the Central Authority in Spain on a Spanish VAT refund payment.
Cash flow from operating activities from continuing operations was $389.3 in fiscal 2020 as compared to $142.1 in fiscal 2019. This change of $247 was primarily driven by higher year-over-year cash net earnings resulting from lower cash expenditures of approximately $126 associated with the Battery and Auto Care Acquisitions, most notably the payment of
interest and ticking fees associated with the debt utilized to fund the Battery Acquisition and other success and consulting fees paid to finalize the acquisitions in the prior year. In addition, working capital changes favorably impacted cash flow from operations year-over-year. These changes were driven by approximately $30 related to the agreement and final cash settlement from the Central Authority in Spain on a Spanish VAT refund payment, approximately $70 related to higher year-over-year accounts receivable collections as the Company's factoring program was more established throughout fiscal 2020 compared to the prior year, and approximately $36 related to the timing of payments and programs, most notably for higher trade and A&P accruals.
Investing Activities
Net cash used by investing activities from continuing operations was $126.4 in fiscal 2021 and $64.0 in fiscal 2020, and net cash from investing activities from continuing operations was $2,514.9 in fiscal 2019, and consisted of the following:
•Capital expenditures were $64.9, $65.3, and $55.1 in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
•Proceeds from asset sales were $5.7, $6.4, and $0.2 in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The fiscal 2021 proceeds primarily related to the sale of our Guatemala manufacturing facility acquired with the Battery Acquisition. The fiscal 2020 proceeds primarily represent insurance proceeds received from property, plant and equipment utilized by the Acquired Battery Business damaged in a flood.
•Acquisitions, net of cash acquired, were $67.2, $5.1, and $2,460.0 in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The fiscal 2021 payments related to the acquired Indonesia battery plant and the Formulations Acquisition. The majority of the fiscal 2020 payment was due to the finalization of working capital adjustments with Spectrum for the Auto Care Acquisition while $1.5 was utilized to complete the CAE acquisition. The fiscal 2019 outflow was utilized to purchase the Battery and Auto Care Acquisitions.
Investing cash outflows of approximately $55 to $65 are anticipated in fiscal 2022 for capital expenditures relating to maintenance, product development and cost reduction investments. Additional investing cash outflows of approximately $10 to $20 are anticipated in fiscal 2022 for the remaining investment in integration related capital expenditures for the Battery and Auto Care Acquisitions.
Financing Activities
Net cash used by financing activities from continuing operations was $1,069.1 in fiscal 2021. Net cash from financing activities from continuing operations was $394.2 and $1,276.8 in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively.

The Company has a contractual commitment to repay its long-term debt of $3,346.7 based on the defined terms of our debt agreements. Within the next twelve months, the company is obligated to pay $12.0 of this total debt. Our interest commitments based on the current debt balance and LIBOR rate on drawn debt at September 30, 2021 is $888.6, with $125.9 expected within the next twelve months. The company has entered into an interest rate swap agreement that fixed the variable benchmark component (LIBOR) on $700.0 of variable rate debt. Refer to Note 13 Debt for further details.
The Company has a long-term obligation to pay a mandatory transition tax of $16.7. No payments are required until fiscal 2024.
Additionally, Energizer has material future purchase commitments for goods and services which are legally binding and that specify all significant terms including price and/or quantity. Total future commitments for these obligations over the next 5 years is $33.8. Of this amount, $17.0 is due within the next twelve months. Refer to Note 18 Other Commitments and Contingencies for further details. Energizer is also party to various service and supply contracts that generally extend approximately one to three months. These arrangements are primarily individual, short-term purchase orders for routine goods and services at market prices, which are part of our normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. These contracts can generally be canceled at our option at any time. We do not believe such arrangements will adversely affect our liquidity position.
Finally, Energizer has operating and financing leases for real estate, equipment, and other assets that include future minimum payments with initial terms of one year or more. Total future operating and finance lease payments at September 30, 2021 are $169.2 and $85.2, respectively. Within the next twelve months, operating and finance lease payments are expected to be $19.5 and $4.8, respectively. Refer to Note 11 Leases for further details.
Other Matters
Environmental Matters
The operations of Energizer are subject to various federal, state, foreign and local laws and regulations intended to protect the public health and the environment. These regulations relate primarily to worker safety, air and water quality, underground fuel storage tanks and waste handling and disposal. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, Energizer has been identified as a “potentially responsible party” (PRP) and may be required to share in the cost of cleanup with respect to certain federal “Superfund” sites. It may also be required to share in the cost of cleanup with respect to state-designated sites or other sites outside of the U.S.
Accrued environmental costs at September 30, 2021 were $10.1, of which approximately $3.1 is expected to be spent during fiscal 2022. It is difficult to quantify with certainty the cost of environmental matters, particularly remediation and future capital expenditures for environmental control equipment. Current environmental spending estimates could be modified as a result of changes in our plans or our understanding of underlying facts, changes in legal requirements or the enforcement or interpretation of existing requirements.
Legal Proceedings
The Company and its affiliates are subject to a number of legal proceedings in various jurisdictions arising out of its operations. Many of these legal matters are in preliminary stages and involve complex issues of law and fact, and may proceed for protracted periods of time. The amount of liability, if any, from these proceedings cannot be determined with certainty. We are a party to legal proceedings and claims that arise during the ordinary course of business. We review our legal proceedings and claims, regulatory reviews and inspections on an ongoing basis and follow appropriate accounting guidance when making accrual and disclosure decisions. We establish accruals for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated, and we disclose the amount accrued and the amount of a reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued, if such disclosure is necessary for our financial statements to not be misleading. We do not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable, but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated. Based upon present information, the Company believes that its liability, if any, arising from such pending legal proceedings, asserted legal claims and known potential legal claims which are likely to be asserted, is not reasonably likely to be material to the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, taking into account established accruals for estimated liabilities.
Critical Accounting Policies
The methods, estimates, and judgments Energizer uses in applying its most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results the Company reports in its Consolidated Financial Statements. Specific areas, among others, requiring the application of management’s estimates and judgment include assumptions pertaining to accruals for consumer and trade-promotion programs, pension benefit costs, acquisition, goodwill and intangible assets, uncertain tax positions, the reinvestment of undistributed foreign earnings and tax valuation allowances. On an ongoing basis, Energizer evaluates its estimates, but actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
The Company's critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. A summary of Energizer’s significant accounting policies is contained in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of Energizer’s accounting policies.
•Revenue Recognition - The Company measures revenue as the amount of consideration for which it expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods. Net sales reflect the transaction prices for contracts, which include units shipped at selling list prices reduced by variable consideration as determined by the terms of each individual contract. Discounts are offered to customers for early payment and an estimate of the discount is recorded as a reduction of net sales in the same period as the sale. Our standard sales terms generally include payments within 30 to 60 days and are final with returns or exchanges not permitted unless a special exception is made. Our Auto Care channel terms are longer, in some cases up to 365 days, in which case we use our Trade Receivables factoring program for more timely collection. Reserves are established based on historical data and recorded in cases where the right of return does exist for a particular sale. The Company does not offer warranties on products.
Energizer offers a variety of programs, primarily to its retail customers, designed to promote sales of its products. Such programs require periodic payments and allowances based on estimated results of specific programs and are recorded as a reduction to net sales. Methodologies for determining these provisions are dependent on specific customer pricing and promotional practices, which range from contractually fixed percentage price reductions to reimbursement based on actual occurrence or performance. Where applicable, future reimbursements are estimated based on a combination of historical patterns and future expectations regarding specific in-market product performance. Energizer accrues, at the time of sale, the estimated total payments and allowances associated with each transaction. Customers redeem trade promotions in the form of payments from the accrued trade allowances or invoice credits against trade receivables. Additionally, Energizer offers programs directly to consumers to promote the sale of its products. Energizer continually assesses the adequacy of accruals for customer and consumer promotional program costs not yet paid. To the extent total program payments differ from estimates, adjustments may be necessary. Historically, these adjustments have not been material.
The Company’s contracts with customers do not have significant financing components or non-cash consideration and the Company does not have unbilled revenue or significant amounts of prepayments from customers. Revenue is recorded net of the taxes we collect on behalf of governmental authorities which are generally included in the price to the customer. Shipping and handling activities are accounted for as contract fulfillment costs and recorded in Cost of products sold.
•Pension Plans - The determination of the Company’s obligation and expense for pension benefits is dependent on certain assumptions developed by the Company and used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. Assumptions include, among others, the discount rate, future salary increases and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Actual results that differ from assumptions made, or impacts to the obligation that are due to changes to assumptions, are recognized on the balance sheet and subsequently amortized to earnings over future periods. Significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in macroeconomic conditions resulting in changes to assumptions may materially affect pension obligations. In determining the discount rate, the Company uses the yield on high-quality bonds in conjunction with the cash flows of its plans’ estimated payouts. For the U.S. plans, which were frozen January 1, 2014 and represent the Company’s most significant obligations, we consider the Mercer Above-Mean yield curve in determining the discount rates.
Of the assumptions listed above, changes in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and changes in the discount rate used in developing plan obligations will likely have the most significant impact on the Company’s annual earnings, prospectively. Based on plan assets at September 30, 2021, a 100 basis point decrease or increase in expected asset returns would increase or decrease the Company’s U.S. pre-tax pension expense by $4.4. In addition, poor asset performance may increase and accelerate the rate of required pension contributions in the future. Uncertainty related to economic markets and the availability of credit may produce changes in the yields on corporate bonds rated as high-quality. As a result, discount rates based on high-quality corporate bonds may increase or decrease leading to lower or
higher, respectively, pension obligations. A 100 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase U.S. pension obligations by $50.1 at September 30, 2021.
As allowed under GAAP, the Company’s U.S. qualified pension plan's impact on earnings is determined using Market Related Value, which recognizes market appreciation or depreciation in the portfolio over five years and therefore reduces the short-term impact of market fluctuations.
•Acquisitions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets - The Company allocates the cost of an acquired business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess value of the cost of an acquired business over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. The valuation of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results. The Company uses a variety of information sources to determine the value of acquired assets and liabilities including: third-party appraisers for the values and lives of property, identifiable intangibles and inventories; actuaries for defined benefit retirement plans; and legal counsel or other advisors to assess the obligations associated with legal, environmental or other claims.
During fiscal 2021, Energizer used variations of the income approach in determining the fair value of the amortizable intangible assets acquired for the Formulations Acquisition. The Company utilized multi-period excess earnings methods for determining the fair value of the proprietary technology and customer relationships acquired. Our determination of the fair value of these assets involved the use of significant estimates and assumptions related to the revenue growth rates and discount rates. Our determination of the fair value of customer relationships also involved assumptions related to customer attrition rates.
During fiscal 2019, Energizer used variations of the income approach in determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired in the Battery and Auto Care Acquisitions. Specifically, the Company utilized the multi-period excess earnings method for determining the fair value of the indefinite lived trade names and customer relationships acquired, and the relief from royalty method to determine the fair value of the proprietary technology acquired. Our determination of the fair value of the indefinite lived trade names acquired involved the use of significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates and discount rates. Our determination of the fair value of customer relationships acquired involved significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates, discount rates, and customer attrition rates. Our determination of the fair value of the proprietary technology acquired involved the use of significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates. Energizer believes that the fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions and estimates that marketplace participants would use. However, our assumptions are inherently risky and actual results could differ from those estimates.
Significant judgment is also required in assigning the respective useful lives of intangible assets. Certain brand intangibles are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands. Other intangible assets are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment of intangible assets that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including the competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment. Our estimates of the useful lives of determinable-lived intangible assets are primarily based on the same factors. The costs of determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over the estimated useful life. The value of indefinite-lived intangible assets and residual goodwill is not amortized, but is tested at least annually for impairment. See Note 12, Goodwill and intangible assets, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
However, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our acquisition valuations and intangible asset and goodwill impairment testing, including discount rates, revenue growth rates, future operating results and related cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values in the future. An increase in discount rates, a reduction in projected cash flows or a combination of the two could lead to a reduction in the estimated fair values, which may result in impairment charges that could materially affect our financial statements in any given year.
During fiscal 2021, we performed our annual goodwill test for impairment. There were no indications of impairment of goodwill noted during this testing. In addition, we completed impairment testing on indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill, which are trademarks/brand names used in our various product categories. No impairment was indicated as a result of this testing.
•Income Taxes - Our annual effective income tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences are temporary, reversing over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.
The Company estimates income taxes and the effective income tax rate in each jurisdiction that it operates. This involves estimating taxable earnings, specific taxable and deductible items, the likelihood of generating sufficient future taxable income to utilize deferred tax assets, the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the U.S. and be taxable and possible exposures related to future tax audits. Deferred tax assets are evaluated on a subsidiary by subsidiary basis to ensure that the asset will be realized. Valuation allowances are established when the realization is not deemed to be more likely than not. Future performance is monitored, and when objectively measurable operating trends change, adjustments are made to the valuation allowances accordingly. To the extent the estimates described above change, adjustments to income taxes are made in the period in which the estimate is changed.
The Company operates in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax and regulatory environments, which are subject to differing interpretations by the taxpayer and the taxing authorities. At times, we may take positions that management believes are supportable, but are potentially subject to successful challenges by the appropriate taxing authority. The Company evaluates its tax positions and establishes liabilities in accordance with guidance governing accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. The Company reviews these tax uncertainties in light of the changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjusts them accordingly. The Company's policy on accounting for tax on the global intangible low-taxed income is to treat the taxes due as a period expense when incurred.
In general, it is our practice and intention to permanently reinvest the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and repatriate earnings only when the tax impact is zero or very minimal. No provision has been provided for taxes that would result upon repatriation of our foreign investments to the United States. We intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries to fund local operations, fund strategic growth objectives, and fund capital projects. See Note 7, Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04 Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. The amendment provides optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference LIBOR. These updates are effective immediately and may be applied prospectively to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated on or before December 31, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating our contracts and the optional expedients provided by this update, but does not expect any material impact to the financial statements.
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06 Changes to Accounting for Convertible Debt. This amendment simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity. The FASB has reduced the number of accounting models for convertible debt and convertible preferred stock instruments and made certain disclosure amendments to improve the information provided to financial statement users. The new guidance also modifies how particular convertible instruments and certain contracts that may be settled in cash or shares impact the diluted EPS computation. The amendment goes into effect for fiscal years starting after December 15, 2021, which for Energizer would be the beginning of fiscal year 2023. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this updated may have on our financial statements, however it is not expected to be material.
