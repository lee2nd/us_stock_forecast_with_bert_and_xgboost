Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements. Discussion and analysis of our cash flows for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 is included under the heading Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Financial Position in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 21, 2020.
OVERVIEW
Sensient Technologies Corporation (the Company or Sensient) is a global developer, manufacturer, and supplier of flavor and fragrance systems for the food, beverage, personal care, and household-products industries. The Company previously announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its fragrances product line (excluding its essential oils product line). The Company is also a leading developer, manufacturer, and supplier of colors for businesses worldwide. The Company provides natural and synthetic color systems for use in foods, beverages, pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals; colors and other ingredients for cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and nutraceuticals; and technical colors for industrial applications. The Company’s three reportable segments are the Flavors & Extracts Group (formerly known as the Flavors & Fragrances segment; see Note 12, Segment and Geographic Information) and the Color Group, which are managed on a product basis, and the Asia Pacific Group, which is managed on a geographic basis. The Company’s corporate expenses, restructuring including operational improvement plans, divestiture, share-based compensation, COVID-19 employee payment, and other costs are included in the “Corporate & Other” category. In the second quarter of 2020, the Company divested its inks product line (Color Group), and in the third quarter of 2020, the Company divested its yogurt fruit preparations product line (Flavors & Extracts Group).
In 2020, Sensient’s management team and employees worked diligently throughout the pandemic to ensure that employees remained safe, facilities remained open, and the supply chain continued to function. As a result of these efforts, Sensient was able to serve as a consistent and reliable supplier to its customers throughout the pandemic for their food, pharmaceutical, and personal care ingredient needs. The impact of COVID-19 on Sensient’s business was mixed in 2020. The Company believes the net impact of the pandemic was negative to Sensient’s results, as the increase in certain product lines was more than offset by the significant drop in demand for cosmetic makeup ingredients and certain food products.
The Company also made significant progress on the product line divestitures that were announced in 2019. The sales of the inks product line and yogurt fruit preparations product line were completed in 2020. Additionally, a definitive agreement to sell the fragrances product line (excluding the essential oils product line) was signed in November 2020, with an anticipated close date in the first half of 2021.
The Company’s diluted earnings per share were $2.59 in 2020 and $1.94 in 2019. Included in the 2020 results were $18.5 million ($14.4 million after tax, $0.34 per share) of divestiture & other related costs, operational improvement plan costs, and a one-time COVID-19 employee payment. Included in the 2019 results were $45.9 million ($43.2 million after tax, $1.02 per share) of divestiture & other related costs. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, which exclude the divestiture & other related costs, the results of operations of the product lines divested or to be divested, the operational improvement plan costs, and the impact of the one-time COVID-19 employee payment, were $2.79 in 2020 and $2.92 in 2019 (see discussion below regarding non-GAAP financial measures).
Additional information on the results is included below.
Index
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
2020 vs. 2019
Revenue
Sensient’s revenue was approximately $1.3 billion in both 2020 and 2019.
Gross Profit
The Company’s gross margin was 31.8% in 2020 and 31.4% in 2019. The increase in gross margin is primarily a result of lower divestiture & other related costs in 2020.
Selling and Administrative Expenses
Selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenue was 20.4% in 2020 and 22.2% in 2019. Selling and administrative expenses in 2020 included divestiture & other related expenses, operational improvement plan costs, and the one-time COVID-19 employee payment totaling $15.7 million and in 2019 included divestiture & other related costs totaling $35.3 million. These expenses increased selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenue by approximately 120 and 270 basis points in 2020 and 2019, respectively. See Divestitures below for further information.
Operating Income
Operating income was $152.7 million in 2020 and $121.1 million in 2019. Operating margins were 11.5% in 2020 and 9.2% in 2019. Divestiture & other related costs, operational improvement plan costs, and the one-time COVID-19 employee payment reduced operating margins by approximately 140 basis points in 2020 and divestiture & other related expenses reduced operating margins by approximately 350 basis points in 2019.
Additional information on segment results can be found in the Segment Information section.
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $14.8 million in 2020 and $20.1 million in 2019. The decrease in expense was primarily due to a decrease in the average interest rate and the average debt outstanding.
Income Taxes
The effective income tax rate was 20.6% in 2020 and 18.8% in 2019. The effective tax rates in both 2020 and 2019 were impacted by changes in estimates associated with the finalization of prior year foreign and domestic tax items, audit settlements, mix of foreign earnings, costs related to the divestiture & other related costs and the release of valuation allowances related to the foreign tax credit carryover and foreign net operating losses. See Note 11, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for additional information.
The 2021 effective income tax rate is estimated to be between 24% and 25%, before any divestiture & other related costs and discrete items, such as finalization of prior year foreign and domestic tax items, audit settlements, and valuation allowance adjustments.
Divestitures
In October 2019, the Company announced its intent to divest its inks, fragrances (excluding its essential oils product line), and yogurt fruit preparations product lines. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the Board of Directors approved the sale of the inks product line, which was within the Color segment, and the fragrances product line (excluding its essential oils product line), which is within the Flavors & Extracts segment. In the second quarter of 2020, the Board of Directors approved the sale of the yogurt fruit preparations product line, which was within the Flavors & Extracts segment.
On June 30, 2020, the Company completed the sale of its inks product line. In 2020, the Company received $11.6 million of net cash for the sale of the product line and expects to receive additional cash when it completes certain post-closing asset sales. On September 18, 2020, the Company completed the sale of its yogurt fruit preparations product line for $1.0 million. The sale included an earn-out agreement based on future performance, which could result in additional cash consideration for the Company. On November 23, 2020, the Company announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to sell its fragrances product line (excluding its essential oils product line). The Company expects the transaction to close in the first half of 2021.
Index
Divestiture & other related costs were $12.2 million and $45.9 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. See Note 14, Divestitures, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for additional information.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company currently estimates 2021 divestiture charges will be $10 million to $14 million. The Company is expecting a non-cash charge of $8 million to $10 million upon closing the sale of the fragrances product line (excluding its essential oils product line) related to the reclassification of accumulated foreign currency translation and related items from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss to Selling and Administrative Expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. In addition, the Company expects other costs, primarily accelerated depreciation and other exiting activities expenses, to be between $2 million and $4 million. The Company anticipates that it will complete the sales and exit activities of these product lines in 2021.
Operational Improvement Plan
In the third quarter of 2020, the Company approved an operational improvement plan to consolidate manufacturing facilities and improve efficiencies within the Company. As part of the operational improvement plan, the Company is combining its New Jersey cosmetics manufacturing facility in the Personal Care product line of the Color segment into its existing Color segment facility in Missouri. In addition, the Company is centralizing certain Flavors & Extracts segment support functions in Europe into one location. In the Asia Pacific segment, the Company incurred costs in connection with the elimination of certain selling and administrative positions.
COVID-19 Employee Payment
In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company approved a one-time COVID-19 employee payment to reward the outstanding dedication and efforts of the Company’s employees during these challenging and unprecedented times. This adjustment totaled approximately $3.0 million.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Within the following tables, the Company reports certain non-GAAP financial measures, including: (1) adjusted revenue, adjusted operating income, adjusted net earnings, and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which exclude the results of the product lines divested or to be divested, the divestiture & other related costs, the operational improvement plan costs, and a one-time COVID-19 employee payment and (2) percentage changes in revenue, operating income, and diluted earnings per share on an adjusted local currency basis, which eliminate the effects that result from translating its international operations into U.S. dollars, the results of product lines divested or to be divested, the divestiture & other related costs or income, the operational improvement plan costs, and the one-time COVID-19 employee payment.
The Company has included each of these non-GAAP measures in order to provide additional information regarding our underlying operating results and comparable year-over-year performance. Such information is supplemental to information presented in accordance with GAAP and is not intended to represent a presentation in accordance with GAAP.

SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Company determines its operating segments based on information utilized by its chief operating decision maker to allocate resources and assess performance. Segment performance is evaluated on operating income before any applicable divestiture & other related costs, share-based compensation, acquisition, restructuring including the operational improvement plan, one-time COVID-19 employee payment, and other costs (which are reported in Corporate & Other), interest expense, and income taxes.
The Company’s discussion below regarding its operating segments has been updated to reflect the Company’s disaggregation of revenue, which was adopted in the first quarter of 2018, as summarized in Part IV, Item I, Note 12, Segment and Geographic Information, of this report.
The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Flavors & Extracts, Color, and Asia Pacific segments.
Flavors & Extracts
Flavors & Extracts segment revenue was $742.0 and $700.4 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, an increase of approximately 6%. Foreign exchange rates did not have a significant impact on segment revenue in 2020. Segment revenue was higher than the prior year due to higher revenue in Flavors, Extracts & Flavor Ingredients and Natural Ingredients, partially offset by lower revenue in Yogurt Fruit Preparations and Fragrances. The higher revenue in Flavors, Extracts & Flavor Ingredients and Natural Ingredients was primarily due to favorable volumes and selling prices, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates at Flavors, Extracts & Flavor Ingredients. The lower revenue in Yogurt Fruit Preparations was primarily due to lower volumes and the divestiture of the product line in the third quarter of 2020. The lower revenue in Fragrances was due to lower selling prices partially offset by higher volumes.
Flavors & Extracts segment operating income was $91.0 million in 2020 and $75.0 million in 2019, an increase of approximately 21%. Foreign exchange rates decreased segment operating income by approximately 1%. The higher segment operating income was primarily a result of higher operating income in Flavors, Extracts & Flavor Ingredients and Fragrances, partially offset by lower operating income in Natural Ingredients. The higher operating income in Flavors, Extracts & Flavor Ingredients was primarily due to favorable selling prices, favorable manufacturing and other costs, and lower raw material costs. The higher operating income at Fragrances was primarily due to lower raw material costs, favorable manufacturing and other costs, and favorable volumes and product mix, partially offset by lower selling prices. The lower operating income in Natural Ingredients was primarily due to higher raw material and manufacturing and other costs, partially offset by higher selling prices and favorable volumes and product mix. Segment operating income as a percent of revenue was 12.3% and 10.7% for 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Index
Color
Segment revenue for the Color segment was $501.0 million in 2020 and $535.2 million in 2019, a decrease of approximately 6%. Foreign exchange rates decreased segment revenue by approximately 2%. The lower segment revenue was primarily a result of lower revenue in Personal Care and Inks, partially offset by higher revenue in Food & Pharmaceutical Colors. The lower revenue in Personal Care was primarily a result of lower volumes due to lower demand for makeup products due to COVID-19 and unfavorable foreign exchange rates, partially offset by higher selling prices. The lower revenue in Inks was primarily a result of divesting the product line in the second quarter of 2020 and lower volumes. The higher revenue in Food & Pharmaceutical Colors was primarily due to favorable volumes and higher selling prices, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.
Segment operating income for the Color segment was $96.0 million in 2020 and $101.2 million in 2019, a decrease of approximately 5%. Foreign exchange rates decreased segment operating income by approximately 2%. The lower segment operating income was primarily a result of lower operating income in Personal Care, partially offset by higher operating income in Food & Pharmaceutical Colors. The lower operating income in Personal Care was primarily a result of lower volumes due to lower demand for makeup products due to COVID-19, higher raw material and manufacturing and other costs, and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by higher selling prices. The higher operating income in Food & Pharmaceutical Colors was primarily due to lower raw material costs, volumes, and selling prices, partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing and other costs. Segment operating income as a percent of revenue was 19.2% in 2020 compared to 18.9% in 2019.
Asia Pacific
Segment revenue for the Asia Pacific segment was $121.2 million and $118.2 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively, an increase of approximately 3%. Foreign exchange rates had a minimal impact on segment revenues. Segment revenue was higher than the prior year due to higher volumes.
Segment operating income for the Asia Pacific segment was $22.1 million in 2020 and $19.4 million in 2019, an increase of approximately 14% compared to the prior year. Foreign exchange rates did not have a significant impact on segment operating income. The increase in segment operating income was a result of higher volumes and lower raw material costs. Segment operating income as a percent of revenue was 18.2% in 2020 and 16.4% in 2019, respectively.
Corporate & Other
The Corporate & Other operating loss was $56.4 million in 2020 and $74.4 million in 2019. The lower operating loss was primarily a result of lower divestiture & other related costs in 2020 of $12.2 million compared to $45.9 million in 2019. These lower divestiture & other related costs in 2020 were partially offset by higher stock based compensation of $6.3 million, operational improvement plan costs of $3.3 million, and the one-time COVID-19 employee payment of $3.0 million. There were no operational improvement plan costs or COVID-19 employee payment in 2019. See the Divestitures, Operational Improvement Plan, and COVID-19 Employee Payment sections above for further information.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
2019 vs. 2018
Revenue
Sensient’s revenue was approximately $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Gross Profit
The Company’s gross margin was 31.4% in 2019 and 33.6% in 2018. The decrease in gross margin was primarily a result of unfavorable volume and the impact of a $10.6 million inventory adjustment related to the divesting of the yogurt fruit preparations product line, partially offset by higher selling prices. See Divestitures below for further information on the inventory adjustment.
Selling and Administrative Expenses
Selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenue was 22.2% in 2019 and 18.9% in 2018, respectively. Divestiture & other related costs of $35.3 million in 2019 were included in Selling and Administrative Expense and increased selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenue by approximately 270 basis points in 2019. See Divestitures below for further information.
Operating Income
Operating income was $121.1 million in 2019 and $203.4 million in 2018. Operating margins were 9.2% in 2019 and 14.7% in 2018. Divestiture & other related costs reduced operating margins by approximately 350 basis points in 2019.
Additional information on segment results can be found in the Segment Information section.
Index
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $20.1 million in 2019 and $21.9 million in 2018. The decrease in expense was primarily due to the decrease in average debt outstanding.
Income Taxes
The effective income tax rate was 18.8% in 2019 and 13.3% in 2018. The effective tax rates in both 2019 and 2018 were impacted by changes in estimates associated with the finalization of prior year foreign and domestic tax items, audit settlements, and mix of foreign earnings. The effective tax rate in 2019 was impacted by tax costs related to the divestiture & other related costs and the release of valuation allowances related to the foreign tax credit carryover and foreign net operating losses. The effective tax rate in 2018 was also favorably impacted by U.S. tax accounting method changes that were filed with the IRS in the second quarter of 2018 and generation of foreign tax credits during 2018. See Note 11, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for additional information.
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the 2017 Tax Legislation (2017 Tax Legislation). The 2017 Tax Legislation significantly changed U.S. corporate income tax laws by reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21% beginning in 2018 and creating a territorial tax system with a one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings of U.S. subsidiaries. As a result, the Company recorded a provisional net tax expense of $18.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2017. This amount consists of reevaluating the U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the lower corporate income tax rate, adjustments to the Company’s foreign tax credit carryover, and the one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings of U.S. subsidiaries. In 2018, the Company finalized its provisional estimates related to the 2017 Tax Legislation resulting in an income tax benefit of $6.6 million. Sensient considers $11.8 million to be the final net tax expense related to the 2017 Tax Legislation.
Acquisitions
On March 9, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of certain net assets and the natural color business of GlobeNatural, a company based in Lima, Peru. The Company paid $10.8 million of cash for this acquisition. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The Company acquired net assets of $1.4 million and identified intangible assets, principally customer relationships of $2.0 million, and allocated the remaining $7.4 million to goodwill. These operations are included in the Color segment.
On July 10, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of Sensient Natural Extraction Inc., a botanical extraction business with patented solvent-free extraction processes, located in Vancouver, Canada. The Company paid $19.8 million of cash for this acquisition. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The Company acquired net assets of $4.0 million and identified intangible assets, principally technological know-how, of $6.9 million. The remaining $8.9 million was allocated to goodwill. These operations are included in the Color segment.
Divestitures
In October 2019, the Company announced its intent to divest its inks, fragrances (excluding its essential oils product line), and yogurt fruit preparations product lines. At such time, the Board of Directors approved the sale of the inks product line, which is within the Color segment, and the sale of the fragrances product line, which is within the Flavors & Extracts segment.
In the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $34.6 million, primarily related to property, plant and equipment and allocated goodwill, in Selling and Administrative Expenses, related to the disposal groups as described in Note 14, Divestitures, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. The charge reduced the carrying value of certain long-lived assets to their fair value. An estimate of the fair value of these product lines less costs to sell was determined to be lower than their carrying value. This estimate for the fragrances product line will be finalized and adjusted as necessary upon the closing of the sale or as assumptions change. Also in the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company recorded a non-cash charge of $9.8 million and disposal costs of $0.8 million, in Cost of Products Sold, related to the yogurt fruit preparations divestiture. The charge reduced the carrying value of certain inventories, as they were determined to be excess as of December 31, 2019. The Company also incurred $0.7 million of additional costs, primarily related to severance, in the fourth quarter of 2019, in Selling and Administrative Expenses, related to the divestitures sold and to be sold, and other exit activities.

Index
Color
Segment revenue for the Color segment was $535.2 million in 2019 and $554.0 million in 2018, a decrease of approximately 3%. Foreign exchange rates decreased segment revenue by approximately 3%. The lower segment revenue was primarily a result of lower revenue in Personal Care and Inks, partially offset by higher revenue in Food & Pharmaceutical Colors. The lower revenue in Personal Care was primarily a result of lower volumes and unfavorable exchange rates. The lower revenue in Inks was primarily a result of lower volumes, lower prices, and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. The higher revenue in Food & Pharmaceutical Colors was primarily a result of higher volumes, the additional revenue from the Sensient Natural Extraction Inc. and GlobeNatural acquisitions, and higher selling prices, partially offset by unfavorable exchange rates. The additional revenue from the Sensient Natural Extraction Inc. and GlobeNatural acquisitions represent less than 1% of total segment revenue.
Segment operating income for the Color segment was $101.2 million in 2019 and $113.3 million in 2018, a decrease of approximately 11%.

The lower segment operating income in Personal Care was primarily a result of lower volumes and the unfavorable impact of exchange rates, partially offset by higher selling prices. Segment operating income as a percent of revenue was 18.9% in 2019 compared to 20.5% in 2018.
Asia Pacific
Segment revenue for the Asia Pacific segment was $118.2 million and $123.2 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively. Foreign exchange rates had a minimal impact on segment revenues. Segment revenue was slightly lower than prior year as lower volumes were partially offset by higher selling prices.

Corporate & Other
The Corporate & Other operating loss was $74.4 million in 2019 and $27.2 million in 2018. The higher operating loss was primarily a result of the divestiture & other related costs in 2019 of $45.9 million. See Divestitures above for further information. There were no divestiture & other related costs incurred in 2018.
LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL POSITION
Financial Condition
The Company’s financial position remains strong. The Company is in compliance with its loan covenants calculated in accordance with applicable agreements as of December 31, 2020. The Company expects its cash flow from operations and its existing debt capacity can be used to meet anticipated future cash requirements for operations, capital expenditures, dividend payments, acquisitions, and stock repurchases.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities was $218.8 million and $177.2 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Operating cash flow provided the primary source of funds for operating needs, capital expenditures, and shareholder dividends. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2020 is primarily due to favorable working capital changes.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
In preparing the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., management is required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the asset, liability, revenue, and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosures of the Company, including information about contingencies, risk, and financial condition. The Company believes, given current facts and circumstances, that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable, adhere to accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., and are consistently applied. Inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise. The Company makes routine estimates and judgments in determining the net realizable value of accounts receivable, inventories, and property, plant, and equipment. Management believes the Company’s most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas:
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue at the transfer of control of its products to the Company’s customers in an amount reflecting the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled. Revenue is recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer, the customer is obligated to pay the Company and the Company has no remaining obligations, which is typically at shipment. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for additional details.
Goodwill Valuation
The Company reviews the carrying value of goodwill annually utilizing several valuation methodologies, including a discounted cash flow model. The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, in the third quarter of 2020. In conducting its annual test for impairment, the Company performed a qualitative assessment of its previously calculated fair values for each of its reporting units. Fair value is estimated using both a discounted cash flow analysis and an analysis of comparable company market values. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its net book value, no impairment exists. The Company’s three reporting units each had goodwill recorded and were tested for impairment. All three reporting units had fair values that were above their respective net book values by at least 90%. Changes in estimates of future cash flows caused by items such as unforeseen events or changes in market conditions could negatively affect the reporting units’ fair value and result in an impairment charge.
In the fourth quarter of 2019, as a result of the Company meeting the assets held for sale criteria for its divestitures of its inks and fragrances (excluding its essential oils product line) product lines, the Company allocated $8.4 million of goodwill to that disposal group. The $8.4 million of goodwill related to the disposal groups was determined to be fully impaired. In 2020, the fair value of the disposal groups decreased, which resulted in the previously allocated goodwill of $2.2 million to be reallocated to its respective financial reporting units. See Note 14, Divestitures, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for additional details.
Income Taxes
The Company estimates its income tax expense in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which it operates. The Company is subject to a tax audit in each of these jurisdictions, which could result in changes to the estimated tax expense. The amount of these changes would vary by jurisdiction and would be recorded when probable and estimable. These changes could impact the Company’s financial statements. Management has recorded valuation allowances to reduce the Company’s deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. As of December 31, 2020, the Company recorded gross deferred tax assets of $118 million with an associated valuation allowance of $48 million. Examples of deferred tax assets include deductions, net operating losses, and tax credits that the Company believes will reduce its future tax payments. In assessing the future realization of these assets, management has considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies. An adjustment to the recorded valuation allowance as a result of changes in facts or circumstances could result in a significant change in the Company’s tax expense. The Company does not provide for deferred taxes on unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which are considered to be invested indefinitely.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method with the exception of certain locations of the Flavors & Extracts segment where cost is determined using a weighted average method. Net realizable value is determined on the basis of estimated realizable values. Cost includes direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead.
Index
The Company estimates any required write-downs for inventory obsolescence by examining inventories on a quarterly basis to determine if there are any damaged items or slow moving products in which the carrying values could exceed net realizable value. Inventory write-downs are recorded as the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated market value. The Company recorded non-cash charges of $1.8 million and $9.8 million, in 2020 and 2019, respectively, in Cost of Products Sold primarily related to the yogurt fruit preparations divestiture. The charges reduced the carrying value of certain inventories, as they were determined to be excess. While significant judgment is involved in determining the net realizable value of inventory, the Company believes that inventory is appropriately stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
Commitments and Contingencies
The Company is subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of its businesses or arising under applicable laws and regulations. Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the judgment of management, who rely in part on information from Company legal counsel. When it is probable that the Company has incurred a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation matters and the Company’s exposure is reasonably estimable, the Company records a charge against earnings. The Company recognizes related insurance reimbursement when receipt is deemed probable. The Company’s estimate of liabilities and related insurance recoveries may change as further facts and circumstances become known.
