COVID-19 Impact
The COVID-19 outbreak is an unprecedented event that provides significant economic uncertainty for a broad spectrum of industries. The spread of this outbreak has caused significant disruptions in the U.S. economy and some of these impacts will be long lasting. As it continues to evolve it is not clear when or how the pandemic-driven contraction will recover. Congress, the President, and the Federal Reserve have taken several actions designed to cushion the economic fallout. Most notably, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act was signed into law at the end of March 2020 as a $2 trillion legislative package. The goal of the CARES Act is to prevent a severe economic downturn through various measures, including direct financial aid to American families and economic stimulus to significantly impacted industry sectors. Many of the CARES Act provisions, as well as other recent legislative and regulatory efforts, are expected to have a material impact on financial institutions. The Company's strong track record and revenue diversification provide a solid foundation for earnings and capital. The Company is focused on supporting its customers, communities and employees during this unique operating environment. Following is a description of the impact COVID-19 is having, actions taken as a result of COVID-19, and certain risks to the Company that COVID-19 creates or exacerbates, as well as management's outlook on the current COVID-19 situation.
Lending operations and accommodations to customers. Beginning in March 2020, First Mid Bank offered a 90-day commercial deferral program, primarily to hotel and restaurant borrowers. Subsequently, additional deferrals were offered on an individual case basis and a broader program was offered to residential and consumer customers. As of December 31, 2020, a total of $57.4 million was deferred through these programs. In accordance with interagency guidance issued in March 2020, these short-term deferrals are not considered troubled debt restructurings.
Beginning April 3, 2020, with the passage of the initial Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”), administered by the Small Business Administration (“SBA”), the Company actively participated in assisting existing and new customers with applications for resources through the program. The initial PPP loans had a two-year term, while those originated after June 5, 2020 had a five-year term. All PPP loans earned interest at 1%. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has approved and outstanding with the SBA 1,846 PPP loans totaling $168.3 million. The Company believes that most of these loans will ultimately be forgiven by the SBA in accordance with the terms of the program. Under the program, the SBA will forgive all or a portion of the loan if, during a certain period, loans are used for qualifying expenses. If all or a portion of the loan is not forgiven, the borrower is responsible for repayment.
Employees. The Company has a business continuity plan in place that was executed in March 2020. Approximately half of the Company's workforce have the ability to work remotely with secure connections. In addition, various preventative and personal hygiene measures, in accordance with CDC guidelines have been implemented. To protect and ensure the safety of employees, as well as customers, all branch locations were transitioned to drive-thru use only. Most branch lobbies were re-opened in mid-June and then transitioned back to drive-thru in November 2020 as COVID-19 case were rising. The Company increased the number of available sick days to every employee impacted in anyway by COVID-19 and offered financial assistance for any employee with need.
Asset impairment. The Company does not believe that any impairment exists due to COVID-19 to goodwill and other intangible assets, long-lived assets, mortgage servicing rights ("MSRs"), right of use assets, or available-for-sale investment securities at this time. While certain valuation assumptions and judgements will change to account for COVID-19 related circumstances, the Company does not expect significant changes in methodology used to determine the fair value of assets in accordance with GAAP. It is uncertain whether prolonged effects of COVID-19 will result in future impairment charges related to any of these assets.
Capital and liquidity. The Company's and First Mid Bank's capital levels are higher today than during the Great Recession of 2008. The Company’s current allowance for credit losses could absorb net charge offs greater than the total of all net charge offs over the last 20 years. The Company’s aggregate net charge offs over the last 20 years through December 31, 2020, were $32.9 million. Current capital levels also support the Company's recent loan stress testing of the most vulnerable industry sectors impacted by COVID-19. The Company maintains access to multiple sources of liquidity. As of December 31, 2020, the Company's total liquidity sources could provide $1.7 billion of total available capacity.
Management's outlook. The Company's current financial position is strong and the fundamental earning capabilities of its currently existing operations is solid. Due to the uncertain economic outlook related to the COVID-19 crisis and the potential for loan losses and other asset impairments, it is anticipated that reserve levels will remain elevated compared to recent historical trends. All processes, procedures and internal controls are expected to continue as outlined in existing applicable policies despite remote working status of many employees. While the Company does not currently anticipate any material changes or deficiencies to its capital or liquidity sources, uncertainties about duration and overall effects on the economy could result in more adverse effects than expected.
For the Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 Overview
This overview of management’s discussion and analysis highlights selected information in this document and may not contain all of the information that is important to you. For a more complete understanding of trends, events, commitments, uncertainties, liquidity, capital resources, and critical accounting estimates, you should carefully read this entire document. These have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition and results of consolidated operations.
Net income was $45.3 million, $47.9 million, and $36.6 million and diluted earnings per share were $2.70, $2.87, and $2.52 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The following table shows the Company’s annualized performance ratios for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:
Total assets at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $4.73 billion, $3.84 billion, and $3.84 billion, respectively. Net loan balances increased to $3.10 billion at December 31, 2020, from $2.67 billion at December 31, 2019, from $2.62 billion at December 31, 2018. Of the increase in 2020, approximately $183 million was loans purchased from Stifel Bank and $168 million was PPP loans. The increase in 2019 was primarily due to increases in commercial real estate and construction and land development.
Total deposit balances increased to $3.69 billion at December 31, 2020 from $2.92 billion at December 31, 2019 and increased from $2.99 billion at December 31, 2018. The increase in 2020 was primarily due to approximately $62 million of deposits acquired from Stifel Bank for customer accounts in connection with loans acquired, increases in customers deposits for stimulus payments and PPP loan proceeds. The decrease in 2019 was primarily due to decreases in money market accounts and interest-bearing deposits.
Net interest margin (tax effected), defined as net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets, was 3.27% for 2020, 3.64% for 2019 and 3.79% for 2018. In 2020 the decrease was primarily due to less accretion income and a decline in interest rates. In 2019 the decrease was primarily due to less accretion income and higher funding costs.
Net interest income increased to $127.4 million in 2020 from $125.7 million in 2019 and $111.7 million in 2018. During 2020, the increase in net interest income was primarily due to growth in earning assets offset by a decline in interest rates. During 2019, the increase in net interest income was primarily due to growth in earning assets as a result of loans and investment securities acquired from First Bank & SCB partially offset by an increase in cost of deposits and borrowings.
Non-interest income increased to $59.5 million in 2020 compared to $56.0 million in 2019 and $35.4 million in 2018. The increase in 2020 was primarily due to increases in wealth management revenues, insurance commissions and mortgage banking income. The increase in 2019 was due to the addition of First Bank during the second quarter of 2018 and the addition of SCB during the fourth quarter of 2018.
Non-interest expenses decreased $905,000, to $111.1 million in 2020 compared to $112.0 million in 2019, and $90.0 million in 2018. The decrease in 2020 was primarily declines in occupancy and equipment, amortization of intangibles, ATM/debit card expense and acquisition costs offset by increases in salary and benefits and FDIC insurance assessment expense. The increase in 2019 was primarily due to the acquisitions of First Bank and SCB.
Following is a summary of the factors that contributed to the changes in net income (in thousands):
Credit quality is an area of importance to the Company. Year-end total nonperforming loans were $28.1 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $27.8 million at December 31, 2019, and $29.7 million at December 31, 2018. Repossessed Assets balances totaled $2.5 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $3.7 million at December 31, 2019, and $2.6 million at December 31, 2018. The Company’s provision for loan losses was $16.1 million for 2020, compared to $6.4 million for 2019, and $8.7 million for 2018. The increase in provision in 2020 was due to the adoption of ASU 2016-13 and impacts of COVID-19 on the operations and earnings of borrowers. The decrease of provision expense in 2019 is primarily due to a decrease in classified loans.
The Company’s capital position remains strong and the Company has consistently maintained regulatory capital ratios above the “well-capitalized” standards. The Company’s Tier 1 capital ratio to risk weighted assets ratio at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was 14.63%, 14.79%, and 12.76%, respectively. The Company’s total capital to risk weighted assets ratio at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was 18.82%, 15.74% and 13.63%, respectively. The increases in these ratios in 2020 were primarily due to subordinated debt that qualified as Tier 2 capital and net income added to retained earnings. The increases in these ratios in 2019 were primarily due to net income added to retained earnings.
The Company’s liquidity position remains sufficient to fund operations and meet the requirements of borrowers, depositors, and creditors. The Company maintains various sources of liquidity to fund its cash needs. See “Liquidity” herein for a full listing of its sources and anticipated significant contractual obligations.
The Company enters into financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include lines of credit, letters of credit and other commitments to extend credit. The total outstanding commitments at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $615.5 million, $585.3 million, and $564.1 million, respectively. See Note 17 - “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” herein for further information.
Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Significant Estimates
The Company has established various accounting policies that govern the application of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements. The significant accounting policies of the Company are described in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements. Certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities; management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies. The judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors, which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management, actual results could differ from these judgments and assumptions, which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of operations of the Company.
Investment in Debt and Equity Securities. The Company classifies its investments in debt securities as either held-to-maturity or available-for-sale. Securities classified as held-to-maturity are recorded at amortized cost. Available-for-sale and equity securities are carried at fair value. Fair value calculations are based on quoted market prices when such prices are available. If quoted market prices are not available, estimates of fair value are computed using a variety of techniques, including extrapolation from the quoted prices of similar instruments or recent trades for thinly traded securities, fundamental analysis, or through obtaining purchase quotes. Due to the subjective nature of the valuation process, it is possible that the actual fair values of these investments could differ from the estimated amounts, thereby affecting the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company. If the estimated value of investments is less than the cost or amortized cost, the Company evaluates whether an event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. If such an event or change has occurred and the Company determines that the impairment is other-than-temporary, a further determination is made as to the portion of impairment that is related to credit loss. The impairment of the investment that is related to the credit loss is expensed in the period in which the event or change occurred. The remainder of the impairment is recorded in other comprehensive income.
Allowance for Credit Losses - Held-to-Maturity Securities. Currently all the Company's held-to-maturity securities are government agency-backed securities for which the risk of loss is minimal. Accordingly, the Company does not record an allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity securities.
Loans. Loans are reported at amortized cost. Amortized cost is the principal balance outstanding, net of purchase discounts and premiums, fair value hedge accounting adjustments and deferred loan fees and costs. Accrued interest is reported separately and is included in interest receivable in the consolidated balance sheets.
Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans. The Company believes the allowance for credit losses for loans is the critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. The allowance for credit losses for loans represents the best estimate of losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio. An estimate of potential losses inherent in the loan portfolio are determined and an allowance for those losses is established by considering factors including historical loss rates, expected cash flows and estimated collateral values. In assessing these factors, the Company uses relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.
The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective (pool) basis for non-impaired loans with similar risk characteristics. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimate of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for relevant factors to each pool including merger & acquisition activity, economic conditions, changes in policies, procedures & underwriting, and concentrations. The Company estimates the appropriate level of allowance for credit losses for impaired loans by evaluating them separately. A specific allowance is assigned to an impaired loan when expected cash flows or collateral are less than the carrying amount of the loan.
Allowance for Credit Losses - Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures. The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period that the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless the obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
Other Real Estate Owned. Other real estate owned acquired through loan foreclosure is initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. The adjustment at the time of foreclosure is recorded through the allowance for credit losses. Due to the subjective nature of establishing the fair value when the asset is acquired, the actual fair value of the other real estate owned or foreclosed asset could differ from the original estimate. If it is determined that fair value temporarily declines subsequent to foreclosure, a valuation allowance is recorded through noninterest expense. Operating costs associated with the assets after acquisition are also recorded as noninterest expense. Gains and losses on the disposition of other real estate owned and foreclosed assets are netted and posted to other noninterest expense.
Mortgage Servicing Rights. The Company has elected to measure mortgage servicing rights under the amortization method. Using this method, servicing rights are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income. The amortized assets are assessed for impairment based on fair value at each reporting date. Impairment is determined by stratifying rights into tranches based on predominant characteristics, such as interest rate, loan type and investor type. Impairment is recognized through a valuation reserve, to the extent that fair value is less than the carrying amount of servicing assets. Fair value in excess of the carrying amount of servicing assets is not recognized.
Deferred Income Tax Assets/Liabilities. The Company’s net deferred income tax asset arises from differences in the dates that items of income and expense enter into our reported income and taxable income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for these items as they arise. From an accounting standpoint, deferred tax assets are reviewed to determine if they are realizable based on the historical level of taxable income, estimates of future taxable income and the
reversals of deferred tax liabilities. In most cases, the realization of the deferred tax asset is based on future profitability. If the Company were to experience net operating losses for tax purposes in a future period, the realization of deferred tax assets would be evaluated for a potential valuation reserve.
Additionally, the Company reviews its uncertain tax positions annually. An uncertain tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is "more likely than not" that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be recognized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the "more likely than not" test, no tax benefit is recorded. A significant amount of judgment is applied to determine both whether the tax position meets the "more likely than not" test as well as to determine the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be recognized. Differences between the position taken by management and that of taxing authorities could result in a reduction of a tax benefit or increase to tax liability, which could adversely affect future income tax expense.
Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Core deposit and customer relationships, which are intangible assets with a finite life, are recorded on the Company’s balance sheets. These intangible assets were capitalized as a result of past acquisitions and are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of up to 15 years. Core deposit intangible assets, with finite lives will be tested for impairment when changes in events or circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. Core deposit intangible assets were tested for impairment during 2019 as part of the goodwill impairment test and no impairment was deemed necessary.
As a result of the Company’s acquisition activity, goodwill, an intangible asset with an indefinite life, is reflected on the balance sheets. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually, unless there are factors present that indicate a potential impairment, in which case, the goodwill impairment test is performed more frequently than annually.
Fair Value Measurements. The fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The Company estimates the fair value of a financial instrument using a variety of valuation methods. Where financial instruments are actively traded and have quoted market prices, quoted market prices are used for fair value. When the financial instruments are not actively traded, other observable market inputs, such as quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, may be used, if available, to determine fair value. When observable market prices do not exist, the Company estimates fair value. The Company’s valuation methods consider factors such as liquidity and concentration concerns. Other factors such as model assumptions, market dislocations, and unexpected correlations can affect estimates of fair value. Imprecision in estimating these factors can impact the amount of revenue or loss recorded.
ASC 820 establishes a framework for measuring the fair value of financial instruments that considers the attributes specific to particular assets or liabilities and establishes a three-level hierarchy for determining fair value based on the transparency of inputs to each valuation as of the fair value measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows:
•
Level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
•
Level 2 - inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices of identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
•
Level 3 - inputs that are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.
At the end of each quarter, the Company assesses the valuation hierarchy for each asset or liability measured. From time to time, assets or liabilities may be transferred within hierarchy levels due to changes in availability of observable market inputs to measure fair value at the measurement date. Transfers into or out of hierarchy levels are based upon the fair value at the beginning of the reporting period. A more detailed description of the fair values measured at each level of the fair value hierarchy can be found in Note 11 - “Disclosures of Fair Values of Financial Instruments.”
Results of Operations
Net Interest Income
The largest source of operating revenue for the Company is net interest income. Net interest income represents the difference between total interest income earned on earning assets and total interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The amount of interest income is dependent upon many factors, including the volume and mix of earning assets, the general level of interest rates and the dynamics of changes in interest rates. The cost of funds necessary to support earning assets varies with the volume and mix of interest-bearing liabilities and the rates paid to attract and retain such funds.
Net interest income is the excess of interest received from earning assets over interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. For analytical purposes, net interest income is presented on a full tax equivalent (TE) basis in the table that follows. The federal statutory rate in effect of 21% was used for all years. The TE analysis portrays the income tax benefits associated with the tax-exempt assets. The year-to-date net yield on interest-earning assets excluding the TE adjustments of $2,223,000, $2,152,000, and $2,025,000 for 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, were 3.20%, 3.58%, and 3.71% at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company’s average balances, fully tax equivalent interest income and interest expense, and rates earned or paid for major balance sheet categories are set forth in the following table (dollars in thousands):
(1)
Tax-exempt income is shown on a fully tax equivalent basis.
(2)
Nonaccrual loans have been included in the average balances. Balances are net of unaccreted discount related to loans acquired.
(3)
Includes loans held for sale
Changes in net interest income may also be analyzed by segregating the volume and rate components of interest income and interest expense. The following table summarizes the approximate relative contribution of changes in average volume and interest rates to changes in net interest income for the past two years (in thousands):
(1)
Changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate.
(2)
Nonaccrual loans have been included in the average balances. Balances are net of unaccreted discount related to loans acquired.
Net interest income on a tax-effected basis increased $1.8 million or 1.4% in 2020 compared to an increase of $14.1 million or 12.4% in 2019. Net interest income on a tax-effected basis increased primarily due to the growth in average earnings assets including loans and interest-bearing deposits. The tax-effected net interest margin decreased primarily due to lower yields on loans and investments and less accretion income from acquisitions.
In 2020, average earning assets increased by $464.3 million, or 13.4%, and average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $247 million or 9.2%. In 2019, average earning assets increased by $478.1 million or 16.0% and average interest-bearing liabilities increased $338.1 million or 14.4% compared with 2018. Changes in average balances are shown below:
•
Average interest-bearing deposits held by the Company increased $74.4 million or 112.6% in 2020 compared to 2019. In 2019, average interest-bearing deposits held by the Company increased $38.2 million or 136.8% compared to 2018.
•
Average federal funds sold increased $0.3 million or 42.7% in 2020 compared to 2019. In 2019, average federal funds sold increased $0.2 million or 30.9% compared to 2018.
•
Average certificates of deposit investments decreased $2.5 million or 39.5% in 2020 compared to 2020. In 2019, average certificates of deposit investments increased $3.2 million or 107% compared to 2018.
•
Average loans increased by $448.1 million or 17.2% in 2020 compared to 2019. In 2019, average loans increased by $322.2 million or 14.2% compared to 2018.
•
Average securities decreased by $56.1 million or 7% in 2020 compared to 2019. In 2019, average securities increased by $114.3 million or 16.6% compared to 2018.
•
Average interest-bearing deposit liabilities increased by $186.6 million or 7.9% in 2020 compared to 2019. In 2019, average deposits increased by $309.6 million or 15% compared to 2018.
•
Average securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased by $49.9 million or 29.4% in 2020 compared to 2019. In 2019, average securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased by $28.8 million or 20.5% compared to 2018.
•
Average borrowings and other debt increased by $10.5 million or 7.6% in 2020 compared to 2019. In 2019, average borrowings and other debt decreased by $.3 million or 0.2% compared to 2018.
•
Net interest margin decreased to 3.27% compared to 3.64% in 2019 and 3.79% in 2018. Asset yields decreased by 65 basis points in 2020, and interest- bearing liabilities decreased by 33 basis points.
Provision for Loan Losses
The provision for loan losses in 2020 was $16,103,000 compared to $6,433,000 in 2019 and $8,667,000 in 2018. Nonperforming loans increased to $28,123,000 at December 31, 2020 from $27,818,000 at December 31, 2019 and $29,749,000 at December 31, 2018. The increase in provision expense in 2020 was primarily due to the adoption of ASU 2016-13 and additional provision due to impacts of COVID-19 on borrower operations and earnings. The decrease in provision expense in 2019 was primarily due to the decrease in nonperforming loans. Net charge-offs were $2,776,000 during 2020, $5,711,000 during 2019 and $2,455,000 during 2018. For information on loan loss experience and nonperforming loans, see “Nonperforming Loans and Repossessed Assets” and “Loan Quality and Allowance for credit losses” herein.
Other Income
An important source of the Company’s revenue is derived from other income. The following table sets forth the major components of other income for the last three years (in thousands):
Total non-interest income increased to $59.5 million in 2020 compared to $56.0 million in 2019 and $35.4 million in 2018. The primary reasons for the more significant year-to-year changes in other income components are as follows:
•
Wealth management revenues increased in 2020 due to an increase in farm real estate brokerage fees and investment brokerage commissions offset by declines in market-based fees and farm management income. The increase in 2019 was due to increases in market value and revenue from defined contribution and other retirement accounts, an increase in revenue from brokerage accounts from new business development efforts and farm management and brokerage services and additional trust accounts added with the acquisition of Soy Capital. Total assets under management were $4.5 billion at December 31, 2020 compared to $4.3 billion at December 31, 2019 and $3.9 billion at December 31, 2018.
•
Insurance commissions increased in 2020 primarily due to increases in contract bond revenue and contingency income. During 2019, the growth was primarily due to an increase in insurance activities and revenues following the acquisition of SCB.
•
Fees from service charges decreased in 2020 due to a decline in overdraft fees primarily resulting from increased assistance related to COVID-19 such as stimulus payments and increased unemployment benefits and less spending during the shelter-in-place period. The increase in 2019 was primarily due to additional income from SCB transactions offset by a decrease in service charges based on the number of transactions.
•
Net securities gains in 2020 were $1,106,000 compared to $802,000 in 2019 and $901,000 in 2018. Sale of securities in 2020 resulted in greater net securities gains compared to the same period last year due to an increase in called securities resulting from the decline in interest rates during the first quarter of 2020.
•
The increase in mortgage banking income during 2020 was due to an increase in mortgage refinancing activity and fees from loans sold in the secondary market. Loans sold balances were as follows:
•
$196 million (representing 1,315 loans) in 2020
•
$101 million (representing 741 loans) in 2019
•
$62 million (representing 489 loans) in 2018
First Mid Bank generally releases the servicing rights on loans sold into the secondary market.
•
Revenue from ATMs and debit cards increased in 2020 and 2019 primarily due to an increase in electronic transactions.
•
Bank owned life insurance decreased during 2020 due to a slight decline in the change in cash surrender value compared to the same period last year. The increase during 2019 was primarily due to $13.6 million in bank owned life insurance acquired in the SCB acquisition.
•
Other income decreased during 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to an increase in waived fees and decreases in fees charged, and activity from First Mid Captive that did not occur in the same period last year, offset by fee income received from derivative transactions. The increase in 2019 is primarily due to increases in miscellaneous fees and revenues from the SCB and First Bank acquisitions.
Other Expense
The major categories of other expense include salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expenses and other operating expenses associated with day-to-day operations. The following table sets forth the major components of other expense for the last three years (in thousands):
Total non-interest expense decreased to $111.1 million in 2020 from $112 million in 2019 and increased from $90 million in 2018. The primary reasons for the more significant year-to-year changes in other expense components are as follows:
•
Salaries and employee benefits, the largest component of other expense, increased primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation and commissions, group insurance expense, share-based compensation expense and increases for merit raises and applicable payroll taxes. The increase in 2019 is primarily due to additional employees from the First Bank and SCB acquisitions for all of 2019 and merit increases in 2019 for continuing employees during the first quarter of 2019. There were 824 full-time equivalent employees at December 31, 2020, compared to 827 at December 31, 2019, and 818 at December 31, 2018.
•
Occupancy and equipment expense decreased due to a decline in expenses for software and uncapitalized equipment. The increase in 2019 was primarily due to increases in maintenance and repair expenses, rent expense, and building insurance related to the acquisition of First Bank and SCB.
•
Net other real estate owned expense decreased primarily due to more gains on properties sold during 2020 than properties sold during 2019 and a decrease in property maintenance expense due to less properties currently owned. The increase in 2019 was primarily due to more losses on properties sold during 2019 than during 2018.
•
FDIC insurance expense increased due to less small business assessment credit applied during 2020 and an increase in assessment rates. The decrease in 2019 is primarily due to small business assessment credits received for the June and September FDIC insurance assessments. These amounts were reversed from previously accrued expense.
•
Amortization of other intangibles expense decreased during 2020 due to less amortization for core deposit intangibles. The increase in 2019 was due to amortization of additional core deposit intangibles from the First Bank and SCB acquisitions, customer list intangibles from the SCB.
•
ATM and debit card expenses decreased primarily due to growth incentives received that reduced expense. The increase in 2019 was primarily due to an increase in electronic transactions following the First Bank and SCB acquisitions that occurred in the second and fourth quarter of 2018.
•
Other operating expenses decreased during 2020 due to decreases in loan collection expense, business entertainment and seminar expenses and acquisition costs offset by increases in data processing costs. The increase in 2019 is primarily due to an increase in loan collection expenses and costs associated with the merger of SCB into First Mid Bank.
•
On a net basis, all other categories of operating expenses decreased during 2020 due to declines in marketing and promotion expenses offset by an increase in legal and professional fees. The increase in 2019 was primarily due to an increase in legal and professional fees primarily associated with the acquisitions of First Bank and SCB.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense amounted to $14,472,000 in 2020 compared to $15,323,000 in 2019, and $11,905,000 in 2018. Effective tax rates were 24.2% for 2020, 24.2% for 2019, and 24.5% for 2018. The Company files U.S. federal and state of Illinois, Indiana, and Missouri income tax returns. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal or state income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2017.
Analysis of Balance Sheets
Securities
The Company’s overall investment objectives are to insulate the investment portfolio from undue credit risk, maintain adequate liquidity, insulate capital against changes in market value and control excessive changes in earnings while optimizing investment performance. The types and maturities of securities purchased are primarily based on the Company’s current and projected liquidity and interest rate sensitivity positions. The following table sets forth the amortized cost of the available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities for the last three years (dollars in thousands):
At December 31, 2020, the amortized cost of the Company’s investment portfolio increased by $116.4 million from December 31, 2019. When purchasing investment securities, the Company considers its overall liquidity and interest rate risk profile, as well as the adequacy of expected returns relative to the risks assumed.
The table below presents the credit ratings as of December 31, 2020 for certain investment securities (in thousands):
(1)
Credit ratings reflect the lowest current rating assigned by a nationally recognized credit rating agency.
(2)
Mortgage-backed securities include mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) issues from the following government sponsored enterprises: FHLMC, FNMA, GNMA and FHLB. While MBS and CMOs are no longer explicitly rated by credit rating agencies, the industry recognizes that they are backed by agencies which have an implied government guarantee.
Loans
The loan portfolio (net of unearned interest) is the largest category of the Company’s earning assets. The following table summarizes the composition of the loan portfolio, including loans held for sale, for the last five years (in thousands):
Loan balances increased by $443.1 million or 16.4% from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 of which approximately $183 million were loans purchased from Stifel Bank and $168.3 million were PPP loans. Loan balances increased by $50.8 million or 1.9% from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019 primarily due to increases in balances of commercial real estate and construction and land development. The balances of loans sold into the secondary market were $196.4 million in 2020 compared to $101.4 million in 2019. The balance of real estate loans held for sale, included in the balances shown above, amounted to $1,924,000 and $1,820,000 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Commercial and commercial real estate loans generally involve higher credit risks than residential real estate and consumer loans. Because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate or equipment are often dependent upon the successful operation and management of the underlying assets, repayment of such loans may be influenced to a great extent by conditions in the market or the economy. The Company does not have any sub-prime mortgages or credit card loans outstanding which are also generally considered to be higher credit risk.
The following table summarizes the loan portfolio geographically by branch region as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in thousands):
Loans are geographically dispersed among these regions located in central and southwestern Illinois. While these regions have experienced some economic stress during 2020 and 2019, the Company does not consider these locations high risk areas since these regions have not experienced the significant volatility in real estate values seen in some other areas in the United States.
The Company does not have a concentration, as defined by the regulatory agencies, in construction and land development loans or commercial real estate loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital for the periods shown above. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company did have industry loan concentrations in excess of 25% of total risk-based capital in the following industries (dollars in thousands):
The concentration of nursing care facilities (skilled nursing) industries was less than 25% of total risk-based capital as of December 31, 2019 however is shown for comparative purposes. The Company had no further industry loan concentrations in excess of 25% of total risk-based capital.
The following table presents the balance of loans outstanding as of December 31, 2020, by contractual maturities (in thousands):
(1)
Based upon remaining contractual maturity.
(2)
Includes demand loans, past due loans and overdrafts.
As of December 31, 2020, loans with maturities over one year consisted of approximately $2.1 billion in fixed rate loans and approximately $502.2 million in variable rate loans. The loan maturities noted above are based on the contractual provisions of the individual loans. The Company has no general policy regarding renewals and borrower requests, which are handled on a case-by-case basis.
Nonperforming Loans and Nonperforming Other Assets
Nonperforming loans include: (a) loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis; (b) accruing loans contractually past due ninety days or more as to interest or principal payments; and (c) loans not included in (a) and (b) above which are defined as “troubled debt restructurings”. Repossessed assets include primarily repossessed real estate and automobiles.
The Company’s policy is to discontinue the accrual of interest income on any loan for which principal or interest is ninety days past due. The accrual of interest is discontinued earlier when, in the opinion of management, there is reasonable doubt as to the timely collection of interest or principal. Once interest accruals are discontinued, accrued but uncollected interest is charged against current year income. Subsequent receipts on non-accrual loans are recorded as a reduction of principal, and interest income is recorded only after principal recovery is reasonably assured. Nonaccrual loans are returned to accrual status when, in the opinion of management, the financial position of the borrower indicates there is no longer any reasonable doubt as to the timely collection of interest or principal.
Troubled debt restructurings are loans on which, due to deterioration in the borrower’s financial condition, the original terms have been modified in favor of the borrower or either principal or interest has been forgiven. Repossessed assets represent property acquired as the result of borrower defaults on loans. These assets are recorded at estimated fair value, less estimated selling costs, at the time of foreclosure or repossession. Write-downs occurring at foreclosure are charged against the allowance for credit losses. On an ongoing basis, properties are appraised as required by market indications and applicable regulations. Write-downs for subsequent declines in value are recorded in non-interest expense in other real estate owned along with other expenses related to maintaining the properties.
The following table presents information concerning the aggregate amount of nonperforming loans and repossessed assets (in thousands):
The $1.4 million decrease in nonaccrual loans during 2020 resulted from the net of $10.8 million of loans put on nonaccrual status, offset by $0.6 million of loans transferred to other real estate owned, $2.3 million of loans charged off and $9.2 million of loans becoming current or paid-off. The amounts above do not include loans formerly identified as TDRs by SCB.
The following table summarizes the composition of nonaccrual loans (in thousands):
Interest income that would have been reported if nonaccrual and restructured loans had been performing totaled $575,000, $906,000 and $1,189,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 20189 and 2018, respectively.
The $1,227,000 decrease in repossessed assets during 2020 resulted from the net of $835,000 of additional assets repossessed, $2,353,000 of repossessed assets sold and a $291,000 adjustment to a discount recorded at acquisition. The following table summarizes the composition of repossessed assets (in thousands):
Repossessed assets sold during 2020 resulted in total net gains of $107,000, of which $127,000 of net gains was related to real estate asset sales and $20,000 of net losses was related to other repossessed assets sales.
Loan Quality and Allowance for Credit Losses
The allowance for credit losses represents management’s estimate of the reserve necessary to adequately account for probable losses existing in the current portfolio. The provision for credit losses is the charge against current earnings that is determined by management as the amount needed to maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses. In determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, and therefore the provision to be charged to current earnings, management relies predominantly on a disciplined credit review and approval process that extends to the full range of the Company’s credit exposure. The review process is directed by overall lending policy and is intended to identify, at the earliest possible stage, borrowers who might be facing financial difficulty. Once identified, the magnitude of exposure to individual borrowers is quantified in the form of specific allocations of the allowance for credit losses. Management considers collateral values and guarantees in the determination of such specific allocations. Additional factors considered by management in evaluating the overall adequacy of the allowance include historical net loan losses, the level and composition of nonaccrual, past due and renegotiated loans, trends in volumes and terms of loans, effects of changes in risk selection and underwriting standards or lending practices, lending staff changes, concentrations of credit, industry conditions and the current economic conditions in the region where the Company operates.
Management reviews economic factors including the potential for reduced cash flow for commercial operating loans from reduction in sales or increased operating costs, decreased occupancy rates for commercial buildings, reduced levels of home sales for commercial land developments, the uncertainty regarding grain prices, increased operating costs for farmers, and increased levels of unemployment and bankruptcy impacting consumers’ ability to pay. Each of these economic uncertainties was taken into consideration in developing the level of the reserve. Management considers the allowance for credit losses a critical accounting policy.
Management recognizes there are risk factors that are inherent in the Company’s loan portfolio. All financial institutions face risk factors in their loan portfolios because risk exposure is a function of the business. The Company’s operations (and therefore its loans) are concentrated in east central Illinois, an area where agriculture is the dominant industry. Accordingly, lending and other business relationships with agriculture-based businesses are critical to the Company’s success. At December 31, 2020, the Company’s loan portfolio included $391.7 million of loans to borrowers whose businesses are directly related to agriculture. Of this amount, $308.2 million was concentrated in other grain farming. Total loans to borrowers whose businesses are directly related to agriculture increased $15.3 million from $376.4 million at December 31, 2019 while loans concentrated in other grain farming increased $6.7 million from $301.5 million at December 31, 2019. While the Company adheres to sound underwriting practices, including collateralization of loans, any extended period of low commodity prices, drought conditions, significantly reduced yields on crops and/or reduced levels of government assistance to the agricultural industry could result in an increase in the level of problem agriculture loans and potentially result in loan losses within the agricultural portfolio. In addition, the Company has $124.8 million of loans to motels and hotels. The performance of these loans is dependent on borrower specific issues as well as the general level of business and personal travel within the region. While the Company adheres to sound underwriting standards, a prolonged period of reduced business or personal travel could result in an increase in nonperforming loans to this business segment and potentially in loan losses. The Company also has $420.2 million of loans to lessors of non-residential buildings, $313.3 million of loans to lessors of residential buildings and dwellings, $119.5 million of loans to other gambling industries and $114.9 million of loans to nursing care facilities.
The structure of the Company’s loan approval process is based on progressively larger lending authorities granted to individual loan officers, loan committees, and ultimately the Board of Directors. Outstanding balances to one borrower or affiliated borrowers are limited by federal regulation; however, limits well below the regulatory thresholds are generally observed. Most of the Company’s loans are to businesses located in the geographic market areas served by the Company’s branch bank system. Additionally, a significant portion of the collateral securing the loans in the portfolio is located within the Company’s primary geographic footprint. In general, the Company adheres to loan underwriting standards consistent with industry guidelines for all loan segments.
The Company minimizes credit risk by adhering to sound underwriting and credit review policies. Management and the Board of Directors of the Company review these policies at least annually. Senior management is actively involved in business development efforts and the maintenance and monitoring of credit underwriting and approval. The loan review system and controls are designed to identify, monitor and address asset quality problems in an accurate and timely manner. On a quarterly basis, the Board of Directors and management review the status of problem loans and determine a best estimate of the allowance. In addition to internal policies and controls, regulatory authorities periodically review asset quality and the overall adequacy of the allowance for credit losses.
Analysis of the allowance for credit losses for the past five years and of changes in the allowance for these periods is summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):
The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 149% as of December 31, 2020 compared to 96.7% as of December 31, 2019. The increase in this ratio is primarily due to changes in methodology following adoption of ASU 2016-13 and allowance allocated for the increase in performing loan balances. The amounts above do not include loans formerly identified as TDRs by Soy Capital Bank. Management believes that the overall estimate of the allowance for credit losses appropriately accounts for probable losses attributable to current exposures.
During 2020, the Company had net charge-offs of $2,776,000 compared to $5,711,000 in 2019. During 2020, there were significant charge-offs of eight commercial real estate loans to five borrowers of $760,000 and significant charge-offs of eleven commercial operating loans to five borrowers of $1.7 million. During 2019, there were significant charge-offs of seven commercial real estate loans to five borrowers of $1.8 million and significant charge-offs of six commercial operating loans to five borrowers of $1.9 million.
At December 31, 2020, the allowance for credit losses amounted to $41.9 million or 1.34% of total loans. Excluding the fully guaranteed PPP loans, the ratio of allowance for credit losses to loans outstanding was 1.41%. At December 31, 2019, the allowance for credit losses amounted to $26.9 million or 1.00% of total loans. The allowance is allocated to the individual loan categories by a specific allocation for all classified loans plus a percentage of loans not classified based on historical losses and other factors. The allowance for credit losses, in management's judgment, was allocated as follows to cover probable loan losses (dollars in thousands):
Deposits
Funding of the Company’s earning assets is substantially provided by a combination of consumer, commercial and public fund deposits. The Company continues to focus its strategies and emphasis on retail core deposits, the major component of funding sources. The following table sets forth the average deposits and weighted average rates for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):
The following table sets forth the high and low month-end balances for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):
In 2020, the average balance of deposits increased by $356 million from 2019. The increase was primarily the result of deposit balances acquired from Stifel Bank and increases in customer balances due to stimulus payments and PPP loan funds received. Average non-interest bearing deposits increased $169.3 million, interest-bearing deposits increased by $253.5 million, savings accounts increased by $31.7 million, and time deposits decreased $98.5 million. In 2019, the average balance of deposits increased by $410.8 million from 2018. The increase was primarily the result of deposit balances acquired in the acquisition of First Bank during the second quarter of 2018 and the acquisition of SCB during the fourth quarter of 2018. Average non-interest bearing deposits increased $101.2 million, interest-bearing deposits increased by $109.7 million, savings accounts increased by $42.5 million, and time deposits increased $157.3 million.
Balances of time deposits of $100,000 or more include time deposits maintained for public fund entities and consumer time deposits. The following table sets forth the maturity of time deposits of $100,000 or more (in thousands):
The balance of time deposits of $100,000 or more decreased $57.6 million from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to time deposits that matured and were not renewed or replaced. The balance of time deposits of $100,000 or more increased $13 million from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019. The increase in 2019 was primarily due to the deposits added through acquisitions.
In 2020 the Company maintained account relationships with various public entities throughout its market areas. Ninety-nine public entities had total balances of $227.6 million in various checking accounts and time deposits as of December 31, 2020. These balances are subject to change depending upon the cash flow needs of the public entity.
Repurchase Agreements and Other Borrowings
Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are short-term obligations of First Mid Bank. These obligations are collateralized with certain government securities that are direct obligations of the United States or one of its agencies. These retail repurchase agreements are a cash management service to its corporate customers. Other borrowings consist of Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances, federal funds purchased, loans (short-term or long-term debt) that the Company has outstanding, subordinated debt and junior subordinated debentures.
Information relating to securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings as December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 is presented below (in thousands):
Securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased $1.2 million during 2020 primarily due to the seasonal demands in balances and change in cash flow needs of various customers. FHLB advances represent borrowings by the First Mid Bank to economically fund loan demand.
At December 31, 2020 FHLB advances totaled $94 million with weighted-average interest rates of 1.57% and maturities from February 2021 to December 2029. At December 31, 2019 the advances totaling $114.0 million with weighted-average interest rates of 1.87% and maturities from January 2020 to December 2029.
The Company is party to a revolving credit agreement with The Northern Trust Company in the amount of $15 million. The balance on this line of credit was $0 as of December 31, 2020. This loan was renewed on April 10,2020 for one year as a revolving credit agreement with a maximum available balance of $15 million. The interest rate is floating at 2.25% over the federal funds rate (2.34% and 3.80% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively). The loan is secured by all of the stock of First Mid Bank. The Company and its subsidiary banks were in compliance with the then existing covenants at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
On October 6, 2020, the Company issued and sold $96.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.95% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2030 (the “Notes”). The Notes were issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of October 6, 2020 (the “Base Indenture”), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of October 6, 2020 (the “Supplemental Indenture”), between the Company and the Trustee. The Base Indenture, as amended and supplemented by the Supplemental Indenture, governs the terms of the Notes and provides that the Notes are unsecured, subordinated debt obligations of the Company and will mature on October 15, 2030. From and including the date of issuance to, but excluding October 15, 2025, the Notes will bear interest at an initial rate of 3.95% per annum. From and including October 15, 2025 to, but excluding the maturity date or earlier redemption, the Notes will bear interest at a floating rate equal to three-month Term SOFR plus a spread of 383 basis points,
or such other rate as determined pursuant to the Supplemental Indenture, provided that in no event shall the applicable floating interest rate be less than zero per annum.
The Company may, beginning with the interest payment date of October 15, 2025, and on any interest payment date thereafter, redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the date of redemption. The Company may also redeem the Notes at any time, including prior to October 15, 2025, at the Company’s option, in whole but not in part, if: (i) a change or prospective change in law occurs that could prevent the Company from deducting interest payable on the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes; (ii) a subsequent event occurs that could preclude the Notes from being recognized as Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital purposes; or (iii) the Company is required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended; in each case, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the redemption date. At December 31, 2020, the recorded balance of the subordinated notes was $94,253,000.
On February 27, 2004, the Company completed the issuance and sale of $10 million of floating rate trust preferred securities through First Mid-Illinois Statutory Trust I (“Trust I”), a statutory business trust and wholly-owned unconsolidated subsidiary of the Company, as part of a pooled offering. On October 7, 2019, these trust preferred securities were redeemed, along with $310,000 in common securities issued by Trust I and held by the Company, as a result of the concurrent redemption of 100% of he Company's junior subordinated debentures due 2034 and held by Trust I, which supported the trust preferred securities. The redemption price for the junior subordinated debentures was equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest, if any, up to, but not including, the redemption date of October 7, 2019. The proceeds from the redemption of the junior subordinated debentures were simultaneously applied to redeem all of the outstanding common securities and the outstanding trust preferred securities at a price of 100% of the aggregate liquidation amount of the trust preferred securities plus accumulated but unpaid distributions up to but not including the redemption date. The redemption was made pursuant to the optional redemption provision of the underlying indenture.
On April 26, 2006, the Company completed the issuance and sale of $10 million of fixed/floating rate trust preferred securities through First Mid-Illinois Statutory Trust II (“Trust II”), a statutory business trust and wholly-owned unconsolidated subsidiary of the Company, as part of a pooled offering. The Company established Trust II for the purpose of issuing the trust preferred securities. The $10 million in proceeds from the trust preferred issuance and an additional $310,000 for the Company’s investment in common equity of Trust II, a total of $10,310 000, was invested in junior subordinated debentures of the Company. The underlying junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company to Trust II mature in 2036, bore interest at a fixed rate of 6.98% paid quarterly until June 15, 2011 and then converted to floating rate (LIBOR plus 160 basis points) after June 15, 2011 1.82% and 3.49% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively). The net proceeds to the Company were used for general corporate purposes, including the Company’s acquisition of Mansfield Bancorp, Inc. in 2006.
On September 8, 2016, the Company assumed the trust preferred securities of Clover Leaf Statutory Trust I (“CLST I”), a statutory business trust that was a wholly owned unconsolidated subsidiary of First Clover Financial. The $4,000,000 of trust preferred securities and an additional $124,000 additional investment in common equity of CLST I, is invested in junior subordinated debentures issued to CLST I. The subordinated debentures mature in 2025, bear interest at three-month LIBOR plus 185 basis points (2.07% and 3.74% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively) and resets quarterly.
On May 1, 2018, the Company assumed the trust preferred securities of FBTC Statutory Trust I (“FBTCST I”), a statutory business trust that was a wholly owned unconsolidated subsidiary of First BancTrust Corporation. The $6,000,000 of trust preferred securities and an additional $186,000 additional investment in common equity of FBTCST I is invested in junior subordinated debentures issued to FBTCST I. The subordinated debentures mature in 2035, bear interest at three-month LIBOR plus 170 basis points (1.92% and 3.59% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively) and resets quarterly.
The trust preferred securities issued by Trust II, CLST I, and FBTCST I are included as Tier 1 capital of the Company for regulatory capital purposes. On March 1, 2005, the Federal Reserve Board adopted a final rule that allows the continued limited inclusion of trust preferred securities in the calculation of Tier 1 capital for regulatory purposes. The final rule provided a five-year transition period, ending September 30, 2010, for application of the revised quantitative limits. On March 17, 2009, the Federal Reserve Board adopted an additional final rule that delayed the effective date of the new limits on inclusion of trust preferred securities in the calculation of Tier 1 capital until March 31, 2012. The application of the revised quantitative limits did not and is not expected to have a significant impact on its calculation of Tier 1 capital for regulatory purposes or its classification as well-capitalized. The Dodd-Frank Act, signed into law July 21, 2010, removes trust preferred securities as a permitted component of a holding company’s Tier 1 capital after a three-year phase-in period beginning January 1, 2013 for larger holding companies. For holding companies with less than $15 billion in consolidated assets, existing issues of trust preferred securities are grandfathered and not subject to this new restriction. New issuances of trust preferred securities, however would not count as Tier 1 regulatory capital.
In addition to requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act discussed above, the act also required the federal banking agencies to adopt rules that prohibit banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring certain unregistered investment companies (defined as hedge funds and private equity funds). This rule is generally referred to as the “Volcker Rule.” On December 10, 2013, the federal banking agencies issued final rules to implement the prohibitions required by the Volcker Rule. Following the publication of the final rule, and in reaction to concerns in the banking industry regarding the adverse impact the final rule’s treatment of certain collateralized debt instruments has on community banks, the federal banking agencies approved a final rule to permit banking entities to retain interests in certain collateralized debt obligations backed primarily by trust preferred securities. Under the final rule, the agencies permit the retention of an interest in or sponsorship of covered funds by banking entities under $15 billion in assets if (1) the collateralized debt obligation was established and issued prior to May 19, 2010, (2) the banking entity reasonably believes that the offering proceeds received by the collateralized debt obligation were invested primarily in qualifying trust preferred collateral, and (3) the banking entity’s interests in the collateralized debt obligation was acquired on or prior to December 10, 2013. Although the Volcker Rule impacts many large banking entities, the Company does not currently anticipate that the Volcker Rule will have a material effect on the operations of the Company, First Mid Bank or Providence Bank.
Interest Rate Sensitivity
The Company seeks to maximize its net interest margin while maintaining an acceptable level of interest rate risk. Interest rate risk can be defined as the amount of forecasted net interest income that may be gained or lost due to changes in the interest rate environment, a variable over which management has no control. Interest rate risk, or sensitivity, arises when the maturity or repricing characteristics of interest-bearing assets differ significantly from the maturity or repricing characteristics of interest-bearing liabilities. The Company monitors its interest rate sensitivity position to maintain a balance between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities. This balance serves to limit the adverse effects of changes in interest rates. The Company’s asset liability management committee (ALCO) oversees the interest rate sensitivity position and directs the overall allocation of funds.
In the banking industry, a traditional way to measure potential net interest income exposure to changes in interest rates is through a technique known as “static GAP” analysis which measures the cumulative differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities maturing or repricing at various intervals. By comparing the volumes of interest-bearing assets and liabilities that have contractual maturities and repricing points at various times in the future, management can gain insight into the amount of interest rate risk embedded in the balance sheet.
The following table sets forth the Company’s interest rate repricing GAP for selected maturity periods at December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands):
The static GAP analysis shows that at December 31, 2020, the Company was asset sensitive, on a cumulative basis, through the twelve-month time horizon. This indicates that future decreases in interest rates could have an adverse effect on net interest income. There are several ways the Company measures and manages the exposure to interest rate sensitivity, including static GAP analysis. The Company’s ALCO also uses other financial models to project interest income under various rate scenarios and prepayment/extension assumptions consistent with First Mid Bank’s historical experience and with known industry trends. ALCO meets at least monthly to review the Company’s exposure to interest rate changes as indicated by the various techniques and to make necessary changes in the composition terms and/or rates of the assets and liabilities.

Stock Plans
Deferred Compensation Plan. The Company follows the provisions of the Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 97-14, “Accounting for Deferred Compensation Arrangements Where Amounts Earned Are Held in a Rabbi Trust and Invested” (“EITF 97-14”), which was codified into ASC 710-10, for purposes of the First Mid-Illinois Bancshares, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (“DCP”). At December 31, 2020, the Company classified the cost basis of its common stock issued and held in trust in connection with the DCP of approximately $4,241,000 as treasury stock. The Company also classified the cost basis of its related deferred compensation obligation of approximately $4,241,000 as an equity instrument (deferred compensation).
The DCP was effective as of June 1984. The purpose of the DCP is to enable directors, advisory directors, and key employees the opportunity to defer a portion of the fees and cash compensation paid by the Company as a means of maximizing the effectiveness and flexibility of compensation arrangements. The Company invests all participants’ deferrals in shares of common stock. Dividends paid on the shares are credited to participants’ DCP accounts and invested in additional shares. The Company issued, pursuant to DCP:
•
12,921 common shares during 2020
•
11,072 common shares during 2019, and
•
9,043 common shares during 2018
First Retirement and Savings Plan. The First Retirement Savings Plan ("401(k) plan") was effective beginning in 1985. Employees are eligible to participate in the 401(k) plan after three months of service with the Company. The Company offers common stock as an investment option for participants of the 401(k) plan. Beginning in 2016, shares for the 401(k) plan were purchased in the open market instead of being issued by the Company.
Dividend Reinvestment Plan. The Dividend Reinvestment Plan (“DRIP”) was effective as of October 1994. The purpose of the DRIP is to provide participating stockholders with a simple and convenient method of investing cash dividends paid by the Company on its common and preferred shares into newly issued common shares of the Company. All holders of record of the Company’s common or preferred stock are eligible to voluntarily participate in the DRIP. The DRIP is administered by Computershare Investor Services, LLC and offers a way to increase one’s investment in the Company. Of the $13,494,000 in common stock dividends paid during 2020, $680,000 or 5% was reinvested into shares of common stock of the Company through the DRIP. Approximately $680,000, $805,000 and $1,099,000 of common stock was purchased through reinvestment of dividends during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Stock Incentive Plan. At the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held April 26, 2017, the stockholders approved the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan ("SI Plan"). The SI Plan was implemented to succeed the Company’s 2007 Stock Incentive Plan, which had a ten-year term. The SI Plan is intended to provide a means whereby directors, employees, consultants and advisors of the Company and its Subsidiaries may sustain a sense of proprietorship and personal involvement in the continued development and financial success of the Company and its Subsidiaries, thereby advancing the interests of the Company and its stockholders. Accordingly, directors and selected employees, consultants and advisors may be provided the opportunity to acquire shares of Common Stock of the Company on the terms and conditions established in the SI Plan.
A maximum of 149,983 shares of common stock may be issued under the SI Plan. During 2020, 2019, and 2018, the Company awarded 25,950 and 26,700, and 28,700 shares as stock and stock unit awards, respectively. This SI Plan is more fully described in Note 13 - Stock Incentive Plan.
Stock Repurchase Program. Since August 5, 1998, the Board of Directors has approved repurchase programs pursuant to which the Company may repurchase a total of approximately $76.7 million of the Company’s common stock.
During 2020, the Company repurchased 6,288 shares (0.04% of common shares) at a total price of approximately $213,000. All of these shares were a result of shares withheld for taxes on vested employee stock incentives. During 2019, the Company repurchased 3,900 (0.02% of common shares) at a total price of approximately $138,000. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $4.7 million remains available for purchase under the repurchase programs. Treasury stock is further affected by activity in the DCP.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan. At the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held April 25, 2018, the stockholders approved the First Mid Bancshares, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). The ESPP provides eligible employees with the opportunity to purchase shares of common stock of the Company at a 5% discount through payroll deductions. The ESPP is intended to qualify as an employee stock purchase plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. A maximum of 600,000 shares of common stock may be issued under the ESPP. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, 11,037 and 8,899 shares, respectively were issued pursuant to ESPP.

Liquidity
Liquidity represents the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to meet all present and future financial obligations arising in the daily operations of the business. Financial obligations consist of the need for funds to meet extensions of credit, deposit withdrawals and debt servicing. The Company’s liquidity management focuses on the ability to obtain funds economically through assets that may be converted into cash at minimal costs or through other sources. The Company’s other sources of cash include overnight federal fund lines, Federal Home Loan Bank advances, the ability to borrow at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, and the Company’s operating line of credit with The Northern Trust Company. Details for these sources include:
•
First Mid Bank has $100 million available in overnight federal fund lines, including $30 million from First Horizon Bank, $20 million from U.S. Bank, N.A., $10 million from Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., $15 million from The Northern Trust Company and $25 million from Zions Bank. Availability of the funds is subject to First Mid Bank meeting minimum regulatory capital requirements for total capital to risk-weighted assets and Tier 1 capital to total average assets. As of December 31, 2020, First Mid Bank met these regulatory requirements.
•
First Mid Bank can borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank as a source of liquidity. Availability of the funds is subject to the pledging of collateral to the Federal Home Loan Bank. Collateral that can be pledged includes one-to-four family residential real estate loans and securities. At December 31, 2020, the excess collateral at the FHLB would support approximately $651.1 million of additional advances for First Mid Bank.
•
First Mid Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System and can borrow funds provided that sufficient collateral is pledged.
•
In addition, as of December 31, 2020, the Company had a revolving credit agreement in the amount of $15 million with The Northern Trust Company with an outstanding balance of $0 million and $15 million in available funds. This loan was renewed on April 10, 2020 for one year as a revolving credit agreement. The interest rate is floating at 2.25% over the federal funds rate. The loan is secured by all of the stock of First Mid Bank and includes requirements for operating and capital ratios. The Company and its subsidiary banks were in compliance with the existing covenants at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Management continues to monitor its expected liquidity requirements carefully, focusing primarily on cash flows from:
•
lending activities, including loan commitments, letters of credit and mortgage prepayment assumptions;
•
deposit activities, including seasonal demand of private and public funds;
•
investing activities, including prepayments of mortgage-backed securities and call provisions on U.S. Treasury and government agency securities; and
•
operating activities, including scheduled debt repayments and dividends to stockholders.

Effects of Inflation
Unlike industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of the Company are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on the Company’s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or experience the same magnitude of changes as goods and services, since such prices are affected by inflation. In the current economic environment, liquidity and interest rate adjustments are features of the Company’s assets and liabilities that are important to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels. The Company attempts to maintain a balance between monetary assets and monetary liabilities, over time, to offset these potential effects.
