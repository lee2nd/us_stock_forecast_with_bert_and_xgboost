Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties as described under the heading “Cautionary Note Regarding Our Forward-Looking Statements” elsewhere in this Report. You should review the disclosure under the heading “Risk Factors” in this Report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.
Overview
We are a nanotechnology company and sole owner, developer and manufacturer of the patented C-Bond technology. The Company is engaged in the implementation of proprietary nanotechnology applications and processes to enhance properties of strength, functionality and sustainability of brittle material systems. Our present primary focus is in the multi-billion-dollar glass and window film industry with target markets in the United States and internationally. We operate in two divisions: C-Bond Transportation Solutions and C-Bond Safety Solutions.
To date, we have filed, licensed and/or acquired a total of 22 individual patents and patent applications spanning core and strategic nano-technology applications and processes. Our intellectual property portfolio was recently valued at $33.7 million by a leading, independent, global intellectual property valuation firm. The IP valuation firm’s review covered the valuation of our intangible assets including our developed technology, trade name, customer relationships, and assembled workforce, and the Company’s determination of the fair value or other amounts of any assets and liabilities including current assets, real property, personal property, and current liabilities. Our developed technology includes C-Bond nanoShield, C-Bond Secure, and C-Bond BRS. The valuation firm also reviewed historical and projected financial information for the Company giving consideration to general economic and industry trends.
On April 25, 2018, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Acquisition Sub, merged with and into C-Bond Systems, LLC, pursuant to which C-Bond Systems, LLC was the surviving corporation and became our wholly-owned subsidiary. All of the outstanding membership interests of C-Bond Systems, LLC were converted into shares of our common stock, as described in more detail below. We changed our name to C-Bond Systems, Inc. on July 18, 2018.
On May 20, 2020, we entered into a two-year Distributor Agreement with an entity where we were appointed as a distributor to exclusively sell MB-10 Disinfectant Tablets for use in certain markets. MB-10 Disinfectant Tablets are the most convenient way yet to deliver the benefits of chlorine dioxide to hygiene or biosafety programs. MB-10 disinfectant tablets have one of the broadest, most complete EPA registration labels on the market. It is a safe, easy and effective way to disinfect a vehicle’s interior using an EPA registered disinfectant (Reg No.70060-19-46269) included on List N for use against human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. It is proven effective against emerging viral pathogens, including enveloped and large and small non-enveloped viruses. MB-10 Tablets provide fast-acting virus and bacteria protection that is safe for all vehicle surfaces including LED screens and electronics without leaving a residue or odor. We were appointed as a distributor to exclusively sell MB-10 Disinfectant Tablets for use in the following markets:
● Automotive, Trucking, RV, rental agencies (auto and truck), service vehicles (taxi, Uber, Lyft), mass transit (train, buses), golf carts, aviation, train, marine (potential future growth)
● School facilities and buses
● Dealerships
● Global Distribution
● Service Providers
● Transportation Detailing.
The following discussion highlights our results of operations and the principal factors that have affected our financial condition as well as our liquidity and capital resources for the periods described and provides information that management believes is relevant for an assessment and understanding of the statements of financial condition and results of operations presented herein. The following discussion and analysis are based on our consolidated financial statements contained in this Report, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). You should read the discussion and analysis together with such financial statements and the related notes thereto.
Operating Overview
We are a nanotechnology company and sole owner, developer and manufacturer of the patented C-Bond technology. We are engaged in the implementation of proprietary nanotechnology applications and processes to enhance properties of strength, functionality and sustainability of brittle material systems. Our present primary focus is in the multi-billion-dollar glass and window film industry with target markets in the United States and internationally. The Company operates in two divisions: C-Bond Transportation Solutions, which sells a windshield strengthening water repellent solution as well as a disinfection product, and C-Bond Safety Solutions, which sells multi-purpose glass strengthening primer and window film mounting solutions (“C-Bond Secure”), ballistic resistant film systems (C-Bond BRS”) and disinfection products. The C-Bond technology enables ordinary glass to dissipate energy by permeating the glass surface and detecting microscopic flaws and defects that are randomly distributed all over the glass surface. C-Bond’s unique qualities then work to locate and repair the identified surface imperfections that weaken the glass composite structure and ultimately act as failure initiators. The C-Bond formula is engineered to maintain original glass design integrity while increasing the mechanical performance properties of the glass unit. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic we created partnerships to distribute disinfection related products which we began to sell in the second quarter of 2020.
Revenue is generated by the sale of products through distributors and directly to dealers. C-Bond nanoShield and disinfection sales are generated through large distribution channels. Sales of C-Bond Secure are made to window film dealers who offer the product as an upsell during installation. Revenue is generated from the sale of C-Bond BRS on a project basis. C-Bond BRS is specified into project plans providing authorized installers a competitive advantage.
Product sales are recognized when the product is shipped to the customer and title is transferred and are recorded net of any discounts or allowances.
We anticipate continued losses requiring either revenue generation to achieve sustained profitability or obtaining additional financial resources to maintain operations as well as research and development into product performance and new product verticals.
COVID-19
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. We are monitoring this closely, and although operations have not been materially affected by the COVID-19 outbreak to date, the ultimate duration and severity of the outbreak and its impact on the economic environment and our business is uncertain. As of April 12, 2021, our facilities are open. However, we have seen a material decrease in sales from our international customers as a result of the unprecedented public health crisis from the COVID-19 pandemic and a decrease in domestic sales due to a decrease in business spending on discretionary items. As a result, our international customers have delayed the ordering of products and have delayed payment of balances due to us. Accordingly, we anticipate that there will be an impact on our operations. We cannot estimate the duration of the pandemic and potential impact on our business if customer’s business remains closed or if customers are otherwise unable or unwilling to make payments to us. In addition, a severe or prolonged economic downturn could result in a variety of risks to our business, including weakened demand for our products and a decreased ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. At this time, the Company is unable to estimate the impact of this event on its operations.
Critical Accounting Policies
The following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management continually evaluates such estimates, including those related to estimates for allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivable, the estimates for obsolete inventory, the useful life of property and equipment, assumptions used in assessing impairment of long-term assets, the fair value of a beneficial conversion feature, and the fair value of non-cash equity transactions. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Any future changes to these estimates and assumptions could cause a material change to our reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
Accounts receivable
The Company recognizes an allowance for losses on accounts receivable in an amount equal to the estimated probable losses net of recoveries. The allowance is based on an analysis of historical bad debt experience, current receivables aging, and expected future write-offs, as well as an assessment of specific identifiable customer accounts considered at risk or uncollectible. The expense associated with the allowance for doubtful accounts is recognized as general and administrative expense.
Inventory
Inventory, consisting of raw materials and finished goods, are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value utilizing the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. A reserve is established when management determines that certain inventories may not be saleable. If inventory costs exceed expected net realizable value due to obsolescence or quantities in excess of expected demand, the Company will record reserves for the difference between the cost and the net realizable value. These reserves are recorded based on estimates and included in cost of sales.
Revenue recognition
In May 2014, FASB issued an update Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) (“ASU 2014-09”) establishing Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”). ASU 2014-09, as amended by subsequent ASUs on the topic, establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most of the existing revenue recognition guidance. This standard, which is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years that begin after December 15, 2017, requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services and also requires certain additional disclosures. The Company adopted this standard in 2018 using the modified retrospective approach, which requires applying the new standard to all existing contracts not yet completed as of the effective date and recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. Based on an evaluation of the impact ASU 2014-09 will have on the Company’s sources of revenue, the Company has concluded that ASU 2014-09 did not have a material impact on the process for, timing of, and presentation and disclosure of revenue recognition from customers and there was no cumulative effect adjustment.
The Company sells its products primarily to distributors and authorized dealers. Product sales are recognized when the product is shipped to the customer and title is transferred and are recorded net of any discounts or allowances. The warranty does not represent a separate performance obligation.
Derivative financial instruments
We have had certain financial instruments that are embedded derivatives associated with capital raises. We evaluate all our financial instruments to determine if those contracts or any potential embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for in accordance with ASC 810-10-05-4 and 815-40. This accounting treatment requires that the carrying amount of any embedded derivatives be recorded at fair value at issuance and marked-to-market at each balance sheet date. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability, as is the case with the Company, the change in the fair value during the period is recorded as either other income or expense. Upon conversion, exercise or repayment, the respective derivative liability is marked to fair value at the conversion, repayment or exercise date and then the related fair value amount is reclassified to other income or expense as part of gain or loss on extinguishment.
In July 2017, FASB issued ASU No. 2017-11, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260); Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480); Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): (Part I) Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features. These amendments simplify the accounting for certain financial instruments with down-round features. The amendments require companies to disregard the down-round feature when assessing whether the instrument is indexed to its own stock, for purposes of determining liability or equity classification. The guidance was adopted as of January 1, 2019 and we elected to record the effect of this adoption, if any, retrospectively to outstanding financial instruments with a down round feature by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of the beginning of 2019, the period which the amendment is effective. The adoption of ASU No. 2017-11 had no effect on our financial position or results of operations.
Stock-based compensation
Stock-based compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of ASC 718 - “Compensation -Stock Compensation”, which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of employee, director, and non-employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the period the employee, director , or non-employee is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting period). The ASC also requires measurement of the cost of employee, director, and non-employee services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The Company has elected to recognize forfeitures as they occur as permitted under ASU 2016-09 Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment.
See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements.
Results of Operations
The following comparative analysis on results of operations was based primarily on the comparative consolidated financial statements, footnotes and related information for the periods identified below and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, which are included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. The results discussed below are for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Comparison of Results of Operations for the Years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Sales
For the year ended December 31, 2020, sales amounted to $658,432 as compared to $602,636 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $55,796, or 9.3%. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in C-Bond nanoshield solution sales of $97,737 and an increase in the sale of disinfection products of $250,208 in our new C-Bond Safety Solutions division, offset by a decrease in sales of C-Bond ballistic-resistant glass protection systems and C-Bond Secure window film solution of $275,160, and a decrease in installation and freight and delivery revenue of $16,989. The decrease in sales of C-Bond ballistic-resistant glass protection systems and C-Bond multi-purpose glass protection system was primarily due to a decrease in both domestic and international sales resulting from the shutdown of economies caused by COVID-19. These decreases were offset by the sale of disinfection products which consisted primarily of hand sanitizer and MB-10 Tablets and related products.
Cost of Goods Sold
Cost of goods sold is comprised primarily of inventory sold, packaging costs, and warranty costs.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, cost of sales amounted to $242,506, or 36.8% of sales, as compared to $121,967, or 20.2% of sales, for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $120,539, or 98.8%. The increase in cost of sales was primarily due to an increase in cost of sales related to disinfection products offset by a decrease in sales of C-Bond ballistic-resistant glass protection systems and C-Bond Secure window film application solution.
Gross Profit
For the year ended December 31, 2020, gross profit amounted to $415,926, or 63.2% of sales, as compared to $480,669, or 79.8% of sales, for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $64,743, or 13.5%. This decrease in gross profits is primarily the result of the reduction in sales of C-Bond BRS sales and an implemented price decrease on C-Bond Secure window film application solution. Additionally, gross profit generated from the sale of disinfection products is lower than gross profits generated from the sale of BRS products.
Operating Expenses
For the year ended December 31, 2020, operating expenses amounted to $4,892,959 as compared to $6,839,281 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $1,946,322, or 28.5%. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, operating expenses consisted of the following:
Compensation and related benefits
For the year ended December 31, 2020, compensation and related benefits decreased by $1,618,625, or 30.2%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation of $1,750,495, offset by an increase in executive compensation of $131,870. During the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, stock-based compensation related to the accretion of stock-option expense and other stock-based compensation amounted to $2,108,472 and $3,858,967, respectively, a decrease of $1,750,495.
Research and development
Research and development expenses consist primarily of contracted development services, third party testing laboratories, materials used and allocated overhead expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2020, research and development expense decreased by $14,430, or 46.5%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in research and development expense is primarily related to a decrease in use of contracted development services due a lack of working capital and business impacted by the COVID-19 global pandemic.
We believe continued investment is important to attaining our strategic objectives and expect research and development expenses to increase in the foreseeable future, if working capital is available.
Professional fees
For the year ended December 31, 2020, professional fees decreased by $439,466, or 44.6%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease primarily related to a decrease in legal fees of $86,923 and a decrease in consulting fees of $438,855, offset by an increase in investor relations fees of $111,297. During the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, stock-based professional fees amounted to $132,892 and $355,393, respectively, a decrease of $222,501.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of rent, insurance, depreciation expense, sale and marketing, delivery and freight, travel and entertainment, and other office expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2020, general and administrative expenses increased by $126,199, or 27.3%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in bad debt expense of $201,488 offset by a decrease in travel of $74,119. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase due to the anticipated growth of our business.
Loss from Operations
For the year ended December 31, 2020, loss from operations decreased by $1,881,579, or 29.6%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
Other Income (Expenses), net
For the year ended December 31, 2020, other income, net amounted to $42,590 as compared to other expenses, net of $(882,128) for the year ended December 31, 2019, a positive change of $924,718, or 104.8%. This change was due to a decrease in derivative expense of $479,436 attributable to the recording of or extinguishment of derivative liabilities related to convertible debt and due to the recording of a gain from debt extinguishment which increased over the 2019 period by $846,814 related to the conversion of convertible debt and the settlement of accounts payable, offset by an increase in interest expense of $408,106 related to the amortization of debt discount, an increase in interest-bearing debt, and an increase in interest expense related to accretion of debt discount related to Series A preferred shares.
Net Loss
For the year ended December 31, 2020, net loss amounted to $4,434,443, or $(0.03) per common share (basic and diluted), as compared to $7,240,740, or $(0.08) per common share (basic and diluted), for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $2,806,297. The decrease in net loss was primarily attributable to a decrease in operating expenses and a decrease in other expenses as discussed above.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity is the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs for cash requirements. We had cash of $323,407 and $77,211 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Our primary uses of cash have been for salaries, fees paid to third parties for professional services, research and development expense, and general and administrative expenses. We have received funds from the sales of products and from various financing activities such as from the sale of our common shares and from debt financings. The following trends are reasonably likely to result in changes in our liquidity over the near to long term:
● An increase in working capital requirements to finance our current business,
● Research and development fees;
● Addition of administrative and sales personnel as the business grows, and
● The cost of being a public company;
● Marketing expense for building brand;
● Capital requirements for production capacity.
Since inception, we have raised from proceeds from the sale of common and preferred shares and from debt to fund our operations and research and development initiatives.
In connection with subscription agreements dated January 13, 2020 and February 18, 2020, we received cash proceeds of $280,000 from an investor for the purchase of 7,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at $0.04 per share.

The conversion price was based on contractual terms of the related debt. Additionally, we repaid principal of $393,215 and accrued interest of $15,917.
On April 28, 2020, we entered into a Paycheck Protection Program Promissory Note (the “PPP Note”) with respect to a loan of $156,200 (the “PPP Loan”) from Comerica Bank. The PPP Loan was obtained pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”) of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES act”) administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”). The PPP Loan matures on April 28, 2022 and bears interest at a rate of 1.00% per annum. The PPP Loan is payable in 18 equal monthly payments of approximately $8,900 commencing November 1, 2020. The PPP Loan may be prepaid at any time prior to maturity with no prepayment penalties. We may apply to have the loan forgiven pursuant to the terms of the PPP if certain criteria are met.
On May 8, 2020, we closed a subscription agreement with an accredited investor (the “Investor”) whereby the Investor purchased 7,000,000 unregistered shares of the Company’s common stock for proceeds of $161,000, or $0.023 per share.
In connection with subscription agreements dated July 2, 2020, we received cash proceeds of $280,000 from investors for the purchase of 21,538,462 shares of the Company’s common stock at $0.013 per share.

Funding Requirements
We expect the primary use of capital to continue to be product costs, salaries, third-party outside research and testing services, product and research supplies, legal and regulatory expenses and general overhead costs including sales and marketing. Additional uses of capital will include additional headcount, tools and equipment, capacity expansion and operational control software. We believe the current cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements not including potential product sales. Additional capital will be required to further research new product verticals and enhancements to current product offerings based on customer requirements.
As of December 31, 2020, we determined that there was substantial doubt about our ability to maintain operations as a going concern. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. Management cannot provide assurance that we will ultimately achieve profitable operations or become cash flow positive or raise additional debt and/or equity capital. We will seek to raise capital through additional debt and/or equity financings to fund operations in the future. Although we have historically raised capital from sales of common shares and from the issuance of convertible promissory notes, there is no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so. If we are unable to raise additional capital or secure additional lending in the near future, management expects that the company will need to curtail its operations. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern.
Our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially as a result of a number of factors. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our capital requirements are difficult to forecast. Please see the section titled “Risk Factors” elsewhere in this Report for additional risks associated with our capital requirements.
Until such time as we generate substantial product revenue to offset operational expenses, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of public and private equity offerings, debt financing, collaborative research and licensing agreements. We may be unable to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements when needed or on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition.
Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Contractual Obligations
We have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions, changing interest rates, and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments. We have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the tables, in order to assist in the review of this information within the context of our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
The following tables summarize our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020, and the effect these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods.
We enter into agreements in the normal course of business with contracted research and testing organization, product distribution and material vendors which are payable or cancelable at any time with 30-day prior written approval.
Off-balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements during the period presented as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.
