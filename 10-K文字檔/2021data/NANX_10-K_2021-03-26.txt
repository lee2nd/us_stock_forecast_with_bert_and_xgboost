The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with risks discussed in the financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. When used in the following discussions, the words “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “plans,” “intends” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and contingencies that could cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, such statements. See the “Forward Looking Statements” section in Part 1, Item 1, of this Form 10-K.
Overview
Nanophase is a skin health focused company whose primary products are fully developed prestige skin care formulations, marketed and sold through our Solésence subsidiary, enabled by our proprietary Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (“APIs”) which are also marketed as APIs for sale to manufacturers of other types of skin health products, including sunscreens and daily care products. In terms of the balance of our life sciences focus, we have seen current conditions significantly increase demand for our medical diagnostics ingredients, which are used in testing for various viruses, most notably COVID-19. Additionally, we continue to sell products in markets for architectural coatings, industrial coating applications, abrasion-resistant additives, plastics additives, and surface finishing technologies (polishing) applications- all of which, along with medical diagnostics, currently fall into the advanced materials product category.
Critical Accounting Estimates
We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable. We conduct long-lived asset impairment analyses in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 360-10-15, Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. ASC 360-10-15 requires us to group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and evaluate the asset group against the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows. If the undiscounted cash flows do not indicate the carrying amount of the asset is recoverable, an impairment charge is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value based on discounted cash flow analysis or appraisals.
Certain assumptions are necessary to assess the impact of risks and uncertainties on the financial information, such as cash flow projections, availability of capital if needed to support the ongoing operations of the business, and our expected compliance with contractual commitments. Any changes in those plans or assumptions could have a material impact on our liquidity and financial condition.
Results of Operations
Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Total revenue increased to $17,123,000 in 2020, compared to $12,509,000 in 2019. A substantial majority of our revenue for each year is from our largest customers, in particular, sales to our largest customer in skin care and sunscreen applications, medical diagnostics, and now finished skin health products marketed through our Solésence subsidiary. Product revenue, the primary component of our total revenue, increased to $16,422,000 in 2020, compared to $11,852,000 in 2019. This increase was due to rapid growth in the adoption of our Solésence® products and our medical diagnostics materials, offset by a decrease in revenue from our largest customer in our personal care ingredients business.
Current Significant Customers
Other revenue increased to $701,000 in 2020, compared to $657,000 in 2019. This increase primarily related to development fees recognized for the Company’s work on behalf of two customers relating to new personal care ingredients, as well as reimbursement for testing costs from Solésence customers incurred during product development. Other revenue also includes customer-paid shipping charges, and any other customer-paid development projects.
Cost of revenue generally includes costs associated with commercial production and customer development arrangements. Cost of revenue increased to $11,133,000 in 2020, compared to $9,893,000 in 2019. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily driven by the increases in product revenue volume, along with a degree of manufacturing inefficiencies relating to several new customer start-up campaigns for our Solésence products. Our annual gross margin increased by approximately 14% when compared to that of the prior year. We expect to continue new materials development and dispersion technologies for personal care applications and for our formulated Solésence products during 2021 and beyond. At current revenue levels we have generated a positive gross margin, though margins can be impeded by the cyclicality of our demand, often leading to the Company not having enough revenue to efficiently absorb manufacturing overhead that is required to work with current customers and expected future customers. We believe that our current fixed manufacturing cost structure is sufficient to support higher levels of revenue volume. The extent to which margins grow, as a percentage of total revenue, will be dependent upon revenue mix, revenue volume, our ability to continue to cut costs and pass commodity market-driven raw materials increases on to customers, and the speed and efficiency with which we are able to scale up production for our Solésence products. We expect that, as product revenue volume increases, our fixed manufacturing costs will be more efficiently absorbed, which should lead to increased margins as we grow. We expect to continue to focus on reducing controllable variable product manufacturing costs, with potential variability related to the commodity metals markets, but may or may not realize absolute dollar gross margin growth through 2021 and beyond, dependent upon the factors discussed above.
Research and development expense, which includes all expenses relating to the technology and advanced engineering groups, primarily consists of costs associated with the development or acquisition of new finished product formulations for skin care, new product applications for our skin care ingredients, advancement of our medical diagnostics ingredient knowledge, and the cost of enhancing our manufacturing processes. As an example, we are currently focusing the bulk of our resources on developing new product formulations, and related new technologies, as we expand marketing and sales efforts relating to our Solésence products. This work has led to several new products and additional potential new products. Our efforts in research and development, cosmetic formulating, process engineering and advanced engineering groups are focused in three major areas: 1) application development for our products; 2) creating or obtaining additional core materials technologies and/or materials that have the capability to serve multiple skin health-related markets; and 3) continuing to improve our core technologies to improve manufacturing operations and reduce costs.
Research and development expense decreased to $1,571,000 in 2020, compared to $1,870,000 in 2019. The primary reasons for this decrease were reductions in outside testing, salaries and consulting, and materials charges associated with the development and launch of our Solésence line of personal care products and related capabilities. We increased patent legal spending in 2020, in keeping with our strategy to expand our intellectual property position to protect our unique skin health technology. We expect expenses for research and development to potentially be 30% to 40% higher in 2021, depending on both growth in our Solésence line of products, and the success we have in developing other products in key focus areas.
Selling, general and administrative expense decreased to $2,934,000 in 2020, compared to $3,542,000 in 2019. The net decrease was primarily attributed to a reduction in headcount, severance charges, business travel, and a reduction in booth presence at exhibitions and tradeshows. We expect 2021 expenses in this area to be higher, potentially as much as 20% to 35% if growth continues as planned. We will be augmenting our selling and marketing efforts, and parts of our administrative functions, including related staffing additions. The extent to which this increase occurs will be dependent upon growth.
Interest expense was $496,000 in 2020, compared to $210,000 in 2019, due mainly to the impact of our revolving line of credit for working capital funding, cash, and discount-related interest expense on our $2,000,000 Convertible Note, and finance leases and term loans supporting some of our equipment.
Inflation
We believe inflation has not had a material effect on our operations or financial position. However, supplier price increases and wage and benefit inflation, both of which represent a significant component of our costs of operations, may have a material effect on our operations and financial position in 2021 and beyond if we are unable to pass through any increases under present contracts or through to our markets in general.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our cash amounted to $957,000 as of December 31, 2020, compared to $1,194,000 as of December 31, 2019. The cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $2,061,000 compared to $2,776,000 used for the year ended December 31, 2019. This was mainly due to the Company generating $989,000 in net income compared to a $3,006,000 net loss year over year, offset by an increase in inventories and accounts receivable to accommodate revenue growth in 2020. Net cash used in investing activities amounted to $878,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $740,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Cash capital expenditures amounted to approximately $878,000 and $740,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We did not dispose of or sell any assets during 2020, and disposed of a fixed asset in 2019, incurring a $15,000 loss.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $2,702,000 in 2020, compared to $3,365,000 in 2019. On April 17, 2020, we received a loan of $952,000 from the Libertyville Bank and Trust Company (“Libertyville”) under the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”). On May 13, 2019, we sold 4,189,000 shares of our common stock to our largest investor for $1,677,000 in proceeds, and had no such sales during 2020. On November 20, 2019, we closed on a Convertible Note from the Company with our largest investor, resulting in $2,000,000 in proceeds. The primary use of these funds has been to fund growth, to support the Company’s expanding working capital needs, and to fund capital equipment. No selling commission or other remuneration was paid in connection with any of these transactions.
The Company has a business loan agreement with Libertyville which had its revolving credit limit of $500,000, with certain limitations imposed on our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness for borrowed money outside the ordinary course of business (like a finance lease, receivables factoring or a mortgage), sell, lease or use our assets as collateral for additional credit, pay cash dividends or engage in certain business transactions without Libertyville’s prior written consent. Outstanding borrowings were $500,000 on this line of credit as of December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019. The maturity date for this Line of Credit Agreement, which has been renewed annually for a number of years, is now April 4, 2021. During March 2019, we modified the substance of the Agreement to include the addition of language mirroring the requirements for holding $500,000 in inventory and other non-cash items that are discussed within the most recent amendment to the BASF supply agreement in lieu of cash.
On November 16, 2018, we entered into a Business Loan Agreement (the “Master Agreement”) with Beachcorp, LLC. The Master Agreement relates to two loan facilities, each evidenced by a separate promissory note dated as of November 16, 2018: a term loan to the Company of up to $500,000 to be disbursed in a single advance (the “Term Loan”) with a fixed annual interest rate of 8.25%, payable quarterly, accruing from the date of such advance and with principal due on December 31, 2020; and an asset-based revolving loan facility for the Company of up to $2,000,000 (the “Revolver Facility”), with floating interest accruing at the prime rate plus 3% (8.25% minimum) per year, with a borrowing base consisting of qualified accounts receivable of the Company, and with all principal and accrued interest due March 31, 2020, as amended. On March 23, 2020, the Company and Beachcorp, LLC executed the First Amendment to our Master Agreement that extends the maturities of both the Term Loan and the Revolver Facility to March 31, 2021. Effective September 8, 2020, the Company and Beachcorp, LLC executed the Second Amendment to our Master Agreement that expands the limit on the Revolver Facility from $2,000,000 to $2,750,000. On December 23, 2020, the Company and Beachcorp, LLC executed the Third Amendment to our Master Agreement that expands the limit on the Revolver Facility from $2,750,000 to $4,000,000 and extends the maturities of both the Term Loan and the Revolver Facility to March 31, 2022. The Term Loan and Revolver Facility are secured by all the unencumbered assets of the Company and subordinated to Libertyville’s secured interest under the New Business Loan Credit Agreement.
On May 13, 2019, we sold 4.2 million shares of our common stock to our largest investor for $1.7 million in proceeds and had no such sales during 2020. No selling commission or other remuneration was paid in connection with this transaction.
In November 2019, we entered in to a 2% Convertible Promissory Note in the original principal amount of $2,000,000. This note matures on May 15, 2024, and is payable to our investor at that time in cash, or through conversion of the rights to purchase up to 10,000,000 unregistered shares of the Company’s common stock at $0.20 per share. The conversion can be done in full or in part, and may be undertaken prior to the note’s maturity date. The Master Agreement substantially restricts the Company’s ability to incur additional indebtedness during the terms of the Term Loan, the Revolver Facility, and the Convertible Promissory Note. On December 31, 2020, the balances on the Term Loan and the Convertible Promissory Note were $500,000 and $2,000,000, respectively, and the balance on the Revolver Facility was $2,155,000.
On April 17, 2020, we received a loan of $952,000 from Libertyville under the PPP. Under the PPP, the Company may apply for forgiveness of the amount due on the loan in an amount equal to the sum of the following costs incurred during the 24-week period beginning on the date of the first disbursement of the Loan: (a) payroll costs, (b) any payment of interest on a covered obligation (which shall not include any prepayment of or payment of principal on a covered mortgage obligation), (c) any payment on a covered rent obligation, and (d) any covered utility payment, calculated in accordance with the terms of the CARES Act. Although management believes that the Company expended the proceeds of the PPP loan principally for forgivable purposes under the CARES Act, no assurance can be provided that the Company will obtain forgiveness of the PPP loan in whole or in part. The Company applied for PPP forgiveness during the first quarter of 2021.
For more information regarding the New Business Loan Agreement, see Note 4 to our Financial Statements referred to in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our supply agreements with our largest customer, BASF, contain certain financial covenants which could potentially impact our liquidity. The most restrictive financial covenants under these agreements require that we maintain a minimum of $1,000,000 in certain current assets; which may be composed of no less than $500,000 cash, cash equivalents, and certain investments, no more than a combined $500,000 of certain related inventory, of which no more than $250,000 can be raw material, and certain receivables, and that we not have the acceleration of any debt maturity having a principal amount of more than $10 million, in order to avoid triggering the customer’s potential right to transfer certain technology and equipment to that customer at a contractually-defined price. At December 31, 2020, we had approximately $950,000 in cash, and total availability under our revolving loans from Libertyville and Beachcorp, LLC of $621,000. This supply agreement and its covenants are more fully described in Note 13, and our line of credit is more fully described in Note 4, to our Financial Statements referred to in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We believe that cash from operations and cash on hand, in addition to unused borrowing capacity, may not be adequate to fund our operating plans through 2021. We are working to reduce these risks, but some of this is dependent on several things over which we have limited control. We have seen an increase in sales of our Solésence products through 2020, which we expect to continue in 2021. If that does continue, we will require additional investment in working capital. Given these issues, and other commercial realities, we are monitoring the additional working capital demands that this could create as we continue to execute on our Solésence growth strategy. The timing of cash flows is critical. If cash generated from operations is not materially consistent with our plans, we believe that we may need to seek additional funding to address working capital demands. This uncertainty has caused us to be unable to assert that, for the next twelve months, we have enough current cash and guaranteed access to financing to fund operations, and to continue with our current growth strategy in terms of investment in capital equipment and in operating expenses related to Solésence, without securing additional financing. We believe that we will be able to secure additional financing if needed, but we do not have any additional financing commitments in place as of today. However, we may not be able to secure additional financing in a timely manner under commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to secure additional financing, the operations of the Company might need to be curtailed to a certain degree, and we would need to delay capital expenditures related to our Solésence growth strategy, which could impede growth in 2021 and 2022.
Our actual future capital requirements in 2021 and beyond will depend on many factors, including customer acceptance of our current and potential finished Solésence products, APIs sold as ingredients in to the skin health markets, medical diagnostics ingredients, and other engineered materials, applications, and products, continued progress in research and development activities and product testing programs, the magnitude of these activities and programs, and the costs necessary to increase and expand our manufacturing capabilities and to market and sell these products and ingredients. Other important issues that will drive future capital requirements will be the development of new markets and new customers as well as the potential for significant unplanned growth with existing customers. Depending on the success of certain projects, we expect that capital spending relating to currently known capital needs for 2021 will be between $1,200,000 and $1,800,000, to be funded by profit from operations, and our existing loans and lines of credit. If those projects are delayed or ultimately prove unsuccessful, or if we fail to be able to support the additional cost of funding them in the near term, we expect our capital expenditures may fall below the lower end of the range. Similarly, substantial success in business development projects may cause the actual 2021 capital investment to exceed the top of this range.
In the likely event that we will need to seek additional financing, such additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms or even at all, and any such additional financing could be dilutive to our shareholders. Such financing could be necessitated by such things as the loss of an existing customer; a significant decrease in revenue from one or more of our customers; temporary working capital demands resulting from our expected growth in our Solésence business that we cannot fund with existing capital; currently unknown capital requirements considering the factors described above; new regulatory requirements that are outside our control; the need to meet previously discussed cash requirements to avoid a triggering event under our BASF agreement; or various other circumstances coming to pass that we currently do not anticipate. The failure to have access to sufficient capital to fund our business plans may result in a curtailment or other change in those plans, and under such circumstances, this raises doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.
On December 31, 2020, we had a net operating loss carryforward of approximately $67 million for income tax purposes. Because the Company may have experienced “ownership changes” within the meaning of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) in connection with its various prior equity offerings, future utilization of this carryforward may be subject to certain limitations as defined by the IRC. If not utilized, $63 million of this loss carryforward will expire between 2021 and 2037. Given changes to the IRC, net operating loss carryforwards generated after January 1, 2018 do not expire, therefore, $5 million in net operating losses generated since January 1, 2018 do not expire.
As a result of the annual limitation and uncertainty as to the amount of future taxable income that will be earned prior to the expiration of the carryforward, we have concluded that it is likely that some portion of this carryforward will expire before ultimately becoming available to reduce income tax liabilities.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have not created, and are not party to, any special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purposes of raising capital, incurring debt or operating our business. We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources.
As more fully described in Note 3 to our Financial Statements, referenced in Part II, Item 8 and set forth on page of this Form 10-K, during July 2014 we entered into a new bank-issued letter of credit and promissory note for up to $30,000 supporting our obligations under our facility lease agreement. This note expires July 2021. No borrowings have been incurred under this promissory note.
