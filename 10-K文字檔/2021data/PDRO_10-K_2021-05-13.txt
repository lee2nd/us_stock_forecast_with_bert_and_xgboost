Plan of Operation for the next 12 months
Our cash balance is $0 as of October 31, 2020. We do not believe that our cash balance is sufficient to fund our limited levels of operations beyond one year’s time unless additional revenues are generated.
Our independent registered public accountant has issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we generate additional revenue sufficient to maintain operations or obtain additional capital to pay our bills. There is no assurance we will ever reach that stage.
Over the next twelve months we plan to engage in the following activities to expand our business operations:
Accounting/Auditing & Legal: Expenses for accounting will go primarily toward the preparation of financial statements. Expenses for auditing will go to our auditor for our year end audits and quarterly reviews. Expenses for legal fees will go primarily to our lawyer to ensure that all our filings are in order and we are in compliance with different regulatory authorities.
Office and Administration: This will be the cost of purchasing small office equipment such as a computer, printer/scanner/copier/fax, expenses such as telephone, electricity, office supplies, etc.
Working Capital: Items not accounted for elsewhere or that are difficult to predict such as bank fees, entertainment, software products and office equipment.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At October 31, 2019 the Company had $0 in cash and there were outstanding liabilities of $11,258

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.
Limited Operating History; Need for Additional Capital
There is limited historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in start-up stage operations and for the year ended October 31, 2020, we have generated no revenues. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products.
We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholders.
Summary of significant accounting policies:
INCOME TAXES
For federal income tax purposes, substantially all expenses incurred prior to the commencement of operations must be deferred and then they may be written off over a 180-month period. Tax deductible losses can be carried forward for 20 years until utilized for federal tax purposes. The Company will provide a valuation allowance in the full amount of the deferred tax assets since there is no assurance of future taxable income.
The Company utilizes the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740 related to Income Taxes to account for the uncertainty in income taxes. Topic 740 for Income Taxes clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing rules for recognition, measurement and classification in financial statements of tax positions taken or expected to be in a tax return. Further, it prescribes a two-step process for the financial statement measurement and recognition of a tax position. The first step involves the determination of whether it is more likely than not (greater than 50 percent likelihood) that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. The second step requires that any tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold be measured and recognized in the financial statements at the largest amount of benefit that is a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. This topic also provides guidance on the accounting for related interest and penalties, financial statement classification and disclosure. The Company’s policy is that any interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in income tax expense when incurred. The Company has no uncertain tax positions or related interest or penalties requiring accrual at October 31, 2020.
CASH
There was $0 in cash as of the year ended October 31, 2020 and the prior year ended October 31, 2019.
REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY
The Company recognizes revenues and the related costs when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery and acceptance has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection of any resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Costs and expenses are recognized during the period in which they are incurred. Any revenues earned include sales of our exercise equipment. The Company recognizes these sales once delivery time is confirmed by the customer.
COST OF SALES
Amounts that will be recorded as cost of sales relate to direct expenses incurred in order to fulfill orders of our products. Such costs are recorded and allocated as incurred. Our cost of sales will consist primarily of the cost of product, packaging/labeling costs and shipping expenses.
PROPERTY
Property is stated at historical cost. Cost represents the purchase price of the asset and other costs incurred to bring the asset into its existing use. Additions and improvements are capitalized while routine repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Upon sale or disposition, the historically recorded asset cost and any accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the net amount less proceeds from disposal is charged or credited to other income or expense.
NET INCOME (LOSS) PER COMMON SHARE
Basic income (loss) per common share is computed based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.
