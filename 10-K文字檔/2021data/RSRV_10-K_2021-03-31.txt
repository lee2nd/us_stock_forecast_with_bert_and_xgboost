ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
COVID-19
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. Governments have tried to slow the spread of the virus by imposing social distancing guidelines, travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders, which have caused a significant decrease in activity in the global economy and the demand for oil and to a lesser extent natural gas. As a result, the price for oil decreased significantly. While oil prices have recovered significantly, there is still ongoing volatility in the market.
Our profitability has been and will likely continue to be significantly affected by this decreased demand and lower commodity price environment. The decline in commodity prices and our future estimated production levels could lead to additional material impairments of our long-lived assets, equity method investments and right-of-use assets. It is likely that additional impairments could be triggered if the COVID-19 pandemic leads to a continued and sustained reduction in global economic activity and demand for energy. We continue to evaluate all cash management strategies, maintaining conservative choices in short-term investments to protect cash reserves and liquidity.
Please refer to the financial statements and related notes in Item 8 of this Form 10-K to supplement this discussion and analysis.
Critical Accounting Estimates
●
Estimates of future revenues from oil and gas sales are derived from a combination of factors which are subject to significant fluctuation over any given period. Reserve estimates, by their nature, are subject to revision in the short-term. The evaluating engineer considers production performance data, reservoir data and geological data available to the Company, as well as makes estimates of production costs, sale prices and the time period the property can be produced at a profit. A change in any of the above factors can significantly change the timing and amount of net revenues from a property. The Company’s producing properties are composed of many small working interest and royalty interest properties. As a non-operating owner, we have limited access to the underlying data from which working interest reserve estimates are calculated. Estimates of royalty interest reserves are not made because the information required for the estimation is not available to the Company. While reserve estimates are not accounting estimates, they are the basis for impairment, depreciation, depletion and amortization described below. Additionally, the estimated economic life for each producing property from the reserve estimates is used in the calculation of asset retirement obligations.
●
Reserves relating to the Company’s proved properties may become uneconomic to produce resulting in impairment of proved properties.
●
The provisions for depreciation, depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties all constitute critical accounting estimates. Non-producing leaseholds are amortized over the life of the leases using a straight-line method; however, when leases are impaired or condemned, an appropriate adjustment to the provision is made at that time.
●
The provision for impairment of long-lived assets is determined by review of the estimated future cash flows from the individual properties. A significant, unforeseen downward adjustment in future prices and/or potential reserves could result in a material change in estimated long-lived assets impairment.
●
Depletion and depreciation of oil and gas properties are computed using the units-of-production method. A significant, unanticipated change in volume of production or estimated reserves would result in a material, unexpected change in the estimated depletion and depreciation provisions.
●
The Company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and facilities associated with oil and gas wells and to restore land at the end of oil and gas production operations. Removal and restoration obligations are most often associated with plugging and abandoning wells. Estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations will take effect in the future. Additionally, these operations are subject to private contracts and government regulations that often have vague descriptions of what is required. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing as are regulatory, political, environmental and safety considerations. Inherent in the present value calculations are numerous assumptions and judgments, including the ultimate removal cost amounts, inflation factors and discount rate.
●
The estimation of the amounts of income tax to be recorded by the Company involves interpretation of complex tax laws and regulations as well as the completion of complex calculations, including the determination of the Company’s percentage depletion deduction, if any. To calculate the exact excess percentage depletion allowance, a well-by-well calculation is and can only be performed at the end of each year. During interim periods, a high-level estimate is made considering historical data and current pricing. Although our management believes its income tax accruals are adequate, differences may occur in the future depending on the resolution of pending and new tax matters.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
To supplement the following discussion, please refer to the balance sheets and the statements of cash flows included in this Form 10-K.
In 2020, as in prior years, the Company funded its business activity using internal sources of capital. For the most part, these internal sources are cash flows from operations, cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale debt securities. When cash flows from operating activities are in excess of those needed for other business activities, the remaining balance is used to increase cash, cash equivalents and/or available-for-sale debt securities. When cash flows from operating activities are not adequate to fund other business activities, withdrawals are made from cash, cash equivalents and/or available-for-sale debt securities. Cash equivalents are highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less. All the available-for-sale debt securities are U.S. Treasury Bills.
In 2020, net cash provided by operating activities was $1,105,337, net cash provided by investing activities was $13,129,088 and net cash applied to financing activities was $785,678.
Other than cash and cash equivalents, other significant changes in working capital include the following:
Equity securities increased $1,991,407 (365%) to $2,536,482 in 2020 from $545,075 in 2019. The net increase is primarily due to a net increase in purchases of $1,577,032, unrealized gains of $296,920, which represent the change in the fair value of the securities from their original cost and $117,455 of 2020 realized gain on sales.
Refundable income taxes increased $108,205 (50%) to $218,204 from $109,999 in 2019, due primarily to a current tax benefit in 2020.
Accounts receivable decreased $174,220 (18%) to $794,162 in 2020 from $968,382 in 2019. The change was primarily due to changes in oil and gas sales receivables due to the current decreased pricing environment.
Notes receivable of $278,569 were issued in 2020, with none in 2019. See “Investing Activities” below for detail on notes receivable.
Accounts payable increased $91,286 (58%) to $248,054 in 2020 from $156,768 in 2019, due to timing of payables processing.
Discussion of Selected Material Line Items in Cash Flows.
The following is a discussion of material changes in cash flow by activity between the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Also, see the discussion of changes in operating results under “Results of Operations” below in this Item 7.
Operating Activities
As noted above, net cash flows provided by operating activities in 2020 were $1,105,337, which, when compared to the $2,855,972 provided in 2019, represents a net decrease of $1,750,635. The decrease was mostly due to a decrease in oil and gas sales of $2,069,316 and a decrease of interest received of $259,679, offset by a decrease in production costs of $424,142 and income tax refunds net of taxes paid of $77,550 in 2020, compared to income taxes paid net of refunds of $163,443 in 2019. Additional discussion of the significant items follows.
The $2,069,316 (32%) decrease in cash received from oil and gas sales to $4,323,526 in 2020 from $6,392,842 in 2019 was the result of a decrease in oil and gas sales prices and a decrease in oil and gas sales volumes. See “Results of Operations” below for a price/volume analysis and the related discussion of oil and gas sales.
Interest received decreased $259,679 (55%) to $214,156 in 2020 from $473,835 in 2019. This decrease was the result of decreased interest rates on available-for-sale debt securities.
Investing Activities
Net cash provided by investing activities was $13,129,088 in 2020, from a net cash applied to investing activities of $4,287,328 in 2019. The 2020 amount was due to a net increase in the maturity of available-for-sale debt securities of $17,002,677 available-for-sale debt securities, offset by net equity securities purchases of $1,577,032, net property purchases of $1,517,255, notes receivable issued for $278,569 and a $500,733 increase in purchases of other investments.
The $278,569 in notes receivable discussed above are all receivable from Grand Woods, an equity investment. The notes are expected to be paid within the next year, either upon restructuring of financing agreements within the investment or upon the sale of property held by the investment. See Item 8, Note 7 to the accompanying financial statements for related disclosures and additional information regarding equity investments.
Financing Activities
Cash applied to financing activities decreased $1,473,127 (65%) to $785,678 in 2020 from $2,258,805 in 2019. Cash applied to financing activities consist of cash dividends on common stock and cash used for the purchase of treasury stock. In 2020, cash dividends paid on common stock amounted to $783,078 as compared to $1,479,081 in 2019. Dividends of $5.00 per share were paid in 2020 compared to $7.00 per share paid in 2019. Dividends payable of $687,048 in 2019 represented net cash transferred to the Company’s transfer agent for payment and escheatment of past dividends. Cash applied to purchase treasury stock decreased $90,076 to $2,600 in 2020 from $92,676 in 2019.
Forward-Looking Summary
The Company’s latest estimate of business to be done beyond 2020 indicates the projected activity can be funded from cash flows from operations and other internal sources, including net working capital. The Company is engaged in exploratory drilling. If this drilling is successful, substantial development drilling may result. Also, should other exploration projects which fit the Company’s risk parameters become available or other investment opportunities become known, capital requirements may be more than the Company has available. If so, the Company could require external sources of financing.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
As disclosed in the statements of operations in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, in 2020 the Company had a net loss of $(1,956,255) as compared to net loss of $(266,763) in 2019. Net loss per share, basic and diluted, was $(12.49) in 2020, an increase of $10.79 per share from $(1.70) in 2019. Material line item changes in the statements of operations will be discussed in the following paragraphs.
Operating Revenues
Operating revenues decreased $2,546,191 (38%) to $4,082,098 in 2020 from $6,628,289 in 2019. Oil and gas sales decreased $2,495,988 (38%) to $3,995,074 in 2020 from $6,491,062 in 2019. Lease bonuses and other revenues decreased $50,203 (37%) to $87,024 in 2020 from $137,227 in 2019. The decrease in oil and gas sales is discussed in the following paragraphs.
The $2,495,988 decrease in oil and gas sales was the result of a $523,261 decrease in gas sales, a $1,918,842 decrease in oil sales and an $53,885 decrease in miscellaneous oil and gas product sales. The following price and volume analysis is presented to explain the changes in oil and gas sales from 2019 to 2020. Miscellaneous oil and gas product sales of $126,167 in 2020 and $180,052 in 2019 are not included in the analysis.
The $523,261 (29%) decrease in natural gas sales to $1,283,011 in 2020 from $1,806,272 in 2019 was the result of a decrease in gas sales volumes and a decrease in the average price received per thousand cubic feet (MCF). The average price per MCF of natural gas sales decreased $0.42 per MCF to $1.80 per MCF in 2020 from $2.22 per MCF in 2019, resulting in a negative gas price variance of $294,001. A negative volume variance of $229,259 was the result of a decrease in natural gas volumes sold of 103,270 MCF to 711,981 MCF in 2020 from 815,251 MCF in 2019.
The decrease in the volume of gas production was the net result of new 2020 production of about 3,800 MCF, offset by a decline of about 107,000 MCF in production from previous wells. As disclosed in Supplemental Schedule 1 of the Unaudited Supplemental Financial Information included in Item 8 below, working interests in natural gas extensions and discoveries were not adequate to replace working interest reserves produced in 2020 or 2019.
The gas production for 2020 and 2019 includes production from about 100 royalty interest properties drilled by various operators in Robertson County, Texas. These properties accounted for approximately 196,000 MCF and $386,000 of the 2020 gas sales and approximately 233,000 MCF and $653,000 of the 2019 gas sales. These properties accounted for about 31% of the Company’s gas revenues in 2020 versus 34% in 2019. The Company has no control over the timing of future drilling on the acreage in which we hold mineral interests.
The $1,918,842 (43%) decrease in crude oil sales to $2,585,896 in 2020 from $4,504,738 in 2019 was the result of a decrease in the average price per barrel (Bbl) and a decrease in oil sales volumes. The average price received per Bbl of oil decreased $17.31 to $36.28 in 2020 from $53.59 in 2019, resulting in a negative oil price variance of $1,233,610. A decrease in oil sales volumes of 12,786 Bbls to 71,271 Bbls in 2020 from 84,057 Bbls in 2019 resulted in a negative volume variance of $685,232.
The decrease in the oil volume production was the net result of new 2020 production of about 8,000 Bbls, offset by a 21,000 Bbl decline in production from previous wells. As disclosed in Supplemental Schedule 1 of the Unaudited Supplemental Financial Information included below in Item 8, working interests in oil extensions and discoveries were not adequate to replace working interest reserves produced in 2020 or 2019.
For both oil and gas sales, the price change was mostly the result of a change in the spot market prices upon which most of the Company’s oil and gas sales are based. These spot market prices have had significant fluctuations in the past and these fluctuations are expected to continue.
Operating Costs and Expenses
Operating costs and expenses decreased $395,872 (5%) to $7,237,873 in 2020 from $7,633,745 in 2019, primarily due to decreases in production and exploration expenses, offset by an increase in long-lived assets impairment. The material components of operating costs and expenses are discussed below.
Production Costs. Production costs decreased $455,934 (20%) to $1,878,319 in 2020 from $2,334,253 in 2019. The decrease was the result of a $325,915 (20%) decrease in lease operating expense to $1,319,563 in 2020 from $1,645,478 in 2019 and a $124,136 (38%) decrease in gross production taxes to $206,671 in 2020 from $330,807 in 2019. Gross production taxes are state taxes, which are calculated as a percentage of gross proceeds from the sale of products from each producing oil and gas property, therefore, they fluctuate with the change in the dollar amount of revenues from oil and gas sales.
Exploration and Development Costs. Under the successful efforts method of accounting used by the Company, geological and geophysical costs are expensed as incurred, as are the costs of unsuccessful exploratory drilling. The costs of successful exploratory drilling and all development costs are capitalized. Total costs of exploration and development, excluding asset retirement obligations but inclusive of geological and geophysical costs, were $1,268,387 in 2020 and $1,082,804 in 2019. See Item 8, Note 8 to the accompanying financial statements for a breakdown of these costs. Exploration and acquisition costs charged to operations were $161,288 in 2020 and $709,753 in 2019, inclusive of geological and geophysical costs of $64,898 in 2020 and $54,317 in 2019. Mineral acquisition costs were $19,805 in 2020 and $471,251 in 2019.
Update of Oil and Gas Exploration and Development Activity. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company participated in the drilling of 6 gross exploratory working interest wells (including 2 in progress at the end of 2019) and 7 gross development working interest wells, with working interests ranging from a high of 14% to a low of 3.2%. Of the 6 exploratory wells, 3 were completed as producing wells, 2 as dry holes and 1 was in progress. Of the 7 development wells, 3 were completed as producing wells and 4 were in progress.
The following is a summary as of March 18, 2021, updating both exploration and development activity from December 31, 2019, for the period ended December 31, 2020.
The Company is participating with its 14% interest in the acquisition of additional leasehold and exploratory drilling on a Creek County, Oklahoma 3-D seismic project. There are currently seven active prospects within the project. Exploratory wells were drilled on two of the prospects in 2019. The two wells were completed in 2020, one as a commercial oil producer and the other as a dry hole. Three development wells were drilled on the first prospect and all three were completed as commercial oil producers. Exploratory wells were drilled on two additional prospects with one completed as a commercial oil producer and the other as a marginal oil producer. Another development well and two more exploratory wells will be drilled starting in March 2021, with additional development drilling to follow. Leasehold costs for the period were $9,872 and additional capitalized costs were $162,654. Dry hole costs of $31,390 were written off to expense.
The Company owns a 35% interest in 16,472.55 net acres of leasehold on a Crockett and Val Verde Counties, Texas prospect. Most of the acreage is underlain by a shallow heavy oil zone. The Company will participate with a 17.5% interest in the re-entry, completion and testing of a previously drilled test well on the prospect with the intention of conducting a thermal recovery pilot test.
The Company has been participating with a 13% interest in a 3-D seismic project covering approximately 35,000 acres in San Patricio County, Texas. Fourteen prospects have been identified and exploratory wells were successfully completed on two of these in 2019. Leasing is complete on six additional prospects. An exploratory well was drilled and completed on one of these, testing gas at a commercial rate. It is shut in awaiting pipeline construction. The Company is participating in the conversion of an abandoned producer to a saltwater disposal well that will handle water from all three existing wells and any future wells drilled in the area. Also, additional processing of the 3-D seismic data has been completed and additional well proposals are anticipated. Leasehold costs for the period were $40,175, additional capitalized costs were $223,428 and geophysical costs were $13,485.
The Company has been participating with a 50% interest in an attempt to develop oil prospects in the Permian Basin. The Company has acquired a 50% interest in 3,182 net acres of leasehold and three producing wells on a Nolan County, Texas prospect and is currently involved in efforts to sell a portion of its interest. Once sufficient interest has been placed, an exploratory horizontal well will be drilled on the prospect. Geological costs for the period were $51,413 and leasehold costs were $175,514.
The Company participated in an attempt to restore commercial production from a well that was drilled and completed in 2019 on a Murray County, Oklahoma prospect. The effort was unsuccessful, as was an attempt to re-complete in another zone. The well is under evaluation.
In August 2020, the Company purchased a 10.5% interest in 637.58 net acres of leasehold on a Lincoln County, Oklahoma prospect for $30,126. An exploratory well was drilled on the prospect and completed as a dry hole. Dry hole costs for the period were $21,378.
The Company is participating in the drilling of four horizontal development wells on fee minerals located in Kingfisher County, Oklahoma. The Company has a 3.2% working interest in three of the wells and a 3.5% working interest in the fourth. All four wells have been drilled with casing set and are scheduled for completion in April 2021. Prepaid costs for the period were $709,845, covering actual costs of $209,113.
The Company largely curtailed its exploration and development activity due to the historic collapse of oil prices in March and April 2020. It resumed drilling activity in the second half of the year with the improvement in the outlook for both oil and gas prices.
Depreciation, Depletion, Amortization and Valuation Provisions (DD&A). Major DD&A components are the provision for impairment of undeveloped leaseholds, provision for impairment of long-lived assets, depletion of producing leaseholds and depreciation of tangible and intangible lease and well costs. Undeveloped leaseholds are amortized over the life of the leasehold (most are 3 years) using a straight line method, except when the leasehold is impaired or condemned by drilling and/or geological interpretation of seismic data; if so, an adjustment to the provision is made at the time of impairment. The provision for impairment of undeveloped leaseholds was $36,872 in 2020 versus $928,524 in 2019.
As discussed in Item 8, Note 10 to the accompanying financial statements, accounting principles require the recognition of an impairment loss on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present. Impairment evaluation is a two-step process. The first step is to measure when the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets, determined on a well basis, is less than the assets’ carrying amounts. Those assets meeting the first criterion are adjusted to estimated fair value. Evaluation for impairment was performed in both 2020 and 2019. The 2020 impairment loss was $2,517,873 and the 2019 impairment loss was $912,045.
The depletion and depreciation of oil and gas properties are computed by the units-of-production method. The amount expensed in any year will fluctuate with the change in estimated reserves of oil and gas, a change in the rate of production or a change in the basis of the assets. The provision for depletion and depreciation was $798,805 in 2020 and $997,043 in 2019. The provision includes $83,453 for 2020 and $88,816 for 2019 for the amortization of the asset retirement costs. See Item 8, Note 2 to the accompanying financial statements for additional information regarding the asset retirement obligation.
The provision for depreciation for other assets was $45,725 in 2020 and $30,559 in 2019.
Other Income, Net. See Item 8, Note 11 to the accompanying financial statements for an analysis of the components of this line item for 2020 and 2019. Other income, net increased $171,902 (28%) to $775,082 in 2020 from $603,180 in 2019. The line items responsible for this net increase are described below.
Net realized and unrealized gain on equity securities increased $323,906 (358%) to a net gain of $414,375 in 2020 from a net gain of $90,469 in 2019. Realized gains or losses result when an equity security is sold. Unrealized gains or losses result from adjusting the Company’s carrying amount in equity securities owned at the reporting date to estimated fair value. In 2020, the Company had realized gains of $117,455 and unrealized gains of $296,920. In 2019, the Company had realized losses of $(10,778) and unrealized gains of $101,247.
Income from other investments increased $233,366 to $241,866 in 2020 from $8,500 in 2019, primarily resulting from a sale of property in OKC Industrial, LC.
Gains on asset sales increased $5,480 to $23,590 in 2020 from $18,110 in 2019.
Interest income decreased $372,452 (72%) to $147,867 in 2020 from $520,319 in 2019. This decrease was the result of a decrease in the average interest rate, an increase in the average balance of cash equivalents and a decrease in the average balance of available-for-sale debt securities from which most of the interest income is derived. The average interest rate decreased from 1.96% in 2019 to 0.72% in 2020. The average balance outstanding decreased $1,541,720 to $19,805,548 in 2020 from $21,347,268 in 2019.
Provision/(Benefit) for Income Taxes. In 2020, the Company had an estimated income tax benefit of $534,293 as the result of a deferred tax benefit of $348,738 and a current tax benefit of $185,555. In 2019, the Company had an estimated income tax benefit of $223,075 as the result of a deferred tax benefit of $292,906 and a current tax provision of $69,831. See Item 8, Note 6 to the accompanying financial statements for an analysis of the various components of income taxes and a discussion of the federal tax rate change.
