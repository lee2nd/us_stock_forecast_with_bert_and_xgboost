See note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on the sale and leaseback transactions.
In 2019, our cost of sales includes a $6.0 million charge for impairment of inventory in our greeting cards department, which we chose to exit in the first quarter of 2019. Additionally, our selling and administrative expenses include $38.3 million of costs associated with our transformational restructuring initiative, which we refer to as “Operation North Star”, announced in the first quarter of 2019 and $7.3 million in estimated costs associated with employee wage and hour claims brought against us in the state of California. We also recognized a gain on sale of distribution center of $178.5 million related to the sale of our Rancho Cucamonga, CA distribution center which increased our 2019 operating profit by $178.5 million and increased our diluted earnings per share by approximately $3.47 per share. See note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on this sale transaction.
Operating Strategy
In 2019, the Company completed an initial, comprehensive review of its operating strategy. The outcome of the review was a multi-year plan for a strategic transformation, which we refer to as “Operation North Star.”
Operation North Star
Operation North Star has three primary objectives:
•Drive profitable long-term growth;
•Fund the journey; and
•Create long-term shareholder value.
Drive profitable long-term growth
The “drive profitable long-term growth” objective of Operation North Star is focused on growing our net sales, which includes:
•Strengthening our home offerings (“Home”), which spans our Furniture, Seasonal, and Soft Home merchandise categories, as a destination for Jennifer;
•Growing our own brands, especially our Broyhill® brand;
•Growing store traffic;
•Responsibly investing in store presentation initiatives to create an easy shopping experience;
•Growing our store count; and
•Growing our e-commerce sales.
Fund the journey
The “fund the journey” objective of Operation North Star is focused on reducing costs so we can invest those savings in the growth areas of our business, which includes:
•Expanding our gross margin rate;
•Increasing store efficiency and productivity;
•Increasing organizational efficiency;
•Encouraging a culture of frugality; and
•Continuously analyzing our purchasing habits and vendor agreements to ensure we are maximizing our buying power and making cost-effective decisions.
Create long-term shareholder value
The “create long-term shareholder value” objective is the culmination of our “drive profitable long-term growth” and “fund the journey” objectives. If we effectively execute the first two objectives of Operation North Star, we believe that we will deliver value to our shareholders through earnings growth over time. In addition, we continue to optimize our capital allocation to support Operation North Star initiatives while returning capital to our shareholders, when appropriate.
Enablers
In recognition of the importance of having the appropriate technology and processes in place to achieve our “drive profitable long-term growth” and “fund the journey” objectives, we have established several enabler work streams with the following objectives:
•Improve in-store engagement;
•Scale supply chain capabilities; and
•Nurture a high performance culture.
Operation North Star Progress
In 2020, we successfully completed the following under our Operation North Star strategy:
•Grew our Broyhill® brand offerings to account for over $400 million of net sales in 2020;
•Grew our net store count by four stores, which is our second consecutive year of net store growth;
•Implemented our presentation initiatives, The Lot and Queue Line, in approximately 50% of our chain;
•Completed our Pantry Optimization project in our full chain of stores;
•Developed curbside pickup capabilities for our buy online pick up in store (“BOPIS”) orders;
•Partnered with Instacart® and PICKUP® to provide same-day delivery;
•Achieved 82% favorable associate engagement rate, which is above our retail industry benchmark;
•Increased our customer satisfaction score, which is based on survey results, by 600 bps to approximately 81%
•Expanded our gift card offerings to our e-commerce platform and third-party gift card sellers; and
•Expanded our e-commerce distribution network by implementing ship-from-store capabilities in 47 of our stores.
Next Steps
In 2021, we plan to implement the following initiatives to achieve our Operation North Star goals:
•Expand our presentation initiatives, The Lot and Queue Line, to approximately 550 additional stores in our chain;
•Expand our distribution network by opening two small-format distribution centers to enable efficient processing of bulky items and full-pallet shipments;
•Implement a space planning tool to improve space productivity and insights;
•Expand our Broyhill® offerings to include housewares and kitchen textiles;
•Continue to grow our store count;
•Update the user interface of our e-commerce platform for easier online shopping; and
•Invest in e-commerce analytics tools for better insights into our customers’ online shopping habits.
Merchandising
We focus our merchandising strategy on (1) being the authority on price and value to Jennifer in all of our merchandise categories and (2) providing a merchandise assortment that surprises and delights her. Under Operation North Star, our merchandising strategy is also focused on strengthening our Home offerings. Home is an area where we believe Jennifer gives us the right to play and where we believe we can play to win.
Strengthening Home begins with growing our own brands, particularly the Broyhill® brand, an iconic brand that we acquired in 2018. We launched the Broyhill® brand of product offerings in late 2019 with initial product offerings in our Furniture, Seasonal, Soft Home, and Hard Home merchandise categories. Available both in-store and online, we believe the Broyhill® assortment strengthens our Home assortment with a high-quality product offering at a value-based price that Jennifer finds attractive. In 2020, we expanded our assortment of Broyhill® products and our customers responded positively. Our Broyhill®-related net sales exceeded $400 million in 2020. In 2021, we plan to expand our Broyhill® assortment to include housewares and kitchen textiles.
We believe our merchandising strategies for Furniture, Seasonal, and Soft Home position us to surprise and delight Jennifer with our Home offerings:
•Our Furniture category primarily focuses on being a destination for our core customer’s home furnishing needs, such as upholstery, mattresses, case goods, and ready-to-assemble. In Furniture, we believe our competitive advantage is attributable to our sourcing relationships, our in-store availability, and everyday value offerings. A significant majority of our offerings in this category consist of replenishable products sold under our own brands or sourced from recognized brand-name manufacturers. Our long-standing relationships with certain brand-name manufacturers, most notably in our mattresses and upholstery departments, allow us to work directly with them to create product offerings specifically for us, which enables us to provide a high-quality product at a competitive price. Additionally, we believe our “buy today, take home today” practice of carrying in-stock inventory of our core furniture offerings, which allows Jennifer to take home her purchase at the end of her shopping experience, positively differentiates us from our
competition. We encourage Jennifer to shop and buy our products online anytime and anywhere, and we invite her into our stores to touch and feel the quality and comfort of our products. Additionally, Jennifer can have furniture delivered to her door same-day through PICKUP®, our new national delivery partner. We believe that offering a focused assortment, which is displayed in furniture vignettes, provides Jennifer a solution for decorating her home when combined with our home décor offerings. Supplementing our merchandising and presentation strategies, we provide multiple third-party financing options for our customers who may be more challenged for approval in traditional credit channels. Our financing partners are solely responsible for the credit approval decisions and carry the financial risk.
•Our Seasonal category strengthens Home with our patio furniture, gazebos, Christmas trim, and other holiday departments. We believe we have a competitive advantage in this category by offering trend-right products with a strong value proposition in our own brands. We have a large selection of samples assembled and displayed throughout the seasonal section of our store and have packaged the box stock so that it is very easy for Jennifer to purchase and take home. Much of this merchandise is sourced on an import basis, which allows us to maintain our competitive pricing. Additionally, our Seasonal category offers a mix of departments and products that surprise and delight by complementing her outdoor experience and holiday decorating desires. We continue to work with our vendors to expand the product assortment in our Seasonal category to respond to Jennifer’s evolving wants and needs.
•Our Soft Home category complements our Furniture and Seasonal categories in making our stores a destination for a broader range of Home needs. Over the past several years, we have enhanced our assortment in Soft Home by allocating more selling space to the category to support a wider range of replenishable, fashion-based products. We believe that we have a competitive advantage in Soft Home as a result of our trend-right, focused assortment with improved quality and perceived value, and our ability to furnish Jennifer’s home with décor that complements an in-store furniture purchase. We have worked to develop a “solutions” approach to complete a room through our cross-merchandising efforts, particularly color palette coordination, when combining our Soft Home offerings with our Furniture and Seasonal categories. We believe that this approach helps Jennifer envision how the product can work in her home and enhances our brand image.
We consider Food, Consumables, Hard Home, and Electronics, Toys, & Accessories as convenience categories:
•Our Food and Consumables categories focus primarily on catering to Jennifer’s daily essentials by providing reliable value, consistency, and convenience of product offerings. We believe we possess a competitive advantage in the Food and Consumables categories based on our sourcing capabilities for closeout merchandise. Manufacturers and vendors have closeout merchandise for a variety of different reasons, including other retailers canceling orders or going out of business, production overruns, or marketing or packaging changes. We believe our vendor relationships, along with our size and financial strength, afford us these opportunities. To supplement our closeout business, we have focused on improving and expanding our brand name, “never out” product assortment to provide more consistency in those areas where Jennifer desires consistently available product offerings, such as over-the-counter medications. We believe that we have added top brands to our “never out” programs in Consumables and that our assortment and value proposition will continue to differentiate us in this highly competitive industry. In 2020, we reallocated space from the Food category to the Consumables category through our “Pantry Optimization” initiative, which right-sized our food assortment, including reducing our refrigerated foods, and allowed us to expand the “never out” Consumables assortment that Jennifer has told us she loves.
•We believe that our Hard Home and Electronics, Toys, & Accessories categories serve as convenient adjacencies to our other merchandise categories. Over the past several years, with the exception of apparel, we have intentionally narrowed our assortments in these categories and reallocated space from these categories to our Home categories. These categories focus on value, and savings in comparison to competitors, in areas such as food prep, table top, home maintenance, small appliances, electronics, and apparel. In 2020, we expanded our apparel assortment to include graphic tees following a successful test during 2019. These graphic tees are primarily displayed in The Lot, but also appear in other sections of our store. Additionally, during 2020, we took advantage of several well-received closeout opportunities to expand our apparel offering and we intend to continue seeking apparel closeouts going forward.
Our merchandising management team is aligned with our merchandise categories, and their primary goal is to increase our total company comparable sales (“comp” or “comps”), which includes stores open at least fifteen months, plus our e-commerce operations. Our review of the performance of the members of our merchandise management team focuses on comps by merchandise category, as we believe it is the key metric that will drive our long-term net sales. By focusing on strengthening our Home offerings, and managing our convenience categories, we believe our merchandise management team can effectively address the changing shopping behaviors of our customers and implement more focused offerings within each merchandise category, which we believe will lead to continued comp growth.
Marketing
The top priority of our marketing activities is to increase our net sales and comps by developing our brand identity as (1) the authority on price and value for Jennifer and (2) a source of surprise and delight. Over the past few years, we have reviewed our brand identity to gain further insights into Jennifer’s perception of us and how best to improve the overall effectiveness of our marketing efforts. Our research has affirmed that Jennifer is deal-driven, enjoys a “treasure hunt,” comes to us for our value-priced merchandise assortment, and appreciates our ability to assist her in fashioning and furnishing her home so that she can feel empowered to enjoy the space with family and friends. We believe our strong price value perception and the surprise and delight factor in our stores enhances our ability to effectively connect with Jennifer in a way that lets her understand when shopping at Big Lots, she can afford to live Big, while saving Lots.
In an effort to align our messaging with the positive aspects of Jennifer’s perception of our brand, we have focused our marketing efforts on driving our value proposition in every season and category. We continue to increase our use of social and digital media outlets, including conducting entire campaigns through these outlets (specifically on Facebook®, Instagram®, Pinterest®, Twitter®, and YouTube®), to drive an increased understanding of our value proposition with our core customer and to communicate that message to new potential customers. These outlets enable us to deliver our message directly to Jennifer and provide her with the opportunity to share direct feedback with us, which can enhance our understanding of what is most important to her and how we can improve the shopping experience in our stores. Given our customer’s proficiency with mobile devices and digital media, we focus on communicating with her through those channels.
Our BIG Rewards Program allows us to more effectively incentivize our loyal customers and encourage new membership by highlighting the significant features and benefits. Our loyalty program rewards Jennifer with a coupon after every third purchase, a birthday reward offer, and special rewards after large-ticket furniture purchases. Research has shown there is a direct correlation between loyal, frequent shoppers and a larger basket. We believe that growing the membership base of the BIG Rewards Program will provide more opportunities to understand and leverage customer behavior through segmentation. We leverage our rewards program database to gain insights into shopping behaviors, reengage lapsed members, and tailor our assortment and promotions to Jennifer’s desires. At January 30, 2021, our BIG Rewards Program had nearly 21 million active members (defined as having made a purchase in the last 12 months) and we are focused on continuing to grow the membership base of our BIG Rewards Program in 2021.
In addition to electronic, social and digital media, our marketing communication efforts involve a mix of television advertising, printed ad circulars, and in-store signage. The primary goals of our television advertising are to promote our brand and, from time to time, promote products or special discounts in our stores. We have also shifted towards using more digital streaming media in concentrated markets, which allows us to connect more deeply and frequently with Jennifer. Our printed advertising circulars and our in-store signage initiatives focus on promoting our value proposition on our unique merchandise offerings.
Shopping Experience
One of the core objectives of Operation North Star is to responsibly invest in store presentation initiatives that create an easy shopping experience for our customers.
From 2017 through 2019, we invested heavily in a presentation initiative we called “Store of the Future,” which moved our Furniture department to the front center of the store with Seasonal and Soft Home on either side and moved Food and Consumables to the back of the store, while keeping them visible with clear sight lines from the entrance of the store. Additionally, the Store of the Future concept included improved lighting and new flooring. Prior to 2020, we intended to expand the Store of the Future concept to our entire chain of stores. In 2020, we reevaluated our investment in the Store of the Future concept and chose to shift our focus to smaller scale initiatives, such as The Lot and Queue Line initiatives discussed below, that we believe will have a higher return on our investment. Therefore, we do not plan to invest in the Store of the Future concept going forward.
In 2020, we implemented a presentation solution we call “The Lot” in approximately 50% of our stores. We designed The Lot to add incremental selling space to our store layout and display items from various merchandise categories placed in vignettes to promote life’s occasions, such as fall tailgating. The Lot offers surprise and delight to Jennifer by demonstrating the breadth and value of products that we offer in one convenient experience. Our expectation is to re-introduce Jennifer to the “treasure” that we offer, while removing the challenges of the “hunt” from the experience. In 2021, we plan to expand The Lot to approximately 550 additional stores.
Also in 2020, we implemented a streamlined checkout experience in approximately 50% of our stores that we call the “Queue Line,” which features a reconfigured checkout design. The Queue Line both enhances the customer experience and builds a bigger basket as our customers walk by new and expanded convenience offerings as they check out. Furthermore, the Queue Line creates additional selling space for our Furniture merchandise category. In 2021, we plan to expand the Queue Line to approximately 550 additional stores.
As discussed above in “Merchandising,” in 2020, we reallocated space from the Food category to the Consumables category as part of our Pantry Optimization project. This project streamlined our Food assortment and added more staple Consumables offerings to provide the consistency that drives our customers to keep coming back to our stores. We believe this initiative has resonated well with our customers and we are continuing to refine our assortments to meet her needs.
In addition to our efforts to improve the in-store shopping experience, Operation North Star is focused on improving our e-commerce shopping experience and growing e-commerce net sales. Our efforts are centered around removing barriers, creating a fun and easy experience, and expanding the items available for purchase online. Over the last few years, we have made a concerted effort to increase our “extended aisle” assortments on our e-commerce platform, which offer additional fabric and color options on products in our Furniture and Seasonal categories, including items only available online. In 2019, we launched our BOPIS program nationwide, which has allowed us to nearly double the available SKUs online. In 2020, we launched curbside pickup to supplement our BOPIS service, began selling gift cards online, reduced shipping times by expanding our distribution network to include ship-from-store capabilities at 47 stores around the country, and introduced same-day delivery of all items available in our stores through our partnerships with Instacart® and PICKUP®. In 2021, we plan to update the user interface of our e-commerce site to create an easier shopping experience and implement new analytics tools so we can gain better insights into our customer’s online shopping habits to fuel future improvements to the user experience.
Lastly, we continue to offer a private label credit card and our Easy Leasing lease-to-own solutions for customer financing and a coverage/warranty program, focused on our Furniture and Seasonal merchandise categories, to round out Jennifer’s experience. Our private label credit card provides access to revolving credit, through a third party, for use on both larger ticket items and daily purchases. Our Easy Leasing lease-to-own program provides a single use opportunity for access to third-party financing. Our coverage/warranty program provides a method for obtaining multi-year warranty coverage for Furniture purchases. In 2021, we plan to expand our coverage/warranty program to include additional merchandise categories and offer coverage/warranty plans on our e-commerce platform.
Real Estate
Historically, we had determined that our average store size of approximately 22,000 selling square feet was appropriate for us to provide our core customer with a positive shopping experience and properly present a representative assortment of merchandise categories that our core customer finds meaningful. As we have shifted our net sales to a higher proportion of Furniture, we have chosen to gradually expand the size of our new stores to accommodate the Furniture vignettes.
From 2017 through 2019, we remodeled existing stores and opened new stores in our Store of the Future layout. In 2020, we reevaluated our investment in the Store of the Future concept and chose to shift our focus to smaller scale initiatives that we believe will generate higher returns.
Our current real estate development plans include a focus on growing our store count, which we expect to increase by 15 to 25 stores in 2021, and refreshing select older stores in our fleet, which includes low-cost updates to paint, flooring, restrooms, and exterior signage.
During 2021, we anticipate opening 50 to 60 stores and closing approximately 35 of our existing locations, which includes approximately 20 relocations within the same market. As discussed in “Item 2. Properties,” of this Form 10-K, we have 245 store leases that will expire in 2021. The majority of our 2021 closings will involve the relocation of stores to improved locations within the same local market, with the balance resulting from a lack of renewal options or our belief that a location’s sales and operating profit volume are not strong enough to warrant additional investment in the location. As part of our evaluation of potential store closings, we consider our ability to transfer sales from a closing store to other nearby locations and generate a better overall financial result for the geographic market. For our remaining store locations with fiscal 2021 lease expirations, we expect to exercise our renewal option or negotiate lease renewal terms sufficient to allow us to continue operations and achieve an acceptable return on our investment. As we increase our capital investment in our stores, we have collaborated with our landlords to negotiate longer lease terms and renewal options.
2020 COMPARED TO 2019
Net Sales
Net sales by merchandise category (in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales), net sales change (in dollars and percentage), and comps in 2020 compared to 2019 were as follows:
We periodically assess and make minor adjustments to our product hierarchy, which can impact the roll-up to our merchandise categories. Our financial reporting process utilizes the most current product hierarchy in reporting net sales by merchandise category for all periods presented. Therefore, there may be minor reclassifications of net sales by merchandise category compared to previously reported amounts.
Net sales increased $876.0 million, or 16.5%, to $6,199.2 million in 2020, compared to $5,323.2 million in 2019. The increase in net sales was due to comp increases in each of our merchandise categories, with an overall comp increase of 16.1%, which increased net sales by $816.1 million. Additionally, there was a $59.9 million increase in net sales from our non-comparable stores, driven by increased sales in our new and relocated stores compared to our closed stores and the net increase of four stores in 2020.
In 2020, we experienced a favorable impact to net sales due to our position as an “essential retailer” during the COVID-19 pandemic and an increased demand for our home products as customers were spending more time at home. In the first quarter, we experienced a significant increase in demand for “Essential Products”, which we define as food, consumables, health products, and pet supplies. The primary impact was in our Food and Consumables merchandise categories as customers began stocking up on Essential Products as concern over the COVID-19 pandemic grew. From the end of the first quarter through the second quarter of 2020, we experienced a surge in demand in our Furniture, Seasonal, Soft Home, and Hard Home categories driven by the release of government stimulus and unemployment funds under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act of 2020. Following the release of government stimulus and unemployment funds, a “nesting” trend emerged. As a result of spending more time at home, customers chose to invest more in their home which drove a continued demand in our Furniture, Soft Home, and Hard Home through the balance of 2020. We experienced earlier-than-usual Christmas holiday sales late in the third quarter of 2020 and early in the fourth quarter of 2020, which, combined with an intentional reduction in Christmas inventory purchases due to demand uncertainty in the Spring of 2020, led to lower levels of Christmas seasonal inventory and had an unfavorable impact on net sales early in the fourth quarter of 2020. Late in the fourth quarter, we experienced a favorable impact to net sales due to the release of a second round of government stimulus funds.
In 2020, we introduced The Lot and the Queue Line initiatives in approximately 50% of our stores, which also contributed to the increased net sales and positive comps compared to 2019. Additionally, the impact of our Pantry Optimization project, which was completed late in the third quarter of 2020, contributed to the increased net sales and positive comps in comparison to 2019.
We believe we have successfully retained the new customers we attracted as a result of our position as an essential retailer and we have seen a positive response to our strategic initiatives and our product assortment’s alignment with customer demand.
All of our merchandise categories generated increased net sales and positive comps in 2020 compared to 2019:
•Our Furniture and Soft Home categories experienced increased net sales and positive comps during 2020, driven by our customers choosing to invest in home furnishings and home decor as a result of nesting trends throughout 2020, as well as a surge in demand following the release of government stimulus and unemployment funds in the second and fourth quarters of 2020. Additionally, customers have responded positively to our brand-name mattress assortment and our Broyhill® assortments.
•The increased sales and positive comps in our Food and Consumables categories were driven primarily by a surge in demand for Essential Products during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the Consumables category benefited from the completion of our Pantry Optimization project, which reallocated linear square footage from the Food category to the Consumables category.
•Our Seasonal category experienced an increase in net sales and positive comps driven by the summer, lawn & garden, and harvest departments. These increases were primarily driven by nesting trends, as our customers have spent more time in their homes throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, which increased their desire to decorate for holidays and invest in outdoor furniture and lawn maintenance. Additionally, we benefited from increased sales of high-ticket items such as patio furniture following the release of government unemployment and stimulus funds in mid-April 2020. Our customers have also continued to respond well to our Broyhill® patio furniture assortments. The increase in net sales and comps in our Seasonal category was partially offset by a decrease in net sales and comps in our Christmas department, which was due to our decision in the Spring of 2020 to reduce our Christmas inventory purchases based on discretionary spending concerns connected with the COVID-19 pandemic. While we worked to increase our Christmas purchases when pandemic-related economic concerns subsided, we were unable to reach inventory levels that met our pre-pandemic planned purchases and customer demand.
•The increase in net sales and comps in the Electronics, Toys, & Accessories category was driven by our toys, apparel, and accessories departments. The increase was primarily due to the introduction of these products into The Lot and Queue line presentations in 2020.
•Hard Home experienced increased sales and positive comps driven by an increase in our small appliances, table top, and food preparation departments. Despite space reductions and the exit from our greeting card offering, we experienced high demand for products that improve our customers’ at-home dining experience.
Gross Margin
Gross margin dollars increased $382.7 million, or 18.1%, to $2,497.4 million in 2020, compared to $2,114.7 million in 2019. The increase in gross margin dollars was primarily due to an increase in net sales, which increased gross margin dollars by $348.0 million. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales, or gross margin rate, increased 60 basis points to 40.3% in 2020 compared to 39.7% in 2019. The gross margin rate increase was primarily due to a lower markdown rate, higher comps in our high margin merchandise categories, and the absence of a $6.0 million impairment of inventory in our greeting cards department, which we chose to exit in the first quarter of 2019. The increase in gross margin rate was partially offset by higher shrink costs and lower initial mark-up compared to 2019, as our receipts skewed towards domestic purchases, which carry a lower average initial markup. Additionally, our lower initial markup was driven by a significant increase in inbound freight costs in the fourth quarter of 2020, which resulted from transportation capacity restraints and processing backlogs at our distribution centers as we worked to restore inventory levels.
Selling and Administrative Expenses
Selling and administrative expenses were $1,965.6 million in 2020, compared to $1,823.4 million in 2019. The increase of $142.2 million, or 7.8%, was primarily due to $59.2 million in distribution and transportation costs, store-related payroll of $50.5 million, bonus expense of $34.3 million, $13.1 million of share-based compensation expense, $9.1 million of store occupancy expense, advertising expense of $7.6 million, transaction fees of $8.8 million, $7.0 million in stores supplies expense, $4.6 million of employee retirement and separation costs, $4.0 million of sale and leaseback related expenses, and $3.7 million of proxy contest-related costs, partially offset by the absence of $38.3 million in costs incurred for our transformational restructuring initiative, the absence of a $7.3 million loss contingency recorded in 2019, and a decrease in health benefit costs of $16.4 million. The increase in distribution and transportation expenses was due to the transition from our Rancho Cucamonga, CA distribution center to our Apple Valley, CA distribution center, rent expense on our leased distribution centers, higher outbound rates and volume to support our increased net sales, and a temporary $2 per hour wage increase that began in March 2020 and continued through early July 2020 for most of our non-exempt workforce during the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. The increase in store-related payroll was driven by additional payroll hours allocated to stores to support the increased net sales in 2020 and the aforementioned temporary $2 per hour wage increase. The increase in bonus expense was driven by increased performance in 2020 relative to our quarterly and annual operating plans as compared to our performance in 2019 relative to our quarterly and annual operating plans, and a one-time discretionary bonus in the second quarter of 2020 to recognize our non-exempt associates in our stores and distribution centers. Our share-based compensation expense increased as a result of higher grant date fair value and higher estimated performance for the 2018 performance share units (“PSUs”) for which we recognized expense during 2020, compared to the 2017 PSUs for which expense was recognized in 2019. Additionally, our share-based compensation expense increased due to our grant in 2020 of performance share units with a restriction feature to certain members of management, which vest based on the achievement of share price performance goals and a minimum service requirement of one year (“PRSUs”). We began recognizing expense for PRSUs in 2020, compared to our PSU awards, which typically have a deferred grant date. The increase in store occupancy expense was due to new stores opened since the end of 2019, which have higher rents than the stores closed, and normal rent increases resulting from lease renewals. Advertising expense increased due to increased investments in social media engagement and rewards-
based marketing. The increase in transaction fees, which includes credit card fees, debit card fees, and other transaction-driven costs, was primarily due to the increased net sales in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in store supplies expense was driven by safety and cleaning supplies, such as personal protective equipment, hand sanitizer, and disinfectants, distributed to our stores in 2020 to ensure a safe environment for our customers and associates during the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. The employee retirement and separation costs were primarily driven by the retirement and separation of senior executives in 2020. The sale and leaseback related expenses were due to consulting costs incurred in connection with the completion of the sale and leaseback transactions for four distribution centers in the second quarter of 2020. The proxy contest-related costs were comprised of legal, public relations, and advisory fees, and settlement costs incurred to resolve a proxy contest in the first quarter of 2020. The costs incurred for our transformational restructuring initiative consisted of consulting expenses and employee separation costs recognized in 2019. The loss contingency recorded in 2019 was associated with wage and hour claims in the state of California. The decrease in health benefits costs was primarily due to lower benefits claim volume in 2020 as many medical care providers suspended non-emergency care and procedures during 2020 due to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.
As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses decreased by 260 basis points to 31.7% in 2020 compared to 34.3% in 2019.
Depreciation Expense
Depreciation expense increased $3.3 million to $138.3 million in 2020 compared to $135.0 million in 2019. The increase was primarily driven by the full-year impact of investments in our Apple Valley, CA distribution center, new store build-outs and Store of the Future remodels in 2019, and the acquisition of our corporate headquarters facility in the third quarter of 2019, partially offset by a decrease resulting from the sale of four distribution centers in 2020.
Depreciation expense as a percentage of net sales decreased by 30 basis points compared to 2019.
Gain on Sale of Distribution Centers
The gain on sale of distribution center in 2020 was $463.1 million, compared to $178.5 million in 2019. The gain on sale of distribution centers in 2020 was attributable to the sale and leaseback of our distribution centers in Durant, OK; Tremont, PA; Montgomery, AL; and Columbus, OH. The gain on sale of distribution centers in 2019 was attributable to the sale of our Rancho Cucamonga, CA distribution center.
Operating Profit
Operating profit was $856.5 million in 2020 compared to $334.8 million in 2019. The increase in operating profit was primarily driven by the items discussed in the “Net Sales,” “Gross Margin,” “Selling and Administrative Expenses,” “Depreciation Expense,” and “Gain on Sale of Distribution Centers” sections above. In summary, operating profit was driven by the gain on the sale of our distribution centers and an increase in net sales and gross margin rate, partially offset by increases in selling and administrative expenses and depreciation expense.
Interest Expense
Interest expense decreased $5.8 million, to $11.0 million in 2020 compared to $16.8 million in 2019. The decrease in interest expense was driven by lower total average borrowings (including finance leases and the sale and leaseback financing liability) and a lower average interest rate on our revolving debt. We had total average borrowings of $257.6 million in 2020 compared to total average borrowings of $461.6 million in 2019. The decrease in total average borrowings was driven by our repayment of all outstanding debt under the 2018 Credit Agreement following the sale and leaseback transactions completed in the second quarter of 2020, partially offset by the timing of our entry into a $70 million term note on August 7, 2019 (“2019 Term Note”), as the 2019 Term Note was only in place for the second half of 2019, and the establishment of a financial liability in connection with the sale and leaseback transactions for our distribution centers in the second quarter of 2020. The average interest rate on our revolving debt, which is variable based on LIBOR and our credit rating, decreased due to a significant decline in the LIBOR rate in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, partially offset by the impact of a decrease in our credit rating during the first quarter of 2020.
Other Income (Expense)
Other income (expense) was $(0.9) million in 2020, compared to $(0.5) million in 2019. The change was primarily driven by unrealized losses on our diesel fuel derivatives due to a sharp decline in current and forward diesel fuel prices in the first quarter of 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Income Taxes
Our effective income tax rate in 2020 and 2019 was 25.5% and 23.6%, respectively. The increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily attributable to the impact of the sale of our distribution centers. In 2019, the tax rate on the gain on the sale of our California distribution center was less than our normalized rate, thereby reducing our effective tax rate in 2019. In 2020, the tax rate on the gain on sale of our non-California distribution centers was similar to our normalized tax rate, thereby having a more muted impact on our effective tax rate in 2020. Additionally, the impact of our discrete items was similar in value in 2020 compared to 2019, but their impact on the tax rate was significantly curtailed in 2020 by the significant increase in income before income taxes in 2020 as compared to 2019.
2021 Guidance
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The continued spread of the virus throughout the U.S. has significantly impacted the U.S. economy, which has reduced our visibility to future financial results. In 2021, we expect that our financial performance will continue to be significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which includes the impact of volatility in consumer sentiment and potential impact of future government stimulus. Therefore, at this time, the Company does not believe it has sufficient visibility to provide full year guidance for 2021.
Based on information available as of March 5, 2021, and excluding consideration of potential share repurchase activity and government stimulus and/or enhanced unemployment funds released during the first quarter of 2021, we expect the following in the first quarter of 2021:
•Comparable sales increase in the low single digits;
•Gross margin rate in the range of flat to slightly above last year, despite higher anticipated freight costs;
•Selling and administrative expenses above last year; and
•Diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.30 to $1.45.
Capital Resources and Liquidity
On August 31, 2018, we entered into the 2018 Credit Agreement, which provides for a $700 million five-year unsecured credit facility. The 2018 Credit Agreement expires on August 31, 2023. Borrowings under the 2018 Credit Agreement are available for general corporate purposes, working capital, and to repay certain indebtedness. The 2018 Credit Agreement includes a $30 million swing loan sublimit, a $75 million letter of credit sublimit, a $75 million sublimit for loans to foreign borrowers, and a $200 million optional currency sublimit. The interest rates, pricing and fees under the 2018 Credit Agreement fluctuate based on our debt rating. The 2018 Credit Agreement allows us to select our interest rate for each borrowing from multiple interest rate options. The interest rate options are generally derived from the prime rate or LIBOR. We may prepay revolving loans made under the 2018 Credit Agreement without penalty. The 2018 Credit Agreement contains financial and other covenants, including, but not limited to, limitations on indebtedness, liens and investments, as well as the maintenance of two financial ratios - a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio. The covenants of the 2018 Credit Agreement do not restrict our ability to pay dividends. Additionally, we are subject to cross-default provisions associated with the synthetic lease for our distribution center in Apple Valley, CA. A violation of any of the covenants could result in a default under the 2018 Credit Agreement that would permit the lenders to restrict our ability to further access the 2018 Credit Agreement for loans and letters of credit and require the immediate repayment of any outstanding loans under the 2018 Credit Agreement. At January 30, 2021, we were in compliance with the covenants of the 2018 Credit Agreement.
On August 7, 2019, we entered into the 2019 Term Note, a $70 million term note agreement, which is secured by the equipment at our California distribution center. The 2019 Term Note will expire on May 7, 2024. We are required to make monthly payments over the term of the 2019 Term Note and are permitted to prepay the note, subject to penalties, at any time. The interest rate on the note is fixed at 3.3%.
The primary source of our liquidity is cash flows from operations and borrowings under the 2018 Credit Agreement, as necessary. Our net income and, consequently, our cash provided by operations are impacted by net sales volume, seasonal sales patterns, and operating profit margins. Our net sales are typically highest during the nine-week Christmas selling season in our fourth fiscal quarter. However, due to demand volatility we have experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, the seasonality of our 2020 results differed from historical experience and our 2021 results may differ from historical experience. Generally, our working capital requirements peak late in our third fiscal quarter or early in our fourth fiscal quarter. We have historically funded those requirements with borrowings under our credit facility. However, as a result of the sale and leaseback transactions completed in the second quarter of 2020 and our strong cash flow from operations in 2020, we funded our working capital requirements for the second half of 2020 without borrowing under the 2018 Credit Agreement. At January 30, 2021, we had no borrowings under the 2018 Credit Agreement, and the borrowings available under the 2018 Credit Agreement were $693.3 million, after taking into account the reduction in availability resulting from outstanding letters of credit totaling $6.7 million. Currently, we do not anticipate borrowing under the 2018 Credit Agreement during 2021. Cash requirements include among other things, capital expenditures, working capital needs, interest payments, and other contractual commitments.
As a measure to secure additional liquidity during a period of economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, on June 12, 2020, we completed the sale and leaseback transactions relating to our distribution centers located in Columbus, OH; Durant, OK; Montgomery, AL; and Tremont, PA for an aggregate selling price of $725 million. Due to sale-leaseback accounting requirements, the proceeds received in the transactions were allocated between proceeds on the sale of the distribution centers and financing proceeds. Accordingly, aggregate net proceeds on the sales of the distribution centers was $586.9 million and the aggregate gain on the sales was $463.1 million. The remainder of consideration received was financing liability proceeds of $134.0 million. See note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on the sale and leaseback transactions.
In 2020, we invested a portion of the proceeds from the sale and leaseback of the four distribution centers in money market funds, commercial paper, and treasury bills, of which only money market funds were held at January 30, 2021. These highly liquid investments were recorded in cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheets at their fair value. Our aggregate money market fund investments were $175.1 million and $0 at January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020, respectively.
As a result of the sale and leaseback transactions and our strong cash flow from operations during 2020, our cash and cash equivalents increased $506.9 million to $559.6 million compared to 2019.
In August 2020, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500 million of our common shares (“2020 Repurchase Authorization”). Pursuant to the 2020 Repurchase Authorization, we are authorized to repurchase shares in the open market and/or in privately negotiated transactions at our discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors. Common shares acquired through the 2020 Repurchase Authorization will be available to meet obligations under our equity compensation plans and for general corporate purposes. The 2020 Repurchase Authorization has no scheduled termination date and we intend to fund repurchases under the authorization with cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash generated from operations going forward. During 2020, we purchased 3.8 million of our common shares for $172.8 million under the 2020 Repurchase Authorization, at an average price of $46.05.
In 2020, we declared and paid four quarterly cash dividends of $0.30 per common share for a total paid amount of $47.0 million. The cash dividends declared and paid in 2020 were consistent with the cash dividends declared and paid in 2019.
In March 2021, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per common share payable on April 2, 2021 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 19, 2021.
The following table compares the primary components of our cash flows from 2020 to 2019:
Cash provided by operating activities increased by $60.4 million to $399.3 million in 2020 compared to $339.0 million in 2019. The increase was primarily driven by our higher net income, after adjusting for non-cash activity such as deferred taxes and the add-back for the gain on disposition of property and equipment, and an increase in income taxes payable, which was principally due to our higher taxable income in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was partly offset by a decrease in the combined change in inventory and accounts payable, which resulted from our lower inventory position at the end of 2019.
Cash provided by (used in) investing activities increased by $527.5 million to cash provided by investing activities of $453.0 million in 2020 compared to cash used in investing activities of $74.5 million in 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in cash proceeds from sale of property and equipment, resulting from the sale of four distribution centers in 2020 compared to the sale of one distribution center in 2019. Additionally, our capital expenditures decreased compared to 2019, which was driven by our decision to reduce our investments in our Store of the Future concept and new stores in 2020 to preserve liquidity and promote safety during the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, and a decrease in investments in our Apple Valley, CA distribution center which opened in late 2019.
Cash used in financing activities increased by $87.7 million to $345.5 million in 2020 compared to $257.8 million in cash used in financing activities in 2019. The increase was driven by increases in net repayments of long-term debt resulting from our repayment of all outstanding borrowings under the 2018 Credit Agreement during 2020 and payment for treasury shares acquired, which is due to our repurchase of $172.8 million of our common shares under the 2020 Repurchase Authorization
during 2020, compared to our repurchase of $50.0 million of our common shares under the 2019 Repurchase Program during 2019. The increases were partially offset by an increase in net financing proceeds from sale and leaseback resulting from the sale and leaseback of four distribution centers in 2020 and a decrease in payment of finance lease obligations, which was due to the exercise of a purchase option to acquire our corporate headquarters in 2019.
Based on historical and expected financial results, we believe that we have or, if necessary, have the ability to obtain, adequate resources to fund ongoing and seasonal working capital requirements, proposed capital expenditures, new projects, and currently maturing obligations.
Contractual Obligations
The following table summarizes payments due under our contractual obligations at January 30, 2021:
(1)The disclosure of contractual obligations in this table is based on assumptions and estimates that we believe to be reasonable as of the date of this report. Those assumptions and estimates may prove to be inaccurate; consequently, the amounts provided in the table may differ materially from those amounts that we ultimately incur. Variables that may cause the stated amounts to vary from the amounts actually incurred include, but are not limited to: the termination of a contractual obligation prior to its stated or anticipated expiration; fees or damages incurred as a result of the premature termination or breach of a contractual obligation; the acquisition of more or less services or goods under a contractual obligation than are anticipated by us as of the date of this report; fluctuations in third party fees, governmental charges, or market rates that we are obligated to pay under contracts we have with certain vendors; and the exercise of renewal options under, or the automatic renewal of, contracts that provide for the same.
(2)Long-term debt consists of the borrowings outstanding under the 2019 Term Note, expected interest on the 2019 Term Note, and associated accrued interest of $0.1 million. At January 30, 2021, we had no borrowings under the 2018 Credit Agreement. In addition, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $41.0 million at January 30, 2021. Approximately $34.3 million of the outstanding letters of credit represent stand-by letters of credit and we do not expect to meet the conditions requiring significant cash payments on these letters of credit; accordingly, they have been excluded from this table. For further discussion, see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The remaining $6.7 million of outstanding letters of credit represent commercial letters of credit whereby the related obligation is included in the purchase obligation.
(3)Operating lease obligations include, among other items, leases for retail stores and distribution centers. The future commitments for retail store and distribution center leases are $2,144.4 million. In accordance with lease accounting requirements, we have assessed the reasonable certainty of exercising options to extend or terminate existing leases to determine the duration of our lease obligations. For a further discussion of leases, see note 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Many of our store lease obligations require us to pay for our applicable portion of CAM, real estate taxes, and property insurance. In connection with our store lease obligations, we estimated that future obligations for CAM, real estate taxes, and property insurance were $342.4 million at January 30, 2021. We have made certain assumptions and estimates in order to account for our contractual obligations relative to CAM, real estate taxes, and property insurance. Those assumptions and estimates include, but are not limited to: use of historical data to estimate our future obligations; calculation of our obligations based on comparable store averages where no historical data is available for a particular leasehold; and assumptions related to average expected increases over historical data.
(4)For purposes of the purchase obligation disclosures, we have assumed that we will make all payments scheduled or reasonably estimated to be made under those obligations that have a determinable expiration date, and we disregarded the possibility that such obligations may be prematurely terminated or extended, whether automatically by the terms of
the obligation or by agreement between us and the counterparty, due to the speculative nature of premature termination or extension. Where a purchase obligation is subject to a month-to-month term or another automatically renewing term, we included in the table our minimum commitment under such obligation, such as one month in the case of a month-to-month obligation and the then-current term in the case of another automatically renewing term, due to the uncertainty of future decisions to exercise options to extend or terminate any existing agreements.
(5)Purchase obligations include outstanding purchase orders for merchandise issued in the ordinary course of our business that are valued at $722.5 million, the entirety of which represents obligations due within one year of January 30, 2021. The remaining $401.2 million of purchase obligations is primarily related to distribution and transportation, information technology, print advertising, energy procurement, and other store security, supply, and maintenance commitments, which includes $16.0 million for a charitable commitment over six years, which is the remaining obligation of a $40.0 million charitable donation over a 10-year period.
(6)Other long-term liabilities include $213.8 million for payment of financing obligations related to the sale and leaseback transactions for four distribution centers, $32.8 million for obligations related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plan, and $3.4 million for unrecognized tax benefits. In 2020, we completed sale and leaseback transactions for four distribution centers, which gave rise to a financing obligation. The financing obligations related to the sale and leaseback transactions include expected interest on the obligations. In December 2020, we notified plan participants in our nonqualified deferred compensation plan of our decision to terminate the plan and distribute all account balances to plan participants by the end of 2021. Accordingly, obligations related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plan reflect our intent to pay all remaining obligations by the end of 2021. We have included unrecognized tax benefits of $2.1 million for payments expected in 2021 and $1.3 million of timing-related income tax uncertainties anticipated to reverse in 2021. Unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of $10.0 million have been excluded from the table because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. The use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions creates a level of uncertainty with respect to reported or disclosed amounts in our consolidated financial statements or accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, judgments, and assumptions, including those that management considers critical to the accurate presentation and disclosure of our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates, judgments, and assumptions on historical experience, current trends, and various other factors that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the inherent uncertainty in using estimates, judgments, and assumptions, actual results may differ from these estimates.
Our significant accounting policies, including the recently adopted accounting standards and recent accounting standards - future adoptions, if any, are described in note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We believe the following estimates, assumptions, and judgments are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. Management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.
Merchandise Inventories
Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the average cost retail inventory method. Market is determined based on the estimated net realizable value, which generally is the merchandise selling price at or near the end of the reporting period. The average cost retail inventory method requires management to make judgments and contains estimates, such as the amount and timing of markdowns to clear slow-moving inventory and the allowance for shrinkage, which may impact the ending inventory valuation and current or future gross margin. These estimates are based on historical experience and current information.
When management determines the salability of merchandise inventories is diminished, markdowns for clearance activity and the related cost impact are recorded at the time the price change decision is made. Factors considered in the determination of markdowns include current and anticipated demand, customer preferences, the age of merchandise, and seasonal trends. Timing of holidays within fiscal periods, weather, and customer preferences could cause material changes in the amount and timing of markdowns from year to year.
The allowance for shrinkage is recorded as a reduction to inventories, charged to cost of sales, and calculated as a percentage of sales for the period from the last physical inventory date to the end of the reporting period. Such estimates are based on both our current year and historical inventory results. Independent physical inventory counts are typically taken at each store once a year. During 2020, scheduling challenges arising due to COVID-19 resulted in a small number of stores that did not take physical inventory counts in calendar 2020 as initially planned. These stores were prioritized to be counted early in the 2021 physical inventory counting cycle and the allowance for shrinkage associated with these stores at January 30, 2021 was adjusted in consideration of early calendar 2021 results. During calendar 2021, the majority of physical counts will occur between January and June. As physical inventories are completed, actual results are recorded and new go-forward allowance for shrinkage rates are established based on historical results at the individual store level. Thus, the allowance for shrinkage rates will be adjusted throughout the January to June inventory cycle based on actual results. At January 30, 2021, a 10% difference in our shrink accrual would have affected gross margin, operating profit and income before income taxes by approximately $4.1 million. While it is not possible to quantify the impact from each cause of shrinkage, we have asset protection programs and policies aimed at minimizing shrinkage.
Insurance and Insurance-Related Reserves
We are self-insured for certain losses relating to property, general liability, workers’ compensation, and employee medical, dental, and prescription drug benefit claims, a portion of which is funded by employees. We purchase stop-loss coverage from third party insurance carriers to limit individual or aggregate loss exposures in these areas. Accrued insurance liabilities and related expenses are based on actual claims reported and estimates of claims incurred but not reported. The estimated loss accruals for claims incurred but not paid are determined by applying actuarially-based calculations taking into account historical claims payment results and known trends such as claims frequency and claims severity. Management makes estimates, judgments, and assumptions with respect to the use of these actuarially-based calculations, including but not limited to, estimated health care cost trends, estimated lag time to report and pay claims, average cost per claim, network utilization rates, network discount rates, and other factors. A 10% change in our self-insured liabilities at January 30, 2021 would have affected selling and administrative expenses, operating profit, and income before income taxes by approximately $7.9 million.
