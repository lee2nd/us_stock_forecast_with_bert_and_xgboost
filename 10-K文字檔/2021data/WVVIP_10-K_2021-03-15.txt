ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements and related notes. Some statements and information contained in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are not historical facts but are forward-looking statements. For a discussion of these forward-looking statements, and of important factors that could cause results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this report, see Item 1 of Part I, “Business - Forward-Looking Statements.”
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses Willamette Valley Vineyards’ financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. As such, management is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable based upon the information available. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to product returns, bad debts, inventories, leases, investments, income taxes, financing operations, and contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Revenue - The Company’s principal sources of revenue are derived from direct sales and sales through distributors of wine. Distributor sales are recognized from wine sales at the time of shipment and passage of title. The Company’s payment arrangements with wholesalers provide primarily 30-day terms and, to a limited extent, 45-day, 60-day or longer terms for some international wholesalers. Direct sales from items sold through the Company’s retail locations are recognized at the time of sale.
The Company pays depletion allowances to the Company’s distributors based on their sales to their customers. The Company sets these allowances on a monthly basis and the Company’s distributors bill them back on a monthly basis. All depletion expenses associated with a given month are recognized in that month as a reduction of revenues. The Company also reimburses for samples used by distributors up to 1.5% of product sold to the distributors. Sample expenses are recognized at the time the Company is billed by the distributor as a selling, general and administrative expense.
Amounts paid by customers to the Company for shipping and handling expenses are included in the net revenue. Expenses incurred for outbound shipping and handling charges are included in selling, general and administrative expense.
Inventory - The Company values inventories at the lower of actual cost to produce the inventory or net realizable value. The Company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and adjusts its production requirements for the next twelve months based on estimated forecasts of product demand. A significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand. In the future, if the Company’s inventory cost is determined to be greater than the net realizable value of the inventory upon sale, the Company would be required to recognize such excess costs in its cost of goods sold at the time of such determination. Therefore, although the Company makes every effort to ensure the accuracy of its forecasts of future product demand, any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the ultimate selling price and cases sold and, therefore, the carrying value of the Company’s inventory and its reported operating results.
Additionally, the Company regularly evaluates inventory for obsolescence and marketability and if it determines that the inventory is obsolete, or no longer suitable for use or marketable, the cost of that inventory is recognized in its cost of sales at the time of such determination.
Vineyard Development - The Company capitalizes internal vineyard development costs prior to the vineyard land becoming fully productive. These costs consist primarily of the costs of the vines and expenditures related to labor and materials to prepare the land and construct vine trellises. Amortization of such costs as annual crop costs is done on a straight-line basis for the estimated economic useful life of the vineyard, which is estimated to be 30 years. The Company regularly evaluates the recoverability of capitalized costs. Amortization of vineyard development costs are included in capitalized crop costs that in turn are included in inventory costs and ultimately become a component of cost of goods sold.
Income Taxes - The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability approach. This requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and the tax basis of assets and liabilities at the applicable tax rates. The Company evaluates deferred tax assets, and records a valuation allowance against those assets, if available evidence suggests that some of those assets will not be realized.
The effect of uncertain tax positions would be recorded in the financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions would withstand an examination by tax authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. As facts and circumstances change, management reassesses these probabilities and would record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate.
Overview
The Company generates revenue from the sales of wine to wholesalers and direct to consumers. The Company is experiencing increased levels of competition in traditional wholesale to retail grocery distribution from large California based wineries that are acquiring, producing and marketing Oregon branded wines. Direct to consumer sales primarily include sales through the Company’s tasting rooms and wine club. Direct to consumer sales provide a higher gross profit to the Company due to prices received being closer to retail than those prices paid by wholesalers. The Company continues to emphasize growth in direct to consumer sales through use of the Hospitality Center and growth in wine club membership. The Company had 7,873 wine club memberships for the year ended December 31, 2020, a net increase of 308 when compared to 2019. Additionally, the Company’s preferred stock sales since August 2015 have resulted in approximately 7,750 preferred stockholders many of which the Company believes are wine enthusiasts. When considering joint ownership, we believe these new shareholders represent approximately 12,000 potential customers of the Company. The Company also has approximately 2,200 common shareholders which we believe represent an estimated 3,450 potential customers when considering joint ownership. Additionally, the Company has made significant investment in developing alternative wine brands, products, direct sales methods and venues.
Periodically, the Company will sell grapes or bulk wine, which primarily consists of inventory that does not meet Company standards or is in excess to production targets. However, this activity is not a significant part of the Company’s activities.
The Company sold approximately 180,850 and 156,791 cases of produced wine during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, an increase of 24,059 cases, or 15.3% in the current year over the prior year. The increase in case sales was primarily the result of increased shipments to distributors and higher direct sales over the internet in 2020 when compared to 2019.
Cost of Sales includes grape costs, whether purchased or grown at Company vineyards, crush costs, winemaking and processing costs, bottling, packaging, warehousing and shipping and handling costs associated with purchased production materials. For grapes grown at Company vineyards, costs include farming expenditures and amortization of vineyard development costs.
At December 31, 2020, wine inventory included approximately 157,347 cases of bottled wine and 455,016 gallons of bulk wine in various stages of the aging process. Case wine is expected to be sold over the next 12 to 24 months and generally before the release date of the next vintage. The Winery bottled approximately 175,357 cases during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Impact of COVID-19 on Operations
The COVID-19 pandemic has been declared a National Public Health Emergency in the United States, and on March 8, 2020, Oregon Governor Kate Brown declared a state of emergency to address the spread of COVID-19 in Oregon. The outbreak in Oregon and other parts of the United States, as well as the response to COVID-19 by federal, state and local governments could have a continued material adverse impact on economic and market conditions in the United States, which may negatively affect our business and operations. The COVID-19 pandemic and the government responses to the outbreak presents continued uncertainty and risk with respect to the Company and its performance and financial results.
With the exception of key operations personnel, we have shifted our office staff to remote workstations, and we expect we will continue to operate remotely until state and local government restrictions have been lifted and management determines it is safe for employees to return to offices. Far exceeding the required Oregon Healthy Authority protocols, a new state-of-the-art UV light filtration has been installed in the Company’s HVAC system to reduce harmful viruses in the air at its tasting room locations and staff offices.
We have not yet experienced significant disruptions to our supply chain network, however any future stay-at-home orders or other restrictions imposed by our local or state governments may have a negative impact on our future direct to consumer sales. In response to the closure and capacity restrictions on our tasting rooms, the Company launched curbside pick-ups, and complimentary shipping specials with minimum purchase, which have been able to mitigate the expected declines in direct to consumer sales.
Additionally, the demand for the Company’s wine sold directly or through distributors to restaurants, bars, and other hospitality locations will likely be significantly reduced in the near-term due to orders restricting consumers from visiting, as well as in some cases the temporary closure of such establishments.
The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business is highly uncertain and difficult to predict, as the response to the pandemic is continuing to evolve. The severity of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the pandemic and the extent and severity of the impact on the Company’s customers, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted.
Results of Operations
2020 compared to 2019
Net income was $3,394,996 and $2,510,901, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, an increase of $884,095, or 35.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 over the prior year period. The primary reason for this increase was increased sales revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the previous year.
Net income applicable to common shareholders was $2,278,618 and $1,484,838, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, an increase of $793,780, or 53.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 over the prior year period. This increase was primarily driven by higher net income.
The Company had net sales revenues of $27,314,852 and $24,749,263 for the years December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, an increase of $2,565,589 or 10.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 over the prior year period primarily as a result of an increase in revenue from direct sales of $1,069,589 or 11.3% in 2020 compared to 2019, combined with an increase in revenue from sales to distributors of $1,496,000 or 9.8% in 2020 compared to 2019.
The Company has three primary sales channels: direct-to-consumer retail sales, in-state sales to distributors, and out-of-state sales to distributors. During 2020, revenues from retail sales increased 12.6%, revenues from in-state sales increased 27.9%, and revenues from out-of-state sales increased 1.2%, compared to 2019.
Direct sales included $103,958 and $156,768 of bulk wine and grape sales in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and represented approximately 38.6% and 38.2% of the Company’s total net revenue for 2020 and 2019, respectively, while the Company’s remaining revenues came from sales through distributors.
The following table sets forth certain information regarding the Company’s revenue, excluding excise taxes, from the Winery’s operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Retail sales revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $10,560,913 and $9,382,155, respectively, an increase of $1,178,758, or 12.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 over the prior year period. The increase in retail sales revenues in 2020 compared to 2019 was mostly a result of increased revenues from our brand ambassador program and increased wine sales made over the internet, which more than offset lower revenues from hospitality and kitchen sales mostly due to the restrictions on the operation of our tasting rooms resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.
Bulk Wine/miscellaneous sales revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $103,958 and $156,768, respectively, a decrease of $52,810 or, 33.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, over the prior year period. This decrease was primarily the result of a better balance of grapes produced to requirements, which resulted in fewer grapes being in excess of product targets in 2020 compared to the previous year.
In-state sales revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $6,671,743 and $5,215,251, respectively, an increase of $1,456,492, or 27.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 over the prior year period. Management believes this increase is primarily due to increased visibility of our products in the Oregon market as well as enhanced sales efforts in 2020.
Out-of-state sales revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $10,350,708 and $10,228,132, respectively, an increase of $122,576, or 1.2%. Management believes this increase is related to increased sales and promotion efforts in 2020.
The Company pays alcohol excise taxes to both the OLCC and to the TTB. These taxes are based on product sales volumes. The Company is liable for the taxes upon the removal of product from the Company’s warehouse on a per gallon basis. The Company also pays taxes on the grape harvest on a per ton basis to the OLCC for the Oregon Wine Board. The Company’s sales related taxes for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $372,470 and $233,043, an increase of $139,427, for the year ended December 31, 2020 over the prior year period. This increase was due primarily to increased wine sales revenues in 2020 and the timing of removals.
Cost of Sales was $10,585,076 and $9,454,681 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, an increase of $1,130,395, or 12.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, over the prior year period. This change was primarily the result of an increase in sales in 2020.
Gross profit was $16,729,776 and $15,294,582 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, an increase of $1,435,194, or 9.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 over the prior year period. This increase was generally driven by an increase in sales revenues partially offset by a higher cost of sales.
The gross margin percentage was 61.2% and 61.8% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, a decrease of 0.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 over the prior year period. This decrease in the gross profit percentage was primarily the result of an overall decrease in per case margins mostly due to the release of wines from vintages produced from higher product costs.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $11,728,003 and $11,567,058 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, an increase of $160,945, or 1.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 over the prior year period. This increase was mainly the result of increased selling expenses such as shipping, and packaging costs and administrative costs associated with efforts to increase sales and accommodate and develop retail growth and new operations.
Income from operations was $5,001,773 and $3,727,524 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, an increase of $1,274,249, or 34.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year period. The primary reason for this increase was increased gross profit and lower selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales.
Interest income was $21,022 and $48,066 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, a decrease of $27,044. Interest expense was $414,061 and $440,999 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, a decrease of $26,938, or 6.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 over the prior year period. The decrease in interest expense was mainly due to the decrease in loan balances in 2020 compared to the previous year.
Other income, net, was $165,916 and $128,433 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, an increase of $37,483, or 29.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 over the prior year period. The increase in other income in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily the result of an increase in revenue from a financial institution patronage payment.
Provision for income taxes was $1,379,654 and $952,123 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, an increase of $427,531, or 44.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 over the prior year period. This increase in income taxes in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily the result of higher income from operations in 2020.
Income per common share after preferred dividends was $0.46 and $0.30 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, an increase of $0.16, or 53.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 over the prior year period. The primary reason for this increase is an increase in net income in 2020 compared to 2019.
The Company had cash balances of $13,999,755, at December 31, 2020, and $7,050,176 at December 31, 2019. The Company had no outstanding line of credit balances at December 31, 2020 or 2019.
EBITDA
In 2020, the Company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) increased 22.2% to $6,983,662 from $5,668,420 in 2019, primarily as a result of an increase in net income.
EBITDA does not reflect the impact of a number of items that affect our net income, including financing costs. EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, referred to as “GAAP”, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or income from operations as a measure of performance, nor as an alternative to net cash from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We use EBITDA as a benchmark measurement of our own operating results and as a benchmark relative to our competitors. We consider it to be a meaningful supplement to operating income as a performance measure primarily because depreciation and amortization expense are not actual cash costs, and depreciation expense varies widely from company to company in a manner that we consider largely independent of the underlying cost efficiency of our operating facilities.
EBITDA has significant limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our GAAP results as reported. Because of these limitations, EBITDA should only be considered as a supplemental performance measure and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity or cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. See the Statement of Cash Flows set out in our consolidated financial statements included herein.
The following table provides a reconciliation of net income (the most comparable GAAP measure) to EBITDA for the periods indicated:
Sales
Wine case sales for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and ending inventory amounts for the year ended December 31, 2020, are shown on the following table:
Approximately 52% of the Company’s case sales during 2020 were of the Company’s flagship varietal, Pinot Noir. Case sales of Pinot Gris and Riesling follow with approximately 19% and 13% of case sales each, respectively. The Company sold approximately 180,850 and 156,791 cases of Company-produced wine during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. This represents an increase of approximately 24,059 cases, or 15.3% in 2020 compared to 2019. This increase in case sales in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily the result of increased shipments through internet and telephone sales as well as distributors.
The Company has three primary sales channels: direct-to-consumer sales, in-state sales to distributors, and out-of-state sales to distributors. These three sales channels represent 38.6%, 24.0% and 37.4%, of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively. This compares to 38.2%, 20.9% and 40.9% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019, respectively. Miscellaneous and grape sales are included in direct-to-consumer sales.
The Company’s direct-to-consumer sales and national sales to distributors offer comparable products to customers and utilize similar processes and share resources for production, selling and distribution. Direct-to-consumer sales generate a higher gross profit margin than national sales to distributors due to differentiated pricing between these segments.
Wine Inventory
The Company had approximately 157,347 cases of bottled wine on-hand at the end of 2020. Management believes sufficient bulk wine inventory is on-hand to bottle approximately 191,350 cases of wine in 2020 and that sufficient stock is on hand to meet current demand levels until the 2020 vintage becomes available.
Production Capacity
Current production volumes are within the current production capacity constraints of the Winery when including storage capacity at the Tualatin Winery and utilization of temporary storage when appropriate. In 2020, approximately 175,357 cases were produced. The Winery has capacity to store and process about 220,000 cases of wine per year at the Estate Winery but can expand that capacity by utilizing storage at the Tualatin Winery as well as temporary storage. Management continues to invest in new production technologies intended to increase the efficiency and quality of wine production. During 2020, the Company did not choose to utilize the wine production facilities at the Tualatin Winery but did utilize it for wine storage. The Tualatin Winery has capacity to produce approximately 28,000 cases of wine. The facility is maintained in good condition and is occasionally used by other local wineries. Management intends to fully utilize the production capacity at the Estate Winery before expanding into the Tualatin Winery.
Grape Supply
For the 2020 and 2019 vintages, the Company grew approximately 41% and 60% of all grapes harvested, respectively. The remaining grapes harvested were purchased from other growers. In 2020 and 2019, 50% and 37% of grapes harvested were purchased under short-term contracts, and 9% and 3% of grapes harvested were purchased under long-term contracts, respectively. The Company considers short-term contracts to be for single vintage years and long-term contracts to cover multiple vintage years.
Grapes are typically harvested and received in October of the vintage year. Upon receipt, the grapes are weighed, and a quality analysis is performed to ensure the grapes meet the standards set forth in the purchase contract. Based on the quantity of qualifying grapes received, the full amount payable to the grower is recorded to the grapes payable liability account. Approximately 50% of the grapes payable amount is due in November of the vintage year. The remaining amount is due in March of the following year. The grapes are processed into wine, which is typically bottled and available for sale between five months and two years from date of harvest.
The Company received $220,650 and $222,419 worth of grapes from long-term contracts during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company received $3,339,460 and $1,426,867 worth of grapes from short-term contracts during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Total grapes payable was $1,307,165 and $792,595 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Grapes payable includes $126,024 and $112,650 of grapes payable from long-term contracts as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The Company plans to address long-term grape supply needs by developing new vineyards on properties currently owned or secured by lease. The Company has approximately 56 acres of vineyards that have been planted but are in the pre-productive stage. We anticipate that these vineyards will begin producing grapes within the next one to three years. The Company has approximately 252 acres of land that is suitable for future vineyard development. Management currently has plans to plant approximately 22 acres in 2021, which we anticipate will begin producing grapes in 2025. Additionally, the Company intends to seek out opportunities to acquire land for future grape plantings in order to continue to increase available quantities, maintain control over farming practices, more effectively manage grape costs and mitigate uncertainty associated with long-term contracts.

Seasonality
The Company has historically experienced and expects to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in its revenue and net income. Typically, first quarter sales are the lowest of any given year, and sales volumes increase progressively through the fourth quarter mostly because of consumer buying habits.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At December 31, 2020, the Company had a working capital balance of $27.5 million and a current ratio of 4.80:1. The Company had cash balances of $13,999,755, at December 31, 2020.
Total cash provided from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $5,420,998, which resulted primarily from cash provided by net income combined with increased non-cash operating expenses, such as depreciation and increased grapes payable and accrued expenses, being partially offset by cash used in connection with increased inventory and accounts receivable.
Total cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $4,771,978, which was primarily due to cash used to acquire property and equipment and to develop vineyards on the Company’s properties.
Total cash provided from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $6,300,559, which primarily resulted from cash received from the issuance of preferred stock, being partially offset by cash used for the repayment of debt and payment of a preferred stock dividend. The Company qualified for and obtained a PPP loan for $1.655 million, but quickly returned the funds after obtaining a $5 million commercial loan commitment from Farm Credit Services, which is intended to provide the Company with additional liquidity in the event the Company was to experience operating losses from any sales disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This Commitment came into effect in July 2020 and as of the filing date the Company has not drawn down any funds on this commitment.
In 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the construction of a new tasting room at the Bernau Estate Vineyard, expected to be mostly completed during the 2021 fiscal year. The total construction costs for the Bernau Estate Tasting Room is expected to be approximately $14.4 million, of which we expect will be funded through a combination of cash on hand as well as debt and/or equity financing. Construction on the Bernau Estate Tasting Room began in July, 2019 and as of December 31, 2020, we had spent approximately $5.3 million on the project from our cash reserves.
