Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
General
In this Management’s Discussion and Analysis, all references to “we,” “us,” and the “Partnership” refer to America First Multifamily Investors, L.P., its consolidated subsidiaries, and consolidated VIEs as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Executive Summary
The Partnership was formed in 1998 for the primary purpose of acquiring a portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds (“MRBs”) that are issued by state and local housing authorities to provide construction and/or permanent financing for affordable multifamily and commercial properties. We also invest in governmental issuer loans (“GILs”), which are similar to MRBs, to provide construction financing for affordable multifamily properties. We generally refer to affordable multifamily and residential properties associated with our MRBs and GILs as “Residential Properties.” We expect and believe the interest received on our MRBs and GILs is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes. We may also invest in other types of securities and investments that may or may not be secured by real estate to the extent allowed by the Partnership Agreement.
The Partnership includes the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the Partnership, our wholly owned subsidiaries and consolidated VIEs. All significant transactions and accounts between us and the consolidated VIEs have been eliminated in consolidation. See Note 2 to the Partnership’s consolidated financial statements for additional details.
As of December 31, 2020, we have four reportable segments: (1) Mortgage Revenue Bond Investments, (2) Public Housing Capital Fund Trusts, (3) MF Properties, and (4) Other Investments. The Partnership separately reports its consolidation and elimination information because it does not allocate certain items to the segments. See Notes 2 and 25 to the Partnership’s consolidated financial statements for additional details.
Effects of COVID-19
We continue to monitor the impact of the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic on all aspects of our business, including how it will impact our borrowers, business partners and tenants. While we have developed and implemented measures to monitor and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 to our business, the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will continue to depend on numerous factors that we are unable to reliably predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, general economic conditions during and after the pandemic, and governmental actions that have been taken, or may be taken in the future, in response to the pandemic. See the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section in this Item 7 for information regarding our uses and potential sources of liquidity for the next twelve months.
Mortgage Revenue Bonds and Governmental Issuer Loans
Our MRBs and GILs are secured by affordable multifamily properties (referred to as Residential Properties) except for the Live 929 MRB, which is secured by a student housing property, and the Provision Center 2014-1 MRB, which is secured by a commercial property. The decline in U.S. economic activity as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to negatively impact employment and earnings for tenants of affordable housing properties nationwide, such as the Residential Properties securing our MRB investments.
The property owners and property management service providers of our MRB Residential Properties provide regular updates on operations and rental collections. These parties have reported average rental collections within 30 days of billing of 92% in November 2020, 91% in December 2020, and 91% in January 2021. Such collection rates, plus the availability of reserves, have allowed all of the multifamily Residential Properties to be current on contractual debt service payments on our MRBs and we have received no requests for forbearance of contractual debt service payments.
Federal and state governments have instituted various relief measures intended to provide economic assistance to businesses and individuals impacted by COVID-19, including the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, also known as the CARES Act. We believe such relief measures have allowed many tenants to stay current on their contractual rental payments. The long-term ability of the multifamily Residential Properties to stay current on contractual debt service payments may be dependent on various future developments that are uncertain, such as additional shutdowns in local markets, changes in unemployment rates, and continuing governmental relief programs. If the Residential Properties experience a significant increase in delinquent rents in future months, our Residential Properties may be unable to make contractual principal and interest payments on our MRBs, negatively impacting our cash flows and leading to potential forbearance requests or MRB defaults. MRB defaults may cause defaults on our debt financing
arrangements, triggering either a termination and repayment of the related debt or a sale of the underlying MRB. We may choose to provide support to Residential Properties through supplemental property loans to prevent such MRB defaults. We are continually monitoring rent collections and financial results of the Residential Properties for signs of stress and will proactively work with Residential Properties that request forbearance on a case-by-case basis.
COVID-19 has had a more significant on Live 929 Apartments, our sole student housing MRB Residential Property. Live 929 Apartments is 69% occupied as of December 31, 2020, due to limited on campus, in person classes at nearby Johns Hopkins University. Prior to COVID-19, the Live 929 Apartments MRB was operating under a forbearance agreement related to certain debt covenants. Additional forbearance was granted in November 2020 which defers contractual MRB principal payments through December 2021. We are actively working with the borrower on opportunities to improve operations and improve cash flows available to pay debt service, though the COVID-19 pandemic is making such improvements difficult. Due to these factors, we recorded an impairment of the Live 929 Apartments MRB and a related property loan in the third and fourth quarters of 2020. The outstanding principal of the Partnership’s MRB was $39.5 million as of December 31, 2020.
Additionally, COVID-19 has negatively impacted the performance of the commercial property associated with the Provision Center 2014-1 MRB in the form of lower patient volume and revenues. These results, in conjunction with declines in the general creditworthiness of proton therapy centers in the United States, have resulted in the reduction of the financial performance and support of the property. The contractual interest payment due on the Provision Center 2014-1 MRB was not made as scheduled on November 1, 2020 due to the majority senior bondholder’s direction to the bond trustee not to draw on the debt service reserve fund, as provided for under the bond indenture. Shortly thereafter, the borrower of Provision Center 2014-1 MRB filed for bankruptcy protection. The outstanding principal balance of the Partnership’s MRB was $10.0 million as of December 31, 2020 and represents approximately 9% of the senior MRBs issued by the borrower. We are assessing forbearance and restructuring options with other senior bondholders.
Residential Properties associated with our GILs are currently under construction and have not yet commenced leasing operations. To date, these Residential Properties have not experienced any material supply chain disruptions for either construction materials or labor or incurred material construction cost overruns due to COVID-19. If such disruptions or cost overruns were to occur, such GILs could default, causing a default on our debt financing arrangements, triggering either a termination and repayment of the related debt or a sale of the underlying GIL.
Investments in unconsolidated entities
Our investments in unconsolidated entities are related to the development of market-rate multifamily properties. To date, projects under construction have not experienced any material supply chain disruptions for either construction materials or labor as a result of COVID-19, though such disruptions could occur in the future. In addition, we have noted no material construction cost overruns to date. Future increases in the spread of COVID-19 could require construction sites to close, causing potential construction delays. Leasing activity at properties with available units has faced challenges due to social distancing measures imposed as a result of COVID-19. However, properties with available units have generally experienced increasing occupancy though at a lower rate than before the COVID-19 pandemic. If such challenges persist, leasing could further decelerate, which will negatively impact our returns and cash flows from these investments and may cause impairment losses in future periods.
MF Properties
The MF Properties are adjacent to universities and serve primarily university students. The University of Nebraska-Lincoln, which is adjacent to The 50/50 MF Property, held on-campus, in person classes for the Fall 2020 semester and plans to do so for the Spring 2021 semester. The 50/50 MF Property was 89% occupied as of December 31, 2020, which is only slightly below prior periods, and there has been no significant increase in rental delinquencies. The 50/50 MF Property has generated sufficient operating cash flows to meet all mortgage payment and operational obligations through December 31, 2020. However, if the spread of COVID-19 causes a reduction or suspension of on-campus classes during either the Spring or Fall of 2021, we may experience declines in occupancy and collections.
San Diego State University, which is adjacent to the Suites on Paseo MF Property, has suspended on campus, in person classes for the Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 semesters due to COVID-19 concerns. Residence halls remain open but at a reduced capacity. As a result, occupancy at the Suites on Paseo was 68% as of December 31, 2020, which is significantly lower than prior periods. We have noted a slight increase in delinquencies at the Suites on Paseo compared to historical average delinquencies. There is currently no mortgage associated with the Suites on Paseo and the property’s operating cash flows have been sufficient to meet all operational obligations through December 31, 2020.
Continued spread of COVID-19 could put further stress on occupancy and delinquencies at our MF Properties. We continue to enforce the terms of our lease contracts with tenants, including co-signor guarantees, and will work with tenants experiencing financial difficulties on a case-by-case basis.
General Operations
Employees of Greystone Manager, the general partner of our General Partner, are responsible for our operations, including those individuals acting as executive officers of the Partnership. To protect the health and safety of our employees, we have implemented social distancing measures and certain employees continue to utilize work-at-home options. We also have implemented policies and procedures to address the COVID-19 pandemic, which have closely followed the recommendations and requirements of the CDC and the pronouncements of the state and local authorities of the states in which we operate.
Mortgage Revenue Bond Investments Segment
As of December 31, 2020, we owned 77 MRBs with an aggregate outstanding principal amount of $673.6 million and three GILs with an aggregate outstanding principal amount of $64.9 million. Most of these MRBs and the GILs were issued by various state and local housing authorities to provide construction and/or permanent financing for 71 Residential Properties containing a total of 11,851 rental units located in 15 states in the United States.
As of December 31, 2019, we owned 76 MRBs with an aggregate outstanding principal amount of $679.7 million. Most of these MRBs were issued by various state and local housing authorities in order to provide construction and/or permanent financing for 66 Residential Properties containing a total of 10,871 rental units located in 13 states in the United States.
Each MRB, GIL and property loan related to a Residential Property is secured by a mortgage or deed of trust. One MRB is secured by ground, facility, and equipment of a commercial ancillary health care facility in Tennessee. Property loans related to Residential Properties are also included in this segment and may or may not be secured by a mortgage or deed of trust.
The following table compares operating results for the Mortgage Revenue Bond Investments segment for the periods indicated (dollar amounts in thousands):
Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Net interest income increased for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 due primarily to lower interest expense. Interest expenses decreased due to:
•
The termination of five fixed rate Term A/B financings with interest rates of approximately 4.50% that were replaced by five new TOB financings with an initial variable interest rate of approximately 2.09% in April 2020;
•
The termination of two fixed rate Term A/B financings with fixed interest rates of 4.53% that were replaced by new TOB financings with an initial variable interest rate of approximately 2.59% in August 2019;
•
The termination of one fixed rate Term TOB financing with an interest rate of approximately 4.39% that was replaced by a new TOB financing with an initial variable interest rate of approximately 3.08% in August 2019;
•
Refinancing of the M24 TEBS financing from a variable interest rate of 3.85% as of June 30, 2019 to a fixed interest rate of 3.05% in July 2019;
•
Generally lower SIFMA index rates during the year ended December 31, 2020 resulted in lower interest expense on our variable rate debt financings;
•
Lower average outstanding principal on the unsecured lines of credit; and
•
A decrease in expense related to fair value adjustments on our derivative financial instruments.
Segment net income for 2020 decreased as compared to the same period in 2019 due to:
•
The changes in total revenues and total interest expense detailed in the tables below;
•
A provision for credit loss of approximately $3.5 million related to the Live 929 Apartments MRBs and a provision for loan loss of approximately $911,000 related to the Live 929 Apartments property loan for the year ended December 31, 2020. The provisions were a result of recent operational results, the borrower’s continued covenant forbearance, forbearance allowing for the deferral of principal payments granted in the fourth quarter of 2020 and declines in debt service coverage;
•
A provision for credit loss of approximately $3.9 million related to the Provision Center 2014-1 MRB for the year ended December 31, 2020. The provision was a result of debt service shortfalls by the underlying commercial property, the borrower’s declaration of Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and request for forbearance, and the general creditworthiness of proton therapy centers in the United States, including the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic; and
•
Offset by a decrease of approximately $2.6 million in restricted unit compensation expense due to the closing of the acquisition by Greystone of AFCA 2 on September 10, 2019 in which all outstanding restricted units vested and all previously unrecognized compensation expense was recognized.
The following tables summarize the segment’s net interest income, average balances, and related yields earned on interest-earning assets and incurred on interest-bearing liabilities, as well as other income included in total revenues for 2020 and 2019. The net of interest income from interest-earning assets and interest expense for interest-bearing liabilities is the segment’s net interest income. The average balances are based primarily on monthly averages during the respective periods. All dollar amounts are in thousands.
(1)
Interest expense is reported net of income/loss on the Partnership’s two total return swaps.
(2)
The increase in the average interest rate was due primarily to approximately $454,000 of additional interest expense related to termination of the Term A/B financings and Master Trust Agreement with Deutsche Bank in April 2020. Excluding such items, the average interest rate was approximately 4.2%.
(3)
Net interest income equals the difference between total interest income from interest-earning assets minus total interest expense from interest-bearing assets. Net interest spread equals annualized net interest income divided by the average interest-bearing assets during the period.
The following tables summarize the changes in interest income and interest expense between 2020 and 2019, and the extent to which these variances are attributable to 1) changes in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, or 2) changes in the interest rates of the assets and liabilities. All dollar amounts are in thousands.
(1)
The increase in Fixed TEBS financing volume and decrease in Variable TEBS financing volume is due primarily to the refinance of the M24 and M33 TEBS financings from variable to fixed rate in July 2019.
(2)
Interest expense is reported net of income/loss on the Partnership’s two total return swaps.
(3)
We terminated two Fixed Term A/B financings and one Fixed Term TOB financing in August 2019 and subsequently closed new variable TOB financings with Mizuho. We also terminated all Fixed Term A/B & TOB financings with Deutsche Bank in April 2020 and subsequently closed new variable TOB financings with Mizuho.
(4)
The increase was due primarily to approximately $454,000 of additional interest expense related to termination of the Term A/B Trusts and Master Trust Agreement with Deutsche Bank in April 2020.
MF Properties Segment
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Partnership owned the Suites on Paseo and The 50/50 MF Properties containing a total of 859 rental units.
The following table compares operating results for the MF Properties segment for the periods indicated (dollar amounts in thousands):
Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
The decrease in total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 is due primarily to lower occupancy at the Suites on Paseo. Lower occupancy is a result of the suspension of on-campus, in-person classes for the Fall 2020 semester at San Diego State University due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The decrease in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 was due to the refinancing of The 50/50 Mortgage and TIF loans to lower interest rates in February 2020.
The increase in segment net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 was due to the changes in total revenues and interest expense described above. This was offset by a decrease in depreciation expense of approximately $266,000 at The 50/50 MF Property due to certain real estate assets that became fully depreciated in mid-2019.
Other Investments Segment
The Other Investments segment consists of the operations of ATAX Vantage Holdings, LLC, which holds noncontrolling equity investments in certain market-rate multifamily projects and property loans due from market-rate multifamily projects.
The following table compares operating results for the Other Investments segment for the periods indicated (dollar amounts in thousands):
Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
The decrease in total revenues between 2020 and 2019 was due to the following factors:
•
A decrease of approximately $3.0 million of contingent interest income related to the redemption of the Vantage at Brooks, LLC property loan in January 2019;
•
A net decrease of approximately $538,000 in investment interest income related to sales of investments in unconsolidated entities. We reported a decrease of approximately $1.2 million and $824,000 of additional investment income recognized upon the sale of Vantage at Boerne, LLC in December 2019 and Vantage at Panama City Beach, LLC in September 2019, respectively which was offset by an increase of $1.5 million of additional investment income recognized upon the sale of Vantage at Waco, LLC in June 2020; and
•
A net decrease of approximately $437,000 in recurring investment interest income related due to having reached the maximum guaranteed preferred returns on certain investments.
The gain on sale of investments in unconsolidated entities for 2019 consists of approximately $10.5 million and $5.7 million related to the sales of Vantage at Panama City Beach in September 2019 and Vantage at Boerne in December 2019, respectively. There were no such gains on sale during 2020.
The decrease in net income between 2020 and 2019 was due to the decreases in total revenues and gain on sale of investments in unconsolidated entities described above.
Public Housing Capital Fund Trusts Segment
The PHC Certificates within this segment consisted of custodial receipts evidencing loans made to public housing authorities. Principal and interest on these loans were payable by the respective public housing authorities out of annual appropriations to be made to the public housing authorities by HUD under HUD’s Capital Fund Program. In January 2020, we sold all our PHC Certificates to an unrelated third party.
The following table compares operating results for the Public Housing Capital Fund Trusts segment for the periods indicated (dollar amounts in thousands):
Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Total revenues and interest expense decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 due to the sale of the PHC Certificates in January 2020 and the payment in full of all principal and interest due on the TOB financings secured by the PHC Certificates.
Segment net income increased for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 due to a gain of approximately $1.4 million realized upon sale of the PHC Certificates, net of the decreases in total revenue and interest expense noted above.
Debt Financing
The following table summarizes the Partnership’s debt financing, net of deferred financing costs, as of December 31, 2020:
(1)
Facility fees have a variable component.
(2)
The M45 TEBS has an initial interest rate of 3.82% through July 31, 2023. From August 1, 2023 through the stated maturity date, the interest rate is 4.39%. These rates are inclusive of credit enhancement fees payable to Freddie Mac.
(3)
The Partnership has entered into two total return swap transactions with the Secured Notes as the reference security and notional amounts totaling the outstanding principal on the Secured Notes. The total return swaps effectively net down the interest rate on the Secured Notes. Considering the effect of the total return swaps, the effective net interest rate is 4.25% for approximately $40.0 million of the Secured Notes and 1.00% for approximately $63.5 million of the Secured Notes as of December 31, 2020. See Note 18 in Item 8 of this Report for further information on the total return swaps.
(4)
The Term TOB Trust is securitized by the Village at Avalon MRB.
(5)
The following table summarizes the individual TOB Trust securitizations as of December 31, 2020:
(1)
The TOB Trust is securitized by the Scharbauer Flats Apartments, Oasis at Twin Lakes, and Centennial Crossings GILs.
(2)
The TOB Trust is securitized by the Scharbauer Flats Apartments and Centennial Crossings property loans.
The following table summarizes the Partnership’s debt financing, net of deferred financing costs, as of December 31, 2019:
(1)
Facility fees have a variable component.
(2)
The M45 TEBS has an initial interest rate of 3.82% through July 31, 2023. From August 1, 2023 through the stated maturity date, the interest rate is 4.39%. These rates are inclusive of credit enhancement fees payable to Freddie Mac.
(3)
The following table summarizes the individual TOB, Term TOB and Term A/B Trust securitizations as of December 31, 2019:
The Partnership is required to meet various covenants under the Master Trust Agreements related to the TOB Trusts Financings with Mizuho. The TOB Trusts with Mizuho require that the Partnership’s residual interest in the TOB Trusts maintain a certain value in relation to the total assets in each Trust. In addition, the Master Trust Agreement with Mizuho requires the Partnership’s partners’ capital, as defined, to maintain a certain threshold and that the Partnership remained listed on the NASDAQ. If the Partnership is not in compliance with any of these covenants, a termination event of the financing facility would be triggered, which would require the Partnership to purchase a portion or all of the senior interests issued by each TOB Trust. The Partnership was in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2020.
The Partnership is required to meet various covenants under the Term TOB financings with Morgan Stanley. The underlying property must maintain certain occupancy and debt service covenants. A termination event will occur if the Partnership’s net assets, as defined, decrease by 25% in one quarter or 35% over one year. If the underlying property or the Partnership, as applicable, is out of compliance with any of these covenants, a termination event of the financing facility would be triggered which would require the Partnership to purchase a portion or all of the Class A Certificates held by Morgan Stanley. The Partnership was in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2020.
See Item 7a, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” of this Report and Note 16 to the Partnership’s consolidated financial statements for additional details.
Discussion of Occupancy at Investment-Related Properties
The following tables outline information regarding the Residential Properties on which we hold MRBs as investments. The tables also contain information about the MF Properties and properties associated with our investments in unconsolidated entities. The narrative discussion that follows provides a brief operating analysis of each category as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Non-Consolidated Properties - Stabilized
The owners of the following properties either do not meet the definition of a VIE and/or we have evaluated and determined we are not the primary beneficiary of each VIE. As a result, we do not report the assets, liabilities and results of operations of these properties on a consolidated basis. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, these Residential Properties have met the stabilization criteria (see footnote 3 below the table). Debt service on our MRBs for the non-consolidated stabilized properties was current as of December 31, 2020. The amounts presented below were obtained from records provided by the property owners and their related property management service providers.
(1)
Physical occupancy is defined as the total number of units occupied divided by total units at the date of measurement.
(2)
Economic occupancy is defined as the net rental income received divided by the maximum amount of rental income to be derived from each property. This statistic is reflective of rental concessions, delinquent rents and non-revenue units such as model units and employee units. Physical occupancy is a point in time
measurement while economic occupancy is a measurement over the period presented. Therefore, economic occupancy for a period may exceed the actual occupancy at any point in time.
(3)
A property is considered stabilized once it reaches 90% physical occupancy for 90 days and an achievement of 1.15 times debt service coverage ratio on amortizing debt service for a period after construction completion or completion of the rehabilitation.
(4)
The Ohio Properties consist of Crescent Village, located in Cincinnati, Ohio, Willow Bend, located in Columbus (Hilliard), Ohio and Postwoods, located in Reynoldsburg, Ohio.
(5)
The physical occupancy and economic occupancy amounts are based on the latest available occupancy and financial information, which is as of December 31, 2019. Prior year occupancy data is not available as the related investment was acquired in 2020.
Physical and economic occupancy as of December 31, 2020 were relatively consistent with the same period in 2019.
Despite the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, at this time we have not seen significant impacts to physical and economic occupancy for the MRB portfolio on average. We believe this is largely due to government relief programs that aid individuals, including affordable housing tenants, that have experienced economic hardship as a result of COVID-19. If COVID-19 continues to negatively impact the U.S. economy and such government relief programs are discontinued or curtailed, we anticipate there will be a negative impact on economic occupancy and physical occupancy in the future. Live 929 Apartments has seen significant decline in occupancy which is due to the property being primarily student housing, which has been more significantly impacted by COVID-19 than affordable multifamily properties.
Non-Consolidated Properties - Not Stabilized
The owners of the following properties do not meet the definition of a VIE and/or we have evaluated and determined we are not the primary beneficiary of each VIE. As a result, we do not report the assets, liabilities and results of operations of these properties on a consolidated basis. For the year ended December 31, 2020 these Residential Properties has not met the stabilization criteria (see footnote 3 below the table). As of December 31, 2020, debt service on the Partnership’s MRB and GILs for the non-consolidated non-stabilized properties was current. The amounts presented below were obtained from records provided by the property owners and their related property management service providers.
(1)
Physical occupancy is defined as the total number of units occupied divided by total units at the date of measurement.
(2)
Economic occupancy is defined as the net rental income received divided by the maximum amount of rental income to be derived from each property. This statistic is reflective of rental concessions, delinquent rents and non-revenue units such as model units and employee units. Physical occupancy is a point in time measurement while economic occupancy is a measurement over the period presented. Therefore, economic occupancy for a period may exceed the actual occupancy at any point in time.
(3)
This property is currently under construction. As such, this property is not considered stabilized as it has not met the criteria for stabilization. A property is considered stabilized once it reaches 90% physical occupancy for 90 days and an achievement of 1.15 times debt service coverage ratio on amortizing debt service for a period after completion of the rehabilitation.
(4)
Physical and economic occupancy information is not available for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 as the property is under construction.
The Partnership had four properties that had not stabilized as of December 31, 2020 as the properties were still under construction.
MF Properties
As of December 31, 2020, we owned two MF Properties. We report the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of these properties on a consolidated basis. The MF properties are encumbered by mortgage loans with an aggregate principal balance of $26.0 million as of December 31, 2020. Debt service on our mortgage payables was current as of December 31, 2020.
(1)
Physical occupancy is defined as the total number of units occupied divided by total units at the date of measurement.
(2)
Economic occupancy is defined as the net rental income received divided by the maximum amount of rental income to be derived from each property. This statistic is reflective of rental concessions, delinquent rents and non-revenue units such as model units and employee units. Physical occupancy is a point in time measurement while economic occupancy is a measurement over the period presented. Therefore, economic occupancy for a period may exceed the actual occupancy at any point in time.
The physical occupancy and economic occupancy as of December 31, 2020 decreased as compared to the same period in 2019 due to a decrease in overall occupancy at the Suites on Paseo primarily due to the effects of COVID-19.
The COVID-19 pandemic and the related impact to universities adjacent to our MF Properties may have a negative impact on economic occupancy and physical occupancy in the future. The University of Nebraska-Lincoln is holding on-campus, in-person learning for the Spring 2021 term and residence halls are open. However, San Diego State University has suspended on campus, in person classes for the Spring 2021 semester due to COVID-19 concerns. Residence halls remain open but at a reduced capacity. If the spread of COVID-19 continues, we may experience further declines in occupancy and collections related to our MF Properties.
Investments in Unconsolidated Entities
We are the only limited equity investor in various unconsolidated entities formed for the purpose of constructing market-rate, multifamily real estate properties. The Partnership determined the unconsolidated entities are VIEs but that the Partnership is not the primary beneficiary. As a result, the Partnership does not report the assets, liabilities and results of operations of these properties on a consolidated basis. The limited membership interests entitle the Partnership to shares of certain cash flows generated by the Vantage Properties from operations and upon the occurrence of certain capital transactions, such as a refinancing or sale. The amounts presented below were obtained from records provided by the property management service providers.
(1)
Physical occupancy is defined as the total number of units occupied divided by total units at the date of measurement.
(2)
December 2020 information is not available as the property has been sold.
(3)
December 2019 information is not available as the properties were under construction.
(4)
December 2020 and 2019 information are not available as the properties are currently under construction.
The Vantage Properties at Tomball, Hutto and San Marcos are currently under construction. All other properties are currently in the lease-up phase. Leasing activities at properties with available units have faced challenges due to social distancing measures imposed because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Results of Operations
The tables and following discussions of our changes in results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 should be read in conjunction with the Partnership’s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto filed in Item 8 of this Report.
The following table compares revenue and other income for the Partnership for the periods presented (dollar amounts in thousands):
Discussion of the Total Revenues for the Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019
Investment income. The net decrease in investment income between 2020 and 2019 was due to the following factors:
•
A decrease of $2.2 million in investment income related to the PHC Certificates that were sold in January 2020;
•
A net decrease of approximately $538,000 in investment interest income related to sales of investments in unconsolidated entities. We reported a decrease of approximately $1.2 million and $824,000 of additional investment income recognized upon the sale of Vantage at Boerne, LLC in December 2019 and Vantage at Panama City Beach, LLC in September 2019, respectively which was offset by an increase of $1.5 million of additional investment income recognized upon the sale of Vantage at Waco, LLC in June 2020;
•
A net decrease of approximately $437,000 recurring investment interest income due to having reached the maximum guaranteed preferred returns on certain investments in unconsolidated entities;
•
An increase approximately $1.1 million in investment income related to investments in GILs in 2020; and
•
A net decrease of approximately $542,000 in investment income related to MRB volume and interest rates. See discussion of volume and interest rate changes in the Mortgage Revenue Bond Investments segment previously included in Item 7.
Property revenues. The net decrease in total revenue between 2020 and 2019 was due primarily to lower occupancy at the Suites on Paseo. Lower occupancy is a result of the suspension of on-campus, in-person classes for the Fall 2020 semester at San Diego State University due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Contingent interest income. There was minimal contingent interest income recognized in 2020. In January 2019, we realized contingent interest income of approximately $3.0 million related to the redemption of the Vantage at Brooks, LLC property loan.
Other interest income. Other interest income is comprised mainly of interest income on taxable property loans held by us. The increase in other interest income is primarily due to interest on approximately $5.8 million of property loan advances during 2020.
Other income. Other income was minimal for 2020 and 2019.
Gain on the sale of securities. The gain on sale of securities for 2020 related to the sale of the PHC Certificates in January 2020. There was no gain on sale of securities reported for 2019.
Gain on sale of investments in unconsolidated entities. There was no gain on sale of investments in unconsolidated entities for 2020. The gain on sale of investment in unconsolidated entities for 2019 consisted of approximately $10.5 million and $5.7 million related to the sales of Vantage at Panama City Beach in September 2019 and Vantage at Boerne in December 2019, respectively.
The following table compares Partnership expenses for the periods presented (dollar amounts in thousands):
Discussion of the Total Expenses for the Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019
Real estate operating expenses. Real estate operating expenses associated with the MF Properties are comprised principally of real estate taxes, property insurance, utilities, property management fees, repairs and maintenance, and salaries and related employee expenses of on-site employees. A portion of real estate operating expenses is fixed in nature, thus a decrease in physical and economic occupancy would result in a reduction in operating margins. Conversely, as physical and economic occupancy increase, the fixed nature of these expenses will increase operating margins as these real estate operating expenses would not increase at the same rate as rental revenues. The decrease in real estate operating expenses between 2020 and 2019 was due to the following factors:
•
A decrease of approximately $277,000 in food costs due to the closure of the bistro at the Suites on Paseo in fall 2020; and
•
A net increase of approximately $150,000 related to generally higher operating expenses at the MF Properties, partially due to increased costs as a result of COVID-19.
Provision for credit loss. The provision for credit loss for 2020 consists of other-than-temporary impairments of approximately $3.5 million related to the Live 929 Apartments MRB and approximately $3.9 million related to the Provision Center 2014-1 MRB. There was no provision for credit loss recognized for 2019.
The provision for credit loss related to the Live 929 Apartments MRB was due to recent operational results, the borrower’s continued covenant forbearance, forbearance allowing for the deferral of principal payments granted in the fourth quarter of 2020 and declines in debt service coverage. The change in operating results at the Live 929 Apartments was primarily driven by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had a significant impact on the student housing industry.
The provision for credit loss related to the Provision Center 2014-1 MRB was due to debt service shortfalls by the underlying commercial property, the borrower’s declaration of Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and request for forbearance, and the general creditworthiness of proton therapy centers in the United States, including the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Provision for loan loss. The provision for loan loss for 2020 is related to the loan loss allowance established for the Live 929 Apartments property loan of approximately $911,000. There was no provision for loan loss recognized for 2019. The provision for loan loss related to Live 929 was due to the same factors as discussed above related to the properties provision for credit loss.
Impairment charge on real estate assets. The impairment charge on real estate assets for 2020 and 2019 related to the land held for development in Gardner, KS.
Depreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization relate primarily to the MF Properties. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses between 2020 and 2019 was due to a decrease of approximately $266,000 in depreciation expense due to real estate assets that became fully depreciated in mid-2019.
Interest expense. The net decrease in interest expense between 2020 and 2019 was due to the following factors:
•
A decrease of approximately $4.8 million due to a decrease in effective interest rates of the debt financing portfolio as a result of refinancing activities and generally lower market interest rates;
•
An increase of approximately $2.1 million due to higher average principal outstanding;
•
A net decrease of approximately $617,000 related to fair value adjustments to interest rate derivatives, net of cash paid; and
•
A decrease of approximately $264,000 in amortization of deferred financings costs.
General and administrative expenses. The decrease in general and administrative expenses for 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to a decrease of approximately $2.6 million in restricted unit compensation expense. Upon the closing of the acquisition by Greystone of AFCA 2 in September 2019, all outstanding restricted units vested and all previously unrecognized compensation expense was recognized.
Discussion of Income Tax Expense for the Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019
A wholly owned subsidiary of the Partnership, the Greens Hold Co, is a corporation subject to federal and state income tax. The Greens Hold Co owns The 50/50 MF Property and certain property loans.
There was minimal taxable income for the Greens Hold Co in 2020 and 2019. The increase in income tax expense is primarily due to improved operational results.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We continually evaluate our potential sources and uses of liquidity, including current and potential future developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The information below is based on the Partnership’s current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends, which could materially differ from actual results. See the discussion of Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Report for further information.
Our short-term liquidity requirements over the next 12 months will be primarily operational expenses, investment commitments, debt service (principal and interest payments) on our debt financings, and distribution payments. We expect to meet these liquidity requirements primarily using cash on hand, operating cash flows from our investments and MF Properties, and additional debt financing.
Our long-term liquidity requirements will be primarily for maturities of debt financings and mortgages payable and additional investments in MRBs, GILs, property loans and unconsolidated entities. We expect to meet these liquidity requirements primarily through refinancing of maturing debt financings with the same or similar lenders, principal and interest proceeds from investments in MRBs and GILs, and proceeds from asset sales and redemptions. In addition, we will consider the issuance of additional Beneficial Unit Certificates (“BUCs”), Series A Preferred Units or other series of beneficial interests in the partnership based on needs and opportunities for executing our strategy.
Sources of Liquidity
The Partnership’s principal sources of liquidity consist of:
•
Unrestricted cash on hand;
•
Operating cash flows from investments in MRBs, GILs and investments in unconsolidated entities;
•
Net operating cash flows from MF Properties;
•
Unsecured lines of credit;
•
Proceeds from our total return swap transactions associated with our Secured Notes;
•
Proceeds from obtaining additional debt;
•
Issuances of BUCs and Series A Preferred Units; and
•
Proceeds from the sale of assets.
Unrestricted Cash on Hand
As of December 31, 2020, the Partnership had unrestricted cash on hand of approximately $44.5 million. The Partnership is required to keep a minimum of $500,000 of unrestricted cash on hand under the terms of its TEBS debt financing arrangements. There are no other contractual restrictions of the Partnership’s ability to use cash on hand.
Operating Cash Flows from Investments
Cash flows from operations are primarily comprised of regular interest payments received on our MRBs and GILs that provide consistent cash receipts throughout the year. All MRBs and GILs are current on contractual debt service payments as of January 31, 2021, except for the Provision Center 2014-1 MRB as noted in the “Effects of Covid-19” section in this Item 7. Receipts, net of interest expense on related debt financings and lines of credit balances, are available for general use by the Partnership. The Partnership also receives distributions from investments in unconsolidated entities if, and when, cash is available for distribution at the unconsolidated entities.
Receipt of cash from our investments in MRBs and investments in unconsolidated entities is dependent upon the generation of net cash flows at multifamily properties that underlie our investments. These underlying properties are subject to risks usually associated with direct investments in multifamily real estate, which include (but are not limited to) reduced occupancy, tenant defaults, falling rental rates, and increasing operating expenses. Receipt of cash from GILs is dependent on the availability of construction funding and the execution of certain equity commitments by the owners of the underlying properties.
Net Operating Cash Flows from MF Properties
Cash flows generated by MF Properties, net of operating expenses and mortgage debt service payments, are unrestricted for use by the Partnership. The MF properties are subject to risks usually associated with direct investments in multifamily real estate, which include (but are not limited to) reduced occupancy, tenant defaults, falling rental rates, and increasing operating expenses. As noted in the “Effects of COVID-19” section in this Item 7, the Suites on Paseo MF Property is experiencing a lower than historical occupancy. There is currently no mortgage associated with the Suites on Paseo MF Property and the property’s operating cash flows have been sufficient to meet all operational obligations through December 31, 2020. However, excess net cash flows from operations could be limited in the future due to low occupancy.
Unsecured Lines of Credit
We maintain two unsecured lines of credit (“LOC”) with a financial institution. Our unsecured operating LOC allows for the advance of up to $10.0 million to be used for general operations. We are required to make repayments of the principal to reduce the outstanding principal balance on the operating LOC to zero for fifteen consecutive days during each calendar quarter. We fulfilled this requirement during the quarter ended December 31, 2020. In addition, we have fulfilled this requirement for the first quarter of 2021. We have $10.0 million available on the operating LOC as of December 31, 2020. The unsecured operating LOC has a maturity date of June 2022.
Our unsecured non-operating LOC allows for the advance of up to $50.0 million and may be utilized for the purchase of multifamily real estate, MRBs and taxable MRBs. Advances on the unsecured non-operating LOC are due on the 270th day following the advance date but may be extended up to an additional 270 days by making certain payments. The unsecured non-operating LOC contains a covenant, among others, that the Partnership’s ratio of the lender’s senior debt will not exceed a specified percentage of the market value of the Partnership’s assets, as defined in the Credit Agreement. The Partnership was in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2020. We anticipate paying off the balances on our unsecured non-operating LOC by entering into debt financing arrangements, to be secured with the previously acquired MRBs or multifamily real estate. We have approximately $42.5 million available on the unsecured non-operating LOC as of December 31, 2020. The $7.5 million outstanding balances of the non-operating LOC as of December 31, 2020 are due in March 2021, though the Partnership can extend final repayment of the amounts due to December 2021 by making partial repayments. The unsecured non-operating LOC has a maturity date of June 2022.
Proceeds from our Total Return Swap Transactions associated with our Secured Notes
In September 2020, we issued Secured Notes to Mizuho totaling $103.5 million. Concurrent with the issuance of the Secured Notes, the Partnership entered into two total return swap transactions with Mizuho to reduce the net interest cost related to the Secured Notes. The combined notional amount of the total return swaps is $103.5 million, which is the same as the outstanding principal balance of the Secured Notes.
The first total return swap has a notional amount of approximately $40.0 million as of December 31, 2020. The Partnership’s interest rate on the notional amount is equal to 3-month LIBOR plus 3.75%, with an interest rate floor of 4.25%. We are required to maintain cash collateral with Mizuho equal to 35% of the notional amount, which was approximately $14.0 million as of December 31, 2020. The remaining $26.0 million was received as cash proceeds by the Partnership during 2020.
The second total return swap has a notional amount of $63.5 million as of December 31, 2020. The Partnership’s interest rate on the notional amount is equal to 3-month LIBOR plus 0.50%, with an interest rate floor of 1.00%. We are required to maintain cash collateral with Mizuho equal to 100% of the notional amount as of December 31, 2020. Through March 2022, we have the option to reallocate notional amounts from the second total return swap to the first total return swap, in minimum increments of $10.0 million. Upon such a reallocation, cash equal to 35% of the notional amount reallocated will be posted as collateral for the first total return swap and 65% of the notional amount reallocated will be advanced as net proceeds to the Partnership for its general use. As of December 31, 2020, we have the option to reallocate up to $63.5 million of notional amount, which if fully reallocated will generate additional net cash proceeds of approximately $41.3 million for the Partnership’s general use.
Proceeds from Obtaining Additional Debt
We hold certain investments that are not associated with our debt financings, mortgages payable or non-operating LOC. The Partnership may obtain leverage for these investments by posting the investments as security. As of December 31, 2020, the Partnership’s primary unleveraged assets were the Suites at Paseo MF Property, with a net carrying value of approximately $33.9 million, and certain MRBs with outstanding principal totaling approximately $20.9 million. As noted previously in this report, the Suites on Paseo MF Property is experiencing lower than historical occupancy and operating results due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which could limit the amount of debt that could be obtained related to this asset. Of the MRBs, approximately $10.0 million is principal outstanding on the Provision Center 2014-1 MRB, for which the borrower has declared bankruptcy, and could limit our ability to obtain leverage related to this MRB.
Issuances of BUCs and Series A Preferred Units
We may, from time to time, issue additional BUCs in the public market. In December 2019, the Partnership’s Registration Statement on Form S-3 (“Registration Statement”) was declared effective by the SEC under which the Partnership may offer up to $225.0 million of BUCs for sale from time to time. The Registration Statement will expire in December 2022.
The Partnership is authorized to issue Series A Preferred Units under the Partnership Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, we have issued 9,450,000 Series A Preferred Units for gross proceeds of approximately $94.5 million to five financial institutions. The Series A Preferred Units were issued in a private placement that was terminated in October 2017. The Partnership may conduct additional private offerings of Series A Preferred Units in the future to supplement its cash flow needs if the General Partner deems such offerings to be necessary and otherwise consistent with the Partnership’s strategic initiatives. The Partnership is able to issue Series A Preferred Units so long as the aggregate market capitalization of the BUCs, based on the closing price on the trading day prior to issuance of the Series A Preferred Units, is no less than three times the aggregate book value of all Series A Preferred Units, inclusive of the amount to be issued. We may also designate and issue additional series of preferred units representing beneficial interest in the Partnership is so desired.
Proceeds from the Sale of Assets
We may, from time to time, sell our investments in MRBs, GILs, investments in unconsolidated entities and MF Properties consistent with our strategic plans. Our MRB portfolio is marked at a significant premium to cost, adjusted for paydowns, primarily due to higher stated interest rates when compared to current market interest rates for similar investments. We may consider selling certain MRBs in exchange for cash at prices that approximate our currently reported fair value. However, we are contractually prevented from selling the MRBs included in our TEBS financings.
Our ability to dispose of investments on favorable terms is dependent upon several factors including, but not limited to, the availability of credit to potential buyers to purchase investments at prices we consider acceptable. In addition, potential adverse changes to general market and economic conditions may negatively impact our ability to sell our investments in the future.
In January 2020, we sold our PHC Certificates to an unrelated party and we received net proceeds of approximately $8.7 million, after the payment of principal, interest and expenses related to the collapse of the related secured TOB financing. In June 2020, our investment in Vantage at Waco was redeemed upon the sale of the underlying property and we received cash of approximately $10.8 million related to the sale.
Uses of Liquidity
Our principal uses of liquidity consist of:
•
General and administrative expenses;
•
Investments in additional MRBs, GILs, property loans and unconsolidated entities;
•
Debt service on debt financings, Secured Notes and mortgages payable;
•
Distributions paid to holders of Series A Preferred Units and BUCs; and
•
Other contractual obligations.
General and Administrative Expenses
We use cash to pay general and administrative expenses of the Partnership’s operations. For additional details, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this report, and the section captioned “Cash flows from operating activities” in the Partnership’s consolidated statements of cash flows set forth in Item 8 of this Report. General and administrative expenses are typically paid from unrestricted cash on hand and operating cash flows.
Investments in Additional MRBs, GILs, Property Loans and Unconsolidated Entities
Our overall strategy is to continue to increase our investment in quality multifamily properties through either the acquisition of MRBs, GILs, property loans or equity investments in both existing and new markets. We evaluate investment opportunities based on, but not limited to, our market outlook, including general economic conditions, development opportunities and long-term growth potential. Our ability to make future investments is dependent upon identifying suitable acquisition and development opportunities, access to long-term financing sources, and the availability of investment capital. We may commit to fund additional investments on a draw-down or forward basis. The following table summarizes our outstanding investment commitments as of December 31, 2020:
(1)
The assets associated with these commitments are securitized in TOB financing facilities with Mizuho that allow for additional principal proceeds as the remaining investment commitments are funded by the Partnership.
(2)
Of the amount reported, approximately $43.1 million is related to assets securitized in TOB financing facilities with Mizuho that allow for additional principal proceeds as the remaining investment commitments are funded by the Partnership.
(3)
This investment commitment is contingent upon the completion and stabilization of the underlying property.
Debt Service on Debt Financings and Mortgages Payable
Our debt financing arrangements consist of various secured financing transactions to leverage our portfolio of MRBs, GILs and certain property loans. The financing arrangements generally involve the securitization of MRBs, GILs and property loans into trusts whereby we retain beneficial interests in the trusts that provide us certain rights to the underlying investment assets. The senior beneficial interests are sold to unaffiliated parties in exchange for debt proceeds. The senior beneficial interests require periodic interest payments that may be fixed or variable, depending on the terms of the arrangement, and scheduled principal payments. The Partnership is required to fund any shortfall in principal and interest payable to the senior beneficial interests of the TEBS financings in the case of non-payment, forbearance or default of the borrowers’ contractual debt service payments of the related MRBs. In the
case of forbearance or default on an MRB, GIL or property loan in a Term TOB or TOB financing, we may be required to fund shortfalls in principal and interest payable to the senior beneficial interests, repurchase a portion of the outstanding senior beneficial interests, or repurchase the MRB, GIL or property loan and seek alternative financing. In addition, the Partnership may be required to post collateral if the value of MRBs, GILs and property loans securitized in TOB financings drops below a threshold in the aggregate. We anticipate that cash flows from the securitized assets will fund normal, recurring principal and interest payments to the senior beneficial interests and all trust-related fees.
Our Secured Notes are secured by the Partnership’s cash flows of the residual certificates associated with our TEBS financings. Interest due on the Secured Notes, net of amounts due to the Partnership on the related total return swap transactions, will be paid from receipts related to the TEBS financing residual certificates. Future receipts of principal related to the TEBS financing residual certificates will be used to pay down the principal of the Secured Notes. The Partnership has guaranteed the payment and performance of the responsibilities under the Secured Notes and related documents.
We actively manage both our fixed and variable rate debt financings and our exposure to changes in market interest rates. The following table summarizes our fixed and variable rate debt financings as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:
(1)
The securitized asset and related debt financing both have variable interest rates, though the variable rate indices may differ. As such, the Partnership is at least partially hedged against rising interest rates.
In April 2020, we terminated all outstanding arrangements with Deutsche Bank, consisting of the Term TOB Trust, Term A/B Trusts and Master Trust Agreement. The debt financing structures were collapsed and replaced with variable rate TOB Trust debt financings with Mizuho. The termination of the Master Trust Agreement with Deutsche Bank released the Partnership from various financial covenants that limited the Partnership’s liquidity and that exposed the Partnership to risk of covenant violations due to changes in its market capitalization, which is outside of the Partnership’s control.
In July 2020, we extended the maturity of all existing debt financings with Mizuho that were scheduled to mature within the next 12 months to July 2023. There were no additional changes to terms or fees associated with the amendment. We typically refinance arrangements with existing lenders, assuming the terms are acceptable to the Partnership. We may also explore other financing options with Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, other investment banks or other lenders in the market.
Our mortgages payable financing arrangements are used to leverage The 50/50 MF Property. The mortgages are entered into with financial institutions and are secured by the MF Property. The mortgages bear interest at fixed rates and include scheduled principal payments. We anticipate that cash flows from The 50/50 MF Property will be sufficient to pay all normal, recurring principal and interest payments.
In February 2020, the Partnership refinanced The 50/50 MF Property mortgage loan with its existing lender. The maturity date of the mortgage loan was extended seven years to April 2027 and the interest rate was fixed at 4.35%. In February 2020, the Partnership also refinanced The 50/50 MF Property TIF loan with its existing lender. The maturity date of the TIF loan was extended five years to March 2025 and the interest rate was lowered to 4.40%.
Distributions Paid to Holders of Series A Preferred Units and BUCs
Distributions to the holders of Series A Preferred Units, if declared by the General Partner, are paid quarterly at an annual fixed rate of 3.0%. The Series A Preferred Units are non-cumulative, non-voting and non-convertible.
On December 16, 2020, we announced that the Board of Managers of Greystone Manager, which is the general partner of the General Partner, declared a quarterly distribution of $0.06 per BUC to unitholders of record on December 31, 2020 and was paid on January 29, 2021.
The Partnership and its General Partner continually assess the level of distributions for the Series A Preferred Units and BUCs based on cash available for distribution, financial performance and other factors considered relevant, including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Other Contractual Obligations
We are subject to various guarantee obligations in the normal course of business, and, in most cases, do not anticipate these obligations to result in significant cash payments by the Partnership.
Cash Flows
In 2020, we generated $79.8 million of cash, which was the net result of $15.8 million provided by operating activities, $38.1 million used in investing activities, and $102.1 million provided in financing activities.
Cash provided by operating activities totaled $15.8 million in 2020 compared to $18.0 million generated in 2019. The change was due to the following factors:
•
A decrease of $23.3 million in net income;
•
A decrease of $2.6 million in restricted unit compensation expense;
•
An increase of $16.1 million related to the gain on sale of an unconsolidated entity; and
•
An increase of $7.3 million related to the provision for credit loss.
Cash used in investing activities totaled $38.1 million in 2020 compared to cash provided of $23.2 million in 2019. The change was due to the following factors:
•
A decrease of $64.9 million due to principal advances on GILs;
•
A decrease of $25.5 million of proceeds from the sale of investments in unconsolidated entities;
•
A decrease of $11.4 million of principal payments received on property loans and contingent interest;
•
A decrease of $5.4 million due to increased advances on property loans;
•
A net increase of $37.0 million due to proceeds from the sale and principal payments related to the PHC Certificates; and
•
An increase of $9.7 million due to the reduction in purchases of MRBs.
Cash provided by financing activities totaled $102.1 million in 2020 compared to cash used of $31.3 million in 2019. The change was due to the following factors:
•
A net increase in proceeds from debt financing of $107.6 million, primarily related to $103.5 million of proceeds from the issuance of Secured Notes to Mizuho in September 2020;
•
A net increase in borrowing on unsecured lines of credit of $16.7 million; and
•
An increase of $9.9 million due to a reduction in distributions paid.
We believe our cash balance and cash provided by the sources discussed herein will be sufficient to pay, or refinance, our debt obligations and to meet our liquidity needs over the next 12 months.
Leverage Ratio
We utilize leverage to enhance rates of return to our Unitholders. Those constraints are dependent upon several factors, including the assets being leveraged, the tenor of the leverage program, whether the financing is subject to market collateral calls, and the liquidity and marketability of the financing collateral. We use target constraints for each type of financing utilized by us to manage an overall 75% leverage constraint, as established by the Board of Managers of Greystone Manager, which is the general partner of the Partnership’s General Partner. The Board of Managers of Greystone Manager retains the right to change the leverage constraint in the future based on consideration of factors the Board of Managers considers relevant. We define our leverage ratio as total outstanding debt divided by total assets using cost adjusted for paydowns for MRBs, GILs, property loans, and taxable MRBs, and initial cost for deferred financing costs and MF Properties. As of December 31, 2020, our overall leverage ratio was approximately 67%.
Cash Available for Distribution
The Partnership believes that Cash Available for Distribution (“CAD”) provides relevant information about the Partnership’s operations and is necessary, along with net income, for understanding its operating results. To calculate CAD, the Partnership begins with net income as computed in accordance with GAAP and adjusts for non-cash expenses consisting of depreciation expense, amortization expense related to deferred financing costs, amortization of premiums and discounts, non-cash interest rate derivative expense or income, provision for credit and loan losses, impairments on MRBs, GILs, PHC Certificates, real estate assets and property loans, deferred income tax expense (benefit) and restricted unit compensation expense. The Partnership also deducts Tier 2 income (see Note 3 to the Partnership’s consolidated financial statements) distributable to the General Partner as defined in the Partnership Agreement and Series A Preferred Unit distributions and accretion. Net income is the GAAP measure most comparable to CAD. There is no generally accepted methodology for computing CAD, and the Partnership’s computation of CAD may not be comparable to CAD reported by other companies. Although the Partnership considers CAD to be a useful measure of the Partnership’s operating performance, CAD is a non-GAAP measure that should not be considered as an alternative to net income calculated in accordance with GAAP, or any other measures of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP.
Currently, cash distributions are made to the Partnership’s BUC holders at an annual rate of $0.305 per BUC. The amount of cash per BUC distributed may increase or decrease at the determination of the General Partner based on its assessment of the amount of cash available for this purpose. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we generated CAD of $0.26 and $0.57 per BUC, respectively.
The following table shows the calculation of CAD (and a reconciliation of the Partnership’s net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP to CAD) for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
(1)
The provision for credit loss for 2020 consists of impairments of approximately $3.5 million for the Live 929 Apartments MRB and approximately $3.9 million for the Provision Center 2014-1 MRB.
(2)
The provision for loan loss relates to impairment of the Live 929 Apartments property loan.
(3)
This amount represents previous impairments recognized as adjustments to CAD in prior periods related to the PHC Certificates. Such adjustments were reversed in the first quarter of 2020 upon the sale of the PHC Certificates in January 2020.
(4)
As described in Note 3 to the Partnership’s consolidated financial statements, Net Interest Income representing contingent interest and Net Residual Proceeds representing contingent interest (Tier 2 income) will be distributed 75% to the limited partners and BUC holders, as a class, and 25% to the General Partner. This adjustment represents the 25% of Tier 2 income due to the General Partner.
For 2020, Tier 2 loss allocable to the general partner related to the sale of the PHC Certificates. For 2019, Tier 2 income consisted of $3.0 million of contingent interest realized on redemption of the Vantage at Brooks, LLC property loan in January 2019 and a $10.5 million gain on sale related to the Partnership’s investment in Vantage at Panama City Beach in September 2019.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we held MRBs and GILs that are collateralized by Residential Properties and one commercial property. The affordable multifamily properties and commercial property are owned by entities that are not controlled by us. We have no equity interest in these entities and do not guarantee any obligations of these entities.
The Partnership has entered into various commitments and guarantees. For additional discussions related to commitments and guarantees, see Note 19 to the Partnership’s consolidated financial statements.
We do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.
We do not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non-independent relationships with us or our related parties, other than what is disclosed in Note 23 to the Partnership’s consolidated financial statements.
Contractual Obligations
As discussed in Notes 15 through 17 to the Partnership’s consolidated financial statements, we have various debt service obligations related to our LOCs, debt financings and our MF Property mortgages payable. Our strategic objective is to leverage our new MRB and GIL investments utilizing long-term securitization financings either with Freddie Mac through its TEBS program or with other lenders with trust securitizations similar to the TOB Trust program with Mizuho and the Term TOB Trust program with Morgan Stanley. This strategy allows us to better match the duration of our assets and liabilities and to better manage the spread between our assets and liabilities.
See Note 20 to the Partnership’s consolidated financial statements for details regarding potential redemption dates for the Partnership’s Series A Preferred Units outstanding.
We have the following contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020:
We are also contractually obligated to pay interest on our long-term debt obligations. The weighted average interest of our lines of credit was 2.7% as of December 31, 2020. The weighted average interest of our debt financing was 3.7% as of December 31, 2020. The weighted average interest of our mortgages payable is 4.4% as of December 31, 2020.
We have various outstanding investment commitments for MRBs, GILs, property loans, investments in unconsolidated entities and for bond purchase commitments. See the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section of this Item 7 for further information on our investment commitments and our liquidity sources to fund such commitments.
Inflation
Substantially all resident leases at the Residential Properties, which collateralize our MRBs, allow for adjustments in the rent payable at the time of renewal, subject to rent restrictions related to the MRBs. Additionally, the MF Properties may be able to seek rent increases. The majority of these leases are for one year or less. The short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce the risk to the properties of the adverse effects of inflation; however, market conditions may prevent the properties from increasing rental rates in amounts sufficient to offset higher operating expenses. Inflation did not have a significant impact on our financial results for the years presented in this Report.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates. The application of these judgments, assumptions, and estimates can affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses reported by us. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 and 24 to the Partnership’s consolidated financial statements, which are incorporated by reference. We consider the following to be our critical accounting policies because they involve our judgments, assumptions and estimates that significantly affect the Partnership’s consolidated financial statements. If these estimates differ significantly from actual results, the impact on the Partnership’s consolidated financial statements may be material.
Variable Interest Entities
Under the accounting guidance for consolidation, the Partnership must evaluate entities in which it holds a variable interest to determine if the entities are VIEs and if the Partnership is the primary beneficiary. The entity that is deemed to have: (1) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance; and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE, is considered the primary beneficiary. If the Partnership is deemed to be the primary beneficiary, then it must consolidate the VIEs in its consolidated financial statements. The Partnership has consolidated all VIEs in which it has determined it is the primary beneficiary. In the Partnership’s consolidated financial statements, all transactions and accounts between the Partnership and the consolidated VIEs have been eliminated in consolidation.
The Partnership re-evaluates VIEs at each reporting date based on events and circumstances at the VIEs. As a result, changes to the consolidated VIEs may occur in the future based on changes in circumstances. The accounting guidance on consolidations is complex and requires significant analysis and judgment.
The Partnership does not believe that the consolidation of VIEs for reporting under GAAP impacts its status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or the status of Unitholders as partners of the Partnership. In addition, the consolidation of VIEs is not expected to impact the treatment of the MRBs, GILs and property loans owned by consolidated VIEs, the tax-exempt nature of the interest payments on secured debt financings, or the manner in which the Partnership’s income is reported to Unitholders on IRS Schedule K-1.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Current accounting guidance on fair value measurements establishes a framework for measuring fair value and provides for expanded disclosures about fair value measurements. The guidance:
•
Defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date; and
•
Establishes a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability on the measurement date.
Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, the fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The three levels of the hierarchy are defined as follows:
•
Level 1 - inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
•
Level 2 - inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument; and
•
Level 3 - inputs are unobservable inputs for asset or liabilities.
The categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities measured at fair value.
Investments in MRBs, Taxable MRBs and Bond Purchase Commitments. The fair value of the Partnership’s investments in MRBs, taxable MRBs, and bond purchase commitments as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, is based upon prices obtained from a third-party
pricing service, which are estimates of market prices. There is no active trading market for these securities, and price quotes for the securities are not available. The valuation methodology of the Partnership’s third-party pricing service incorporates commonly used market pricing methods. The valuation methodology considers the underlying characteristics of each security as well as other quantitative and qualitative characteristics including, but not limited to, market interest rates, illiquidity, legal structure of the borrower, collateral, seniority to other obligations, operating results of the underlying property, geographic location, and property quality. These characteristics are used to estimate an effective yield for each security. The security fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow and yield to maturity or call analysis by applying the effective yield to contractual cash flows. Significant increases (decreases) in the effective yield would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value estimate. Changes in fair value due to an increase or decrease in the effective yield do not impact the Partnership’s cash flows.
The Partnership evaluates pricing data received from the third-party pricing service by evaluating consistency with information from either the third-party pricing service or public sources. The fair value estimates of the MRBs, taxable MRBs and bond purchase commitments are based largely on unobservable inputs believed to be used by market participants and requires the use of judgment on the part of the third-party pricing service and the Partnership. Due to the judgments involved, the fair value measurements of the Partnership’s investments in MRBs, taxable MRBs and bond purchase commitments are categorized as Level 3 assets.
Mortgage Revenue Bonds and Taxable Mortgage Revenue Bonds Impairment
The Partnership accounts for its investments in MRBs and taxable MRBs under the accounting guidance for certain investments in debt and equity securities. The Partnership’s investments in these instruments are classified as available-for-sale debt securities and are reported at their estimated fair value. The net unrealized gains or losses on these investments are reflected in the Partnership’s consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Unrealized gains and losses do not affect the cash flow of the bonds, distributions to Unitholders, or the characterization of the interest income of the financial obligation of the underlying collateral. See Note 24 for a description of the Partnership’s methodology for estimating the fair value of MRBs and taxable MRBs.
The Partnership periodically reviews its MRBs for impairment. The Partnership evaluates whether unrealized losses are considered other-than-temporary impairments based on various factors including, but not necessarily limited to, the following:
•
The duration and severity of the decline in fair value;
•
The Partnership’s intent to hold and the likelihood of it being required to sell the security before its value recovers;
•
Adverse conditions specifically related to the security, its collateral, or both;
•
Volatility of the fair value of the security;
•
The likelihood of the borrower being able to make scheduled interest or principal payments;
•
Failure of the issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments; and
•
Recoveries or additional declines in fair value after the balance sheet date.
While the Partnership evaluates all available information, it focuses specifically on whether the security’s estimated fair value is below amortized cost. If a MRB’s estimated fair value is below amortized cost, and the Partnership has the intent to sell or may be required to sell the MRB prior to the time that its value recovers or until maturity, the Partnership will record an other-than-temporary impairment through earnings equal to the difference between the MRB’s carrying value and its fair value. If the Partnership does not expect to sell an other-than-temporarily impaired MRB, only the portion of the other-than-temporary impairment related to credit losses is recognized through earnings as a provision for credit loss, with the remainder recognized as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). In determining the provision for credit loss, the Partnership compares the present value of cash flows expected to be collected to the MRB’s amortized cost basis.
The recognition of other-than-temporary impairment, provision for credit loss, and the potential impairment analysis are subject to a considerable degree of judgment, the results of which, when applied under different conditions or assumptions, could have a material impact on the Partnership’s consolidated financial statements. If the Partnership experiences deterioration in the values of its MRB portfolio, the Partnership may incur other-than-temporary impairments or provision for credit losses that could negatively impact the Partnership’s financial condition, cash flows, and reported earnings.
Governmental Issuer Loan Impairment
The Partnership accounts for its investment in governmental issuer loans (“GILs”) under the accounting guidance for certain investments in debt and equity securities. The Partnership’s investment in these instruments are classified as held-to-maturity debt securities and are reported at amortized cost.
The Partnership periodically reviews its GILs for impairment. The Partnership evaluates whether unrealized losses are considered other-than-temporary impairments based on various factors including, but not necessarily limited to, the following:
•
The duration and severity of the decline in fair value;
•
The Partnership’s intent to hold and the likelihood of it being required to sell the security before its value recovers;
•
Adverse conditions specifically related to the security, its collateral, or both;
•
Volatility of the fair value of the security;
•
The likelihood of the borrower being able to make scheduled interest or principal payments;
•
The failure of the borrower to make scheduled interest or principal payments; and
•
Recoveries or additional declines in fair value after the balance sheet date.
While the Partnership evaluates all available information, it focuses specifically on whether the security’s estimated fair value is below amortized cost. If a GIL’s estimated fair value is below amortized cost, and the Partnership does not expect to recover its entire amortized cost, only the portion of the other-than-temporary impairment related to credit losses is recognized through earnings as a provision for credit loss, with the remainder recognized as a component of other comprehensive income (loss).
The recognition of other-than-temporary impairment, provision for credit loss, and the potential impairment analysis are subject to a considerable degree of judgment, the results of which, when applied under different conditions or assumptions, could have a material impact on the Partnership’s consolidated financial statements. If the Partnership experiences deterioration in the value of its GILs, the Partnership may incur other-than-temporary impairments or provision for credit losses that could negatively impact the Partnership’s financial condition, cash flows, and reported earnings.
Investments in Unconsolidated Entities Impairment
The Partnership reviews its investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investments may not be fully recoverable. Factors considered include:
•
The absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment;
•
The inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity that justifies the carrying amount of the investment; or
•
Estimated sales proceeds that are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the investment.
The Partnership’s assessment of whether a decline in value is other than temporary is based on the Partnership’s ability and intent to hold the investment and whether evidence indicating the carrying value of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period of time outweighs evidence to the contrary. If the fair value of the investment is determined to be less than the carrying value and the decline in value is considered other than temporary, an impairment charge would be recorded equal to the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the investment.
Property Loans, Net of Loan Loss Allowance
The Partnership invests in taxable property loans made to the owners of certain multifamily properties. Most of the property loans have been made to multifamily properties that secure MRBs and GILs owned by the Partnership. The Partnership recognizes interest income on the property loans as earned and the interest income is reported within “Other interest income” on the Partnership’s consolidated statements of operations. Interest income is not recognized for property loans that are deemed to be in nonaccrual status. The repayment of these property loans and accrued interest is dependent largely on the cash flows or proceeds upon sale or refinancing of the related property. The Partnership periodically evaluates these loans for potential impairment by estimating the fair value of the related property and comparing the fair value to the outstanding MRBs, GILs or other senior financing, plus the Partnership’s property loans. The Partnership utilizes a discounted cash flow model that considers varying assumptions. The discounted cash flow analysis may assume multiple revenue and expense scenarios, various capitalization rates, and multiple discount rates. The Partnership may also consider other information such as independent appraisals in estimating a property’s fair value.
If the estimated fair value of the related property, after deducting the amortized cost basis of the MRB, GIL or other senior financing, exceeds the principal balance of the taxable property loan then no potential loss is indicated and no allowance for loan loss is recorded. If a potential loss is indicated, an allowance for loan loss is recorded against the outstanding loan amount and a loss is realized. The determination of the need for an allowance for loan loss is subject to considerable judgment.
Real Estate Assets Impairment
The Partnership reviews real estate assets for impairment at least quarterly and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment suggest that the carrying value of a real estate asset may not be recoverable, the Partnership compares the carrying amount of the real estate asset to the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from the use of the asset. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted net cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value of the property exceeds its estimated fair value.
