2020 Developments
Results of Operations
Revenue
As described in Item 1, Business we earn revenue primarily through our provision of broadband services that include broadband internet, video, voice, and fiber optic Ethernet, wavelength and leasing services in our Broadband segment. Our Broadband segment revenue is driven primarily by the number of our customers that subscribe to our broadband services, and their selection from our respective rate plans. Our Tower segment leases colocation space on our owned cell towers to wireless carriers. Our Tower segment revenue is driven primarily by the number of cell towers that we own, and our ability to secure colocation leases from wireless carriers.
Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses consist primarily of cost of services, selling, general and administrative, and depreciation and amortization expenses.
Other Income (Expense)
Our other income (expense) consists primarily of interest expense and other income. Our other income primarily represents interest and dividends earned from our investments, including patronage income that is connected with our CoBank loan agreements.
Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense consists of federal and state income taxes in the United States.
Income from Discontinued Operations, net of tax
As discussed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, the results of our Wireless operations are now presented as discontinued operations.

Net income $ 126,723 57.4 $ 55,956 27.0 70,767 126.5
Revenue
Revenue increased approximately $13.9 million, or 6.7%, in 2020 compared with 2019, driven by 31.3% growth in the Tower and 5.4% growth in Broadband segments. Refer to the discussion of the results of operations for the Tower and Broadband segments, included within this annual report, for additional information.
Operating expenses
Operating expenses increased approximately $14.3 million, or 6.9%, in 2020 compared with 2019, driven by incremental Broadband operating expenses incurred to support the launch of our new fiber-to-the-home service, Glo Fiber, and new fixed wireless broadband service, Beam.
Income tax (benefit) expense
Income tax benefit of approximately $0.6 million declined approximately $0.8 million compared with 2019, primarily due to changes in excess tax benefits from stock based compensation and other discrete items.
Income from discontinued operations, net of tax
Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, increased $70.5 million, or 131.7%. The increase was primarily driven by a $48.5 million decline in depreciation and amortization primarily as a result of ceasing depreciation and amortization of assets held for sale during the third quarter of 2020, $25.3 million increase in wireless service revenue driven by our travel revenue settlement with Sprint, a $12.1 million decline in cost of services due to ceasing amortization on our right of use assets under operating leases during the third quarter of 2020, an $8.8 million decline in interest expense driven by lower interest rates on our term loans, partially offset by $27.5 million of higher income tax.
Broadband
Our Broadband segment provides broadband internet, video and voice services to residential and commercial customers in portions of Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky, via hybrid fiber coaxial cable under the brand name of Shentel, fiber optics under the brand name of Glo Fiber and fixed wireless network under the brand name of Beam. The Broadband segment also leases dark fiber and provides Ethernet and Wavelength fiber optic services to enterprise and wholesale customers throughout the entirety of our service area. The Broadband segment also provides voice and DSL telephone services to customers in Virginia’s Shenandoah County and portions of adjacent counties as a Rural Local Exchange Carrier (“RLEC”). These integrated networks are connected by an approximately 6,800 fiber route mile network. This fiber optic network also supports our Wireless segment operations, which are currently classified as discontinued operations, and these intercompany transactions are reported at their market value.

(1)Homes and businesses are considered passed (“homes passed”) if we can connect them to our network without further extending the distribution system. Homes passed is an estimate based upon the best available information. Homes passed will vary among video, broadband data and voice services.
(2)Customer relationships represent the number of billed customers who receive at least one of our services.
(3)Penetration is calculated by dividing the number of users by the number of homes passed or available homes, as appropriate.
(4)Average Revenue Per Data RGU calculation = (Residential & SMB Revenue * 1,000) / average data RGUs / 3 months
(5)Total fiber miles are measured by taking the number of fiber strands in a cable and multiplying that number by the route distance. For example, a 10 mile route with 144 fiber strands would equal 1,440 fiber miles.

Broadband operating income $ 40,360 19.8 $ 42,597 22.0 (2,237) (5.3)
Residential & SMB revenue
Residential & SMB revenue increased approximately $12.7 million, or 8.9%, during 2020 primarily driven by 22.3% growth in broadband RGUs and penetration improvement.
Commercial Fiber revenue
Commercial Fiber revenue increased approximately $2.3 million, or 7.7%, during 2020 due primarily to an increase in new enterprise and backhaul recurring revenue of $3.9 million partially offset by a decline in amortized upfront fee revenue of $1.6 million.
RLEC & Other revenue
RLEC & Other revenue decreased approximately $4.7 million, or 22.0%, compared with 2019 due primarily to a decline in residential DSL subscribers, lower governmental support, and lower intercompany phone service. We expect RLEC revenue to decline at a slower rate in future periods as subscribers migrate to broadband data services.
Cost of services
Cost of services increased approximately $4.2 million, or 5.3%, compared with 2019, primarily driven by higher compensation expense due to the combination of Glo Fiber and Beam start-up expenses, higher incentive accrual from strong operating results, COVID supplemental pay for customer interfacing employees and enhanced benefit plans.
Selling, general and administrative
Selling, general and administrative expense increased $5.9 million or 17.7% compared with 2019 primarily due to increases in compensation expense of $3.4 million, primarily as a result of Glo Fiber and Beam fixed wireless start-up costs, higher benefit plan and incentive accruals from strong operating results and $2.8 million of higher software and professional fees.
Depreciation and amortization
Depreciation and amortization increased $2.5 million or 6.5%, compared with 2019, primarily as a result of our network expansion and the deployment of infrastructure necessary to support new fiber-to-the-home service, Glo Fiber, and fixed wireless solution, Beam.
Tower
Our Tower segment owns cell towers and leases colocation space on the towers to wireless communications providers, including our Wireless segment that is currently classified as a discontinued operation. Substantially all of our owned towers are built on ground that we lease from the respective landlords. The colocation space that is leased to our discontinued Wireless operations is priced at our estimate of fair market value.

Operating expenses
Operating expenses were comparable with the prior year.
Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources and Uses of Cash: Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, proceeds available under our revolving line of credit, and proceeds from dispositions.
As of December 31, 2020 our cash and cash equivalents totaled $195.4 million and the availability under our revolving line of credit was $75.0 million, for total available liquidity of $270.4 million.
Operating activities from continuing operations generated approximately $53.4 million in 2020, representing an increase of $11.0 million compared with 2019, driven by Broadband subscriber growth.
Operating activities from discontinued operations generated $249.5 million as compared to $216.8 million in 2019 driven by a $24.0 million increase due to the resolution of our travel revenue dispute with Sprint and $7.5 million lower advertising expense.
Net cash used in investing activities for continuing operations increased $44.4 million in 2020, compared with 2019 due to the following:
•$53.4 million increase in capital expenditures due primarily to higher spending in the Broadband segment primarily driven by our Glo Fiber market expansion.
•$8.1 million decline in acquisitions.
•Net cash used in investing activities for discontinued operations decreased $54.2 million to $17.5 million during 2020, due to completion of the nTelos and Parkersburg network expansions in the first half of 2019 and postponement of Richmond Sliver territory expansion projects in contemplation of the pending sale of our Wireless operations.
Net cash used in financing activities for continuing operations during 2020 decreased approximately $4.6 million compared with 2019, driven by a $7.2 million decline in share repurchases, partially offset by a $2.5 million increase in dividends paid as our annual dividend increased from $0.29 per share in 2019 to $0.34 per share in 2020.
Net cash used in financing activities for discontinued operations during 2020 decreased $19.1 million primarily due to lower principal payments on our term loans.
Indebtedness: As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s indebtedness totaled approximately $698 million, with an annualized overall weighted average interest rate of approximately 2.3%. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the financial covenants in our Credit Facility agreement.
Disposition of Wireless: Shentel currently expects that the after-tax proceeds from the sale of Shentel Wireless will be approximately $1.5 billion. The transaction will be accounted for as an asset sale for income tax purposes. Cash proceeds from the sale are required to be used to immediately repay our outstanding indebtedness. Principal payments on our debt are thus presented as cash used to finance our discontinued operations. The Company currently expects to use the after-tax proceeds from the sale of Shentel Wireless to, among other things:
•Repay and terminate approximately $702 million of outstanding term loans under our credit agreement, and associated interest rate swap liabilities, concurrent with the closing of the disposition;
•Issue a Special Dividend of $18.75 per share to Shentel’s shareholders;
•Provide adequate liquidity for growth and potential strategic acquisitions; and
•Provide liquidity for general corporate purposes.
The Company expects to pay the Special Dividend in the second quarter 2021 after the close of the Shentel Wireless transaction, subject to the approval of Shentel’s Board of Directors.
Following the disposition of Wireless and concurrent repayment of our outstanding term loans, we expect to secure a new credit facility, to assist in funding our strategic initiatives and future growth.
We expect our cash on hand, proceeds received from dispositions, and cash flow from continuing operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity needs for business operations for the next twelve months. There can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to raise additional financing to support the Company's planned capital expenditures.
We expect our capital expenditures to exceed the cash flow provided from continuing operations through 2023, as we expand our Glo Fiber and Beam broadband services into new markets.
The actual amount and timing of our future capital requirements may differ materially from our estimate depending on the demand for our products and services, the outcome of the sale of our discontinued wireless operations to T-Mobile, new market developments and expansion opportunities.
Our proceeds from dispositions and cash flows from continuing operations could be adversely affected by events outside our control, including, without limitation, changes in overall economic conditions, regulatory requirements, changes in technologies, demand for our products and services, availability of labor resources and capital, natural disasters, pandemics and outbreaks of contagious diseases and other adverse public health developments, such as COVID-19, and other conditions. Our ability to attract and maintain a sufficient customer base, particularly in our Broadband markets, is critical to our ability to maintain a positive cash flow from operations. The foregoing events individually or collectively could affect our results.
Critical Accounting Policies
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, as well as related disclosures. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or operating results would be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss further below.
Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our consolidated financial statements. The following are the accounting policies that we believe involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity and are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.
Revenue Recognition
Our Broadband segment provides broadband data, video and voice services to residential and commercial customers in portions of Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky, via fiber optic, hybrid fiber coaxial cable, and fixed wireless networks. The Broadband segment also provides voice and DSL telephone services to customers in Virginia’s Shenandoah County and portions of adjacent counties as a Rural Local Exchange Carrier (“RLEC”). Our service contracts are generally cancellable at the customer’s discretion without penalty at any time. We allocate the total transaction price in these transactions based upon the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service. We generally recognize these revenues over time as customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits of the service, with the exception of equipment sales and home wiring, which are recognized as revenue at a point in time when control transfers and when installation is complete, respectively. Installation fees, charged upfront without transfer of commensurate goods or services to the customer, are allocated to services and are recognized ratably over the longer of the contract term or the period in which the unrecognized fee remains material to the contract, which we estimate to be about one year. Additionally, the Company incurs commission and installation costs related to in-house and third-party vendors which are capitalized and amortized over the expected weighted average customer life which is approximately five years.
Our Broadband segment also provides Ethernet and Wavelength fiber optic services to enterprise and carrier customers under capacity agreements, and the related revenue is recognized over time. In some cases, non-refundable upfront fees are charged for connecting enterprise or carrier customers to our fiber network. Those amounts are recognized ratably over the longer of the contract term or the period in which the unrecognized fee remains material to the respective contract.
The Broadband segment also leases dedicated fiber optic strands to customers as part of “dark fiber” agreements, which are accounted for as leases under ASC 842 Leases.
Our Tower segment leases space on owned cell towers to our Wireless and Broadband segments, and to other wireless carriers. Revenue from these leases is accounted for under ASC 842.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
Recently issued accounting standards and their expected impact, if any, are discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our consolidated financial statements.
