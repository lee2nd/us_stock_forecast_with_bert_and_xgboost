ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity and capital resources as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. This discussion should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Financial Information. Some of the information contained in this discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties; therefore our “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” should be reviewed for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, such forward-looking statements.
OVERVIEW
We develop, acquire, assemble and market technology and entertainment-based products and services for the gaming industry for placement on the casino floor and legal internet gaming sites. Our products and services primarily relate to licensed casino operators’ table games activities and focus on either increasing their profitability, productivity and security or expanding their gaming entertainment offerings in the form of proprietary table games, electronically enhanced table game platforms, fully-automated electronic tables and other ancillary equipment. In addition, we license intellectual property to legal internet gaming operators. Our products and services are offered in highly regulated markets throughout the world. Our products are assembled at our headquarters in Las Vegas, Nevada, as well as outsourced for certain sub-assemblies in the United States.
Results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated gross revenues of $10,230,316 compared to $21,300,996 in 2019, representing a decrease of $11,070,680, or 52.0%. This decrease was primarily attributable to the COVID-19 crisis, as many of our land-based casino customers remained closed through the end of 2020, and those that were open had reduced capacity or realized reduced visitation which, in turn, resulted in us realizing no revenue from those that were closed and reduced revenue from those that were open. We continued to realize revenue from licensing our game content to the online gaming market through the end of 2020. With the PGP acquisition in the third quarter, we began to recognize revenue from licensing the newly-acquired game content of others to the online gaming market.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $8,964,930 in 2020 compared to $13,295,475 in 2019, representing a decrease of $4,330,545, or 32.6%. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in compensation-related expenses directly related to the COVID-19 crisis (reduction in workforce, removal of bonuses and lower commissions and distributor fees). Lower legal fees contributed to the decrease as well. Prior year legal expenses included expenses associated with our strategic review, the Triangulum Lawsuit and the related contested proxy campaign. Current year legal expenses were comprised mainly of expenses related to the Triangulum Lawsuit. Also, the decrease in expenses related to travel and entertainment, royalty expenses and advertising and marketing were directly related to the COVID-19 crisis. In 2020, the Company incurred $652,198 in expenses associated with the Triangulum Lawsuit and $20,058 of severance expense. Excluding these costs, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of gross revenue was 81.1% in 2020, compared to 53.8% in 2019.
Research and development expenses were $487,679 in 2020 compared to $821,127 in 2019, representing a decrease of $333,448, or 40.6%. This decrease was primarily due to lower payroll and related expenses as a result of the departure of the former Chief Technology Officer in July 2019. Also, consulting expenses decreased due to the Company no longer using certain third-party research and development firms.
Share-based compensation expenses were $737,991 in 2020 compared to $927,696 in 2019, representing a decrease of $189,705, or 20.4%. This decrease was mainly due to fewer restricted shares issued and at a lower stock price than the comparable prior-year period.
As a result of the changes described above, loss from operations was $2,255,010 in 2020 compared to income from operations of $4,072,676 in 2019, a decrease of $6,327,686, or 155.4%.
Total interest expense was $683,357 in 2020 compared to $679,201 in 2019, an increase of $4,156, or 0.6%. The increase was mainly attributable to lower interest on our Term Loan due to lower balances, offset by interest expense on our Revolving Loan (which was undrawn in 2019).
Share redemption consideration was $781,928 in 2020 compared to $510,775 in 2019, an increase of $271,153, or 53.1%. The increase was attributable to the Triangulum Redemption Consideration Obligation, which was outstanding for only a portion of the prior-year period.
On November 21, 2020, the Company received notification the PPP Loan had been forgiven in full, including the original loan amount of $835,300 plus $4,943 in accrued interest.
The benefit for income taxes was ($605,936) in 2020 based on an effective rate of 17.42 percent compared to the provision of $10,018 in 2019 based on an effective rate of 0.3 percent. The 17.42 percent effective tax rate for 2020 differed from the statutory federal income
tax rate of 21.0 percent and was primarily attributable to (i) the income tax benefit of approximately $1.2 million as a result of the net operating loss carryback provisions of the CARES Act and (ii) the income tax provision of approximately $560,000 as a result of a valuation allowance placed against the Company's certain deferred tax assets.
Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA includes adjustments to net (loss) income to exclude interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, share based compensation, gain on extinguishment of debt, foreign currency exchange loss (gain), change in estimated fair value of interest rate swap liability and severance and other expenses related to litigation. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of performance defined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). However, Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to evaluate our operating performance. Management believes that disclosure of the Adjusted EBITDA metric offers investors, regulators and other stakeholders a view of our operations in the same manner management evaluates our performance. When combined with U.S. GAAP results, management believes Adjusted EBITDA provides a comprehensive understanding of our financial results. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or to net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of operating results or of liquidity. It may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it excludes financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance. A reconciliation of U.S. GAAP net income to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:

Includes expenses associated with the Triangulum Lawsuit in both 2020 and 2019 and the strategic review and related contested proxy campaign in 2019.
Liquidity and capital resources. We have generally been able to fund our continuing operations, our investments and the obligations under our existing borrowings through cash flow from operations. However, the COVID-19 crisis resulted in negative cash provided by operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. But based on our forecast of a gradual recovery in the casino gaming industry from the lows of Q2 2020, combined with the $3.92 million in cash we received from the MSPLP, we believe we have adequate liquidity to meet our short-term obligations. However, if COVID-19 continues to force casino closures or if the recovery from the closures is slower than we anticipate, the issuance of debt or equity financing arrangements may be required to fund future expenditures or other cash requirements. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising additional funding, if necessary, and even if we are successful, it may not be on advantageous terms to us. If we are not able to secure additional funding, the implementation of our business plan could be negatively affected. In addition, we may incur higher capital expenditures in the future to expand our operations. We may from time to time acquire products and businesses complementary to our business. We may also incur significant expenses when applying for new licenses or in complying with current jurisdictional requirements. As a public entity, we may issue shares of our common stock and preferred stock in private or public offerings to obtain financing, capital or to acquire other businesses that can improve our performance and growth. To the extent that we seek to acquire other businesses in exchange for our common stock, fluctuations in our stock price could have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete acquisitions.
As of December 31, 2020, we had total current assets of $11,562,833 and total assets of $30,574,594. This compares to $13,208,837 and $22,987,053, respectively, as of December 31, 2019. The decrease in current assets as of December 31, 2020 was primarily due to the Company closing on the Purchase Agreement in August 2020, resulting in a decrease in our cash balance. The increase in total assets as of December 31, 2020 was primarily due to an increase in our Intangibles balance of $10.4 million, as a result of acquiring customer agreements in connection with the closing on the Purchase Agreement.
Our total current liabilities as of December 31, 2020 increased to $4,201,095 from $4,157,841, primarily due the Company drawing down on its $1,000,000 Revolving Loan on March 12, 2020.
Despite the COVID-19 crisis, our business was profitable in Q1 2020. However, our business was not profitable for the remainder of 2020. We do have sufficient working capital to meet our short-term and long-term obligations as they become due. Further, we do not currently believe that the recent temporary casino closures in the both the United Kingdom and United States will result in an impairment of our assets or a default under our loan agreements.
We continue to file applications for new or enhanced licenses in several jurisdictions, which may result in significant future legal and regulatory expenses. A significant increase in such expenses may require us to postpone growth initiatives or investments in personnel, inventory and research and development of our products. It is our intention to continue such initiatives and investments. However, to the extent we are not able to achieve our growth objectives or raise additional capital, we will need to evaluate the reduction of operating expenses.
Our operating activities used $1,586,247 in cash for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to cash provided of $4,890,595 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in operating cash flow was primarily due to the net loss for the period as a result of the COVID-19 crisis.
Investing activities used cash of $6,456,714 for the year December 31, 2020, compared to $163,351 for the year ended December 31, 2019. This was due to closing of the Purchase Agreement in August 2020.
Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $4,389,234, which resulted from the $1,000,000 draw on our Revolving Loan on March 12, 2020, $835,300 from the PPP Loan and $3,920,000 from the MSPLP (net of debt issuance costs), offset by an increase in principal payments on our long-term debt. This compares to $1,363,047 cash used in financing activities for the comparable prior period.
Critical Accounting Policies. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We consider the following accounting policies to be the most important to understanding and evaluating our financial results:
Revenue recognition. We account for our revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. We generate revenue primarily from the licensing of our intellectual property. We recognize revenue under recurring fee license contracts monthly as we satisfy our performance obligation, which consists of granting the customer the right to use our intellectual property. Amounts billed are determined based on flat rates or usage rates stipulated in the customer contract.
Goodwill and other intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets are assessed for impairment at least annually or at other times during the year if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting asset is below the carrying amount. If found to be impaired, the carrying amounts will be reduced, and an impairment loss will be recognized.
Long-term liabilities. The Company issued a promissory note in the face amount of $39,096,401 to Triangulum on May 6, 2019 in connection with the share redemption disclosed in Note 1. The promissory note has not been given accounting effect in the Company’s financial statements. The Company has instead recorded a long-term obligation payable to Triangulum, based on the redemption value specified in our Articles of Incorporation. The obligation is classified as long-term because we do not expect that a final agreement with respect to the litigation will be reached between the parties in the next twelve months.
Off balance sheet arrangements. As of December 31, 2020, there were no off-balance sheet arrangements.
Recently issued accounting pronouncements. We do not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flow.
