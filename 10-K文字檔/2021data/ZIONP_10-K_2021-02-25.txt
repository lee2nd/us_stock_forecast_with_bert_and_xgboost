MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
GAAP to NON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS
This Form 10-K presents non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to provide investors with additional information. The adjustments to reconcile from the applicable GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures are presented in the following schedules. We consider these adjustments to be relevant to ongoing operating results and provide a meaningful base for period-to-period and company-to-company comparisons. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management to assess our performance and financial position and for presentations of our performance to investors. We further believe that presenting these non-GAAP financial measures will permit investors to assess our performance on the same basis as applied by management and the banking industry.
Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations and are not required to be uniformly applied by individual entities. Although non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders to evaluate a company, they have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results reported under GAAP. The following are the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this Form 10-K and a discussion of the reasons for which management and investors use these non-GAAP measures.
Return on Average Tangible Common Equity - This schedule also includes “net earnings applicable to common shareholders, excluding the effects of amortization of core deposit and other intangibles, net of tax,” and “average tangible common equity.” Return on average tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes provides useful information to management and others about our use of shareholders’ equity. Management believes the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information about performance because they present measures of those assets that can generate income.
Schedule 2
RETURN ON AVERAGE TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY (NON-GAAP)
Tangible Equity Ratio, Tangible Common Equity Ratio, and Tangible Book Value per Common Share - This schedule also includes “tangible equity,” “tangible common equity,” and “tangible assets.” Tangible equity ratio, tangible common equity ratio, and tangible book value per common share are non-GAAP financial measures that management believes provide additional useful information about the levels of tangible assets and tangible equity. Management believes the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information about capital adequacy because the ratios present measures of those assets that can generate income.

TANGIBLE EQUITY RATIO, TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY RATIO, AND TANGIBLE BOOK VALUE PER COMMON SHARE (ALL NON-GAAP MEASURES)
Efficiency Ratio and Adjusted Pre-provision Net Revenue - This schedule also includes “adjusted noninterest expense,” “taxable-equivalent net interest income,” “adjusted taxable-equivalent revenue,” “pre-provision net revenue (“PPNR”),” and “adjusted PPNR.” The methodology of determining the efficiency ratio may differ among companies. Management makes adjustments to exclude certain items, as identified in the subsequent schedule, which it believes allows for more consistent comparability among periods. Management believes the efficiency ratio provides useful information regarding the cost of generating revenue. Adjusted noninterest expense provides a measure as to how well we are managing our expenses, and adjusted PPNR enables management and others to assess our ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through a credit cycle. Taxable-equivalent net interest income allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources.

Key Corporate Objectives
While we serve a variety of customers, we are particularly focused on serving small businesses, mid-sized commercial businesses, affluent customers, and providing capital markets products to our commercial customers. The subsequent graphic illustrates our key corporate objectives. We conduct our operations through seven separately managed affiliates, each with its own local branding and management team. We continue to invest in relevant capabilities to maintain a competitive advantage.
To facilitate the service to these customers, we are investing in the following five key areas, referred to as “strategic enablers”:
•Risk Management - we continue to invest in enhanced risk management practices to ensure prudent risk taking and appropriate oversight.
•People and Empowerment - we are investing significantly in training our employees and providing them the tools and resources to build their capabilities, while promoting a diverse, inclusive, and equitable culture.
•Technology - we are investing heavily in technologies that customers value most, that will make us more efficient, and that enable us to compete now and in the future against the largest banks, while helping to insulate us from the risks of bank-disrupting technology companies.
•Operational Excellence - we continue to support ongoing improvements in how we safely and securely deliver value to our customers, both internal and external.
•Data and Analytics - we continue to invest in advanced enterprise data and analytics to support local execution.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
COVID-19 Pandemic: The Backdrop for Our 2020 Financial Performance
The year 2020 presented a great number of challenges, and the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in hardships for many. Key examples of our response to the challenging environment are set forth below.
•Although the sharp reduction of shorter-term benchmark interest rates to nearly zero and a significant flattening of the interest rate curve resulted in a reduction of revenue, the fiscal stimulus provided by the CARES Act and specifically the PPP, allowed us to provide relief to more than 47,000 customers - 14,700 customers of which were new to us - by facilitating a lending lifeline to these businesses. These new customers helped increase the total number of our business customers by nearly 8% in 2020.
•We ranked as the ninth largest originator of PPP loans by dollar volume of all the participating financial institutions, as disclosed by the SBA. Our market share of this program was approximately 3.5 times our overall national deposit market share, as measured by deposits. We attribute this success to two key factors:
◦We leveraged our relationship-based, high-touch approach to banking. During the development and roll-out of the PPP loans, many of our employees worked long hours to call on customers, and to ensure their questions were answered and that the process was as efficient as possible.
◦We rapidly deployed technology solutions that expedited the flow of applications. This was made possible due to the streamlining and advancements we have made in technology in recent years.
•We originated $3.5 billion of residential mortgages in 2020, enabling many consumers to lower their monthly payments. This record origination volume was made possible in part by our investments in residential mortgage banking technology and operations over the past several years.
•We were able to quickly transition more than 70% of our employees to a work-from-home environment to help reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus, and to keep our employees and communities safe. For our banking branches, we modified the hours of operation and limited lobby visits through scheduled in-branch appointments and expanded use of drive-through banking facilities.
•In recent years, we invested significantly in technology that enabled customers to open accounts without visiting a branch or office. Mobile and online banking for retail customers increased 10% in 2020 from
ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
2019, as measured by total logins, thereby enabling customers to fulfill many of their banking needs from the convenience of their mobile devices and computers.
Executive Summary of Our Financial Performance
The financial performance of 2020 relative to 2019 reflects:
•Moderate reduction in net interest income due to interest rate-driven compression of the net interest margin (“NIM”), which was partially offset by an increase in earning asset balances due to PPP loan originations.
•A strong increase in average deposits.
•An increase in customer-related noninterest income, primarily attributable to strong residential mortgage loan originations and sales.
•A decrease in adjusted noninterest expense. Excluding infrequent items such as severance, restructuring, and pension termination, noninterest expense declined 2%, compared with 2019.
•A deterioration of asset quality and a significant increase in the allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses increased $309 million from January 1, 2020, which resulted in an increase in the provision for credit losses of $375 million from the prior year. Net loan and lease charge-offs were $105 million, or 0.2%, of average non-PPP loans, up from $37 million, or 0.1%, of average loans in the prior year.
The net result of the above factors yielded a 35% decrease in net earnings applicable to common shareholders to $505 million for 2020, from $782 million for 2019. Earnings per diluted share of $3.02 for 2020 declined by 27%, compared with $4.16 for 2019.

KEY DRIVERS OF PERFORMANCE
1Includes loans held for sale.
Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin
Net interest income is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities and is approximately 79% of our net revenue. Net interest income is derived from both the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and their respective yields and rates.
Schedule 6
INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS, INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES, AND NET INTEREST MARGIN -
2020 vs. 2019
1 Rates are calculated using amounts in thousands and a tax rate of 21% for the periods presented. The taxable-equivalent rates used are the rates that were applicable at the time of each respective reporting period.
Net interest income and taxable-equivalent net interest income were both $2.2 billion during 2020, a decrease of $0.1 billion, or 4%, compared with $2.3 billion during 2019. The tax rate used for calculating all taxable-equivalent adjustments was 21% for 2020 and 2019. Yields on loans and securities decreased by 88 bps and 36 bps, respectively, while yields on deposits and borrowed funds decreased by 50 bps and 125 bps, respectively. The impact of lower interest rates was partially offset by loan growth from PPP activity, and a shift in liability balances from federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings to lower-cost deposits.
ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
The NIM compressed to 3.15% in 2020, compared with 3.54% in 2019. Due to the lower interest rate environment, the net impact of noninterest-bearing sources of funds on the NIM decreased to 0.18% in 2020, compared with 0.46% in 2019.
Average interest-earning assets increased $6.2 billion, or 10%, in 2020, from 2019, with the average yield decreasing 80 bps. The yield on average interest-earning assets includes the dilutive effect of $4.5 billion (6% of earning assets) of PPP loans with a yield of 3.22%, as compared with a yield on the non-PPP loan portfolio of 3.96%.
Average loans increased in 2020, primarily due to PPP loan originations, which were funded mainly through deposit growth. The average loan yield decreased 88 bps over the same prior year period, with decreases of 75 bps, 124 bps, and 51 bps in non-PPP commercial loans, CRE, and consumer loans, respectively. Recently, as benchmark interest rates have settled at a lower level, yields on new loans have been only modestly lower than yields on maturing loans.
During 2020, we provided assistance to many small businesses through the PPP. Loan processing fees paid to us by the SBA are accounted for as loan origination fees, which are deferred with the loan origination costs, and are recognized over the life of the loan as a yield adjustment. Toward the end of the third quarter of 2020, we extended the maturity dates of PPP loans with an initial two-year maturity to five years, which lengthened the period of time the remaining unamortized net deferred fees are recognized into interest income as a yield adjustment. When a PPP loan is paid off or forgiven by the SBA prior to its maturity date, the remaining unamortized net deferred fees are immediately recognized into interest income at that time, and impact the PPP loan portfolio yield in that period. As of December 31, 2020, there were approximately $102 million of unamortized net origination fees related to the PPP loans.
The PPP loan yield in 2020 was 3.22%. Beginning in October 2020, the SBA initiated forgiveness of the PPP loans. During 2020, about 9,900 PPP loans, totaling $1.3 billion, received forgiveness by the SBA and contributed $26 million of interest income through accelerated recognition of net unamortized deferred fees on these loans. Additionally, on December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act was signed into law, which extended the PPP and provided government funding for additional forgivable PPP loans. These developments, and other potential future program changes, will affect PPP interest income and the effective yield of the PPP loans in future periods.
ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
Benchmark interest rates decreased in 2020 and 2019, resulting in the previously described negative effect on
yields. A portion of our variable-rate loans, such as those with longer initial fixed-rate periods or longer reset frequencies (e.g., five- and seven-year fixed-rate adjustable mortgages), have not yet been affected by declines in benchmark interest rates. Generally, a larger portion of our interest-earning assets reprice when compared with our funding sources, partly because nearly half of our deposits are noninterest-bearing.
Average available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities balances decreased by $181 million in 2020. Yields on average AFS securities decreased by 36 bps over the same time period. The duration of the AFS securities portfolio is 3.1%. Principal repayment volume on AFS securities during 2020 was $4.4 billion, or 32% of the December 31, 2019 balance. We purchased $6.2 billion of AFS securities during 2020.
Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $563 million in 2020, from 2019, and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities decreased 69 bps to 40 bps. Average total deposits were $63.7 billion at an average cost of 17 bps during 2020, compared with $55.1 billion at an average cost of 46 bps during 2019. Various government stimulus programs have provided additional liquidity to individuals and small businesses, which has indirectly contributed to deposit growth. Average interest-bearing deposits grew 10%, and were $34.8 billion at an average cost of 30 bps during 2020, compared with $31.7 billion at an average cost of 80 bps during 2019.
Average borrowed funds decreased $2.5 billion during 2020, from 2019, with average short-term borrowings decreasing $2.8 billion, and average long-term borrowings increasing $308 million during the same period. Strong deposit growth allowed us to reduce short-term borrowings and to repurchase $429 million of our outstanding long-term debt maturing in 2021 and 2022. During 2020, the average interest rate paid on short-term borrowings and the rate paid on long-term debt decreased by 184 bps and 124 bps, respectively, due to lower short-term rates and interest rate hedges on our long-term fixed-rate debt.
The 29 bps decline in the cost of total deposits and the 50 bps decline in the cost of interest-bearing deposits can be largely attributed to the previously mentioned decline in benchmark market rates which reduced competitive pricing pressure for deposits.
Although we utilize a wide variety of sources for our funding needs, we benefit from access to deposits from a significant number of small- to mid-sized business customers, which provides us with a low cost of funds that has a positive impact on our NIM. Because many of our deposit accounts are of an operating nature for businesses and households, we expect our noninterest-bearing deposits to remain a competitive advantage. Average noninterest-
ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
bearing demand deposits increased by $5.5 billion, or 24%, in 2020, from 2019. Average noninterest-bearing deposits comprised 45% and 42% of average total deposits for 2020 and 2019, respectively. The net positive impact of noninterest-bearing sources of funds on the NIM was 0.18% during 2020, compared with 0.46% during 2019, reflecting the decline in benchmark interest rates.
Interest expense decreased $259 million in 2020, compared with 2019, primarily due to both a decrease in the cost of deposits and wholesale funds, as well as a shift in balances from higher-to-lower cost funding sources which included a decrease in the quantity of borrowed funds and brokered deposits, and an increase in the quantity of both noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits.
The spread on average interest-bearing funds was 2.97% and 3.08% during 2020 and 2019, respectively, and was affected by the same factors that impacted the NIM. Interest rate spreads and margins are impacted by the mix of assets we hold, the composition of our loan and securities portfolios, and the type of funding used. Our interest rate risk position estimates are highly dependent upon a number of assumptions regarding the repricing behavior of various deposit and loan types in response to changes in both short-term and long-term interest rates, balance sheet composition, and other modeling assumptions, as well as the actions of competitors and customers in response to those changes. Further detail on interest rate risk is described in “Interest Rate and Market Risk Management” on page 67. Refer to the “Liquidity Risk Management” section beginning on page 73 for more information on how we manage liquidity risk.

INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS, INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES, AND NET INTEREST MARGIN -
2019 vs. 2018
1 Rates are calculated using amounts in thousands and tax rate of 21% for the periods presented. The taxable-equivalent rates used are the rates that were applicable at the time of each respective reporting period.
Net interest income was $2.3 billion during 2019, a slight increase from $2.2 billion during 2018. Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $2.3 billion in both 2019 and 2018.
The NIM was 3.54% and 3.61% for 2019 and 2018, respectively. When comparing 2019 with 2018, higher interest rates and a greater concentration of loans in the earning asset mix led to an increase in earning asset yield, which was more than offset by an increase in deposit rates and a modestly greater reliance on higher-cost borrowed funds. Funding loan growth with wholesale borrowings negatively impacted the NIM relative to deposit funding, although it was accretive to net interest income. The net impact of noninterest-bearing sources of funds on the NIM increased to 0.46% in 2019, compared with 0.33% in 2018.
ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
Average loans increased $2.9 billion, or 6%, in 2019, due to widespread growth in essentially all loans categories, with average commercial loans accounting for over half of the growth. Loan growth was funded through a mix of deposits, securities run-off, and wholesale borrowings. Yields on average loan balances increased by 7 bps, 16 bps, and 18 bps in the commercial, CRE, and consumer portfolios, respectively. The commercial loan growth was in municipal, commercial and industrial, and owner-occupied loans, where our yields are generally lower than commercial real estate (“CRE”), but higher than consumer. The federal funds target rate decreased three times in 2019 after increasing four times in 2018.
The average balance of our investment securities portfolio decreased $0.4 billion in 2019, while the year-end balance decreased $1.1 billion.
Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits comprised 42% of average total deposits, which totaled $55.1 billion in 2019, compared with 45% of average total deposits, which totaled $53.2 billion, for 2018. Average interest-
ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
bearing deposits increased 8% in 2019, compared with 2018. During 2019, the Federal Reserve decreased the overnight benchmark federal funds rate by 75 bps, while the rate paid on our interest-bearing deposits increased 34 bps.
The average balance of long-term debt increased $701 million in 2019, compared with 2018, while the average rate decreased 152 bps. Overall interest expense on long-term debt increased $18 million in 2019. We used short-term Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) borrowings to fund some of our balance sheet growth during 2019 and 2018. Average short-term debt grew $0.2 billion and the rate paid increased 43 bps in 2019.
Interest expense increased $160 million in 2019, compared with 2018 results, attributable to both an increase in the cost and quantity of deposits and wholesale funding. Interest expense on deposits increased $119 million on $31.7 billion of average interest-bearing deposits. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $3.2 billion, while average rates increased 36 bps.
The spread on average interest-bearing funds was 3.08% in 2019, compared with 3.28% in 2018. The spread on average interest-bearing funds for these periods was affected by the same factors that had an impact on the NIM.
The following schedule summarizes the average balances, the amount of interest earned or incurred, and the applicable yields for interest-earning assets and the costs of interest-bearing liabilities that generate taxable-equivalent net interest income.

Schedule 9 analyzes the year-to-year changes in net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis for the years indicated. For purposes of calculating the yields in these schedules, the average loan balances also include the principal amounts of nonaccrual and restructured loans. However, interest received on nonaccrual loans is included in income only to the extent that cash payments have been received and not applied to principal reductions. In addition, interest on restructured loans is generally accrued at reduced rates.
Schedule 9
ANALYSIS OF INTEREST CHANGES DUE TO VOLUME AND RATE
1 Taxable-equivalent rates used where applicable.
2 Net of unearned income and fees, net of related costs. Loans include nonaccrual and restructured loans.
In the analysis of interest changes due to volume and rate, changes due to the volume/rate variance are allocated to volume with the following exceptions: when volume and rate both increase, the variance is allocated proportionately to both volume and rate; when the rate increases and volume decreases, the variance is allocated to rate.
Provision for Credit Losses
The allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) is the combination of both the allowance for loan and lease losses (“ALLL”) and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments (“RULC”). The ALLL represents the estimated current expected credit losses over the contractual term of the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The RULC represents the estimated reserve for current expected credit losses associated with off-balance sheet commitments. Changes in the ALLL and RULC, including changes in net charge-offs, are recorded in the provision for loan and lease losses and the provision for unfunded lending commitments in the income statement, respectively. The ACL for debt securities is estimated separately from loans.
ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
On January 1, 2020, we adopted ASU 2016-13, Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, and its subsequent updates, often referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss (“CECL”) model. Upon adoption of this ASU, we recorded the full amount of the ACL for loans and leases of $526 million, compared with $554 million at December 31, 2019, resulting in an after-tax increase to retained earnings of $20 million. The impact of the adoption of CECL for our securities portfolio was less than $1 million. As a result of the CECL accounting standard, the ACL is subject to economic forecasts that may change materially from period to period.
The provision for credit losses, which is the combination of both the provision for loan losses and the provision for unfunded lending commitments, was $414 million in 2020, compared with $39 million in 2019. The ACL increased $309 million to $835 million at December 31, 2020, compared with $526 million at January 1, 2020. The increase in the ACL is almost entirely due to economic stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic coupled with the effect of low oil and gas prices. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans during 2020 was 0.20%, compared with 0.08% during 2019. The provision for credit losses for debt securities was less than $1 million during 2020.
ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
* January 1, 2020 amount is used instead of December 31, 2019, for comparative purposes because this is the date the CECL accounting standard became effective.
The total ACL was $835 million at December 31, 2020, compared with $526 million at January 1, 2020. The bar chart above shows the broad categories of change in the ACL. The second bar represents the change in ACL due to changes in economic forecasts. The $373 million increase from January 1, 2020 is our estimate of the change in credit losses due to the change in economic forecasts brought on by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic downturn, including the impact of low oil and gas prices. As of December 31, 2020, our base forecast shows economic improvement continuing throughout 2021, gradually stabilizing by 2022. Credit quality factors represented by the third bar include risk-grade migration and specific reserves against loans, which, when combined, add $104 million to the ACL when compared with 2019, showing credit quality deterioration during the year. Lastly, portfolio changes, driven by non-PPP loan balances declining, the aging of the portfolio, decreased utilization, and other similar factors, generated a $168 million reduction in the ACL.
See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on how we determine the appropriate level for the ALLL and the RULC.
Noninterest Income
Noninterest income represents revenues we earn for products and services that have no associated interest rate or yield and is classified as either customer-related or noncustomer-related fee income. We believe a subtotal of customer-related fees provides a better view of income over which we have more direct near-term control and excludes items such as mark-to-market adjustments on certain derivatives, dividends, insurance-related income, and securities gains and losses.
Total noninterest income increased by $12 million, to $574 million in 2020, compared with $562 million in 2019, and $552 million in 2018. Noninterest income accounted for approximately 21% and 20% of net revenue during 2020 and 2019, respectively.

NONINTEREST INCOME
Customer-related fees
Growing customer-related fee income is a key strategic priority, and several strategic initiatives are underway to support this effort. We are working to leverage our relationship with commercial and small business customers to accelerate sales of capital markets products, treasury management products, and wealth advisory services.
Total customer-related fees increased to $549 million in 2020, compared with $525 million in 2019, and $508 million in 2018. Loan-related fees and income increased $34 million in 2020, due to residential mortgage loan originations and sales, which benefited from the reduction in benchmark interest rates and our enhanced customer-facing digital fulfillment process. Retail and business banking fees decreased $10 million in 2020, due to fee waivers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Card fees decreased $10 million in 2020, due to reduced economic activity and transaction volume.
Customer-related fees increased by $17 million, or 3%, during 2019. Capital markets and foreign exchange fees increased by $20 million as a result of an $11 million increase in income from arranging interest rate hedges for our loan customers, a $4 million increase in loan syndication arrangement fees, and a $3 million increase in foreign exchange fees. Wealth management and trust fees increased by $5 million, or 9%, as a result of increased corporate and personal trust revenue. Other customer-related fees decreased by $6 million, or 22%, primarily as a result of the sale of a minor business in 2019.
Noncustomer-related fees
Dividends and other income decreased by $19 million during 2020, primarily due to lower dividends received from the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”), reflecting less FHLB stock held by us.
When comparing 2019 with 2018, fair value and nonhedge derivative income decreased by $8 million due to valuation adjustments on client-related interest rate swaps during 2019. As a result of the decline in interest rates during 2019 and increased client activity during the year, these client-related interest rate swaps significantly increased in value, resulting in the Bank having a larger exposure to the clients and a $9 million negative valuation adjustment in 2019, compared with a negative valuation adjustment of $1 million in 2018.

Noninterest expense decreased by $38 million, or 2%, in 2020, compared with 2019. Adjusted noninterest expense decreased by $31 million, or 2%, over the same period, and includes a $30 million charitable contribution in 2020. See “GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations” on page 28 for more information regarding the calculation of adjusted noninterest expense.
Schedule 12
SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
Salaries and employee benefits decreased by $54 million, or 5%, in 2020, compared with 2019, primarily due to an increase in capitalized salaries and employee benefits as a result of our technology initiatives and PPP loan originations, lower severance costs and base salaries related to the reduction in workforce, and a decrease in the profit sharing contribution to the employee 401(k) plan. Full-time equivalent employees decreased to 9,678 at December 31, 2020, compared with 10,188 at December 31, 2019. During 2020, we paid $21 million in PPP-related bonuses, of which approximately $16 million was capitalized and deferred.
Salaries and employee benefits increased by $71 million, or 7%, in 2019, compared with 2018, mainly due to a $33 million increase in base salaries resulting from salary merit increases, a $22 million increase in severance expenses primarily from the previously mentioned workforce reduction, a $6 million increase in employee medical costs, and a $4 million increase in retirement expenses. These increases were partially offset by a $7 million decrease in incentive compensation.
ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
Other noninterest expense increased by $16 million to $241 million in 2020, compared with $225 million in 2019. This increase was primarily due to the previously mentioned $30 million charitable contribution and a $28 million pension plan termination-related expense, partially offset by an $18 million decrease in travel and entertainment expense, a $13 million impairment charge in 2019 related to centralizing our office space and the closure of certain branches, and $10 million of customer reimbursements in 2019 to remedy a self-identified operational issue. These same expenses that occurred in 2019 contributed to the same reasons for the $28 million increase in Other noninterest expense in 2019, compared with 2018.
When comparing 2019 with 2018, the other significant variance was a $25 million decrease in FDIC premiums, which was primarily due to the elimination of the FDIC surcharge for large banks because the required Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio had been met and the Bank issuing unsecured debt which results in lower FDIC premiums.

Income tax expense was $133 million in 2020, $237 million in 2019, and $259 million in 2018. Our effective income tax rates were 19.8% in 2020, 22.5% in 2019, and 22.7% in 2018. The income tax rates for all tax years were reduced by nontaxable municipal interest income and nontaxable income from certain bank-owned life insurance (“BOLI”) and were increased by the nondeductibility of FDIC premiums, certain executive compensation, and other fringe benefits. The tax rate for 2020 was also reduced as a result of the proportional increase in nontaxable items and tax credits relative to pretax book income, as compared with 2019 and 2018.
We continued to invest in technology initiatives, low-income housing, and municipal securities during 2020, 2019, and 2018, generating tax credits and nontaxable income that benefited the tax rate each year.
We had a net deferred tax liability (“DTL”) balance of $3 million at December 31, 2020, compared with a net deferred tax asset (“DTA”) balance of $37 million at December 31, 2019. The decrease from a net DTA to a net DTL balance resulted primarily from an increase in unrealized gains in OCI related to securities and accelerated tax deductions on certain technology initiatives and depreciable property during 2020. An increase in the provision for loan losses in excess of net charge-offs offset some of the overall decrease in DTA.
We did not record any DTA valuation allowance for GAAP purposes as of December 31, 2020. Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements discloses information about our evaluation of the DTA, including any potential additional valuation allowances.
Preferred Stock Dividends
Preferred stock dividends have been consistent during the past three years and were $34 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018. See further details in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS
We manage our operations and prepare management reports and other information with a primary focus on geographic area. Our banking operations are managed under their own individual brand names, including Zions Bank, Amegy Bank (“Amegy”), California Bank & Trust (“CB&T”), National Bank of Arizona (“NBAZ”), Nevada State Bank (“NSB”), Vectra Bank Colorado (“Vectra”), and The Commerce Bank of Washington (“TCBW”). Performance assessment and resource allocation are based upon this geographic structure. We emphasize local authority and responsibility, local pricing, and customization of certain products (as applicable), designed to maximize customer satisfaction and strengthen community relations.
We allocate the cost of centrally provided services to the business segments based upon estimated or actual usage of those services. We also allocate capital based on the risk-weighted assets held at each business segment. We use an internal Funds Transfer Pricing (“FTP”) allocation process to report results of operations for business segments. This process is continually refined. Prior period amounts have been revised to reflect the impact of these changes had they been instituted for the periods presented. See Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The onset of a global pandemic during 2020 resulted in many challenges for our business segments, and affected all areas of their operations. Common areas of financial performance experienced at various levels of the segments include:
• Decreased income before income taxes;
• Increased loan balances across all geographies, mainly due to PPP loan originations;
•Growth in customer deposit balances across almost all segments, which were assisted by various government economic stimulus programs; and
•Lower credit quality and higher allowance for credit losses.

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS
Interest-earning Assets
Interest-earning assets are those assets that have interest rates or yields associated with them. One of our goals is to maintain a high level of interest-earning assets relative to total assets while keeping non-earning assets at a minimum. Interest-earning assets consist of money market investments, securities, loans, and leases.
Schedule 8, which we referenced in our discussion of net interest income, includes the average balances of our interest-earning assets, the amount of revenue generated by them, and their respective yields. Another goal is to maintain a higher-yielding mix of interest-earning assets, such as loans, relative to lower-yielding assets, while maintaining adequate levels of highly liquid assets. As a result of this goal we redeployed funds from lower-yielding money market investments, in addition to using wholesale borrowings, to purchase agency securities.
Average interest-earning assets were $71.2 billion in 2020, compared with $64.9 billion in 2019. Average interest-earning assets as a percentage of total average assets were 94% and 93% in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Average loans were $53.0 billion in 2020 and $48.3 billion in 2019. Average loans as a percentage of total average assets were 70% in 2020, compared with 69% in 2019.
Average money market investments, consisting of interest-bearing deposits and federal funds sold and security resell agreements, increased by 127% from 2019. Average securities decreased by 2% from 2019. Average total deposits increased by 16%; average total loans also increased by 10% in 2020 when compared with 2019.

The investment securities portfolio includes $387 million of net premium as of December 31, 2020, up from $340 million in the prior year, that is distributed across various asset classes as illustrated in the preceding schedule. Premium amortization for 2020 was approximately $105 million, compared with approximately $120 million in 2019. For more information on the accounting for premiums and discounts for investment securities see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
As of December 31, 2020, under the GAAP fair value accounting hierarchy, 1.2% of the $15.7 billion fair value of the AFS securities portfolio was valued at Level 1, 98.8% was valued at Level 2, and there were no Level 3 AFS securities. At December 31, 2019, 0.2% of the $13.7 billion fair value of AFS securities portfolio was valued at Level 1, 99.8% was valued at Level 2, and there were no Level 3 AFS securities. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of fair value accounting.
Exposure to State and Local Governments
We provide multiple products and services to state and local governments (referred to collectively as “municipalities”), including deposit services, loans, and investment banking services. We also invest in securities issued by the municipalities.
Schedule 15 summarizes our exposure to state and local municipalities:
Schedule 15
MUNICIPALITIES
Our municipal securities and loans are primarily from municipalities located within our geographic footprint. Our municipal loan and lease portfolio is generally secured by real estate or equipment, or is a general obligation of a municipal entity. At December 31, 2020, no municipal loans were on nonaccrual. Municipal securities are internally graded, similar to loans, using risk-grading systems which vary based on the size and type of credit risk exposure. The internal risk grades assigned to our municipal securities follow our definitions of Pass, Special Mention, and Substandard, which are consistent with published definitions of regulatory risk classifications. At December 31, 2020, all municipal securities were graded as Pass. See Notes 5 and 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the credit quality of these municipal loans and securities.
Loans Held for Sale
Loans held for sale were $81 million at December 31, 2020, compared with $129 million at December 31, 2019, and are generally consumer mortgage loans, small business loans, and commercial loans. As of December 31, 2020, the majority of the loans held for sale consisted primarily of consumer mortgage loans.
Loan and Lease Portfolio
As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, net loans and leases accounted for 66% and 70% of total assets, respectively. Schedule 16 presents our loans outstanding by type of loan as of the five most recent year-ends. The schedule also includes a maturity profile for the loans that were outstanding as of December 31, 2020. However, while this schedule reflects the contractual maturity and repricing characteristics of these loans, in a small number of cases, we have hedged the repricing characteristics of our variable-rate loans as more fully described in “Interest Rate Risk” on page 67.
ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
Schedule 16
LOAN AND LEASE PORTFOLIO BY TYPE AND MATURITY
Loans and leases, net of unearned income and fees, increased $4.8 billion, or 10%, to $53.5 billion at December 31, 2020, from $48.7 billion at December 31, 2019, primarily due to the origination of PPP loans across our geographic footprint. Excluding PPP loans, commercial loans decreased by $488 million, as the stressed economic environment adversely impacted demand for these loans. Within commercial loans, a $1.3 billion decrease in commercial and industrial loans was partially offset by increases of $558 million in municipal loans and $284 million in owner-occupied commercial loans. Term commercial real estate loans increased $415 million. Consumer loans decreased $866 million, which was spread across all consumer loan subcategories and geographies.
Other Noninterest-bearing Investments
During 2020, we decreased our short-term borrowings with the FHLB by $1 billion. This decrease required a reduced investment in FHLB activity stock, which consequently decreased by $39 million during the year. Additionally, there were decreases of $19 million to both our Farmer Mac stock and the value of our SBIC investments during the year. Aside from these decreases, other noninterest-bearing investments remained relatively stable as set forth in the following schedule. Schedule 17 summarizes our other noninterest-bearing investments.

Schedule 17
OTHER NONINTEREST-BEARING INVESTMENTS
1 As a result of the merger of our former bank holding company into the Bank, we agreed to dispose of our Farmer Mac Class C stock to resolve questions about the permissibility of national bank investments in such shares, and initiated sales of the stock in the first quarter of 2020.
Premises, Equipment and Software, Net
Net premises, equipment and software increased $67 million, or 5.9%, during 2020. In 2013, we began a three-phase project to replace our core loan and deposit banking systems. In 2017, we implemented the first phase of our core lending and deposit systems replacement project, which replaced our primary consumer lending systems. During the first quarter of 2019, we successfully implemented the second phase of this project by replacing our primary commercial and CRE lending systems. Having reached this milestone, we now have substantially all of our in-scope retail, commercial, and CRE loans on a new modern core platform. We are well underway with the project to convert our deposit servicing system by 2023. The total core replacement project spend amount is comprised of both capitalized amounts and amounts that are expensed as incurred. The useful life for most of the capitalized costs is 10 years. The following schedule shows the total amount of costs capitalized, less accumulated depreciation, by phase for the core replacement project.
Schedule 18
CAPITALIZED COSTS FOR THE CORE REPLACEMENT PROJECT
During 2020, we announced the construction of a 400,000 square-foot technology campus in Midvale, Utah, which will serve our entire organization. The campus is expected to be completed in mid-2022 and will be our primary technology and operations center, accommodating more than 2,000 employees at this location. The new campus will allow us to achieve substantial efficiencies by eliminating 11 smaller facilities totaling 520,000 square feet, reducing related occupancy costs by more than 20%. Vectra also announced in 2020 the construction of a new Denver, Colorado corporate center. The 127,000 square-foot, nine-story, mixed-use building is scheduled to open in late-2022 and will accommodate more than 200 employees.
Deposits
Deposits, both interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing, are a primary source of funding for us. Average total deposits increased by 16% during 2020, compared with 2019, with average interest-bearing deposits increasing by 10%, and average noninterest-bearing deposits increasing by 24%. The average interest rate paid for interest-bearing deposits was 50 bps lower in 2020, compared with 2019.
ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
Demand, savings, and money market deposits were 96% and 92% of total deposits at December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, total deposits included $813 million and $2.3 billion, respectively, of brokered deposits.
See Notes 12 and 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and “Liquidity Risk Management” on page 73 for additional information on funding and borrowed funds.
RISK MANAGEMENT
Since risk is inherent in substantially all of our operations, management of risk is an integral part of our operations and is also a key determinant of our overall performance. We utilize the three lines of defense approach to risk management with responsibilities for each line of defense defined in our Risk Management Framework. The first line of defense represents units and functions throughout the Bank engaged in activities related to revenue generation, expense reduction, operational support, and technology services. These units and functions are accountable for owning and managing the risks associated with these activities. The second line of defense represents functions responsible for independently assessing and overseeing risk management activities. The third line of defense is our internal audit function that provides independent assessment of the effectiveness of the first and second lines of defense.
The Board of Directors has established an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee, and a Risk Oversight Committee (“ROC”) that consist of appointed Board members who oversee our risk management processes. The ROC meets on a regular basis to monitor and review Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) activities. As required by its charter, the ROC performs oversight for various ERM activities and approves ERM policies and activities as detailed in the ROC charter.
Management applies various strategies to reduce the risks to which our operations are exposed, including credit risk, market and interest rate risk, liquidity risk, strategic and business risk, operational risk, technology risk, cyber risk, capital/financial reporting risk, legal/compliance risk (including regulatory risk), reputational risk, and other risk. These risks are overseen by various management committees, including an Enterprise Risk Management Committee, which is the central point for monitoring, reviewing, and managing enterprise risk.
Credit Risk Management
Credit risk is the possibility of loss from the failure of a borrower, guarantor, or another obligor to fully perform under the terms of a credit-related contract. Credit risk arises primarily from our lending activities, as well as from off-balance sheet credit instruments.
The Board of Directors, through the ROC, is responsible for approving the overall credit policies relating to the management of credit risk. The ROC also oversees and monitors adherence to key credit policies and the credit risk appetite as defined in the Risk Management Framework. Additionally, the Board has established the Credit Risk Committee, which is chaired by the Chief Credit Officer and includes members of management, and to which it has delegated the responsibility for managing credit risk and approving changes to credit policies.
Centralized oversight of credit risk is provided through credit policies, credit risk management, and credit examination functions. Our credit policies place emphasis on strong underwriting standards and early detection of potential problem credits in order to develop and implement action plans on a timely basis to mitigate any potential losses. These formal credit policies and procedures provide us with a framework for consistent underwriting and a basis for sound credit decisions at the local banking affiliate level. Credit examinations related to the ACL are reported to both the Audit Committee and the ROC.
Our credit risk management function is separate from the lending function and strengthens control over, and the independent evaluation of, credit activities. In addition, we have a well-defined set of standards for evaluating our loan portfolio, and we utilize a comprehensive loan risk-grading system to determine the risk potential in the portfolio. Furthermore, the internal credit examination department, which is independent of the lending function, periodically conducts examinations of our lending departments and credit activities. These examinations are
ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
designed to review credit quality, adequacy of documentation, appropriate loan risk-grading administration, and compliance with credit policies. New, expanded, or modified products and services, as well as new lines of business, are approved by the Change, Initiatives, and Technology Committee.
Our credit risk management strategy includes diversification of our loan portfolio. Our business activity is primarily with customers located within the geographic footprint of our banking affiliates. We attempt to avoid the risk of undue concentrations of credit in any particular industry, collateral type, location, or with any individual customer or counterparty. Due to the nature of our geographic footprint, we have certain significant concentrations, including CRE and oil and gas-related lending. We have adopted and adhere to concentration limits on leveraged lending, municipal lending, oil and gas-related lending, and various types of CRE lending, particularly construction and land development lending. All of these limits are continually monitored and revised as necessary.
As we continued to monitor our concentration risk, the composition of our loan portfolio changed slightly from the prior year. Total commercial loans were 57% and 52% of the total portfolio at December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively. CRE loans were 23% and 24% of the total portfolio at December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively. Consumer loans were 20% and 24% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively.

Select industries have elevated risk due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and as a result, we are more intensely managing our credit exposure to these industries, including ongoing detailed industry credit reviews during 2020. The following schedule shows $4.0 billion, or 8.4%, of our non-PPP loan balances in these industries as of December 31, 2020. Approximately 29% of these loans had payments deferred or their regularly scheduled payments otherwise modified during 2020. Of the $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2020, approximately 98% were secured by collateral, and 67% were secured by real estate collateral. The oil and gas-related industry has also been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. For more information see “Oil and Gas-Related Exposure” on page 58 of MD&A.

At December 31, 2020, our CRE construction and land development and term loan portfolios represented approximately 23% of the total loan portfolio. The majority of our CRE loans are secured by real estate, which is primarily located within our geographic footprint. Approximately 23% of the CRE loan portfolio matures in the next 12 months. Construction and land development loans generally mature in 18 to 36 months and contain full or partial recourse guarantee structures with one to five-year extension options or roll-to-perm options that often result in term debt. Term CRE loans generally mature within a three to seven-year period and consist of full, partial, and nonrecourse guarantee structures. Typical term CRE loan structures include annually-tested operating covenants that require loan rebalancing based on minimum debt service coverage, debt yield, or loan-to-value tests.
Approximately $156 million, or 7%, of the commercial construction and land development portfolio at December 31, 2020 consists of acquisition and development loans. Most of these acquisition and development loans are secured by specific retail, apartment, office, or other projects.
Underwriting on commercial properties is primarily based on the economic viability of the project with heavy consideration given to the creditworthiness and experience of the sponsor. We generally require that the owner’s equity be injected prior to bank advances. Re-margining requirements (required equity infusions upon a decline in value or cash flow of the collateral) are often included in the loan agreement along with guarantees of the sponsor. Recognizing that debt is paid via cash flow, the projected cash flows of the project are critical in the underwriting because these determine the ultimate value of the property and its ability to service debt. Therefore, in most projects (with the exception of multi-family and hospitality construction projects), we require substantial pre-leasing or leasing in our underwriting, and we generally require a minimum projected stabilized debt service coverage ratio of 1.20 or higher, depending on the project asset class.
Within the residential construction and development sector, many of the requirements previously mentioned, such as creditworthiness and experience of the developer, up-front injection of the developer’s equity, principal curtailment requirements, and the viability of the project are also important in underwriting a residential development loan. Significant consideration is given to the forecasted market acceptance of the product, location, strength of the developer, and the ability of the developer to stay within budget. Progress inspections by qualified independent inspectors are routinely performed before disbursements are made.
Real estate appraisals are ordered in accordance with regulatory guidelines and are validated independently of the loan officer and the borrower, generally by our internal appraisal review function, which is staffed by licensed appraisers. In some cases, reports from automated valuation services are used or internal evaluations are performed. A new appraisal or evaluation is required when a loan deteriorates to a certain level of credit weakness.
Advance rates (i.e., loan commitments) will vary based on the viability of the project and the creditworthiness of the sponsor, but our guidelines generally limit advances to 50% for raw land, 65% for land development, 65% for finished commercial lots, 75% for finished residential lots, 80% for pre-sold homes, 75% for models and homes not under contract, and 75% for commercial properties. Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis.
Loan agreements require regular financial information on the project and the sponsor in addition to lease schedules, rent rolls and, on construction projects, independent progress inspection reports. The receipt of this financial information is monitored, and calculations are made to determine adherence to the covenants set forth in the loan agreement.
The existence of a guarantee that improves the likelihood of repayment is taken into consideration when evaluating CRE loans for expected losses. If the support of the guarantor is quantifiable and documented, it is included in the potential cash flows and liquidity available for debt repayment, and our expected loss methodology takes this repayment source into consideration.
When we modify or extend a loan, we also give consideration to whether the borrower is in financial difficulty, and whether we have granted a concession. In determining if an interest rate concession has been granted, we consider whether the interest rate on the modified loan is equivalent to current market rates for new debt with similar risk characteristics. If the rate in the modification is less than current market rates, it may indicate that a concession was
ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
granted. However, if additional collateral is obtained, or if a guarantor exists who has the capacity and willingness to support the loan on an extended basis, we also consider the nature and amount of the additional collateral and guarantees in the ultimate determination of whether a concession has been granted.
In general, we obtain and consider updated financial information for the guarantor as part of our determination to extend a loan. The quality and frequency of financial reporting collected and analyzed varies depending on the contractual requirements for reporting, the size of the transaction, and the strength of the guarantor.
Complete underwriting of the guarantor includes, but is not limited to, an analysis of the guarantor’s current financial statements, leverage, liquidity, global cash flow, global debt service coverage, contingent liabilities, etc. The assessment also includes a qualitative analysis of the guarantor’s willingness to perform in the event of a problem and demonstrated history of performing in similar situations. Additional analysis may include personal financial statements, tax returns, liquidity (brokerage) confirmations, and other reports, as appropriate.
A qualitative assessment is performed on a case-by-case basis to evaluate the guarantor’s experience, performance track record, reputation, and willingness to work with us. We also utilize market information sources, rating, and scoring services in our assessment. This qualitative analysis coupled with a documented quantitative ability to support the loan may result in a higher-quality internal loan grade, which may reduce the level of allowance we estimate. Previous documentation of the guarantor’s financial ability to support the loan is discounted if there is any indication of a lack of willingness by the guarantor to support the loan.
In the event of default, we evaluate the pursuit of any and all appropriate potential sources of repayment, which may come from multiple sources, including the guarantee. A number of factors are considered when deciding whether or not to pursue a guarantor, including, but not limited to, the value and liquidity of other sources of repayment (collateral), the financial strength and liquidity of the guarantor, possible statutory limitations (e.g., single action rule on real estate) and the overall cost of pursuing a guarantee compared with the ultimate amount we may be able to recover. In other instances, the guarantor may voluntarily support a loan without any formal pursuit of remedies.
Consumer Loans
We have primarily been an originator of first and second mortgages, generally considered to be of prime quality. We generally hold variable-rate loans in our portfolio and sell “conforming” fixed-rate loans to third parties, including Federal National Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, for which we make representations and warranties that the loans meet certain underwriting and collateral documentation standards.
We are engaged in Home Equity Credit Line (“HECL”) lending. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, our HECL portfolio totaled $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively. The following schedule describes the composition of our HECL portfolio by lien status.
Schedule 26
HECL PORTFOLIO BY LIEN STATUS
At December 31, 2020, loans representing less than 1% of the outstanding balance in the HECL portfolio were estimated to have combined loan-to-value ratios (“CLTV”) above 100%. An estimated CLTV ratio is the ratio of our loan plus any prior lien amounts divided by the estimated current collateral-value. At origination, underwriting standards for the HECL portfolio generally include a maximum 80% CLTV with high credit scores at origination.
Approximately 91% of our HECL portfolio is still in the draw period, and approximately 19% of those loans are scheduled to begin amortizing within the next five years. We regularly analyze the risk of borrower default in the
ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
event of a loan becoming fully amortizing and the risk of higher interest rates. The analysis indicates that the risk of loss from this factor is minimal in the current economic environment. The ratio of net charge-offs for the trailing twelve months to average balances at year-end 2020 and 2019 was (0.01)% and 0.02%, respectively. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the credit quality of this portfolio.
Nonperforming Assets
Nonperforming assets as a percentage of loans and leases and other real estate owned (“OREO”) increased to 0.69% at December 31, 2020, compared with 0.51% at December 31, 2019.
Total nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2020 increased to $367 million from $243 million at December 31, 2019, primarily in the 1-4 family residential mortgage and commercial and industrial loan portfolios.
The balance of nonaccrual loans can decrease due to paydowns, charge-offs, and the return of loans to accrual status under certain conditions. If a nonaccrual loan is refinanced or restructured, the new note is immediately placed on nonaccrual. If a restructured loan performs under the new terms for at least a period of six months, the loan can be considered for return to accrual status. See “Restructured Loans” and Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on nonaccrual loans.

The following schedule presents our nonperforming assets:
Schedule 27

Restructured Loans
Troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) are loans that have been modified to accommodate a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulties, and for whom we have granted a concession that we would not otherwise consider. TDRs increased $158 million, or 103%, during 2020. Commercial and commercial real estate loans may be modified to provide the borrower temporary or permanent relief from the original contractual terms of the loan, to provide more time to complete the project, to achieve a higher lease-up percentage, to sell the property, or for other reasons. Consumer loan TDRs represent loan modifications in which a concession has been granted to the borrower who is unable to refinance the loan with another lender, or who is experiencing economic hardship. Such consumer loan TDRs may include residential mortgage loans and home equity loans.
ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
If the restructured loan performs for at least six months according to the modified terms, and an analysis of the customer’s financial condition indicates that we are reasonably assured of repayment of the modified principal and interest, the loan may be returned to accrual status. The borrower’s payment performance prior to and following the restructuring is taken into account to determine whether a loan is returned to accrual status.
Schedule 28
ACCRUING AND NONACCRUING TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURED LOANS
In the periods following the calendar year in which a loan was restructured, a loan may no longer be reported as a TDR if it is on accrual, is in compliance with its modified terms, and yields a market rate (as determined and documented at the time of the modification or restructure). See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding TDRs.
Schedule 29
TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURED LOANS ROLLFORWARD
COVID-19 Modifications and Deferrals
We developed various debt relief programs for our borrowers who have been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. These programs primarily began in the second quarter of 2020 and generally consisted of short-term, or 90-day, principal and interest loan payment deferrals. Consistent with accounting and regulatory guidance, loan modifications provided to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties exclusively related to the COVID-19 pandemic, in which we provided these short-term modifications or payment deferrals, are not classified as TDRs. Other loan modifications above and beyond these short-term modifications or payment deferrals are assessed for TDR classification.
During 2020, we provided payment deferrals or other payment modifications related to COVID-19 hardships with respect to approximately $4.3 billion of total loan balances. As of December 31, 2020, $3.8 billion was outstanding, of which approximately $42 million, or 1.1%, was 90 days or more past due.
Allowance for Credit Losses
The ACL includes the ALLL and the RULC. For the year 2020, the ACL represented our estimate of current expected credit losses over the contractual term of the loan and lease portfolio and unfunded lending commitments as of the balance sheet date. We determined our ACL as the best estimate within a range of estimated current expected losses over the contractual remaining life of each loan. For periods prior to 2020, the ACL represented management’s estimate of probable losses believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio at that time, and the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance was based on periodic evaluations of the portfolios. To determine the adequacy of the allowance, our loan and lease portfolio is segmented based on loan type.
ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
The following schedule shows the changes in the allowance for credit losses and a summary of credit loss experience:
Schedule 30
SUMMARY OF CREDIT LOSS EXPERIENCE
1 Beginning balances at January 1, 2020 for the allowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments do not agree to their respective ending balances at December 31, 2019 because of the adoption of the CECL accounting standard; the allowance for loan losses was adjusted to $497 million, the reserve for unfunded lending commitments was adjusted to $29 million on January 1, 2020.
2 The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans and leases (excluding PPP loans), on December 31, 2020 was 0.22%.
3 The ratio of allowance for credit losses to net loans and leases (excluding PPP loans), on December 31, 2020 was 1.74%.
ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
Schedule 31
ALLOCATION OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES
The total ACL increased during 2020, primarily as a result of the economic stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and stress in the oil and gas-related industry. On January 1, 2020, we adopted the CECL standard. Due to the adoption of the standard, the ACL is not comparable to prior periods.
The RULC represents a reserve for potential losses associated with off-balance sheet commitments and standby letters of credit. The reserve is separately shown in the balance sheet and any related increases or decreases in the reserve are shown separately in the statement of income. At December 31, 2020, the reserve decreased by $1 million, compared with December 31, 2019.
See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the ACL and credit trends experienced in each portfolio segment.
Interest Rate and Market Risk Management
Interest rate and market risk are managed centrally. Interest rate risk is the potential for reduced net interest income and other rate-sensitive income resulting from adverse changes in the level of interest rates. Market risk is the potential for loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of fixed-income securities, equity securities, other earning assets, and derivative financial instruments as a result of changes in interest rates or other factors. As a financial institution that engages in transactions involving an array of financial products, we are exposed to both interest rate risk and market risk.
Our Board of Directors approves the overall policies relating to the management of our financial risk, including interest rate and market risk management. The Board has established the Asset/Liability Committee (“ALCO”) consisting of members of management, to which it has delegated the responsibility of managing our interest rate and market risk. ALCO establishes and periodically revises policy limits and reviews with the ROC the limits and limit exceptions reported by management.
Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is one of the most significant risks to which we are regularly exposed. In general, our goal in managing interest rate risk is to manage balance sheet sensitivity to reduce net income volatility due to changes in interest rates.
While over the course of the last several years, we have actively reduced the level of asset sensitivity through interest rate swap hedges and the purchase of short-to-medium duration agency pass-through securities, the decline in interest rates has led to lower deposit rate sensitivity and combined with strong deposit growth our asset sensitivity has increased. Due to our concentration in noninterest-bearing deposits as well as the low interest rates paid on our interest-bearing deposits, there is little room to reduce deposit costs.
At December 31, 2019, we had $1.5 billion of fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps hedging long-term debt (effectively converting the fixed-rate debt into floating-rate debt). In late March 2020, we terminated $1.0 billion of swaps (i.e., two $500 million swaps with maturities in August 2021 and February 2022) with a combined fair value of $36 million that adjusted the carrying value of the debt by the same amount. The basis adjustment will be
ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
amortized as an adjustment to interest expense through the maturity of the debt, thereby reducing the effective interest rate. $429 million of the 2021 and 2022 debt was subsequently retired, which accelerated the amortization for the portion of the swaps hedging the retired debt. For more information on derivatives designated as qualifying hedges, see Note 7 - Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.
The following schedule presents all derivatives utilized in our asset-liability management (“ALM”) activities that are designated in qualifying hedging relationships as defined by GAAP as of December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019. The schedule includes the notional amount, fair value, and the weighted-average receive-fixed rate for each category of interest rate derivatives. The schedule for the current year has cash flow hedges shown by maturity for the next five years. Fair value hedges are shown by maturity every five to 10 years, while the previous year’s schedule has all categories shown by maturity for the next five years.

1 Fair values shown in the schedule above are presented net and exclude the effects of collateral settlements for centrally cleared derivatives.
2 Fair value asset hedges consist of pay-fixed swaps hedging AFS fixed-rate securities executed during the third quarter of 2020.
3 Fair value hedges of both our fixed rate debt and AFS securities are longer dated than traditional cash flow hedges. Consequently, the maturity schedule above aggregates trades maturing in each column to include all trades maturing after the end of year of the previous column and prior to or during the year of the column the amounts are contained within.
Interest Rate Risk Measurement
We monitor interest rate risk through the use of two complementary measurement methods: net interest income simulation, or Earnings at Risk (“EaR”), and Economic Value of Equity at Risk (“EVE”). EaR analyzes the expected change in near-term (one year) net interest income in response to changes in interest rates. In the EVE method, we measure the expected changes in the fair value of equity in response to changes in interest rates.
EaR is an estimate of the change in total net interest income that would be recognized under different interest rate environments over a one-year period. This simulated impact to net interest income due to a change in rates uses as its base a modeled net interest income that is not necessarily the same as the most recent quarter’s or year’s reported net interest income. Rather, EaR employs estimated net interest income under an unchanged interest rate scenario as the basis for comparison. The EaR process then simulates changes to the base net interest income under several interest rate scenarios, including parallel and nonparallel interest rate shifts across the yield curve, taking into account deposit repricing assumptions and estimates of the possible exercise of embedded options within the portfolio (e.g., a borrower’s ability to refinance a loan under a lower-rate environment). The EaR model does not contemplate changes in fee income that are amortized into interest income (e.g., premiums, discounts, origination points and costs, etc.). Our policy contains a trigger for a 10% decline in rate-sensitive income as well as a risk capacity of a 13% decline if rates were to immediately rise or fall in parallel by 200 bps. Exceptions to the EaR limits are subject to notification and approval by the ROC.
EVE is calculated as the fair value of all assets minus the fair value of liabilities. We measure changes in the dollar amount of EVE for parallel shifts in interest rates. Due to embedded optionality and asymmetric rate risk, changes in EVE can be useful in quantifying risks not apparent for small rate changes. Examples of such risks may include out-of-the-money interest rate caps (or limits) on loans, which have little effect under small rate movements but may become important if large rate changes were to occur, or substantial prepayment deceleration for low-rate mortgages in a higher-rate environment. Our policy contains a trigger for an 8% decline in EVE as well as a risk capacity of a 10% decline if rates were to immediately rise or fall in parallel by 200 bps. Exceptions to the EVE limits are subject to notification and approval by the ROC.
ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
Estimating the impact on net interest income and EVE requires that we assess a number of variables and make various assumptions in managing our exposure to changes in interest rates. The assessments address deposit withdrawals and deposit product migration (e.g., customers moving money from checking accounts to certificates of deposit), competitive pricing (e.g., existing loans and deposits are assumed to roll into new loans and deposits at similar spreads relative to benchmark interest rates), loan and security prepayments, and the effects of other similar embedded options. As a result of uncertainty about the maturity and repricing characteristics of both deposits and loans, we also calculate the sensitivity of EaR and EVE results to key assumptions. As most of our liabilities are comprised of indeterminate maturity and managed rate deposits, such as checking, savings, and money market accounts, the modeled results are highly sensitive to the assumptions used for these deposits, and also to prepayment assumptions used for loans with prepayment options. We use historical regression analysis as a guide for setting such assumptions; however, due to the current low interest rate environment, which has little historical precedent, estimated deposit behavior may not reflect actual future results. Additionally, competition for funding in the marketplace has and may again result in changes to deposit pricing on interest-bearing accounts that are greater or less than changes in benchmark interest rates such as LIBOR or the federal funds rate.
Under most rising interest rate scenarios, we would expect some customers to move balances from demand deposits to interest-bearing accounts such as money market, savings, or certificates of deposit. The models are particularly sensitive to the assumption about the rate of such migration.
In addition, we assume a correlation, often referred to as a “deposit beta,” with respect to interest-bearing deposits, wherein the rates paid to customers change at a different pace when compared with changes in average benchmark interest rates. Generally, certificates of deposit are assumed to have a high correlation rate, while interest-on-checking accounts are assumed to have a lower correlation rate. Actual results may differ materially due to factors including the shape of the yield curve, competitive pricing, money supply, our credit worthiness, and so forth; however, we use our historical experience as well as industry data to inform our assumptions.
The aforementioned migration and correlation assumptions result in deposit durations presented in the following schedule.
Schedule 33
DEPOSIT ASSUMPTIONS
As of the dates indicated and incorporating the assumptions previously described, the following schedule shows EaR, or percentage change in net interest income, based on a static balance sheet size, in the first year after the interest rate change if interest rates were to sustain immediate parallel changes ranging from -100 bps to +300 bps.
Schedule 34
INCOME SIMULATION - CHANGE IN NET INTEREST INCOME
1 Assumes rates cannot go below zero in the negative rate shift.
For non-maturity, interest-bearing deposits, the weighted average modeled beta is 25%. If the weighted average deposit beta were to increase 6%, the EaR in the +100 bps rate shock would change from 9.2% to 8.4%.
ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
For comparative purposes, the December 31, 2019, measures are presented in the following schedule.
1 Assumes rates cannot go below zero in the negative rate shift.
The asset sensitivity as measured by EaR increased since December 31, 2019, primarily due to lower assumed rate sensitivity of interest-bearing deposits and an increase in noninterest-bearing deposits.
The EaR analysis focuses on parallel rate shocks across the term structure of rates. The yield curve typically does not move in a parallel manner. If we consider a flattening rate shock where the short-term rate moves +200 bps, but the 10-year rate only moves +30 bps, the increase in EaR is 14% less over 24 months, compared with the parallel +200 bps rate shock.
As of the dates indicated, the following schedule shows our estimated percentage change in EVE under parallel interest rate changes ranging from -100 bps to +300 bps. For these parallel changes we assumed interest rates will not decline below 0%. For non-maturity, interest-bearing deposits, the weighted average modeled beta is 25%. If the weighted average deposit beta were to increase 6% it would change the EVE in the +100 bps rate shock from 12.0% to 11.6%. In the -100 bps rate shock, the EVE would increase due to the fact that we cap the value of our indeterminate deposits at their par value, or equivalently we assume no premium would be required to dispose of these liabilities given that depositors could be repaid at par. Since our assets increase in value as rates fall and the majority of our liabilities are indeterminate deposits, EVE increases disproportionately.
Schedule 35
CHANGES IN ECONOMIC VALUE OF EQUITY

1 Assumes rates cannot go below zero in the negative rate shift.
Our focus on business banking also plays a significant role in determining the nature of our asset-liability management posture. At December 31, 2020, $22 billion of our commercial lending and CRE loan balances were scheduled to reprice in the next six months. Of these variable-rate loans, approximately 98% are tied to either the prime rate or LIBOR. For these variable-rate loans, we have executed $3.2 billion of cash flow hedges by receiving fixed rates on interest rate swaps or through purchased interest rate floors. Additionally, asset sensitivity is reduced due to $4 billion of variable-rate loans being priced at floored rates at December 31, 2020, which were above the “index plus spread” rate by an average of 66 bps. At December 31, 2020, we also had $3 billion of variable-rate consumer loans scheduled to reprice in the next six months. Of these variable-rate consumer loans, approximately $1 billion were priced at floored rates, which were above the “index plus spread” rate by an average of 35 bps. See Notes 3 and 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding derivative instruments.
LIBOR Exposure
In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority, the authority regulating LIBOR, along with various other regulatory bodies, announced that LIBOR would likely be discontinued at the end of 2021. Subsequent to that announcement,
ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
in November 2020, the Financial Conduct Authority announced that many tenors of LIBOR would continue to be published through June of 2023. Bank regulators including the OCC, have instructed banks to discontinue new originations referencing LIBOR as soon as possible, but no later than December 2021. To facilitate the transition process, we have instituted an enterprise-wide program to identify, assess, and monitor risks associated with the expected discontinuance or unavailability of LIBOR, which includes active engagement with industry working groups and regulators. This program includes active involvement of senior management with regular engagement from the Enterprise Risk Management Committee. The program is structured with an emphasis towards minimizing client and internal business operational impacts, providing transparency in reporting, ensuring consistency, and creating a central governance model that aligns with FASB, IRS, and other regulatory guidance.
Our focus has centered around operational readiness, as well as the installation of processes and systems to validate that contract risk is clearly identified and understood. New originations and any modifications or renewals of LIBOR-based contracts contain fallback language to assist in an orderly transition upon selection of an alternative reference rate. For the rest of our contracts that have a duration beyond December 31, 2021 and that reference LIBOR, all fallback provisions and variations are currently being identified and sorted into classifications based upon those provisions. Upon classification, the contracts will be remediated and monitored through defined workflow paths. The goal is to clearly understand fallback provisions by loan and to have the entire portfolio in a state that simplifies ultimate conversion to a replacement index.
We have a significant number of assets and liabilities that reference LIBOR such as commercial loans, commercial real estate term loans, adjustable-rate mortgage loans, unfunded loan commitments, derivatives, and debt securities. As of December 31, 2020, we had more than $38 billion of assets that reference LIBOR, consisting mostly of commercial loans. The amount of borrowed funds that reference LIBOR as of December 31, 2020 was less than $1 billion. These amounts exclude derivative assets and liabilities on our balance sheet. As of December 31, 2020, the notional amount of our LIBOR-referenced interest rate derivative contracts was more than $16 billion, of which more than $10 billion related to contracts with central counterparty clearinghouses. Each of the LIBOR-referenced amounts described above will vary in future periods as current contracts expire with potential replacement contracts using either LIBOR with a fallback provision or an alternative reference rate. In considering a replacement rate for LIBOR indices used as reference rates in lending agreements, the ideal rate would adjust for changes in the credit environment and have a term structure. By contrast, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) is a risk-free overnight funding rate. We, along with other industry participants, continue to explore alternative indices other than SOFR which could be utilized as a replacement for LIBOR.
Market Risk - Fixed Income
We engage in the underwriting and trading of municipal securities. This trading activity exposes us to a risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the prices of these fixed-income securities.
At December 31, 2020, we had a relatively small amount, $266 million, of trading assets and $61 million of securities sold, not yet purchased, compared with $182 million and $66 million, respectively, at December 31, 2019.
We are exposed to market risk through changes in fair value. We are also exposed to market risk for interest rate swaps used to hedge interest rate risk. Changes in the fair value of AFS securities and in interest rate swaps that qualify as cash flow hedges are included in AOCI for each financial reporting period. During 2020, the after-tax change in AOCI attributable to AFS securities increased by $229 million, due largely to changes in the interest rate environment, compared with a $257 million increase in the same prior year period.
Market Risk - Equity Investments
Through our equity investment activities, we own equity securities that are publicly traded. In addition, we own equity securities in companies and governmental entities, e.g., Federal Reserve Bank and an FHLB, that are not publicly traded. The accounting for equity investments may use the cost, fair value, equity, or full consolidation methods of accounting, depending on our ownership position and degree of involvement in influencing the investees’ affairs. Regardless of the accounting method, the value of our investment is subject to fluctuation. Because the fair value of these securities may fall below our investment costs, we are exposed to the possibility of
ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
loss. Equity investments in private and public companies are approved, monitored, and evaluated by our Equity Investments Committee consisting of members of management.
We hold both direct and indirect investments in predominantly pre-public companies, primarily through various SBIC venture capital funds. Our equity exposure to these investments was approximately $135 million and $154 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. On occasion, some of the companies within our SBIC investments may issue an initial public offering. In this case, the fund is generally subject to a lockout period before liquidating the investment, which can introduce additional market risk.
Liquidity Risk Management
Overview
Liquidity refers to our capacity to meet our cash and collateral obligations and to manage both expected and unexpected cash flows without adversely impacting our operations or financial strength. Sources of liquidity include both traditional forms of funding, such as deposits, borrowings, and equity and unencumbered assets, such as marketable loans and securities.
Since liquidity risk is closely linked to both credit risk and market risk, many of the previously described risk control mechanisms also apply to the monitoring and management of liquidity risk. We manage our liquidity to provide adequate funds for our customers’ credit needs, capital plan actions, anticipated financial and contractual obligations, which include withdrawals by depositors, debt and capital service requirements, and lease obligations.
Overseeing liquidity management is the responsibility of ALCO, which implements a Board-approved corporate Liquidity and Funding Policy. This policy addresses monitoring and maintaining adequate liquidity, diversifying funding positions, and anticipating future funding needs. The policy also includes liquidity ratio guidelines, such as a 30-day liquidity coverage ratio, that are used to monitor our liquidity positions as well as our various stress test and liquid asset measurements. We perform liquidity stress tests and assess our portfolio of highly liquid assets (sufficient to cover 30-day funding needs under stress scenarios). At December 31, 2020, our investment securities portfolio of $16.6 billion and cash and money market investments of $7.4 billion collectively comprised 29% of total assets.
The management of liquidity and funding is performed by our Treasury department under the direction of the Corporate Treasurer, with oversight by ALCO. The Treasurer is responsible for recommending changes to existing funding plans and our Liquidity Policy. These recommendations must be submitted for approval to ALCO, and changes to the Policy also must be approved by the ERMC and the Board of Directors. We have adopted policy limits that govern liquidity risk. The policy requires us to maintain a buffer of highly liquid assets sufficient to cover cash outflows in the event of a severe liquidity crisis. Throughout 2020 and as of December 31, 2020, we complied with this policy.
Liquidity Regulation
Upon passage of the Crapo Bill, we are no longer subject to the enhanced prudential standards for liquidity management (Reg. YY). However, we continue to perform liquidity stress tests and assess our portfolio of highly liquid assets (sufficient to cover 30-day funding needs under the stress scenarios). Although we are no longer subject to the regulations of the Final LCR Rule, we exceed the regulatory requirements that mandate a buffer of securities and other liquid assets to cover 70% of 30-day cash outflows under the assumptions mandated therein.
Liquidity Management Actions
Our consolidated cash, interest-bearing deposits held as investments, and security resell agreements were $7.3 billion at December 31, 2020, compared with $1.8 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $5.5 billion. During 2020, the primary sources of cash were from an increase in deposits and net cash provided by operating activities. Uses of cash during the same period were primarily from (1) loan originations and purchases, (2) an increase in investment securities, (3) a decrease in short-term borrowings, (4) repayment of long-term debt, (5) dividends on common and preferred stock, and (6) repurchases of our common stock.
ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
Total deposits were $69.7 billion at December 31, 2020, compared with $57.1 billion at December 31, 2019. The $12.6 billion increase during 2020 was a result of an $8.9 billion and $5.8 billion increase in noninterest-bearing demand deposits and savings and money market deposits, respectively, partially offset by a $2.1 billion decrease in time deposits. The funding of PPP loan proceeds into customer deposit accounts contributed meaningfully to overall deposit growth. Our core deposits, consisting of noninterest-bearing demand deposits, savings and money market deposits, and time deposits under $250,000, were $68.2 billion at December 31, 2020, compared with $53.9 billion at December 31, 2019.
At December 31, 2020, maturities of our long-term senior and subordinated debt ranged from August 2021 to October 2029.
Our cash payments for interest, reflected in operating expenses, decreased to $195 million during 2020, from $401 million during 2019, primarily due to lower interest rates paid on deposits and borrowed funds and lower borrowed funds. Additionally, we paid approximately $259 million of dividends on preferred and common stock during 2020, compared with $260 million during 2019. Dividends paid per common share were $1.36 in 2020 compared to $1.28 in 2019. In February 2021, the Board approved a quarterly common dividend of $0.34 per share.
General financial market and economic conditions impact our access to and cost of external financing. Access to funding markets is also directly affected by the credit ratings received from various rating agencies. The ratings not only influence the costs associated with borrowings, but can also influence the sources of the borrowings. All of the credit rating agencies rate our debt at an investment-grade level. Although our credit ratings did not change during 2020, Fitch and S&P revised their outlook from Stable to Negative due to disruption in economic activity and financial markets from the COVID-19 pandemic and our oil and gas exposure. Our credit ratings and outlooks are presented in the following schedule.
Schedule 36
CREDIT RATINGS
The FHLB system and Federal Reserve Banks have been and are a source of back-up liquidity and a significant source of funding. Zions Bancorporation, N.A., is a member of the FHLB of Des Moines. The FHLB allows member banks to borrow against their eligible loans and securities to satisfy liquidity and funding requirements. We are required to invest in FHLB and Federal Reserve stock to maintain our borrowing capacity.
The amount available for additional FHLB and Federal Reserve borrowings was approximately $17.1 billion at December 31, 2020, compared with $15.3 billion at December 31, 2019. Loans with a carrying value of approximately $24.7 billion at December 31, 2020 have been pledged at the FHLB of Des Moines and the Federal Reserve as collateral for current and potential borrowings, compared with $21.5 million at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2020, we had no FHLB or Federal Reserve borrowings outstanding, compared with $1.0 billion of short-term FHLB borrowings outstanding and no long-term FHLB or Federal Reserve borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2020, our total investment in FHLB and Federal Reserve stock was $11 million and $98 million, respectively, compared with $50 million and $107 million at December 31, 2019.
During 2020, the Federal Reserve established the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (“PPPLF”). Under the PPPLF, we will be able to obtain term financing for PPP loans by pledging them to the FRB prior to March 31, 2021. In deciding whether to utilize the PPPLF as a funding source, we will take into account our current funding position and our expectation of early PPP redemption through loan forgiveness. Although the PPPLF will
ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
cease after March 31, 2021, we will also have the ability to increase our borrowing capacity at the FHLB of Des Moines by pledging the PPP loans. The ability to pledge PPP loans to the FHLB of Des Moines does not have a defined expiry, and funding terms may vary.
Our AFS investment securities are primarily held as a source of contingent liquidity. We target securities that can be easily turned into cash through sale or repurchase agreements and whose value remains relatively stable during market disruptions. We regularly manage our short-term funding needs through secured borrowing with the securities pledged as collateral. Interest rate risk management is another consideration for selection of investment securities. Our AFS securities balances increased by $2.0 billion during 2020.
Our loan-to-total deposit ratio was 77% at December 31, 2020, compared with 85% at December 31, 2019, reflecting higher deposit growth in 2020 relative to loan growth.
If our operating, investing, and deposit activities do not provide the loan funding required, we may rely on more expensive wholesale funding for a portion of our loan growth. Our use of borrowed funds (both short- and long-term) decreased by $868 million during 2020 as our deposit growth more than adequately funded our loan growth during the period. Due to the increase in average deposits of $8.6 billion during 2020 and with average loans only increasing $4.7 billion, the surplus cash went to paying down borrowings and increasing short-term investments, which increased $5.5 billion from December 31, 2019.
We may also, from time to time, issue additional preferred stock, senior or subordinated notes or other forms of capital or debt instruments, depending on our capital, funding, asset-liability management or other needs as market conditions warrant and subject to any required regulatory approvals. Management believes that the sources of available liquidity are adequate to meet all reasonably foreseeable short-term and intermediate-term demands.
Contractual Obligations
Schedule 37 summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2020.
Schedule 37
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
1 Indeterminable maturity deposits include noninterest-bearing demand, savings and money market.
2 Commitments to make venture and other noninterest-bearing investments do not have defined maturity dates. They are due upon demand and may be drawn immediately, or as late as after five years. Therefore, these commitments are shown as having indeterminable maturities.
3 The maturities on long-term debt do not include the associated hedges.
In addition to the commitments specifically noted in Schedule 37, we enter into a number of contractual commitments in the ordinary course of business. These include software licensing and
ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
maintenance, telecommunications services, facilities maintenance and equipment servicing, supplies purchasing, and other goods and services used in the operation of our business. Some of these contracts are renewable or cancellable at least annually, and in certain cases, to secure favorable pricing concessions, we have committed to contracts that may extend to several years.
We also enter into derivative contracts under which we are required either to receive or pay cash, depending on changes in interest rates. These contracts are carried at fair value on the balance sheet with the fair value representing the net present value of the expected future cash receipts and payments based on market rates of interest. The fair value of the contracts changes daily as interest rates change. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on derivative contracts.
Operational, Technology, and Cyber Risk Management
Operational risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human errors or misconduct, or adverse external events. In our ongoing efforts to identify and manage operational risk, we have an ERM department whose responsibility is to help employees, management and the Board of Directors to assess, understand, measure, manage, and monitor risk in accordance with our Risk Management Framework. We have documented both controls and the Control Self-Assessment related to financial reporting under the 2013 framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) and the FDICIA.
To manage and minimize our operational risk, we have in place transactional documentation requirements; systems and procedures to monitor transactions and positions; systems and procedures to detect and mitigate attempts to commit fraud, penetrate our systems or telecommunications, access customer data, and/or deny normal access to those systems to our legitimate customers; regulatory compliance reviews; and periodic reviews by our Compliance Risk Management, Internal Audit and Credit Examination departments. Reconciliation procedures have been established to ensure that data processing systems consistently and accurately capture critical data. In addition, the Data Governance department has key governance surrounding data integrity and availability oversight. Further, we have key programs and procedures to maintain contingency and business continuity plans for operational support in the event of natural or other disasters. We also mitigate certain operational risks through the purchase of insurance, including errors and omissions and professional liability insurance.
We continually strive to improve our oversight of operational risk, including enhancement of risk identification, risk and control self-assessments, and anti-fraud measures, which are reported on a regular basis to enterprise management committees. The Operational Risk Committee reports to the ERMC, which reports to the ROC. Key measures have been established in line with our Risk Management Framework to increase oversight by ERM and Operational Risk Management through the strengthening of new initiative reviews, and enhancements to Enterprise Supply Chain and Vendor Risk Management. We also continue to enhance and strengthen the Enterprise Business Continuity program, Enterprise Security program, and Enterprise Incident Management reporting.
Significant enhancements have also been made to governance, technology, and reporting, including the establishment of Policy and Committee Governance programs, the implementation of a governance, risk and control solution, and the creation of an Enterprise Risk Profile and Operational Risk Profile. In addition, our Enterprise Exam Management department has standardized our response and reporting, and increased our effectiveness and efficiencies with regulatory examination, communications and issues management.
We continue to make significant investments to mature our technology capabilities and to eliminate the risk from outdated and unsupported technologies (technology debt). This includes updating core banking systems as well as introducing new digital customer-facing capabilities. Technology projects, initiatives and operations are governed by a change management framework that assesses the activities and risk within our business processes to limit disruption and resource constraints. Change initiative status and risks are reviewed regularly by the Change, Initiatives, and Technology Committee that includes, among other senior executives, the CEO, CFO, COO and CRO. Initiative risk and change impact from the framework are reported to the ROC.
ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
Technology governance is also in place at the operational level within our Enterprise and Technology Operations (ETO) division to help ensure safety, soundness, operational resiliency, and compliance with our cybersecurity requirements. ETO management teams participate in enterprise architecture review boards and technology risk councils to address such issues as enterprise standards compliance and strategic alignment, cyber vulnerability management, end-of-life, audit, risk and compliance issue management, and asset management. Thresholds are defined to escalate risks in these areas to the attention of the ORC and ERMC committees as appropriate.
The number and sophistication of attempts to disrupt or penetrate our systems - sometimes referred to as hacking, cyber fraud, cyberattacks, or other similar names - continues to grow. To combat the ever-increasing sophistication of cyberattacks, we are continuously improving methods for detecting and preventing attacks. In addition, we have implemented policies and procedures and developed specific training for our employees and elevated our oversight and internal reporting to the Board and respective committees. Further, we regularly engage independent third-party cyber experts to test for vulnerabilities in our environment. We also conduct our own internal simulations and tabletop exercises as well as participate in financial sector-specific exercises. We have engaged consultants at both the strategic level and at the technology implementation level to assist us in better managing this critical risk.
While we have significant internal resources, policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, we have experienced security breaches due to cyberattacks in the past and there can be no assurance that any such failure, interruption or security breach will not occur in the future, or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. It is impossible to determine the potential effects of these events with any certainty, but any such breach could result in material adverse consequences for us and our customers.
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
Overview
The Board of Directors is responsible for approving the policies associated with capital management. The Board has established the Capital Management Committee (“CMC”), chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and consisting of members of management, whose primary responsibility is to recommend and administer the approved capital policies that govern our capital management. Other major CMC responsibilities include:
•Setting overall capital targets within the Board-approved Capital Policy, monitoring performance compared with our Capital Policy limits, and recommending changes to capital including dividends, common stock issuances and repurchases, subordinated debt, and changes in major strategies to maintain ourselves at well-capitalized levels;
•Maintaining an adequate capital cushion to withstand adverse stress events while continuing to meet the borrowing needs of our customers, and to provide reasonable assurance of continued access to wholesale funding, consistent with fiduciary responsibilities to depositors and bondholders; and
•Reviewing our agency ratings.
We believe that a strong capital position is vital to continued profitability and to promoting depositor and investor confidence. We have a fundamental financial objective to consistently improve risk-adjusted returns on our shareholders’ capital. Specifically, it is our policy to:
•Maintain sufficient capital to support current needs;
•Maintain an adequate capital cushion to withstand adverse stress events while continuing to meet borrowing needs of our customers; and
•Meet fiduciary responsibilities to depositors and bondholders while managing capital distributions to shareholders through dividends and repurchases of common stock so as to be consistent with 12 U.S.C. § 56 and § 60.
ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
Our primary regulator is the OCC. We continue to be subject to examinations by the CFPB with respect to consumer financial regulations. Under the National Bank Act and OCC regulations, certain capital transactions may be subject to the approval of the OCC.
We continue to utilize stress testing as the primary mechanism to inform our decisions on the appropriate level of capital and capital actions, based upon actual and hypothetically stressed economic conditions. The results of our internal stress tests are publicly available on our website. The timing and amount of capital actions are subject to various factors, including our financial performance, business needs, prevailing and anticipated economic conditions, and OCC approval.
Capital Management Actions
Weighted average diluted shares outstanding decreased by 20.9 million from 2019 to 2020, respectively. The decrease from 2019 was primarily due to the expiration of out-of-the money common stock warrants and a lower average Bank common share price. On May 22, 2020, 29.2 million common stock warrants (NASDAQ: ZIONW) expired. Each common stock warrant was convertible into 1.10 shares at an exercise price of $33.31.
Total shareholders’ equity has increased moderately and was $7.9 billion at December 31, 2020, compared with $7.4 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase during 2020 was primarily due to net income of $539 million and a $229 million after-tax increase in unrealized gains on AFS securities, which was due largely to changes in the interest rate environment. The increase was partially offset by $259 million of common and preferred stock dividends paid and $75 million of repurchases of our common stock from our publicly announced plans. Common stock and additional paid-in capital decreased $49 million, or 2%, during 2020, primarily due to common stock repurchases.
During 2020, we repurchased 1.7 million shares of common stock from our publicly announced plans, or 1%, of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2019, for $75 million at an average price of $45.02 per share. Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, we suspended share repurchase activity due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. In February 2021, we repurchased 1.0 million shares of common stock from our publicly announced plans with a fair value of $50 million at an average price of $49.78. We expect to maintain the appropriate amount of capital to cover inherent risk. The timing and amount of any additional common stock repurchases will be subject to various factors, including our financial performance, business needs, prevailing economic conditions, stress testing, and OCC approval. The magnitude, timing, and form of capital return will be determined by the Board. Shares may be repurchased occasionally in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions, utilizing Rule 10b5-1 plans or otherwise.
Under the OCC’s “Earnings Limitation Rule,” our dividend payments are restricted to an amount equal to the sum of the total of (1) our net income for that year, and (2) retained earnings for the preceding two years, unless the OCC approves the declaration and payment of dividends in excess of such amount. As of January 1, 2021, we had $761 million of retained net profits available for distribution.
We paid common dividends of $225 million during 2020, compared with $226 million during 2019. In February 2021, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.34 per common share payable on February 25, 2021, to shareholders of record on February 18, 2021. We also paid dividends on preferred stock of $34 million for both 2020 and 2019.
CECL
We elected to phase-in the regulatory capital effects of the adoption of CECL, as allowed by federal bank agencies, and as described in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2020, the application of these provisions improved our CET1, Tier 1 risk-based and Total risk-based capital ratios by 10 bps each, and our Tier 1 leverage capital ratio by 6 bps.
Basel III
We are subject to Basel III capital requirements to maintain adequate levels of capital as measured by several regulatory capital ratios. We met all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III capital rules as of December
ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
31, 2020. The following schedule presents our capital and performance ratios as of December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. The Supervision and Regulation section of the 2020 Form 10-K on page 5 and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contain more detail information about Basel III capital requirements and our compliance.
Schedule 38
CAPITAL AND PERFORMANCE RATIOS
1 See “GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations” on page 28 for more information regarding these ratios.
2 Based on the applicable phase-in periods.
At December 31, 2020, Basel III regulatory tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital was $6.6 billion and $7.9 billion, respectively, compared with $6.3 billion and $7.4 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2019.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES
Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contains a summary of our significant accounting policies. Described below are certain significant accounting policies that we consider critical to our financial statements. These critical accounting policies were selected because the amounts affected by them are significant to the financial statements. Any changes to these amounts, including changes in estimates, may also be significant to the financial statements. We believe that an understanding of these policies, along with the related estimates we are required to make in recording our financial transactions, is important to have a complete picture of our financial condition. In addition, in arriving at these estimates, we are required to make complex and subjective judgments, many of which include a high degree of uncertainty. The following discussion of these critical accounting policies includes the significant estimates related to these policies. We have discussed each of these accounting policies and related estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
We have included, where applicable in this document, sensitivity schedules and other examples to demonstrate the impact of the changes in estimates made for various financial transactions. The sensitivities in these schedules and examples are hypothetical and should be viewed with caution. Changes in estimates are based on variations in assumptions and are not subject to simple extrapolation, as the relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in the amount of the estimate may not be linear. In addition, the effect of a variation in one assumption is likely to cause changes in other assumptions, which could potentially magnify or counteract the sensitivities.
Allowance for Credit Losses
The ACL includes the ALLL and the RULC. For periods prior to 2020, the ALLL represented management’s estimate of probable losses believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio at that time. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance was based on periodic evaluations of the portfolios. This process included both quantitative and qualitative analyses, as well as a qualitative review of the results, which required a significant amount of judgment.
ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
The RULC provided for potential losses associated with off-balance sheet lending commitments and standby letters of credit. For periods prior to 2020, the reserve was estimated using the same procedures and methodologies as for the ALLL, in addition to assumptions regarding the probability and amount of unfunded commitments being drawn.
On January 1, 2020, we adopted ASU 2016-13, or CECL. Upon adoption of the ASU, we recorded the full amount of the ACL for loans and leases of $526 million, compared with $554 million at December 31, 2019, resulting in an after-tax increase to retained earnings of $20 million. The impact of the adoption of CECL for our securities portfolio was less than $1 million.
The CECL allowance is calculated based on quantitative models and management qualitative judgment based on many factors over the life of loan. The primary assumptions of the CECL quantitative model are the economic forecast, the length of the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the length of the reversion period, prepayment rates, and the credit quality of the portfolio.
As a result of this accounting standard, our ACL has become more volatile. Our ACL was $835 million as of December 31, 2020, compared with $917 million as of September 30, 2020, and $526 million as of January 1, 2020. We expect volatility to continue primarily because, under the CECL methodology, the ACL is subject to economic forecasts that may change materially from period to period. Although we believe that our methodology for determining an appropriate level for the ACL adequately addresses the various components that could potentially result in credit losses, the processes and their elements include features that may be susceptible to significant change. Any unfavorable differences between the actual outcome of credit-related events and our estimates could require an additional provision for credit losses.
For example, if the ACL was evaluated on only one baseline scenario rather than probability weighting four scenarios, the quantitatively determined amount of the ACL at December 31, 2020 would decrease by approximately $167 million. Additionally, if the probability of default risk grade for all pass-graded loans was immediately downgraded one grade on our internal risk-grading scale, the quantitatively determined amount of the ACL at December 31, 2020 would increase by approximately $87 million. These sensitivity analyses are hypothetical and have been provided only to indicate the potential impact that changes in forecasts and changes in risk grades may have on the ACL estimate. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the processes and methodologies used to estimate the ACL.
Fair Value Estimates
We measure or monitor many of our assets and liabilities on a fair value basis. Fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements, GAAP has established a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the valuation inputs among (1) observable inputs that reflect quoted prices in active markets, (2) inputs other than quoted prices with observable market data, and (3) unobservable data such as our own data or single dealer nonbinding pricing quotes.
When observable market prices are not available, fair value is estimated using modeling techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis. These modeling techniques use assumptions that market participants would consider in pricing the asset or the liability, including assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique, the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset, the life of the asset and applicable growth rate, the risk of nonperformance, and other related assumptions.
The selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a fair value higher or lower than the carrying value of the item being valued. Considerable judgment may be involved in determining the amount that is most representative of fair value.
For assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, our policy is to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements for those items where there is an active market. In certain cases, when market observable inputs for model-based valuation techniques may not be readily available, we are required to make judgments about the assumptions market participants would use in estimating the
ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
fair value of the financial instrument. The models used to determine fair value adjustments are regularly evaluated by management for relevance under current facts and circumstances.
Changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data. For example, reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable. When market data is not available, we use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value.
Fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary measure of accounting. Fair value is used on a nonrecurring basis to measure certain assets or liabilities (including loans held for sale and OREO) for impairment or for disclosure purposes in accordance with current accounting guidance.
Impairment analysis also relates to long-lived assets, goodwill, and core deposit and other intangible assets. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not likely to be recoverable and exceeds its fair value. In determining the fair value, management uses models and applies the techniques and assumptions previously described.
AFS securities are valued using several methodologies, which depend on the nature of the security, availability of current market information, and other factors. AFS securities in an unrealized loss position are formally reviewed on a quarterly basis for the presence of impairment. If we have an intent to sell an identified security, or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, then we recognize an impairment equal to any existing allowance written off against the security. If we do not have the intent to sell a security, and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell a security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, then we determine whether there is any impairment attributable to credit-related factors.
Notes 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and the “Investment Securities Portfolio” on page 51 contain further information regarding the use of fair value estimates.
Accounting for Goodwill
Goodwill is initially recorded at fair value in the financial statements of a reporting unit at the time of its acquisition and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment in accordance with current accounting guidance. We perform this annual test at the beginning of the fourth quarter, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of any of our reporting units, inclusive of goodwill, is less than fair value. The goodwill impairment test for a given reporting unit compares its fair value with its carrying value. If the carrying amount, inclusive of goodwill, is more likely than not to exceed its fair value, additional quantitative analysis must be performed to determine the amount, if any, of goodwill impairment. Our reporting units with goodwill are Amegy, CB&T, and Zions Bank.
To determine the fair value of a reporting unit, we historically have used a combination of up to three separate quantitative methods: comparable publicly traded commercial banks in the Western and Southwestern states (“Market Value”); where applicable, comparable acquisitions of commercial banks in the Western and Southwestern states (“Transaction Value”); and the discounted present value of management’s estimates of future cash flows. The Transaction Value approach was not used in the 2020 goodwill analysis due to the lack of comparable transactions that occurred in 2020. Acquisition activity declined in 2020, which was likely due to the economic uncertainty from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Critical assumptions that are used as part of these calculations may include:
•Selection of comparable publicly traded companies based on location, size, and business focus and composition;
•Selection of market comparable acquisition transactions, if available, based on location, size, business focus and composition, and date of the transaction;
•The discount rate, which is based on our estimate of the cost of equity capital;
•The projections of future earnings and cash flows of the reporting unit;
ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
•The relative weight given to the valuations derived by the three methods described; and
•The control premium associated with reporting units.
We apply a control premium in the Market Value approach to determine the reporting units’ equity values. Control premiums represent the ability of a controlling shareholder to change how we are managed and can cause the fair value of a reporting unit as a whole to exceed its market capitalization. Based on a review of historical bank acquisition transactions within our geographic footprint, and a comparison of the target banks’ market values 30 days prior to the announced transaction to the deal value, we have determined that up to a 25% control premium for the reporting units was appropriate.
Since estimates are an integral part of the impairment test computations, changes in these estimates could have a significant impact on our reporting units' fair value and the goodwill impairment amount, if any. Estimates include economic conditions, which impact the assumptions related to interest and growth rates, loss rates, and imputed cost of equity capital. The fair value estimates for each reporting unit incorporate current economic and market conditions, including Federal Reserve monetary policy expectations and the impact of legislative and regulatory changes. Additional factors that may significantly affect the estimates include, among others, competitive forces, customer behaviors and attrition, loan losses, changes in growth trends, cost structures and technology, changes in equity market values and merger and acquisition valuations, and changes in industry conditions.
Weakening in the economic environment, a decline in the performance of the reporting units, or other factors could cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. Additionally, new legislative or regulatory changes not anticipated in management’s expectations may cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below the carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. Any impairment charge would not affect our regulatory capital ratios, tangible common equity ratio, or liquidity position.
During the fourth quarter of 2020, we performed our annual goodwill impairment evaluation of the entire organization, effective October 1, 2020. We concluded that none of our reporting units were impaired. Furthermore, the evaluation process determined that the fair values of Amegy, CB&T, and Zions Bank exceeded their carrying values by 12%, 28%, and 44%, respectively. Additionally, we performed a hypothetical sensitivity analysis on the discount rate assumption to evaluate the impact of an adverse change to this assumption. If the discount rate applied to future earnings was increased by 100 bps, the fair values of Amegy, CB&T, and Zions Bank would exceed their carrying values by 9%, 24%, and 39%, respectively.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS AND DEVELOPMENTS
Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements discusses recently issued accounting pronouncements that we will be required to adopt. Also described is our expectation of the impact these new accounting pronouncements will have, to the extent they are material, on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.
