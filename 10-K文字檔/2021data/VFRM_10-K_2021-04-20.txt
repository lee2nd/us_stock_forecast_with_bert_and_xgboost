Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Effects of the Current Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic on the Company
The adverse public health developments and economic effects of the current COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, have and could continue to adversely affect the Company’s customers and suppliers as a result of quarantines, facility closures, closing of “brick and mortar” retail outlets and logistics restrictions imposed or which otherwise occur in connection with the pandemic. More broadly, the high degree of unemployment resulting from the pandemic could potentially lead to an extended economic downturn, which would likely decrease spending, adversely affect demand for our products and services and harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. At this time, we cannot accurately predict the effect the long-term effects the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the Company.
Results of Operations
Year ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019
Revenues. We had net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $6,225,848, as compared to $7,291,908 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease reflects a significant contraction of retail sales in 2020 from 2019, primarily as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Sales include bulk oils for wholesale, vegan capsules, tinctures, lotions, salves, and oral syringes, all in various potency levels and flavors. We co-package in addition to marketing our own Veritas Farms brand product line.
Cost of Sales. All expenses incurred to grow, process, and package the finished goods are included in our cost of sales. Cost of sales decreased to $3,268,249 for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $3,831,194 for the year ended December 31, 2019, as a result of decreased sales during the year ended December 31, 2020. We had gross profit of $2,957,599 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to gross profit of $3,460,714 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $10,420,569 for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $14,590,155 for the year ended December 31, 2019, reflecting the significant reduction in marketing expenses, as well as the reduction in the number of employees in our in-house sales team. Selling, General and Administrative expenses primarily consist of administrative personnel costs, facilities expenses, professional fee expenses and marketing costs for our Veritas Farms brand products.
Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $129,569, $71,250 of which was from the amortization of the beneficial conversion feature and $13,677 was accrued interest that is due upon maturity, for a convertible note from a shareholder, as compared to interest expense of $18,167 for the year ended December 31, 2019, $5,714 of which was attributable to loans from a related party.
As a result of the decrease in operating, marketing and public company expenses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020, net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020, decreased to $7,592,539 or ($0.18) per share based on 42,586,651 weighted average shares outstanding, from $11,147,608 or ($0.32) per share based on 34,712,692 weighted average shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, total assets were $12,408,021, as compared to $14,218,557 at December 31, 2019. Assets primarily decreased due to decreases in cash, inventories and prepaid expenses, primarily due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Total liabilities as of December 31, 2020 were $4,760,654, as compared to $2,023,345 at December 31, 2019. The increase was due in large part to increases in accounts payable, accrued expenses, right of use lease liability and debt, including the PPP Loan that the Company received.
Net cash used in operating activities decreased to $2,969,076 for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $12,267,159 for 2019. Results of operations, offset by decreases in inventories, prepaid expenses and accounts payable comprised most of the change.
Net cash used in investing activities was $88,038 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $1,443,433 for the year ended December 31, 2019, reflecting a decrease in cash used for the purchase of property and equipment in 2020.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $2,088,263 for year ended December 31, 2020, primarily attributable to the proceeds from the proceeds of the notes payable as well as an additional private offering undertaken during 2020 as described below. This compares to net cash provided by financing activities of $14,623,049 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Our primary sources of capital to develop and implement our business plan and expand our operations have been the proceeds from private offerings of our equity securities, PPP loans, capital contributions made by members prior to completion of the September 2017 acquisition of 271 Lake Davis Holdings, LLC (“271 Lake Davis”) by the Company and loans from shareholders. The shareholder loans which were evidenced by promissory notes issued to the lending shareholders, which accrued interest at rates between 2% and 3% per annum which were paid in full by September 30, 2019.
In order to raise additional capital, the Company solicited the exercise of the warrants issued in a 2018 private offering. As of December 31, 2020 7,947,916 of the Warrants have been exercised, resulting in proceeds to the Company, net of warrant solicitation fees of $238,438, of $4,530,312.
In April 2019, Veritas Farms commenced a private offering of its equity securities to “accredited investors” pursuant to Rule 506(c) promulgated under the Securities Act (the “2019 Private Offering”). The Company offered up to 6,250,000 “restricted shares of its common stock on a “best efforts” (no minimum) basis at a price of $1.60 per share, with the right to increase the maximum amount of the 2019 Private Offering to 9,375,000 shares ($15,000,000) or more, depending upon investor demand. The Company completed the 2019 Private Offering in August 2019, in which it sold a total of 9,643,854 shares for total gross proceeds of $15,429,981, less offering expenses of $2,069,603, for net proceeds of $13,362,341.
In 2020, Veritas Farms commenced a private offering of its equity securities to “accredited investors” pursuant to Rule 506(c) promulgated under the Securities Act (the “2020 Private Offering”). The Company offered up to 8,000,000 “units” on a “best efforts” (no minimum) basis. Each unit in the offering consisted of two shares of stock and one common stock purchase warrant with an offering price of $0.50 per unit. Each warrant entitled the holder to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $0.50 at any time through August 31, 2025. In the 2020 Private Offering the Company sold a total of 4,160,000 shares for total gross proceeds of $1,040,000, less offering expenses of $155,760, for net proceeds of $885,035.
In April 2020, we borrowed $200,000 on a 30-day demand basis from a shareholder. The loan is evidenced by a promissory note, is secured by a lien on our assets and while outstanding, is convertible into a subsequent private placement of our securities. The note bears interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum, which accrues and is payable together with principal at maturity. The note matures on the first anniversary of the original issuance date or such earlier date on which this Note becomes due in accordance with its terms. As of December 31, 2020, there was $13,677 in accrued interest due on the note.
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. However, the Company has sustained substantial losses from operations since its inception. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $26,667,147 and a net loss of $7,592,539 for the year ended December 31, 2020. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. Continuation as a going concern is dependent on the ability to raise additional capital and financing, though there is no assurance of success.
The Company believes that it will require additional financing to fund its growth and achieve profitability The Company anticipates that such financing, will be generated from subsequent public or private offerings of its equity and/or debt securities. While we believe additional financing will be available to us as needed, there can be no assurance that financing will be available on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise, when needed. Moreover, any such additional financing may dilute the interests of existing shareholders. The absence of additional financing, when needed, could substantially harm the Company, its business, results of operations and financial condition.
Critical Accounting Policies
Revenue Recognition
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes all existing revenue recognition requirements, including most industry specific guidance. This new standard requires a company to recognize revenues when it transfers goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that the company expects to receive for those goods or services. The FASB subsequently issued the following amendments to ASU No. 2014-09 that have the same effective date and transition date: ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations; ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing; ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients; and ASU No. 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company adopted these amendments with ASU 2014-09 (collectively, the new revenue standards).
The new revenue standards became effective for the Company on January 1, 2019 and were adopted using the modified retrospective method. The adoption of the new revenue standards as of January 1, 2019 did not change the Company’s revenue recognition as the majority of its revenues continue to be recognized when the customer takes control of the Company’s product. As the Company did not identify any accounting changes that impacted the amount of reported revenues with respect to its product revenues, no adjustment to retained earnings was required upon adoption.
Under the new revenue standards, the Company recognizes revenues when its customers obtain control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which it expects to receive in exchange for those goods. The Company recognizes revenues following the five-step model prescribed under ASU No. 2014-09: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenues when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligation.
Revenues from product sales are recognized when the customer obtains control of the Company’s products, which occurs at a point in time, typically upon delivery to the customer. The Company expenses incremental costs of obtaining a contract as and when incurred if the expected amortization period of the asset that it would have recognized is one year or less or the amount is immaterial.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Purchases of property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Improvements and replacements of property, plant and equipment are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the lives of property and equipment are charged to expense as incurred. When assets are sold or retired, their cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reported in the Statements of Operations. Depreciation is recorded over the estimated economic useful life of each class of assets and is computed using the straight-line method.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The carrying value of long-lived assets are reviewed when facts and circumstances suggest that the assets may be impaired or that the amortization period may need to be changed. The Company considers internal and external factors relating to each asset, including cash flows, local market developments, industry trends and other publicly available information. If these factors and the projected undiscounted cash flows of the Company over the remaining amortization period indicate that the asset will not be recoverable, the carrying value will be adjusted to the fair market value.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Significant estimates include deferred revenue, costs incurred related to deferred revenue, the useful lives of property and equipment and the useful lives of intangible assets.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 740 Income Taxes, (“ASC 740”). Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the enactment occurs. A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize tax assets through future operations.
In accordance with ASC 740, management evaluated the Company’s tax positions and concluded that the Company had taken no uncertain tax positions that require adjustment to the financial statements to comply with the provisions of this guidance. The Company is subject to routine audits by taxing jurisdictions; however, there are currently no audits for any tax periods in progress.
Effective September 27, 2017, the Company became taxed as a C-Corporation. Income tax benefits are recognized for income tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, only when it is determined that the income tax position will more-likely than-not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company has analyzed tax positions taken for filings with the Internal Revenue Service and all tax jurisdictions where it operates. The Company believes that income tax filing positions will be sustained upon examination and does not anticipate any adjustments that would result in a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Accordingly, the Company has not recorded any reserves, or related accruals for interest and penalties for uncertain income tax positions at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
There are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.
