Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (all dollar amounts in thousands, except per share and revenue per equivalent admissions amounts)
This Annual Report and the documents that are incorporated by reference in this Annual Report contain certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include all statements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts and may be identified by the use of words such as “may,” “believe,” “will,” “seeks to”, “expect,” “project,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “plan” or “continue.” These forward-looking statements are based on the current plans and expectations and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors which could significantly affect current plans and expectations and our future financial condition and results. For a listing and a discussion of such factors, which could cause actual results, performance and achievements to differ materially from those anticipated, see Certain Cautionary Statements-Forward Looking Information and Item 1A.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if:
•
it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and
•
changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been made could have a material impact on our consolidated statement of earnings or financial condition.
The table of critical accounting estimates that follows is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies that require estimates. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, as discussed in Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, the estimates discussed below involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. We believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
The table that follows presents information about our critical accounting estimates, as well as the effects of hypothetical changes in the material assumptions used to develop each estimate:

Receivables-net and Provision for Concession Adjustments
Receivables-net for our Healthcare Services segment primarily consists of amounts due from third-party payors and patients from providing healthcare services to healthcare facility patients. Receivables for our Pharmacy segment primarily consists of amounts due from third-party payors; institutions such as extended care and rehabilitation centers, nursing homes, home health, hospice, hospitals; Medicaid Part D program; and customers from the sale of pharmacy services and merchandise. Our ability to collect outstanding receivables is critical to our results of operations and cash flows. The primary uncertainty lies with accounts for which patients are responsible, which we refer to as patient responsibility accounts. These accounts include both amounts payable by uninsured patients and co-payments and deductibles payable by insured patients
Our provision for concession adjustments, included in our results of continuing operations for the years ended June 30, was as follows:
2021-$726; and
2020-$784
The largest component of concessions adjustments in our patient accounts receivable for our Healthcare Services and Pharmacy segments relates to accounts for which patients are responsible, which we refer to as patient responsibility accounts. These accounts include both amounts payable by uninsured patients and co-payments and deductibles payable by insured patients. In general, we attempt to collect deductibles, co-payments and self-pay accounts prior to the time of service for non-emergency care. If we do not collect these patient responsibility accounts prior to the delivery of care, the accounts are handled through our billing and collections processes.
We attempt to verify each patient’s insurance coverage as early as possible before a scheduled non-emergency admission or procedure, including with respect to eligibility, benefits and authorization/pre-certification requirements, in order to notify patients of the estimated amounts for which they will be responsible. Our hospital does not operate an emergency room. We attempt to verify insurance coverage within a reasonable amount of time for all non-emergency urgent admissions in compliance with the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act.
In general, we utilize the following steps in collecting accounts receivable: if possible, cash collection of all or a portion of deductibles, co-payments and self-pay accounts prior to or at the time service is provided; billing and follow-up with third party payors; collection calls; utilization of collection agencies; sue to collect if the patient has the means to pay and chooses not to pay; and if collection efforts are unsuccessful, write off the accounts.
A significant increase in our provision for doubtful accounts (as a percentage of revenues) would lower our earnings. This would adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and potentially our future access to capital.
If net revenues during fiscal year 2021 were changed by 1%, our 2021 after-tax income from continuing operations would change by approximately $407 or diluted earnings per share of $0.06.
This is only one example of reasonably possible sensitivity scenarios. The process of determining the allowance requires us to estimate uncollectible patient accounts that are highly uncertain and requires a high degree of judgment. It is impacted by, among other things, changes in regional economic conditions, business office operations, payor mix and trends in private and federal or state governmental healthcare coverage.

Our policy is to write off accounts after all collection efforts have failed, which is typically no longer than 120 days after the date of discharge of the patient or service to the patient or customer. Patient responsibility accounts represent the majority of our write-offs. Our subsidiary hospital retains third-party collection agencies for billing and collection of delinquent accounts; the use of one or more collection agencies promotes competition and improved performance. Generally, we do not write off accounts prior to utilizing the services of a collection agency. Once collection efforts have proven unsuccessful, an account is written off from our patient accounting system.
We monitor our revenue trends by payor classification on a quarter-by-quarter basis along with the composition of our accounts receivable agings. This review is focused primarily on trends in self-pay revenues, self-pay accounts receivable, co-payment receivables and historic payment patterns.
In addition, we analyze other factors such as day’s revenue in accounts receivable and we review admissions and charges by physicians, primarily focusing on recently recruited physicians.

Revenue recognition / Net Patient Service Revenues
For our Healthcare Services segment, we recognize revenues in the period in which services are provided. For our Pharmacy segment, we recognize revenues in the period in which services are provided and at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise. Patient receivables primarily consist of amounts due from third-party payors and patients. Amounts we receive for treatment of patients covered by governmental programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and other third-party payors, such as HMOs, PPOs and other private insurers, are determined pursuant to contracts or established government rates and are generally less than our established billing rates. Accordingly, our gross revenues and patient receivables are reduced to net amounts receivable pursuant to such contracts or government payment rates through an allowance for contractual discounts. The sources of these revenues were as follows for the year ended June 30, 2021 (as a percentage of total revenues):
Medicare-44.7%;
Medicaid-25.9%; and
Commercial insurance and other sources-12.5%.
Revenues are recorded at estimated amounts due from patients, third- party payors, institutions, and others for healthcare and pharmacy services and goods provided net of contractual discounts pursuant to contract or government payment rates. Estimates for contractual allowances are calculated using computerized and manual processes depending on the type of payor involved. In our hospital, the contractual allowances are calculated by a computerized system based on payment terms for each payor and certain manual estimates are used in calculating contractual allowances based on historical collections from payors that are not significant or have not entered into a contract with us. All contractual adjustments regardless of type of payor or method of calculation are reviewed and compared to actual experience on a periodic basis.
Accounts receivable primarily consist of amounts due from third party payors, institutions, and patients. Amounts we receive for the treatment of patients covered by HMOs, PPOs and other private insurers are generally less than our established billing rates. We include contractual allowances as a reduction to revenues in our financial statements based on payor specific identification and payor specific factors for rate increases and denials.

Governmental payors
Governmental payors
The majority of services performed on Medicare and Medicaid patients are reimbursed at predetermined reimbursement rates. The differences between the established billing rates (i.e., gross charges) and the predetermined reimbursement rates are recorded as contractual discounts and deducted from gross charges. Under this prospective reimbursement system, there is no adjustment or settlement of the difference between the actual cost to provide the service and the predetermined reimbursement rates.
Discounts for retrospectively cost-based revenues are estimated based on historical and current factors and are adjusted in future periods when settlements of filed cost reports are received.
Final settlements under all programs are subject to adjustment based on administrative review and audit by third party intermediaries, which can take several years to resolve completely.
Because the laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are complex and subject to change, the estimates of contractual discounts we record could change by material amounts. Adjustments related to final settlements for revenues retrospectively increased (decreased) our revenues from continuing operations by the following amounts for the years ended June 30:
2021-$69 and
2020-$139.
Commercial Insurance
Commercial Insurance
For most managed care plans, contractual allowances estimated at the time of service are adjusted to actual contractual allowances as cash is received and claims are reconciled. We evaluate the following criteria in developing the estimated contractual allowance percentages: historical contractual allowance trends based on actual claims paid by managed care payors; review of contractual allowance information reflecting current contract terms; consideration and analysis of changes in payor mix reimbursement levels; and other issues that may impact contractual allowances.
If our overall estimated contractual discount percentage on all of our commercial revenues during 2021 were changed by 1%, our 2021 after-tax income from continuing operations would change by approximately $78. This is only one example of reasonably possible sensitivity scenarios. The process of determining the allowance requires us to estimate the amount expected to be received and requires a high degree of judgment. It is impacted by changes in managed care contracts and other related factors.
A significant increase in our estimate of contractual discounts would lower our earnings. This would adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and future access to capital.

Intangible assets and accounting for business combinations
Our intangible assets by business segment included in our consolidated balance sheets as of June 30 for the following years was as follows:
In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification 350-10, “Intangibles-Goodwill and Other,” (“ASC 350-10”) goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed by us at least annually for impairment. For purposes of these analyses, the estimate of fair value is based on the income approach, which estimates the fair value based on future discounted cash flows. The estimate of future discounted cash flows is based on assumptions and projections that are believed to be currently reasonable and supportable. If it is determined the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets to be impaired, then the carrying value is reduced.
The purchase price of acquisitions is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values and are subject to change during the twelve-month period subsequent to the acquisition date. We engage independent third-party valuation firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the time of acquisition. Such valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumption, including projections of future events and operating performance.

Fair value estimates are derived from independent appraisals, established market values of comparable assets, or internal calculations of estimated future net cash flows. Our estimate of future cash flows is based on assumptions and projections we believe to be currently reasonable and supportable. Our assumptions take into account revenue and expense growth rates, patient volumes, changes in payor mix, and changes in legislation and other payor payment patterns.
Professional and general liability claims
We are subject to potential medical malpractice lawsuits and other claims as part of providing healthcare and pharmacy related services. To mitigate a portion of this risk, we have maintained insurance for individual malpractice claims exceeding a self-insured retention amount. Our self-insurance retention amount was $1,000 on individual malpractice claims for each contract year commencing March 1, 2011 through February 29, 2016 and was reduced to $750 from March 1, 2016 through March 31, 2021. A tail insurance policy has been purchased for claims occurring on or before March 31, 2021 which has a $750 per incident self-insured retention. For claims occurring after March 31, 2021, claims made insurance policies have been purchased with $1,000 on individual malpractice claims for the contract year commencing April 1, 2021 through March 31, 2022.
Each year, we obtain quotes from various malpractice insurers with respect to the cost of obtaining medical malpractice insurance coverage. We compare these quotes to our most recent actuarially determined estimates of losses at various self-insured retention levels. Accordingly, changes in insurance costs affect the self-insurance retention level we choose each year. As insurance costs increase, we may accept a higher level of risk in self-insured retention levels.
The reserve for professional and general liability claims is based upon independent actuarial calculations, which consider historical claims data, demographic considerations, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions in the determination of reserve estimates.
The reserve for professional and general liability claims reflects the current estimate of all outstanding losses, including incurred but not reported losses, based upon actuarial calculations as of the balance sheet date. The loss estimates included in the actuarial calculations may change in the future based upon updated facts and circumstances.
We revise our reserve estimation process by obtaining independent actuarial calculations quarterly.
Actuarial calculations include a large number of variables that may significantly impact the estimate of ultimate losses recorded during a reporting period. In determining loss estimates, professional judgment is used by each actuary by selecting factors that are considered appropriate by the actuary for our specific circumstances. Changes in assumptions used by our independent actuary with respect to demographics and geography, Industry trends, development patterns and judgmental selection of other factors may impact our recorded reserve levels and our results of operations.
Changes in our initial estimates of professional and general liability claims are non-cash charges and accordingly, there would be no material impact currently on our liquidity or capital resources.

The reserve for professional and general liability claims included in our consolidated balance sheets as of June 30 was as follows:
2021-$37 and
2020-$123
The total increases (decreases) for professional and general liability coverage, included in our consolidated results of operations for the years ended June 30, was as follows:
2021-$211; and
2020-$(338).
Our estimated reserve for professional and general liability claims will be significantly affected if current and future claims differ from historical trends. While we monitor reported claims closely and consider potential outcomes as estimated by our independent actuaries when determining our professional and general liability reserves, the complexity of the claims, the extended period of time to settle the claims and the wide range of potential outcomes complicates the estimation process. In addition, certain states, including Georgia, have passed varying forms of tort reform which attempt to limit the number and types of claims and the amount of some medical malpractice awards. If enacted limitations remain in place or if similar laws are passed in the states where our other medical facilities are located, our loss estimates could decrease.
Conversely, liberalization of the number and type of claims and damage awards permitted under any such law applicable to our operations could cause our loss estimates to increase.

Accounting for income taxes
Deferred tax assets generally represent items that will result in a tax deduction in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Earnings and Loss. We assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not probable, a valuation allowance is established. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance, we must include an expense as part of the income tax provision in our results of operations. Our net deferred tax asset balance (net of valuation allowance) in our consolidated balance sheets as of June 30 for the following years was as follows:
2021-$0; and
2020-$0.
Our valuation allowances for deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets as of June 30 for the following years were as follows:
2021-$6,700; and
2020-$8,389.
In addition, significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of certain tax-related contingencies. We establish accruals when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, it is probable that we have incurred a loss related to tax contingencies and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated.
We adjust the accruals related to tax contingencies as part of our provision for income taxes in our results of operations based upon changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit, development of industry related examination issues, as well as legislative, regulatory or judicial developments. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established an accrual, is audited and resolved.
The first step in determining the deferred tax asset valuation allowance is identifying reporting jurisdictions where we have a history of tax and operating losses or are projected to have losses in future periods as a result of changes in operational performance. We then determine if a valuation allowance should be established against the deferred tax assets for that reporting jurisdiction.
The second step is to determine the amount of the valuation allowance. We will generally establish a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred tax asset (deferred tax assets less deferred tax liabilities) related to the jurisdiction identified in the first step of the analysis. In certain cases, we may not reduce the valuation allowance by the amount of the deferred tax liabilities depending on the nature and timing of future taxable income attributable to deferred tax liabilities.
In assessing tax contingencies, we identify tax issues that we believe may be challenged upon examination by the taxing authorities. We also assess the likelihood of sustaining tax benefits associated with tax planning strategies and reduce tax benefits based on management’s judgment regarding such likelihood. We compute the tax on each contingency. We then determine the amount of loss, or reduction in tax benefits based upon the foregoing and reflects such amount as a component of the provision for income taxes in the reporting period.
During each reporting period, we assess the facts and circumstances related to recorded tax contingencies. If tax contingencies are no longer deemed probable based upon new facts and circumstances, the contingency is reflected as a reduction of the provision for income taxes in the current period.
Our deferred tax assets were $6,700 at June 30, 2021, excluding the impact of valuation allowances. At June 30, 2021, the Company evaluated the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and determined that it was more likely than not that none of our deferred tax assets would be realized. As a result, in accordance with ASC 740, we recognized a total valuation allowance of $6,700 against the deferred tax asset so that the net tax deferred asset was $0 at June 30, 2021. We conducted our evaluation by considering available positive and negative evidence to determine our ability to realize our deferred tax assets. In our evaluation, we gave more significant weight to evidence that was objective in nature as compared to subjective evidence. Also, more significant weight was given to evidence we judged directly related to our current financial performance as compared to less current evidence and future plans.
The IRS may propose adjustments for items we have failed to identify as tax contingencies. If the IRS were to propose and sustain assessments equal to 10% of our taxable income for 2020, we would incur approximately $0 of additional tax expense for 2021 plus applicable penalties and interest.
Financial Summary
The results of continuing operations shown in the historical summary below are for our two business segments, Healthcare Services and Pharmacy.
Results of Operations
Our net revenues are principally from our two business segments, Healthcare Services and Pharmacy. The Company’s net revenues by payor were as follows for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020:
Healthcare Services net revenues in the current year are composed of revenues from one hospital, one extended care and rehabilitation center and a subsidiary which provides information technology services to outside customers and SunLink subsidiaries. Healthcare Services net revenues decreased $2,630, or 16.2% in the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to the year ended June 30, 2020. The decrease in net revenues for fiscal 2021 resulted from primarily from reduced patient demand as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Hospital days decreased 21.9%, extended care and rehabilitation center patient days decreased 25.0% and clinic visits decreased 25.5% in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 compared to the prior year. Settlements of prior year Medicare and Medicaid cost reports contributed net revenues from continuing operations of $69 for the year ended June 30, 2021 and $139 for the year ended June 30, 2020.
Pharmacy Segment net revenues for the year ended June 30, 2021 of $27,072 decreased 14.2% from the prior year. The decreased net revenues resulted from decreased referrals from physician offices and other sources due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the related downward turn in the local economies serviced by the segment. Total scripts filled decreased 9.6% and Durable Medical Equipment sales orders decreased 7.9% for the year ended June 30, 2021 from the prior year. Also, the operations of the Pharmacy segment in Lake Charles, Louisiana were impacted by Hurricane Laura in August 2020 and by Hurricane Delta in October 2020. The local area suffered devasting winds and flooding and customer demand decreased as a result.
Costs and expenses, including depreciation and amortization, were $38,816 and $48,142 for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Costs and expenses as a percentage of net revenues were:
Cost of goods sold as a percent of net revenues decreased 1.4% in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 compared to the prior fiscal year due to decreased sales of higher cost intravenous products. Salaries, wages and benefits expense as a percent of net revenues decreased 6.8% this year compared to the prior fiscal year due to the recognition of CARES Act Employer Retention Credits which the company qualified for when the program was amended effective January 1, 2021. Other operating expenses increased 2.6% due to increased professional liability and other insurance expenses.
Operating Profit (Loss)
Operating profit was $1,871 for the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to an operating loss of $329 for the year ended June 30, 2020. The operating profit in the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to the prior fiscal year resulted from the recognition of CARES Act Employer Retention Credits for which the company qualified when the program was amended effective January 1, 2021.
Other Income - Federal stimulus - Pandemic relief funds
As part of CARES, two subsidiaries received total payments of $5,370 under the Provider Relief Fund (“PRF”). These funds were allocated to Medicare facilities and providers affected by COVID-19 based on eligible provider’s net patient revenues and are required to be used for COVID-19 related costs and to offset the effect of COVID-19, including reduced revenues. The relief funds are recognized as government grants. The Company recognized income when it was able to comply with the relevant conditions of the grants. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, $4,880 of these funds were recognized as Other Income for reimbursement of Lost Revenues and for COVID-19 related expenses compared to $54 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020.
Forgiveness of PPP loan and accrued interest
During the quarter ended June 30, 2021, $261 of our PPP loans and related $3 of accrued interest were forgiven by the SBA and $264 was recorded as income relating to the PPP loan forgiveness in the quarter ended June 30, 2021. In July and August 2021, we received notification that the remaining outstanding $2,972 of PPP loans and related $38 of accrued interest was forgiven by the SBA. During the quarter ended September 30, 2021, we will record $3,010 of income for PPP loan forgiveness.
Interest Expense-net
Interest expense, net was $28 and $29 for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and consisted primarily of interest accrued on PPP loans in the year ended June 30, 2021.
Loss on extinguishment of debt
During the year ended June 30, 2020, the Company repaid the outstanding balance of the Trace RDA Loan, which was scheduled to be fully repaid in July 2027. The pre-payment was made with cash on hand. The Company recorded a non-cash loss on early extinguishment of debt relating to the pre-payment of $178 during the year ended June 30, 2020.
Gain on Sale of Assets
On December 20, 2019, the Company sold a medical office building and approximately 4 acres of land in Clanton, AL. After expenses, the Company received net proceeds from the sale of $204, which was retained for working capital and general corporate
purposes. The pre-tax gain on the sale of property was $86 and is included in the Company’s results for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020.
On September 9, 2019, the Company sold approximately 11.4 acres of undeveloped land in Fulton, MO. After expenses, the Company received net proceeds from the sale of $348, which was retained for working capital and general corporate purposes. The pre-tax gain on the sale of property was $100 and is included in the Company’s results for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020.
Income Taxes
We recorded income tax expense of $63 ($63 state tax expense) for the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to an income tax expense of $296 ($296 state tax expense) for the year ended June 30, 2020.
Of the CARES Act provisions, the most material income tax considerations related to the Company are related to the amounts for ERC and amounts received as general and targeted PRF. Based on the latest published IRS guidance as of the preparation of the June 30, 2021 financial statements, PRF (to the extent the applicable terms and conditions required to retain the funds are met “Retainable PRF”) are fully includable in taxable income in the Company’s tax returns in the fiscal year received. ERC are includable in tax income in the Company’s tax returns in the fiscal year in which the payroll expenses for which the quarterly credits offset are deductible. ERC results in qualified wages being disallowed as a deduction for the portion of wages paid equal to the sum of the payroll tax credit taken in the associated quarter. For amounts received and forgiven under PPP Loans, due to the enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, on December 27, 2020, Congress specifically allows the deduction of any expenses associated with forgiven PPP loan proceeds. It is the Company’s assumption at June 30, 2021 that all PPP Loan associated expenses will be deductible for income tax and the book forgiveness income will not be taxable. The Company has sufficient federal net operating losses for the period to cover the resulting provisional June 30, 2021 taxable income, The year ended June 30, 2021 current tax expense represents the state income tax accrued resulted from tax income resulting from ERC accrued and associated disallowed wages and PRF received during the period.
In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740, we evaluate our deferred taxes quarterly to determine if adjustments to our valuation allowance are required based on the consideration of available positive and negative evidence using a “more likely than not” standard with respect to whether deferred tax assets will be realized. Our evaluation considers, among other factors, our historical operating results, our expectation of future results of operations, the duration of applicable statuary carryforward periods and conditions of the healthcare industry. The ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets depends primarily on our ability to generate future taxable income during the periods in which the related temporary differences in the financial basis and the tax basis of the assets become deductible. The value of our deferred tax assets will depend on applicable income tax rates.
At June 30, 2021, consistent with the above process, we evaluated the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and determined that it was more likely than not that none of our deferred tax assets would be realized. As a result, in accordance with ASC 740, we recognized a valuation allowance of $6,700 against the deferred tax asset so that there is no net long-term deferred income tax asset or liability at June 20, 2021. We conducted our evaluation by considering available positive and negative evidence to determine our ability to realize our deferred tax assets. In our evaluation, we gave more significant weight to evidence that was objective in nature as compared to subjective evidence. Also, more significant weight was given to evidence that directly related to our current financial performance as compared to less current evidence and future performance.
The principal negative evidence that led us to determine at June 30, 2021 that all the deferred tax assets should have full valuation allowances was the underlying negative business conditions for rural healthcare businesses in which our Healthcare Services Segment businesses operate and the Federal income tax net operating loss carry-forward of approximately $15,631.
For Federal income tax purposes, at June 30, 2021, the Company had approximately $15,631 of estimated net operating loss carry-forwards available for use in future years subject to the limitations of the provisions of Internal Revenue Code Section 382. These net operating loss carryforwards expire primarily in fiscal 2023 through fiscal 2038; however, with the enactment of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017, federal net operating loss carryforwards generated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 now have no expiration date. The Company’s returns for the periods prior to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 are no longer subject to potential federal and state income tax examination.
Discontinued Operations
Loss from discontinued operations net of income tax was $47 for the year ended June 30, 2021, and loss from discontinued operations net of income taxes were $554 for the year ended June 30, 2020. The results of all the businesses in .discontinued operations are presented below:
Sold Hospitals - Subsidiaries of the Company have sold substantially all of the assets of five hospitals (“Other Sold Hospitals”) during the period July 2, 2012 to March 17, 2019. The income before income taxes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021of the Other Sold Hospitals resulted primarily from the positive effects of prior year Medicare and Medicaid cost report settlements. The loss before income taxes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 resulted primarily from retained professional liability claims expenses and from the negative effects of prior year Medicare and Medicaid cost report settlements.
Life Sciences and Engineering Segment -SunLink retained a defined benefit retirement plan which covered substantially all of the employees of this segment when the segment was sold in fiscal 1998. Effective February 28, 1997, the plan was amended to freeze participant benefits and close the plan to new participants. Pension expense and related tax benefit or expense is reflected in the results of operations for this segment for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020.
Discontinued Operations-Summary Statement of Earnings Information
Net Earnings (Loss) - Net earnings for the year ended June 30, 2021 was $6,890 ($0.99 per fully diluted share) compared to the net loss for the year ended June 30, 2020 of $1,140 (a loss of $0.16 per fully diluted share).

Our primary source of liquidity is unrestricted cash on hand, which was $9,962 at June 30, 2021. The Company and its subsidiaries currently are funding working capital needs primarily from cash on hand. From time-to-time, nevertheless, we may seek to obtain financing for the liquidity needs or the Company or individual subsidiaries. The Company believes, currently, that its ability to raise capital (debt or equity) in the public or private markets on what it considers acceptable terms is uncertain, and due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related factors, may be non-existent.
CARES Act Provider Relief Funds- The CARES Act was enacted by the U.S. government on March 27, 2020. Among the relief to health care providers under the CARES Act are grant of funds under PRF and forgivable loans under the PPP. We have received a total of $8,304 under the CARES Act programs consisting of $5,370 in general and targeted PRF and $3,234 of PPP loans. During the first two calendar quarters of 2021, the Company qualified for, and we are applying for ERC through amending our quarterly payroll tax filing for the applicable quarters.
Subject to the effects, risks and uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and our right to retain the CARES described above, we believe we have adequate financing and liquidity to support our current level of operations through the next twelve months.

A director of the Company is a member of a law firm which provides services to SunLink. The Company has expensed an aggregate of $182 and $251 to the law firm in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets at June 30, 2020 and 2019 is $21 and $6 of amounts payable to the law firm.
Inflation
During periods of inflation and labor shortages, employee wages increase and suppliers pass along rising costs to us in the form of higher prices for their supplies and services. We have not always been able to offset increases in operating costs by increasing prices for our services and products or by implementing cost control measures. We are unable to predict our ability to control future cost increases or offset future cost increases by passing along the increased cost to customers.
