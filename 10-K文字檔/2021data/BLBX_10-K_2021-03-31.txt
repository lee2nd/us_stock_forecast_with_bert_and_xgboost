Basis of Presentation of Financial Information
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”), which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern, which is dependent upon the Company's ability to obtain sufficient financing or establish itself as a profitable business. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $7,184,818 and $6,829,907, respectively, and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 the Company incurred net losses of $354,911 and $2,983,438, respectively. In November 2020, the Company executed a Loan Agreement with certain lenders (the “Lenders”) and FVP Servicing LLC, (“FVP”), as agent for the Lenders in connection with the issuance of a Note in the amount of $1,000,000 bearing interest at 12% per annum with an initial maturity of November 12, 2022. Simultaneously, with the execution of the Loan Agreement, the Company repaid an existing secured note payable in the amount of $100,000 along with accrued interest, and certain outstanding trade payables in the amount of $133,880. In addition, the Company granted the Lender a security interest in substantially all of its assets. As a result of this financing and the cash flows from operations, the Company had a cash balance of $972,825 at December 31, 2020. Management believes that this will be sufficient to fund its operations and service its debt for the next twelve months. In addition, management may continue to raise additional debt or equity capital in order to improve liquidity or finance more aggressive growth or development. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional capital or on what terms.
The financial statements do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in operation.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
During the year ended December 31, 2020 and through March 31, 2021, there were several new accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). Each of these pronouncements, as applicable, has been or will be adopted by the Company. Management does not believe the adoption of any of these accounting pronouncements has had or will have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.
All other new accounting pronouncements issued but not yet effective or adopted have been deemed not to be relevant to us, hence are not expected to have any impact once adopted.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Use of Estimates
The Company’s financial statement preparation requires that management make estimates and assumptions which affect the reporting of assets and liabilities and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in order to report these financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash
Cash includes all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have original maturities at the date of purchase of three months or less.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and requires certain disclosures about fair value measurements. In general, fair values of financial instruments are based upon quoted market prices, where available. If such quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed models that primarily use, as inputs, observable market-based parameters. Valuation adjustments may be made to ensure that financial instruments are recorded at fair value. These adjustments may include amounts to reflect counterparty credit quality and the customer’s creditworthiness, among other things, as well as unobservable parameters. Any such valuation adjustments are applied consistently over time.
Derivative Financial Instruments
FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement requires bifurcation of certain embedded derivative instruments, and measurement at their fair value for accounting purposes. A holder redemption feature embedded in the Company’s notes payable requires bifurcation from its host instrument and is accounted for as a freestanding derivative.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements.
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were several new accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). Each of these pronouncements, as applicable, has been or will be adopted by the Company. Management does not believe the adoption of any of these accounting pronouncements has had or will have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.
Property and Equipment
The Company’s property and equipment is being depreciated on the straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of three years.
Income Taxes
The Company will recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered. The Company provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which it does not consider realization of such assets to be more likely than not.
Management evaluates the probability of the realization of its deferred income tax assets. Management determined that because the Company has not yet generated taxable income, it is unlikely that a tax benefit will be realized from these operating loss carry forwards. Accordingly, the deferred income tax asset is offset by a full valuation allowance.
In accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, the Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be capable of withstanding examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. These standards prescribe a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
Earnings or (Loss) Per Share
Basic earnings per share (or loss per share), is computed by dividing the earnings (loss) for the period by the weighted average number of common stock shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution of securities by including other potentially issuable shares of common stock, including shares issuable upon conversion of convertible securities or exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants, in the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Therefore, because including shares issuable upon conversion of convertible securities and/or exercise of outstanding options and warrants would have an anti-dilutive effect on the loss per share, only the basic earnings (loss) per share is reported in the accompanying financial statements for period of loss.
Share-Based Payment
Under ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, all share based payments to employees, including share option grants, are to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values. No share based payments were issued for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized from the sale of subscriptions for the use of the Blackbox System web application, on a monthly or annual basis. Revenue generally is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. The performance obligation by the Company is in exchange for the monthly subscription fee, the subscriber is allowed access to the Blackbox System on the website for the calendar month. Revenue related to annual subscriptions is recognized each month with unearned subscriptions reflected as a current liability.
Other Liabilities
The Company planned the development of a future product, a complimentary platform to share its IP protocol with the current Blackbox System on a subscription basis. The future product was not developed and launched. The Company received advance payments from a new subscriber group in anticipation of the development of this future product and the amounts were deferred and in the first quarter 2021 the subscribers agreed to terminate those agreements. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has received $180,000 from this future subscriber group.
Prepaid Expenses
Prepaid expenses are current assets created when the Company makes payments or incurs an obligation for expenses identified for a future period. These amounts are charged to expense as the services are provided.
Contingencies
Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company’s management and legal counsel assess such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company’s legal counsel evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought.
If the assessment of a contingency indicates it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company’s financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material would be disclosed. Loss contingencies considered to be remote by management are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantee would be disclosed.
Reclassification
Affiliate referral expenses totaling $121,227 for the year ended December 31, 2019 have been reclassed from cost of revenues to advertising and marketing expense on the statement of operations. Also data feed expenses in the aggregate of $79,691 have been reclassed from software development costs as of December 31, 2019 to cost of revenue.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At December 31, 2020, the Company had a cash balance of $972,825 and a working capital deficit of $990,738 as compared to a cash balance of $21,172 and a working capital deficit of $3,525,306 at December 31, 2019. In addition, the Company incurred a net loss of $354,911 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company generated cash flow from operations of $143,580 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to cash used by operations of $710,992 in the prior year.
The Company believes that it has sufficient capital resources to fund its current operations and debt service requirements.
Loan Agreement
On November 12, 2020, the Company executed a Loan Agreement with certain lenders (the “Lenders”) and FVP Servicing LLC, (“FVP”), as agent for the Lenders in connection with the issuance of a Note (the “FPV Note”) in the amount of $1,000,000 bearing interest at 12% per annum with an initial maturity of November 12, 2022. Simultaneously, with the execution of the Loan Agreement, the Company repaid an existing secured note payable in the amount of $100,000 along with accrued interest and certain outstanding trade payables in the amount of $133,880.
Sale of Common Stock and Warrants
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company received subscriptions for the purchase of 346,533 shares of Common Stock at a cash price of $1.95 per share for aggregate cash consideration of $407,982 In connection with certain of the sales, warrants to purchase up to 35,259 shares of the Company’s Common Stock at a cash price of $1.95 per share were issued to certain of the subscribers.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company also issued an aggregate of 104,339 shares of Common Stock, for settlement of debt obligations and services rendered valued at $205,950.
Additional funding is expected to be generated as necessary through equity financing from the sale of our Common Stock and/or debt. If we are successful in completing equity financing, existing stockholders will experience dilution of their interest in our Company. We do not currently have any financing arranged and we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our Common Stock or debt to fund our plans of operation and ongoing operational expenses.
