Item 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
The following management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our plans and financial condition. The following selected financial information is derived from our historical financial statements and should be read in conjunction with such financial statements and notes thereto set forth elsewhere herein and the "Forward-Looking Statements" explanation included herein.
COVID-19
During this uncertain time, our critical priorities are the health and safety of our employees and contractors, all of whom began working from home and reduced travel to essential business needs starting in late March. We currently are operating under the guidelines of the State of Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and the Governor of Colorado’s Executive Order, Safer-at Home, as amended. We began to incrementally bring certain employees back to work at our facilities on May 4, 2020 under the directives of the Governor’s Executive Order, and under the guidelines of the local and state health departments. We will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state, local authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees and stockholders.
The COVID-19 pandemic has had and continues to have a significant impact on local, state, national and global economies. The actions taken by governments, as well as businesses and individuals, to limit the spread of the disease has significantly disrupted the Company’s normal activities. Numerous businesses, including some of our contractors, collaborative partners and suppliers, have either shut down or are operating on a limited basis with employees working from home, some employees have been furloughed or laid off and social distancing has been mandated through stay-at-home orders, and continues with the Safer-at-Home orders, as amended. The Company expects these actions to have a significant impact on the Company’s results of operations, particularly with respect to research and development, and financial position. The full extent of the impact to the Company due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be currently determined. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact the Company will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be reasonably predicted, including the duration of the outbreak, the increase or reduction in governmental restrictions to businesses and individuals, the potential for a resurgence of the virus and other factors. The longer the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the greater the potential negative financial effect on the Company.
Overview
Lightwave Logic, Inc. is a development stage company moving toward commercialization of next generation electro-optic photonic devices made on its P2ICTM technology platform which uses in-house proprietary high-activity and high-stability organic polymers. Electro-optical devices convert data from electric signals into optical signals for multiple applications.
Our differentiation at the device level is in higher speed, lower power consumption, simplicity of manufacturing and reliability. We have demonstrated higher speed and lower power consumption in packaged devices, and during 2019, we developed new materials that promise to further lower power consumption. We are currently focused on testing and demonstrating the simplicity of manufacturability and reliability of our devices, including in conjunction with the silicon photonics manufacturing ecosystem.
Index
We are initially targeting applications in data communications and telecommunications markets and are exploring other applications for our polymer technology platform.
Business Strategy
Our business strategy anticipates that our revenue stream will be derived from one or some combination of the following: (i) technology licensing for specific product application; (ii) joint venture relationships with significant industry leaders; or (iii) the production and direct sale of our own electro-optic device components. Our objective is to be a leading provider of proprietary technology and know-how in the electro-optic device market. In order to meet this objective, we intend to:
•
Further the development of proprietary organic electro-optic polymer material systems  
•
Develop photonic devices based on our P2ICTM technology  
•
Continue to develop proprietary intellectual property  
•
Grow our commercial device development capabilities  
•
Grow our product reliability and quality assurance capabilities  
•
Grow our optoelectronic packaging and testing capabilities  
•
Grow our commercial material manufacturing capabilities  
•
Maintain/develop strategic relationships with major telecommunications and data communications companies to further the awareness and commercialization of our technology platform  
•
Continue to add high-level personnel with industrial and manufacturing experience in key areas of our materials and device development programs.  
Create Organic Polymer-Enabled Electro-Optic Modulators
We intend to utilize our proprietary optical polymer technology to create an initial portfolio of commercial electro-optic polymer product devices with applications for various markets, including telecommunications, data communications and data centers. These product devices will be part of our proprietary photonics integrated circuit (PIC) technology platform.
We expect our initial modulator products will operate at data rates at least 50 Gbaud (capable of 50 Gbps with standard data encoding of NRZ and 100 Gbps with more complex PAM-4 encoding). Our devices are highly linear, enabling the performance required to take advantage of the more advance complex encoding schemes. We are currently developing our polymer technology to operate at the next industry node of 100Gbaud.
Capital Requirements
As a development stage company, we do not generate revenues. We have incurred substantial net losses since inception. We have satisfied our capital requirements since inception primarily through the issuance and sale of our common stock.
Results of Operations
Comparison of year ended December 31, 2020 to year ended December 31, 2019
Revenues
As a development stage company, we had no revenues during the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The Company is in various stages of photonic device and material development and evaluation. We expect the next revenue stream to be in product development agreements and prototype devices prior to moving into full commercialization.

Significant Accounting Policies
Our Company's accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements. As disclosed in Note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on our management’s best knowledge of current events and actions our Company may undertake in the future, actual results could differ from the estimates.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) and subsequent related updates. The core principle of Topic 842 is that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from operating leases. The Company adopted the standard effective January 1, 2019 under the optional transition method which allows the entity to apply the new lease standard at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment, if any, to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. The standard had a material impact on the balance sheet.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in operating activities was $4,873,863 and net cash used in investing activities was $217,984, which was due primarily to the Company’s research and development activities and general and administrative expenditures. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $6,162,093. At December 31, 2020, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $3,306,590, our assets totaled $7,366,778, our liabilities totaled $1,591,332, and we had stockholders’ equity of $5,775,446.
For the year ended December 31, 2019
During the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash used in operating activities was $4,765,845 and net cash used in investing activities was $305,670, which was due primarily to the Company’s research and development activities and general and administrative expenditures. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $5,133,234. At December 31, 2019, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $2,236,344, our assets totaled $6,824,856, our liabilities totaled $1,917,142, and we had stockholders’ equity of $4,907,714.
Sources and Uses of Cash
Our future expenditures and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors, including: the progress of our research and development efforts; the rate at which we can, directly or through arrangements with original equipment manufacturers, introduce and sell products incorporating our polymer materials technology; the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights; market acceptance of our products and competing technological developments; and our ability to establish cooperative development, joint venture and licensing arrangements. We expect that we will incur approximately $700,000 of expenditures per month over the next 12 months. We expect our Lincoln Park financing (described below) to provide us with sufficient funds to maintain our operations over that period of time. Our current cash position enables us to finance our operations through December 2021 before we will be required to replenish our cash reserves pursuant to the Lincoln Park financing. Our cash requirements are expected to increase at a rate consistent with the Company’s path to revenue growth as we expand our activities and operations with the objective of commercializing our electro-optic polymer technology. We currently have no debt to service.
Index
On January 21, 2019, our Company entered into the Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park, pursuant to which Lincoln Park agreed to purchase from us up to $25,000,000 of our Common Stock (subject to certain limitations) from time to time over a 36-month period. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Lincoln Park is obligated to make purchases as the Company directs in accordance with the Purchase Agreement, which may be terminated by the Company at any time, without cost or penalty. Sales of shares will be made in specified amounts and at prices that are based upon the market prices of our Common Stock immediately preceding the sales to Lincoln Park. We expect this financing to provide us with sufficient funds to maintain our operations for the foreseeable future. With the additional capital, we expect to achieve a level of revenues attractive enough to fulfill our development activities and adequate enough to support our business model for the foreseeable future. We cannot assure you that we will meet the conditions of the Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park in order to obligate Lincoln Park to purchase our shares of common stock. In the event we fail to do so, and other adequate funds are not available to satisfy long-term capital requirements, or if planned revenues are not generated, we may be required to substantially limit our operations. This limitation of operations may include reductions in capital expenditures and reductions in staff and discretionary costs.
There are no trading volume requirements or restrictions under the Purchase Agreement, and we will control the timing and amount of any sales of our Common Stock to Lincoln Park. Lincoln Park has no right to require any sales by us, but is obligated to make purchases from us as we direct in accordance with the Purchase Agreement. We can also accelerate the amount of Common Stock to be purchased under certain circumstances. There are no limitations on use of proceeds, financial or business covenants, restrictions on future funding, rights of first refusal, participation rights, penalties or liquidated damages in the Purchase Agreement. Lincoln Park may not assign or transfer its rights and obligations under the purchase agreement.
We expect that our cash used in operations will continue to increase during 2021 and beyond as a result of the following planned activities:
•
The addition of management, sales, marketing, technical and other staff to our workforce;  
•
Increased spending for the expansion of our research and development efforts, including purchases of additional laboratory and production equipment;  
•
Increased spending in marketing as our products are introduced into the marketplace;  
•
Developing and maintaining collaborative relationships with strategic partners;  
•
Developing and improving our manufacturing processes and quality controls; and  
•
Increases in our general and administrative activities related to our operations as a reporting public company and related corporate compliance requirements.
