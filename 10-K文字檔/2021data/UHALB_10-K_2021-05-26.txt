Item 7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
We begin this MD&A with the overall strategy of AMERCO, followed by a description of, and strategy related to, our operating segments to give the reader an overview of the goals of our businesses and the direction in which our businesses and products are moving. We then discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results. Next, we discuss our results of operations for fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020, which are followed by an analysis of liquidity changes in our balance sheets and cash flows, and a discussion of our financial commitments in the sections entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources and Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments. The discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended March 31, 2019 included in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2020 is incorporated by reference into this MD&A. We conclude this MD&A by discussing our outlook for fiscal 2022.
This MD&A should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report, including Item 1: Business and Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The various sections of this MD&A contain a number of forward-looking statements, as discussed under the caption, Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this Annual Report and particularly under the section Item 1A: Risk Factors. Our actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
AMERCO has a fiscal year that ends on the 31 st of March for each year that is referenced. Our insurance company subsidiaries have fiscal years that end on the 31 st of December for each year that is referenced. They have been consolidated on that basis. Our insurance companies' financial reporting processes conform to calendar year reporting as required by state insurance departments. Management believes that consolidating their calendar year into our fiscal year financial statements does not materially affect the presentation of financial position or results of operations. We disclose all material events, if any, occurring during the intervening period. Consequently, all references to our insurance subsidiaries' years 2020, 2019 and 2018 correspond to fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 for AMERCO.
Overall Strategy
Our overall strategy is to maintain our leadership position in the North American “do-it-yourself” moving and storage industry. We accomplish this by providing a seamless and integrated supply chain to the “do-it-yourself” moving and storage market. As part of executing this strategy, we leverage the brand recognition of U-Haul
with our full line of moving and self-storage related products and services and the convenience of our broad geographic presence.
Our primary focus is to provide our customers with a wide selection of moving rental equipment, convenient self-storage rental facilities and portable moving and storage units and related moving and self-storage products and services. We are able to expand our distribution and improve customer service by increasing the amount of moving equipment and storage units and portable moving and storage units available for rent, expanding the number of independent dealers in our network and expanding and taking advantage of our Storage Affiliate and Moving Help capabilities.
Property and Casualty Insurance is focused on providing and administering property and casualty insurance to U-Haul and its customers, its independent dealers and affiliates.
Life Insurance is focused on long-term capital growth through direct writing and reinsuring of life, Medicare supplement and annuity products in the senior marketplace.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the United States. The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies can have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements. Note 3, Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this Annual Report summarizes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Certain accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments and assumptions, often as a result of the need to estimate matters that are inherently uncertain.
Following is a detailed description of the accounting policies that we deem most critical to us and that require management's most difficult and subjective judgments. These estimates are based on historical experience, observance of trends in particular areas, information and valuations available from outside sources and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions, and such differences may be material.
We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies, such as revenue recognition; however, these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates, because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective. The accounting policies that we deem most critical to us, and involve the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments include the following:
Recoverability of Property, Plant and Equipment
Our property, plant and equipment is stated at cost. We regularly perform reviews to determine whether facts and circumstances exist, which indicate that the carrying amount of assets, including estimates of residual value, may not be recoverable or that the useful life of assets are shorter or longer than originally estimated. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the remaining life of the equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks and trailers. We assess the recoverability of our assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their estimated remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. We consider factors such as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles and the expected life of vehicles included in the fleet. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. If asset residual values are determined to be recoverable, but the useful lives are shorter or longer than originally estimated, then the net book value of the assets is depreciated over the newly determined remaining useful lives.
Insurance Reserves
Liabilities for future policy benefits related to life insurance, Medicare supplement insurance, and deferred annuities are determined by management utilizing the net premium valuation methodology and are accrued when premium revenue is recognized. The liability, which represents the present value of future benefits to be paid to policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums, is estimated using assumptions applicable at the time the insurance contracts are written, with provisions for the risk of adverse deviation, as appropriate. Assumptions include expected mortality and morbidity experience, policy lapses and surrenders, current asset yields and expenses, and expected interest rate yields. The Company periodically performs a gross premium valuation and reviews original assumptions, including capitalized expenses which reduce the gross premium valuation, to evaluate whether the assets and liabilities are adequate and whether a loss reserve should be recognized.
Insurance reserves for Property and Casualty Insurance and U-Haul take into account losses incurred based upon actuarial estimates and are management's best approximation of future payments.
These estimates are based upon past claims experience and current claim trends as well as social and economic conditions such as changes in legal theories and inflation.
These reserves consist of case reserves for reported losses and a provision for IBNR losses, both reduced by applicable reinsurance recoverables, resulting in a net liability.
Due to the nature of the underlying risks and high degree of uncertainty associated with the determination of the liability for future policy benefits and claims, the amounts to be ultimately paid to settle these liabilities cannot be precisely determined and may vary significantly from the estimated liability, especially for long-tailed casualty lines of business such as excess workers' compensation.
As a result of the long-tailed nature of the excess workers' compensation policies written by Repwest from 1983 through 2001, it may take a number of years for claims to be fully reported and finally settled.
On a regular basis, insurance reserve adequacy is reviewed by management to determine if existing assumptions need to be updated. In determining the assumptions for calculating workers' compensation reserves, management considers multiple factors including the following:
Claimant longevity,
Cost trends associated with claimant treatments,
Changes in ceding entity and third party administrator reporting practices,
Changes in environmental factors including legal and regulatory,
Current conditions affecting claim settlements, and
Future economic conditions including inflation.
We have reserved each claim based upon the accumulation of current claim costs projected through each claimant's life expectancy, and then adjusted for applicable reinsurance arrangements.
Management reviews each claim bi-annually or more frequently, if there are changes in facts or circumstances to determine if the estimated life-time claim costs have increased and then adjusts the reserve estimate accordingly at that time.
We have factored in an estimate of what the potential cost increases could be in our IBNR liability.
We have not assumed settlement of the existing claims in calculating the reserve amount, unless it is in the final stages of completion.
Continued increases in claim costs, including medical inflation and new treatments and medications could lead to future adverse development resulting in additional reserve strengthening.
Conversely, settlement of existing claims or if injured workers return to work or expire prematurely, could lead to future positive development.
Impairment of Investments
Current expected credit loss (“CECL”) has replaced the previous other-than-temporary-impairment (“OTTI”) model. Under the OTTI model, credit losses were recognized as a reduction to the cost basis of the investment with recovery of an impairment loss recognized prospectively over time as interest income and reversals of impairment were not allowed. Under CECL, a valuation allowance is recognized in earnings for credit losses. For securities that are below investment grade, we evaluate whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors such as the interest rate environment. Declines in value due to credit are recognized as an allowance. In making this assessment, management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse market conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, cumulative default rates based on ratings are used to determine the potential cost of default, by year. The present value of these potential costs is then compared to the amortized cost of the security to determine the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis . If we intend to sell a debt security, or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the debt security is written down to its fair value and the write down is charged against the allowance for credit losses, with any incremental impairment reported in
earnings. Reversals of the allowance for credit losses are
permitted and should not exceed the allowance amount initially recognized.
Income Taxes
We file a consolidated tax return with all of our legal subsidiaries.
Our tax returns are periodically reviewed by various taxing authorities. The final outcome of these audits may cause changes that could materially impact our financial results. Please see Note 14, Provision for Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report for more information.

Self-moving equipment rental revenues increased $390.9 million during fiscal 2021, compared with fiscal 2020. During our first quarter of fiscal 2021, we experienced a decrease in these revenues of $94.3 million, or 13%.
Since then these revenues have increased $485.2 million or 25% over the last nine months of fiscal 2021.
Transactions along with average revenue per transaction increased for both our In-town and one-way markets.
Compared to the same period last year, we increased the number of retail locations and independent dealers.
Self-storage revenues increased $58.5 million during fiscal 2021, compared with fiscal 2020.
The average monthly number of occupied units increased by 18%, or 57,000 units during fiscal 2021 compared with the same period last year.
The growth in revenues and units rented comes from a combination of occupancy gains at existing locations and from the addition of new facilities to the portfolio. During fiscal 2021, we added approximately 3.7 million net rentable square feet, a 9% increase, with approximately 0.8 million of that occurring during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.
Sales of self-moving and self-storage products and services increased $79.8 million during fiscal 2021, compared with fiscal 2020. This was due to increased sales of hitches, moving supplies and propane.
Life insurance premiums decreased $6.4 million during fiscal 2021, compared with fiscal 2020 primarily due to decreased Medicare supplement premiums.
Property and casualty insurance premiums increased $2.7 million during fiscal 2021, compared with fiscal 2020. A significant portion of Repwest's premiums are from policies sold in conjunction with U-Haul rental transactions. The premium increase corresponded with the increased moving and storage transactions at U-Haul during the same period.
Net investment and interest income decreased $14.9 million during fiscal 2021, compared with fiscal 2020. Changes in the market value of unaffiliated common stocks held at our Property and Casualty Insurance subsidiary accounted for $3.4 million of the decrease. A $3.2 million realized loss in derivatives used as hedges for our fixed indexed annuities at our life insurance subsidiary also contributed to the decrease. In addition, the adoption of ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (“Topic 326”) resulted in net credit loss expense of $0.6 million for fiscal 2021. Moving and Storage accounted for $8.3 million of the decrease due to a decrease in interest rates on short-term deposits.
Other revenue increased $51.2 million during fiscal 2021, compared with fiscal 2020, caused primarily by growth in our U-Box ® program.
Listed below are revenues and earnings from operations at each of our operating segments for fiscal 2021 and 2020. The insurance companies' years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.

Total costs and expenses increased $142.1 million during fiscal 2021, compared with fiscal 2020. Operating expenses for Moving and Storage increased $67.7 million. Repair costs associated with the rental fleet experienced a $18.2 million decrease for fiscal 2021 due to fewer trucks being prepped for sale at auction. We experienced increases in personnel, liability costs, property taxes and shipping costs associated with U-Box transactions. Although fewer trucks were sold, net gains from the disposal of rental equipment increased $27.0 million from higher resale values. Over the last nine months of fiscal 2021 net gains have increased $42.6 million, after a net loss of $15.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to COVID-19 auction shutdowns.
Depreciation expense associated with our rental fleet decreased $23.8 million to $486.7 million as new truck production has been slowed by delays at manufacturers.
Depreciation expense on all other assets, largely from buildings and improvements, increased $23.7 million to $177.3 million. Losses on the disposal of real estate increased $4.0 million due to the condemnation of a property in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 combined with an increase in roof replacement projects.
As a result of the above-mentioned changes in revenues and expenses, earnings from operations increased to $961.1 million for fiscal 2021, compared with $540.1 million for fiscal 2020.
Interest expense for fiscal 2021 was $163.5 million, compared with $161.0 million for fiscal 2020 due to an increase in borrowings in fiscal 2021 that was offset by lower interest rates in fiscal 2021.
Income tax benefit (expense) was ($185.8) million for fiscal 2021, compared with $63.9 million for fiscal 2020 due to the effect of the CARES Act as enacted on March 27, 2020. Our effective tax rate was 23.3% of net income before taxes for fiscal 2021, compared with (16.9%) in the prior year period. Federal net operating losses from fiscal years 2018, 2019 and 2020 have been carried back to prior tax years as provided by the CARES Act. The statutory tax rate for the carryback years was 35% as compared with 21% at present. Consequently, we recognized a benefit amount of $146.0 million in fiscal 2020. Excluding the CARES Act benefit mentioned above, our effective tax rate for all of fiscal 2020, post CARES Act, was 21.7% compared with 23.3% for fiscal 2021. See Note 14, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report for more information on income taxes.
As a result of the above-mentioned items, earnings available to common shareholders were $610.9 million for fiscal 2021, compared with $442.0 million for fiscal 2020.
Basic and diluted earnings per common share for fiscal 2021 were $31.15, compared with $22.55 for fiscal 2020.
The weighted average common shares outstanding basic and diluted were 19,607,708 for fiscal 2021, compared with 19,603,708 for fiscal 2020.

As a result of the above-mentioned changes in revenues and expenses, earnings from operations for Moving and Storage before consolidation of the equity in the earnings of the insurance subsidiaries increased to $906.9 million for fiscal 2021 as compared with $472.0 million for fiscal 2020.
Equity in the earnings of AMERCO's insurance subsidiaries decreased $11.3 million for fiscal 2021, compared with fiscal 2020.
As a result of the above-mentioned changes in revenues and expenses, earnings from operations increased to $951.3 million for fiscal 2021, compared with $527.8 million for fiscal 2020.
Property and Casualty Insurance
2020 Compared with 2019
Net premiums were $70.3 million and $69.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. A significant portion of Repwest's premiums are from policies sold in conjunction with U-Haul rental transactions. The premium growth corresponded with the increased moving and storage transactions at U-Haul.
Net investment and interest income were $16.5 million and $19.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The main driver of the change in net investment income was the decrease in valuation of unaffiliated common stock of $3.4 million.
Net operating expenses were $35.5 million and $33.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The change was due to an increase in commissions, decreased loss adjusting fees and subrogation income.
Benefits and losses expenses were $18.6 million and $12.4 million for the years
ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase was due to unfavorable loss experience.
As a result of the above-mentioned changes in revenues and expenses, pretax earnings from operations were $32.5 million and $42.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Life Insurance
2020 Compared with 2019
Net premiums were $121.6 million and $128.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Medicare Supplement premiums decreased $9.9 million from the policy decrements offset by premium rate increases. This was partially offset by a $4.2 million increase in life premiums from the new sales.
Premiums on other lines of business decreased $0.7 million. Deferred annuity deposits were $471.3 million or $249.9 million above prior year and are accounted for on the balance sheet as deposits rather than premiums. The increase in deferred annuity deposits is a result of elevated sales due to competitive rates and flexible product offerings.
Net investment and interest income was $107.7 million and $109.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. A $3.2 million loss was realized on derivatives used as hedges for our fixed indexed annuities. The implementation of Topic 326 resulted in net credit loss expense of $0.9 million. Additionally, mortgage loans prepayment gains decreased by a $3.3 million. This was partially offset by a net $5.8 million increase in investment income on fixed maturities, mortgage loans and the remaining invested assets from a larger invested assets base. In addition, the increase in realized gains was $0.3 million.
Net operating expenses were $20.4 million and $21.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease was due to a reduced commission expense on Medicare supplement products as a result of declined premiums and one time accrual for legal losses in the second quarter of the prior year.
Benefits and losses expenses were $161.0 million and $162.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Medicare supplement benefits decreased $10.9 million from the declined policies in force and lower utilization during the pandemic. In addition, long term care benefits decreased $0.7 million from the reduced policies in force and supplementary contract payout decreased $0.8 million. This was partially offset by a $7.9 million increase in life benefits from the increased mortality experience partially attributable to COVID-19.
Additionally, there was an increase of $3.1 million in interest credited to policyholders from a larger annuity deposit base due to continued sales.
Amortization of deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”), sales inducement asset (“SIA“) and the value of business acquired (“VOBA”) was $28.3 million and $31.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. A decrease is primarily in Life DAC amortization from a reduction in policy lapses driven by the premium forbearance on policyholders and Medicare supplement DAC Amortization from a decline of the in force. The decrease in the Annuity DAC amortization is primarily from a one-time DAC and SIA adjustment (write off) in the prior year to reflect updated assumptions in the estimated gross profit.
As a result of the above-mentioned changes in revenues and expenses, pretax earnings from operations were $22.9 million and $26.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We believe our current capital structure is a positive factor that will enable us to pursue our operational plans and goals and provide us with sufficient liquidity for the foreseeable future. There are many factors which could affect our liquidity, including some which are beyond our control, and there is no assurance that future cash flows and liquidity resources will be sufficient to meet our outstanding debt obligations and our other future capital needs.
As of March 31, 2021, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1,194.0 million, compared with $494.4 million as of March 31, 2020. The assets of our insurance subsidiaries are generally unavailable to fulfill the obligations of non-insurance operations (AMERCO, U-Haul and Real Estate). As of March 31, 2021 (or as otherwise indicated), cash and cash equivalents, other financial assets (receivables, short-term investments, other investments, fixed maturities, and related party assets) and debt obligations of each operating segment were:

(a) As of December 31, 2020
As of March 31, 2021, Moving and Storage had available borrowing capacity under existing credit facilities of $105.0 million.
The majority of invested cash at the Moving and Storage segment is held in government money market funds.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, COVID-19 negatively affected our operating cash flows through lower self-moving equipment rental revenues along with a significant reduction in equipment sales proceeds stemming from the closures of commercial auto auctions.
Cash and liquidity improved during the last nine months of fiscal 2021 from increased operating cash flows and proceeds from commercial auto auctions.
We believe that the Company has adequate liquidity to meet our obligations. However, there can be no assurance that market conditions resulting from COVID-19 will not worsen and have a material negative effect on our liquidity.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased $459.9 million in fiscal 2021, compared with fiscal 2020.
The improvement in operating cashflows was primarily due to increased revenue and profitability, a decrease in interest paid of $14.9 million and the surrender of $20.5 million of corporate owned life insurance policies. These were partially offset by an increase of $22.2 million of federal income taxes paid, net of refunds and deposits received.
Net cash used in investing activities decreased $637.1 million in fiscal 2021, compared with fiscal 2020. Purchases of property, plant and equipment decreased $867.9 million. Reinvestment in the rental fleet has declined because new truck production has been slowed from delays at manufacturers.
We have also slowed our investment in new self-storage acquisitions and development during fiscal 2021.
Cash from the sales of property, plant and equipment decreased $149.9 million largely due to reduced fleet sales. For our insurance subsidiaries, net cash used in investing activities increased $69.1 million.
Net cash provided by financing activities decreased $225.0 million in fiscal 2021, compared with fiscal 2020. This was due to a combination of increased debt and finance lease repayments of $226.1 million, a decrease in cash from borrowings of $199.4 million, an increase in net annuity deposits from Life Insurance of $220.4 million and an increase in common stock dividends paid of $19.6 million.
Liquidity and Capital Resources and Requirements of Our Operating Segments
Moving and Storage
To meet the needs of our customers, U-Haul maintains a large fleet of rental equipment. Capital expenditures have primarily consisted of new rental equipment acquisitions and the buyouts of existing fleet from leases. The capital to fund these expenditures has historically been obtained internally from operations and the sale of used equipment and externally from debt and lease financing. In the future, we anticipate that our internally generated funds will be used to service the existing debt and fund operations. U-Haul estimates that during fiscal 2022 the Company will reinvest in its truck and trailer rental fleet approximately $600 million, net of equipment sales and excluding any lease buyouts. For fiscal 2021, the Company invested, net of sales, approximately $326 million before any lease buyouts in its truck and trailer fleet. Fleet investments in fiscal 2022 and beyond will be dependent upon several factors including the availability of capital, the truck rental environment and the used-truck sales market. In particular, this projection is highly dependent upon the availability of new equipment from manufacturers. We anticipate that the fiscal 2022 investments will be funded largely through debt financing, external lease financing and cash from operations. Management considers several factors including cost and tax consequences when selecting a method to fund capital expenditures. Our allocation between debt and lease financing can change from year to year based upon financial market conditions which may alter the cost or availability of financing options.
Based upon interactions with our existing lenders, the Company does not believe that COVID-19 will materially inhibit our ability to obtain financing for the purchases of rental equipment in fiscal 2022.
Should the situation severely worsen this belief could change.
Real Estate has traditionally financed the acquisition of self-storage properties to support U-Haul's growth through debt financing and funds from operations. The Company's plan for the expansion of owned storage properties includes the acquisition of existing self-storage locations from third parties, the acquisition and development of bare land, and the acquisition and redevelopment of existing buildings not currently used for self-storage. The Company expects to fund these development projects through a combination of internally generated funds, corporate debt and with borrowings against existing properties as they operationally mature. For fiscal 2021, the Company invested $505 million in real estate acquisitions, new construction and renovation and repair compared to $751 million in fiscal 2020.
For fiscal 2022, the timing of new projects will be dependent upon several factors, including the entitlement process, availability of capital, weather, the identification and successful acquisition of target properties and any lingering effects of COVID-19.
In fiscal 2021, the Company opted to slow the development of new self-storage projects to preserve liquidity.
We are likely to increase these investments in fiscal 2022.
U-Haul's growth plan in self-storage also includes the expansion of the U-Haul Storage Affiliate program, which does not require significant capital.
Net capital expenditures (purchases of property, plant and equipment less proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment and lease proceeds) were $904.0 million, $1,622.0 million and $1,263.7 million for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Moving and Storage continues to hold significant cash and we believe has access to additional liquidity. Management may invest these funds in our existing operations, expand our product lines or pursue external opportunities in the self-moving and storage marketplace, pay dividends or reduce existing indebtedness where possible.
Property and Casualty Insurance
State insurance regulations may restrict the amount of dividends that can be paid to stockholders of insurance companies. As a result, Property and Casualty Insurance's assets are generally not available to satisfy the claims of AMERCO, or its legal subsidiaries. In December 2020, Repwest paid a $22.6 million dividend to AMERCO.
For calendar year 2021, the ordinary dividend available to be paid to AMERCO is $22.7 million. For more information, please see Note 21, Statutory Financial Information of Insurance Subsidiaries, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.We believe that stockholders' equity at the Property and Casualty operating segment remains sufficient and we do not believe that its ability to pay ordinary dividends to AMERCO will be restricted per state regulations.
Our Property and Casualty operating segment stockholders' equity was $262.6 million, $251.1 million, and $222.4 million as of December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The increase in 2020 compared with 2019 resulted from net earnings of $25.7 million, an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of $9.9 million, offset by the $22.6 million dividend paid to AMERCO and a decrease of $1.5 million to beginning retained earnings due to implementation of Topic 326.
Property and Casualty Insurance does not use debt or equity issues to increase capital and therefore has no direct exposure to capital market conditions other than through its investment portfolio.
Life Insurance
Life Insurance manages its financial assets to meet policyholder and other obligations including investment contract withdrawals and deposits. Life Insurance's net deposits for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $304.0 million. State insurance regulations may restrict the amount of dividends that can be paid to stockholders of insurance companies. As a result, Life Insurance's assets are generally not available to satisfy the claims of AMERCO ® or its legal subsidiaries. In April 2020, Oxford paid a $18.6 million dividend to AMERCO. For calendar year 2021, the ordinary dividend available to be paid to AMERCO is $6.3 million. For more information, please see Note 21, Statutory Financial Information of Insurance Subsidiaries, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.
Our Life Insurance operating segment stockholders' equity was $479.2 million, $417.4 million, and $311.7 million as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in 2020 compared with 2019 resulted from earnings of $18.7 million and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of $62.3 million primarily due to the effect of interest rate changes on the fixed maturity portion of the investment portfolio, a $18.6 million dividend paid to AMERCO and a decrease of $0.6 million to beginning retained earnings due to the implementation of Topic 326.
Life Insurance has not historically used debt or equity issues to increase capital and therefore has not had any significant direct exposure to capital market conditions other than through its investment portfolio. However, as of December 31, 2020, Oxford had outstanding advances of $70.5 million through its membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) and an $11.2 million loan against its home office buildings. For a more detailed discussion of these advances, please see Note 9, Borrowings, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
In December 2020, AMERCO contributed $12.0 million to Oxford in the form of a surplus note.
This note will be repaid to AMERCO with interest over the next seven years.
Cash Provided from Operating Activities by Operating Segments
Moving and Storage
Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,428.9 million, $980.5 million and $958.9 million in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The improvement in operating cashflows was primarily due to increased revenue and profitability, a decrease in interest paid of $14.9 million and the surrender of $20.5 million of corporate owned life insurance policies. These were partially offset by an increase of $22.2 million of federal income taxes paid, net of refunds and deposits received.
Property and Casualty Insurance
Net cash provided by operating activities was $19.4 million, $22.5 million, and $19.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The decrease was the result of changes in intercompany balances and the timing of payables activity.
Property and Casualty Insurance's cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment portfolios amounted to $12.9 million, $11.8 million, and $11.2 million as of December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. These balances reflect funds in transition from maturity proceeds to long-term investments. Management believes this level of liquid assets, combined with budgeted cash flow, is adequate to meet foreseeable cash needs. Capital and operating budgets allow Property and Casualty Insurance to schedule cash needs in accordance with investment and underwriting proceeds.
Life Insurance
Net cash provided (used) by operating activities was $87.1 million, $72.5 million and ($3.2) million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in operating cash flows was primarily due to $12.0 million in proceeds received on a surplus note issued to AMERCO. In addition, there was an increase in unapplied annuity premiums on policies not yet in force and a reduction in variable receivable accounts. This was offset by a reduction in operating cash from the increased commissions on life and annuities.
In addition to cash flows from operating activities and financing activities, a substantial amount of liquid funds are available through Life Insurance's short-term portfolio and its membership in the FHLB. As of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments amounted to $178.1 million, $30.5 million and $24.1 million, respectively. Management believes that the overall sources of liquidity are adequate to meet foreseeable cash needs.
Liquidity and Capital Resources - Summary
We believe we have the financial resources needed to meet our business plans including our working capital needs. We continue to hold significant cash and have access to additional liquidity to meet our anticipated capital expenditure requirements for investment in our rental fleet, rental equipment and storage acquisitions and build outs.
As a result of the federal income tax provisions of the CARES Act, we have filed applicable forms with the IRS to carryback net operating losses. These refund claims total approximately $366 million, none of which has been received at this time. These amounts are expected to provide us additional liquidity whenever received. It is possible future legislation could negatively impact our ability to receive these tax refunds.
Our borrowing strategy has primarily focused on asset-backed financing and rental equipment leases. As part of this strategy, we seek to ladder maturities and fix interest rates. While each of these loans typically contains provisions governing the amount that can be borrowed in relation to specific assets, the overall structure is flexible with no limits on overall Company borrowings. Management believes it has adequate liquidity between cash and cash equivalents and unused borrowing capacity in existing credit facilities to meet the current and expected needs of the Company over the next several years. As of March 31, 2021, we had available borrowing capacity under existing credit facilities of $105.0 million.
While it is possible that circumstances beyond our control could alter the ability of the financial institutions to lend us the unused lines of credit.
We believe that there are additional opportunities for leverage in our existing capital structure. For a more detailed discussion of our long-term debt and borrowing capacity, please see Note 9, Borrowings, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report.

(a) These estimated obligations for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses include case reserves for reported claims and estimates of claims incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) claims estimates and are net of expected reinsurance recoveries. The ultimate amount to settle both the case reserves and IBNR is an estimate based upon historical experience and current trends and such estimates could materially differ from actual results. The assumptions do not include future premiums. Due to the significant assumptions employed in this model, the amounts shown could materially differ from actual results.
(b) These estimated obligations are based on mortality, morbidity, withdrawal and lapse assumptions drawn from our historical experience and adjusted for any known trends. These obligations include expected interest crediting but no amounts for future annuity deposits or premiums for life and Medicare supplement policies.
The cash flows shown above are undiscounted for interest and as a result total outflows for all years shown significantly exceed the corresponding liabilities of $2,553.0 million included in our consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2021. Life Insurance expects to fully fund these obligations from their invested asset portfolio. Due to the significant assumptions employed in this model, the amounts shown could materially differ from actual results.
(c) These estimated obligations are primarily the Company's self insurance accruals for portions of the liability coverage for our rental equipment. The estimates for future settlement are based upon historical experience and current trends. Due to the significant assumptions employed in this model, the amounts shown could materially differ from actual results.
As presented above, contractual obligations on debt and guarantees represent principal payments while contractual obligations for operating leases represent the notional payments under the lease arrangements.
ASC 740 - Income Taxes liabilities and interest of $45.4 million is not included above due to uncertainty surrounding ultimate settlements, if any.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company uses off-balance sheet arrangements in situations where management believes that the economics and sound business principles warrant their use.
Historically, we used certain off-balance sheet arrangements in connection with the expansion of our self-storage business. For more information please see Note 20, Related Party Transactions, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report. These arrangements were primarily used when our overall borrowing structure was more limited. We do not face similar limitations currently and off-balance sheet arrangements have not been utilized in our self-storage expansion in recent years. In the future, we will continue to identify and consider off-balance sheet opportunities to the extent such arrangements would be economically advantageous to us and our stockholders.
Fiscal 2022 Outlook
We will continue to focus our attention on increasing transaction volume and improving pricing, product and utilization for self-moving equipment rentals.
Maintaining an adequate level of new investment in our truck fleet is an important component of our plan to meet our operational goals and is likely to increase in fiscal 2022. Revenue in the U-Move ® program could be adversely impacted should we fail to execute in any of these areas. Even if we execute our plans, we could see declines in revenues primarily due to unforeseen events including adverse economic conditions or heightened competition that is beyond our control.
With respect to our storage business, we have added new locations and expanded existing locations. In fiscal 2022, we are actively looking to complete current projects, increase occupancy in our existing portfolio of locations and acquire new locations. New projects and acquisitions will be considered and pursued if they fit our long-term plans and meet our financial objectives. It is likely spending on acquisitions and new development will increase in fiscal 2022. We will continue to invest capital and resources in the U-Box ® program throughout fiscal 2022.
In light of COVID-19 and its lingering effects, we may be challenged in our progress.
Property and Casualty Insurance will continue to provide loss adjusting and claims handling for U-Haul and underwrite components of the Safemove ® , Safetow ® , Safemove Plus ® , Safestor ® , and Safestor Mobile ® protection packages to U-Haul customers.
Life Insurance is pursuing its goal of expanding its presence in the senior market through the sales of its Medicare supplement, life and annuity policies. This strategy includes growing its agency force, expanding its new product offerings, and pursuing business acquisition opportunities.
