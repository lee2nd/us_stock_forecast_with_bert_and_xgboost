Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
SB Financial Group, Inc. (“SB Financial”), is a financial holding company registered with the Federal Reserve Board and subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. Through its direct and indirect subsidiaries, SB Financial is engaged in commercial and retail banking, wealth management and private client financial services.
The following discussion provides a review of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of SB Financial and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”). This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related footnotes as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Strategic Discussion
The focus and strategic goal of the Company is to grow into and remain a top decile (>90th percentile) independent financial services company. The Company intends to achieve and maintain that goal by executing our five key initiatives.
Increase profitability through ongoing diversification of revenue streams: For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company generated $30.1 million in noninterest income, or 45.6 percent of total operating revenue from fee-based products. These revenue sources include fees generated from saleable residential mortgage loans, retail deposit products, wealth management services, saleable business-based loans (small business and farm service) and title agency revenue. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, the Company generated $18.0 million in revenue from fee-based products, or 34.1 percent of total operating revenue.
Strengthen our penetration in all markets served: Over our 118-year history of continuous operation in Northwest Ohio, we have established a significant presence in our traditional markets in Defiance, Fulton, Paulding and Williams counties in Ohio. In our newer markets of Bowling Green, Columbus, Findlay, Toledo (Ohio) and Ft. Wayne (Indiana), our current market penetration is minimal but we believe our potential for growth is significant. We have expanded and committed additional resources to our presence in the Findlay and Wauseon markets. We continue to seek to expand the presence and penetration in all of our markets.
Expand product utilization by new and existing customers: As of December 31, 2020, we served 32,519 households and provided 95,210 products and services (2.93 products & services per household) to these households. Our strategy is to continue to expand the scope of our relationship with each household via our dynamic “on-boarding” process. Proactively identifying client needs is a key ingredient of our value proposition. As of December 31, 2019, we served 30,377 households and provided 91,154 products and services (3.00 products & services per household) to these households.
Deliver gains in operational excellence: Our management team believes that becoming and remaining a high-performance financial services company will depend upon seamlessly and consistently delivering operational excellence, as demonstrated by the Company’s leadership in the origination and servicing of residential mortgage loans. As of December 31, 2020, the Company serviced 8,543 residential mortgage loans with a principal balance of $1.3 billion. As of December 31, 2019, the Company serviced 8,155 loans with a principal balance of $1.2 billion.
Sustain asset quality: As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s asset quality metrics remained strong. Specifically, total nonperforming assets were $7.3 million, or 0.58 percent of total assets. Total delinquent loans at December 31, 2020 were 0.75 percent of total loans. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had total nonperforming assets of $5.3 million, or 0.51 percent of total assets. Total delinquent loans at December 31, 2019 were 0.28 percent of total loans.
Critical Accounting Policies
The accounting and reporting policies of the Company are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and conform to general practices within the banking industry. The Company’s significant accounting policies are described in detail in the notes to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. The Company’s financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions and are integral to the understanding of reported results. Critical accounting policies are those policies that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and results, and they require management to make estimates that are difficult, subjective or complex.
Allowance for Loan Losses: The allowance for loan losses provides coverage for probable losses inherent in the Company’s loan portfolio. Management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses each quarter based on changes, if any, in the nature and amount of problem assets and associated collateral, underwriting activities, loan portfolio composition (including product mix and geographic, industry or customer-specific concentrations), trends in loan performance, regulatory guidance and economic factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires the use of significant management estimates. Many factors can affect management’s estimates of specific and expected losses, including volatility of default probabilities, rating migrations, loss severity and economic and political conditions. The allowance is increased through provisions charged to operating earnings and reduced by net charge offs.
The Company determines the amount of the allowance based on relative risk characteristics of the loan portfolio. The allowance recorded for commercial loans is based on reviews of individual credit relationships and an analysis of the migration of commercial loans and actual loss experience. The allowance recorded for homogeneous consumer loans is based on an analysis of loan mix, risk characteristics of the portfolio, fraud loss and bankruptcy experiences, and historical losses, adjusted for current trends, for each homogeneous category or group of loans. The allowance for credit losses relating to impaired loans is based on each impaired loan’s observable market price, the collateral for certain collateral-dependent loans, or the discounted cash flows using the loan’s effective interest rate.
Regardless of the extent of the Company’s analysis of customer performance, portfolio trends or risk management processes, certain inherent, but undetected, losses are probable within the loan portfolio. This is due to several factors including inherent delays in obtaining information regarding a customer’s financial condition or changes in their unique business conditions, the subjective nature of individual loan valuations, collateral assessments and the interpretation of economic trends. Volatility of economic or customer-specific conditions affecting the identification and estimation of losses for larger non-homogeneous credits and the sensitivity of assumptions utilized to establish allowances for homogenous groups of loans are also factors. The Company estimates a range of inherent losses related to the existence of these exposures. The estimates are based upon the Company’s evaluation of imprecise risk associated with the commercial and consumer allowance levels and the estimated impact of the current economic environment.
Goodwill and Other Intangibles: The Company records all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions, including goodwill and other intangibles, at fair value as required. Goodwill is subject, at a minimum, to annual tests for impairment. Other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using straight-line and accelerated methods, and are subject to impairment if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount. The initial goodwill and other intangibles recorded and subsequent impairment analysis requires management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of how the acquired asset will perform in the future. Events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include, among others, customer attrition, changes in revenue growth trends, specific industry conditions and changes in competition.
Deferred Tax Liability: The Company has evaluated its deferred tax liability to determine if it is more likely than not that the liability will be realized in the future. The Company’s most recent evaluation has determined that the Company will more likely than not be able to realize the remaining deferred tax liability.
Income Tax Accounting: The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return. The provision for income taxes is based upon income in the consolidated financial statements, rather than amounts reported on our income tax return. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in rates on the deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date.

Loans held for investment increased $47.2 million, or 5.7 percent, to $872.7 million at December 31, 2020. The largest component of this increase was in commercial business loans, which rose $55.7 million. The 2020 results were impacted by the Company’s participation in the PPP, which increased commercial balances by approximately $70.5 million. In addition, the Company acquired the Edon State Bank in June of 2020 that increased loan balances by $16.4 million.

The Company’s loan loss allowance at December 31, 2020, now covers nonperforming loans at 174 percent, up from 137 percent at December 31, 2019.
As detailed in the risk factors, the CARES Act provided for significant consumer and small business relief due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company provided payment relief to a number of consumer and small business customers throughout 2020. As detailed in the table below, loans in forbearance/deferral status as of December 31, 2020 were $23.2 million. An additional $11.7 million of sold mortgage relationships were also in deferral at year-end.
Regulatory capital reporting is required for State Bank only, as the Company is now exempt from quarterly regulatory capital level measurement pursuant to the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement. As of December 31, 2020, State Bank met all regulatory capital levels required to be considered well-capitalized (See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
Earnings Summary - 2020 vs.
Net income for 2020 was $14.9 million, or $1.96 per diluted share, compared with net income of $12.0 million and net income available to common of $11.0 million, or $1.51 per diluted share, for 2019. State Bank reported net income for 2020 of $16.0 million, which was up from the $12.5 million in net income in 2019. SBFG Title reported net income for 2020 of $0.6 million, which was up from the $0.3 million in 2019.
Positive results for 2020 included loan growth of $47.2 million, and deposit growth of $208.8 million. The mortgage banking business line continues to contribute significant revenues, with residential real estate loan production of $694.2 million for the year, resulting in $25.4 million of revenue from gains on sale. The level of mortgage origination was up from the $445.3 million in 2019. The Company’s loans serviced for others ended the year at $1.3 billion, up from $1.2 billion at December 31, 2019. The Company realized over $1.4 million in revenue from the PPP initiative.
Operating revenue was up compared to the prior year by $13.2 million, or 25.0 percent, which was impacted by a $3.6 million temporary OMSR impairment. Our 2020 results include the full year impact from SBFG Title with net income of $0.6 million, and SB Captive, with net income of $0.9 million. Net interest margin on a fully tax equivalent basis (“FTE”) for 2020 was 3.36 percent, down 46 basis points from 2019.
Operating expense was up compared to the prior year by $5.7 million, or 15.2 percent, due to compensation and fringe benefit cost increases as a result of higher mortgage commission levels. Operating leverage (growth in revenue divided by growth in operating expense) for the year was a positive 1.6 times.
Net charge offs for 2020 of $0.68 million resulted in a loan loss provision of $4.5 million, compared to net charge offs of $0.21 million and a $0.8 million loan loss provision in 2019.
Results of Operations
1 Operating revenue equals net interest income plus noninterest income.
Net interest income was $35.9 million for 2020 compared to $34.8 million for 2019, an increase of $1.1 million or 3.2 percent. Average earning assets increased to $1.07 billion in 2020, compared to $915.0 million in 2019, an increase of $157.4 million or 17.2 percent due to higher loan volume. The consolidated 2020 full year net interest margin on an FTE basis decreased 46 basis points to 3.36 percent compared to 3.82 percent for the full year of 2019. PPP activity during 2020 increased margin revenue by $2.0 million for the full year of 2020. We will continue to realize fee income from the forgiveness of these Phase I PPP loans throughout 2021 and we are beginning Phase II of the program in early 2021.
Provision for loan losses of $4.5 million was taken in 2020 compared to $0.8 million taken for 2019. For 2020, net charge offs totaled $0.68 million, or 0.08 percent of average loans. This charge off level was higher than 2019, in which net charge offs were $0.21 million or 0.03 percent of average loans.
Total noninterest income was $30.1 million for 2020 compared to $18.0 million for 2019, representing an increase of $12.1 million, or 67.0 percent, year-over-year. This increase was driven by a 201.3 percent increase in gains on sale of residential real estate loans and the addition of our title agency. The Company sold $598.5 million of originated mortgages into the secondary market in 2020, which allowed our serviced loan portfolio to grow to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2020 from $1.2 billion at December 31, 2019. The higher servicing balance of the portfolio led to the 13.7 percent increase in mortgage loan servicing income. Sales of non-mortgage loans (small business and farm credits) decreased in 2020 as compared to 2019, as SBA activity was focused on the PPP initiative. The Company continued to expand its wealth management assets under care, which resulted in a 4.9 percent increase in wealth fee income.
Total noninterest expense was $43.1 million for 2020 compared to $37.4 million for 2019, representing a $5.7 million, or 15.2 percent, increase year-over-year. Total full-time equivalent employees ended 2020 at 244, which was down 8 from year end 2019.
Salaries and benefits were driven by higher compensation costs in the mortgage division. Professional fees were higher due to higher spending on legal in connection with acquisition activities. The addition of our title agency added $0.5 million in operating expense for the year. Our acquisition of The Edon State Bank Company of Edon, Ohio in June 2020 added $1.2 million in merger related non-recurring expense and a minimal amount of ongoing operating expense.

Goodwill, Intangibles and Capital Purchases
The Company completed its most recent annual goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, the Company’s reporting unit was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, including goodwill. The qualitative assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, resulting in no impairment. The main changes to goodwill for the year included the purchase of the Edon State Bank. The Company’s goodwill is further reviewed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Management plans to continue from time to time to purchase additional premises and equipment and improve current facilities to meet the current and future needs of the Company’s customers. These purchases will include buildings, leasehold improvements, furniture and equipment. Management expects that cash on hand and cash generated from current operations will fund these capital expenditures and purchases.
Liquidity
Liquidity relates primarily to the Company’s ability to fund loan demand, meet deposit customers’ withdrawal requirements and provide for operating expenses. Sources used to satisfy these needs consist of cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions, securities available-for-sale, loans held for sale and borrowings from various sources. These assets, excluding the borrowings, are commonly referred to as liquid assets. Liquid assets were $303.2 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $135.3 million at December 31, 2019.
The Company’s commercial real estate, first mortgage residential, agricultural and multi-family mortgage portfolio of $608.4 million at December 31, 2020, can and is readily used to collateralize borrowings, which is an additional source of liquidity. Management believes the Company’s current liquidity level, without these borrowings, is sufficient to meet its current and anticipated liquidity needs. At December 31, 2020, all eligible commercial real estate, residential first, multi-family mortgage and agricultural loans were pledged under a Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) blanket lien.
Significant additional off-balance-sheet liquidity is available in the form of FHLB advances, unused federal funds lines from correspondent banks and the national certificate of deposit market. Management expects the risk of changes in off-balance-sheet arrangements to be immaterial to earnings. Based on the current collateralization requirements of the FHLB, approximately $103.5 million of additional borrowing capacity existed at December 31, 2020.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had $41.0 million in federal funds lines available. The Company also had $67.5 million in unpledged securities at December 31, 2020 available for additional borrowings.
The cash flow statements for the periods presented provide an indication of the Company’s sources and uses of cash as well as an indication of the ability of the Company to maintain an adequate level of liquidity. A discussion of the cash flow statements for 2020 and 2019 follows:
The Company experienced positive cash flows from operating activities in 2020 and 2019. Net cash from operating activities was $23.9 million and $18.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Significant operating items for 2020 included gain on sale of loans of $25.8 million and net income of $14.9 million. Cash provided by the sale of loans held for sale were $603.2 million. Cash used in the origination of loans held for sale were $582.5 million.
The Company experienced negative cash flows from investing activities in 2020 and 2019. Net cash used in investing activities was $57.2 million and $67.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The changes for 2020 include the purchase of available-for-sale securities of $129.8 million, and net increase in loans of $31.7 million. The changes for 2019 include the purchase of available-for-sale securities of $22.5 million and net increase in loans of $65.5 million. The Company had proceeds from repayments, maturities, sales and calls of securities of $84.0 million and $22.5 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The Company experienced positive cash flows from financing activities in 2020 and 2019. Net cash from financing activities was $146.9 million and $27.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Positive cash flows of $157.7 million and $37.7 million is attributable to the change in deposits for 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The Company uses an Economic Value of Equity (“EVE”) analysis to measure risk in the balance sheet incorporating all cash flows over the estimated remaining life of all balance sheet positions. The EVE analysis calculates the net present value of the Company’s assets and liabilities in rate shock environments that range from -400 basis points to +400 basis points. The results of this analysis are reflected in the following table.
