ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The purpose of this discussion is to focus on significant changes in the financial condition and results of operations of the Company during the past three years. The discussion and analysis are intended to supplement and highlight information contained in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and the selected financial data presented elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
RECLASSIFICATION
In certain circumstances, reclassifications have been made to prior period information to conform to the 2020 presentation. There were no material reclassifications.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The accounting and reporting policies followed by the Company conform with GAAP and to general practices within the banking industry. The Company's critical accounting policies, which are summarized below, relate to (1) the allowance for loan losses, (2) mergers and acquisitions, (3) acquired loans with specific credit-related deterioration, (4) goodwill and intangible assets, (5) deferred tax assets and liabilities, and (6) other-than-temporary impairment of securities. A summary of the Company's significant accounting policies is set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The financial information contained within the Company's financial statements is, to a significant extent, financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset, or relieving a liability. In addition, GAAP itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method.
Allowance for Loan Losses
The purpose of the allowance for loan losses ("ALLL") is to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses and by recoveries of previously charged-off loans. Loan charge-offs decrease the allowance.
The goal of the Company is to maintain an appropriate, systematic, and consistently applied process to determine the amounts of the ALLL and the provision for loan loss expense.
The Company uses certain practices to manage its credit risk. These practices include (1) appropriate lending limits for loan officers, (2) a loan approval process, (3) careful underwriting of loan requests, including analysis of borrowers, cash flows, collateral, and market risks, (4) regular monitoring of the portfolio, including diversification by type and geography, (5) review of loans by the Loan Review department, which operates independently of loan production (the Loan Review function consists of a co-sourced arrangement using both internal personnel and external vendors to provide the Company with a more robust review function of the loan portfolio), (6) regular meetings of the Credit Committee to discuss portfolio and policy changes and make decisions on large or unusual loan requests, and (7) regular meetings of the Asset Quality Committee which reviews the status of individual loans.
Risk grades are assigned as part of the loan origination process. From time to time, risk grades may be modified as warranted by the facts and circumstances surrounding the credit.
Calculation and analysis of the ALLL is prepared quarterly by the Finance Department with input from the Credit Department. The Company's Credit Committee, Risk and Compliance Committee, Audit Committee, and the Board of Directors review the allowance for adequacy.
The Company's ALLL has two basic components: the formula allowance and the specific allowance. Each of these components is determined based upon estimates and judgments.
The formula allowance uses historical loss experience as an indicator of future losses, along with various qualitative factors, including levels and trends in delinquencies, nonaccrual loans, charge-offs and recoveries, trends in volume and terms of loans, effects of changes in underwriting standards, experience of lending staff, economic conditions, portfolio concentrations, regulatory, legal, competition, quality of loan review system, and value of underlying collateral. In the formula allowance for commercial and commercial real estate loans, the historical loss rate is combined with the qualitative factors, resulting in an adjusted loss factor for each risk-grade category of loans. The period-end balances for each loan risk-grade category are multiplied by the adjusted loss factor. Allowance calculations for residential real estate and consumer loans are calculated based on historical losses for each product category without regard to risk grade. This loss rate is combined with qualitative factors resulting in an adjusted loss factor for each product category.
The specific allowance uses various techniques to arrive at an estimate of loss for specifically identified impaired loans. These include:
•
The present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate. The effective interest rate on a loan is the rate of return implicit in the loan (that is, the contractual interest rate adjusted for any net deferred loan fees or costs and any premium or discount existing at the origination or acquisition of the loan);
•
The loan's observable market price; or
•
The fair value of the collateral, net of estimated costs to dispose, if the loan is collateral dependent.
The use of these computed values is inherently subjective and actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates.
No single statistic, formula, or measurement determines the adequacy of the allowance. Management makes subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, and different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. For analytical purposes, management allocates a portion of the allowance to specific loan categories and specific loans. However, the entire allowance is used to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio, including identified and unidentified losses.
The relationships and ratios used in calculating the allowance, including the qualitative factors, may change from period to period as facts and circumstances evolve. Furthermore, management cannot provide assurance that in any particular period the Bank will not have sizable credit losses in relation to the amount reserved. Management may find it necessary to significantly adjust the allowance, considering current factors at the time.
Mergers and Acquisitions
Business combinations are accounted for under the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 805, Business Combinations, using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method of accounting requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date measured at their fair values as of that date. To determine the fair values, the Company will rely on third party valuations, such as appraisals, or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation techniques. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the Company will identify the acquirer and the closing date and apply applicable recognition principles and conditions.
Acquisition-related costs are costs the Company incurs to effect a business combination. Those costs include advisory, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional or consulting fees. Some other examples of costs to the Company include systems conversions, integration planning, consultants, and advertising costs. The Company will account for acquisition-related costs as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred and the services are received, with one exception. The costs to issue debt or equity securities will be recognized in accordance with other applicable GAAP. These acquisition-related costs have been and will be included within the consolidated statements of income classified within the noninterest expense caption.
Acquired Loans with Specific Credit-Related Deterioration
Acquired loans with specific credit deterioration are accounted for by the Company in accordance with FASB ASC 310-30, Receivables - Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality. Certain acquired loans, those for which specific credit-related deterioration since origination is identified, are recorded at the amount paid, such that there is no carryover of the seller's allowance for loan losses. Income recognition on these loans is based on a reasonable expectation about the timing and amount of cash flows to be collected.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
The Company follows ASC 350, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which prescribes the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to initial recognition. Goodwill resulting from business combinations prior to January 1, 2009 represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill resulting from business combinations after January 1, 2009 is generally determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances exist that indicate that a goodwill impairment test should be performed. The Company has selected June 30 as the date to perform the annual impairment test. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic market conditions, the Company determined a triggering event occurred during the first quarter of 2020 and performed a qualitative assessment at March 31, 2020. As the pandemic continued, the Company performed qualitative assessments at June 30 and September 30 and a quantitative assessment at December 31, 2020. The assessments determined the fair value exceeded the carrying value and did not indicate impairment. The impact of COVID-19 on market conditions and other changes in the economic environment, operations, or other adverse events could result in future impairment charges which could have a material adverse impact on the Company's operating results. No indicators of impairment were identified during the year ended December 31, 2019. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortizing over their estimated useful lives of 10 years. Goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite life on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.
Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities
The realization of deferred income tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is "more likely than not" that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. "More likely than not" is defined as greater than a 50% chance. Management considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed.
Other-than-temporary Impairment of Securities
Impairment of securities occurs when the fair value of a security is less than its amortized cost. For debt securities, impairment is considered other-than-temporary and recognized in its entirety in net income if either (1) the Company intends to sell the security or (2) it is more-likely-than-not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If, however, the Company does not intend to sell the security and it is not more-likely-than-not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery, the Company must determine what portion of the impairment is attributable to a credit loss, which occurs when the amortized cost basis of the security exceeds the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected from the security. If there is no credit loss, there is no other-than-temporary impairment. If there is a credit loss, other-than-temporary impairment exists, and the credit loss must be recognized in net income and the remaining portion of impairment must be recognized in other comprehensive income.
RECENT ACQUISITION
On April 1, 2019, the Company completed its acquisition of HomeTown. The combination deepened the Company's footprint in the Roanoke, Virginia metropolitan area and created a presence in the New River Valley with an office in Christiansburg, Virginia. After the merger and with two office consolidations, the Company has eight offices in the combined Roanoke/New River Valley market area. As a result of the merger, the holders of shares of HomeTown common stock received 0.4150 shares of the Company's common stock for each share of HomeTown common stock held immediately prior to the effective date of the merger. Following completion of the merger, HomeTown's subsidiary bank, HomeTown Bank, was merged with and into the Bank.
NON-GAAP PRESENTATIONS
Non-GAAP presentations are provided because the Company believes these may be valuable to investors. These include (1) the calculation of the efficiency ratio, (2) the analysis of net interest income presented on a taxable equivalent basis to facilitate performance comparisons among various taxable and tax-exempt assets, (3) return on average tangible common equity, (4) tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio, and (5) tangible book value per share.
The efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing noninterest expense excluding (1) gains or losses on the sale of other real estate owned ("OREO"), (2) core deposit intangible amortization and (3) merger related expense by net interest income including tax equivalent income on nontaxable loans and securities and noninterest income and excluding (x) gains or losses on securities and (y) gains or losses on sale or disposal of premises and equipment. The efficiency ratio for 2020, 2019, and 2018 was 52.80%, 57.25%, and 59.20%, respectively. The Company expects this ratio to increase in 2021 as the benefits of PPP related items decrease. The efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes provides investors with important information regarding operational efficiency. Such information is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be construed as such. Management believes, however, such financial information is meaningful to the reader in understanding operating performance but cautions that such information not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP information. In addition, the Company's non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures of other companies. The Company, in referring to its net income, is referring to income under GAAP. The components of the efficiency ratio calculation are summarized in the following table (dollars in thousands):
Net interest margin is calculated by dividing tax equivalent net interest income by total average earning assets. Because a portion of interest income earned by the Company is nontaxable, the tax equivalent net interest income is considered in the calculation of this ratio. Tax equivalent net interest income is calculated by adding the tax benefit realized from interest income that is nontaxable to total interest income then subtracting total interest expense. The tax rate utilized in calculating the tax benefit is 21% for 2020, 2019, and 2018. The reconciliation of tax equivalent net interest income, which is not a measurement under GAAP, to net interest income, is reflected in the table below (in thousands):
Return on average tangible common equity is calculated by dividing net income available to common shareholders by average common equity.
Tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio is calculated by dividing period-end common equity less period-end intangibles by period-end assets less period-end intangibles.
The Company presents book value per share (period-end shareholders' equity divided by period-end common shares outstanding) and tangible book value per share. In calculating tangible book value, the Company excludes goodwill and other intangible assets.

Net Income
Net income for 2020 was $30,045,000 compared to $20,906,000 for 2019, an increase of $9,139,000, or 43.7%. Basic earnings per share were $2.74 for 2020 compared to $1.99 for 2019. Diluted earnings per share were $2.73 for 2020 compared to $1.98 for 2019. This net income produced for 2020 a return on average assets of 1.08%, a return on average common equity of 9.12%, and a return on average tangible common equity of 13.19%.
The increase in earnings in 2020 was primarily related to the April 1, 2019 merger with HomeTown as the Company realized a full year of operations from the combined entities and 2019 earnings were impacted adversely by $11,782,000 in one-time merger expenses.
Net income for 2019 was $20,906,000 compared to $22,579,000 for 2018, a decrease of $1,673,000, or 7.4%. Basic earnings per share were $1.99 for 2019 compared to $2.60 for 2018. Diluted earnings per share were $1.98 for 2019 compared to $2.59 for 2018. This net income produced for 2019 a return on average assets of 0.91%, a return on average common equity of 7.16%, and a return on average tangible common equity of 10.43%.
The decrease in earnings in 2019 was primarily related to the April 1, 2019 merger with HomeTown, as earnings were impacted adversely by $11,782,000 in one-time merger expenses. Partially offsetting this impact were increases in net interest income associated with higher loan yields and greater loan volume also associated with the HomeTown acquisition augmented by organic growth throughout the rest of the Company's franchise.
Net Interest Income
Net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets, primarily loans and securities, and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities, primarily deposits and borrowings. Fluctuations in interest rates as well as volume and mix changes in earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can materially impact net interest income. Mergers including the most recent 2019 acquisition of HomeTown impacted net interest income positively for 2020, 2019, and 2018 through increased earning assets.
The following discussion of net interest income is presented on a taxable equivalent basis to facilitate performance comparisons among various taxable and tax-exempt assets, such as certain state and municipal securities. A tax rate of 21% was used in adjusting interest on tax-exempt assets to a fully taxable equivalent basis for 2020, 2019, and 2018. Net interest income divided by average earning assets is referred to as the net interest margin. The net interest spread represents the difference between the average rate earned on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities. All references in this section relate to average yields and rates and average asset and liability balances during the periods discussed.
Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased $6,612,000, or 8.5%, in 2020 from 2019, following a $17,846,000, or 29.9%, increase in 2019 from 2018. The increase in net interest income in 2020 was primarily due to increased volume of earning assets. Average loan balances for 2020 were up $310,962,000 or 18.2%, over 2019, primarily due to PPP lending. These loans had a net balance of $211,275,000 at December 31, 2020, earn 1% interest and generated fee income that is being accreted over the life of the loans. The fee accretion contributed to the yield on the PPP portfolio, but the much lower effective rate contributed to decreased loan yields for 2020. PPP yield may be positively impacted in future periods due to forgiveness and recognition of net fees. Net interest margin benefited from $6.1 million in interest earned on these loans, net of deferred fees and costs. Loan yields overall for 2020 were 50 basis points lower than 2019, reflecting a much lower rate environment during the period and the effect of PPP lending.
Yields on loans were 4.36% in 2020 compared to 4.86% in 2019. Cost of funds was 0.72% in 2020 compared to 1.08% in 2019. Between 2020 and 2019, deposit rates for demand accounts decreased to 0.09% from 0.12%, money market accounts decreased to 0.46% from 1.18%, and time deposits decreased to 1.52% from 1.58%. The net interest margin was 3.30% for 2020, compared to 3.68% for 2019. The decrease in net interest margin was driven by declining interest rates and the impact of the lower rate on the PPP lending.
In 2020, the FOMC, in response to the COVID-19 crisis, reduced the target federal funds rate by 0.50% on March 3 and by another 1.00% on March 15, taking the federal funds target rate down to 0.25% where it remained for the rest of the year.
Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased $17,846,000, or 29.9%, in 2019 from 2018, following a $2,564,000, or 4.5%, increase in 2018 from 2017. The increase in net interest income in 2019 was primarily due to increased volumes of earning assets and higher loan yields related to the acquisition of HomeTown coupled with organic growth in the legacy bank.
The following presentation is an analysis of net interest income and related yields and rates, on a taxable equivalent basis, for the last three years. Nonaccrual loans are included in average balances. Interest income on nonaccrual loans, if recognized, is recorded on a cash basis or when the loan returns to accrual status.

(1) Interest income includes net accretion/amortization of acquired loan fair value adjustments and the net accretion/amortization of deferred loan fees/costs.
(2) Nonaccrual loans are included in the average balances.
(3) A tax rate of 21% in 2020, 2019, and 2018 was used in adjusting interest on tax-exempt assets to a fully taxable equivalent basis.
The following table presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense, and distinguishes between changes resulting from fluctuations in average balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities (volume) and changes resulting from fluctuations in average interest rates on such assets and liabilities (rate). Changes attributable to both volume and rate have been allocated proportionately (dollars in thousands):
Changes in Net Interest Income (Rate / Volume Analysis)
Fair Value Impact to Net Interest Margin
The Company's fully taxable equivalent net interest margin includes the impact of acquisition accounting fair value adjustments. The impact of net accretion for 2018, 2019, and 2020 and the remaining estimated net accretion are reflected in the following table (dollars in thousands):
Noninterest Income
For the year ended December 31, 2020, noninterest income increased $1,673,000, or 11.0%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
A substantial portion of trust fees are earned based on account fair values, so changes in the equity markets may have a large and potentially volatile impact on revenue. Trust fees increased $197,000 for 2020 compared to 2019. Other fees and commissions increased $232,000 in 2020 compared to 2019, while service charges decreased $309,000. Due to the actions taken to combat COVID-19, such as stay-at-home orders and restaurant and retail changes, debit card income decreased as consumers did not spend at the same levels in 2020 as 2019. The Company saw decreases in overdraft and related fees, another component of service charge income, caused by consumer spending decreases during the same period. Mortgage banking income increased $1,075,000 for 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in 2020 is a result of historically low rates in 2020 resulting in increased application volume for new purchases and refinancing of existing loans. Net securities gains increased $207,000 in 2020 compared to 2019, while income from Small Business Investment Companies ("SBICs") investments increased $59,000. The year ended December 31, 2020 benefitted from reduced losses on premises and equipment. Other noninterest income for 2020 was reduced by a loss on the sale of repossessed assets of $139,000.
Trust fees remained stable while service charges increased $411,000 for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the HomeTown acquisition. Other fees and commissions increased $1,056,000 in 2019 compared to 2018, mostly as a result of the acquisition but also from the strength of increased debit card fee revenue. As a result of increased volume, mortgage banking income increased $577,000 in 2019 over 2018. Net securities gains were up $484,000, or 393.5%. Income from SBICs investments decreased $426,000 or 66.9% for 2019 compared to 2018. Net gains (losses) on premises and equipment were a loss of $427,000 for 2019 compared to a gain of $60,000 in 2018. The loss was primarily due to a write-down of carrying value on existing equipment in connection with an ATM replacement initiative.
Noninterest Expense
For the year ended December 31, 2020, noninterest expense decreased $11,509,000, or 17.4%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
Salaries and employee benefits decreased $250,000 in 2020 as compared to 2019. Total full-time equivalent employees ("FTEs") were 342 at end of 2020, down from 355 at the end of 2019; however, 2020 was impacted by pension and salary expenses resulting from voluntary early retirement package costs. Contributing to the decrease was a reduction in salary expenses of $1.7 million for the deferral of loan costs related to PPP originations. The FDIC assessment expense in 2020 and 2019 was positively impacted by the Small Bank Assessment Credit, which reduced insurance expense $75,000 in 2020 and $492,000 in 2019. Core deposit intangible amortization increased $239,000 in 2020 compared to 2019 due to the HomeTown acquisition. Merger related expenses, which are related to the HomeTown acquisition and are nonrecurring in nature, totaled $11,782,000 during 2019. The increased expense for data processing in 2020 compared to 2019 of $450,000 was attributable to the increased costs as a result of a larger customer base after the HomeTown merger. The decrease in other noninterest expense in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to reduced travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic and increased synergies from the HomeTown acquisition.
Salaries and employee benefits increased $5,136,000, or 20.6%, in 2019 compared to 2018. Total FTEs were 355 at the end of 2019, up from 305 at the end of 2018, for an increase of 50 FTEs primarily associated with the HomeTown acquisition. Occupancy and equipment expense increased $1,039,000 in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the acquisition. The FDIC assessment expense in 2019 was positively impacted by the Small Bank Assessment Credit, which reduced insurance expense $492,000. Core deposit intangible amortization increased $1,133,000 in 2019 compared to 2018, and data processing expense increased $876,000 in 2019 compared to 2018, again as a result of the merger. Merger related expenses, which are related to the HomeTown acquisition and are nonrecurring in nature, totaled $11,782,000 during 2019 compared to $872,000 in 2018.
Income Taxes
Income taxes on 2020 earnings amounted to $7,137,000, resulting in an effective tax rate of 19.2%, compared to 18.9% in 2019 and 20.0% in 2018. As a result of the enactment of the CARES Act, the Company recognized in the first quarter of 2020 a tax benefit for the net operating loss ("NOL") five-year carryback provision for the NOL acquired in the HomeTown merger. The rate increased as the Company recognized less tax exempt income in 2020. An income tax benefit was realized for the difference between the current corporate income tax rate of 21% and the higher federal corporate tax rate of 35% prior to 2018.
The effective tax rate is lowered by income that is not taxable for federal income tax purposes. The primary nontaxable income is from state and municipal securities and loans.
Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices
The majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and therefore differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories. The most significant effect of inflation is on noninterest expenses that tend to rise during periods of inflation. Changes in interest rates have a greater impact on a financial institution's profitability than do the effects of higher costs for goods and services. Through its balance sheet management practices, the Company has the ability to react to those changes and measure and monitor its interest rate and liquidity risk.
Market Risk Management
Effectively managing market risk is essential to achieving the Company's financial objectives. Market risk reflects the risk of economic loss resulting from changes in interest rates and market prices. The Company is generally not subject to currency exchange risk or commodity price risk. The Company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk; however, market risk also includes liquidity risk. Both are discussed in the following sections.
Interest Rate Risk Management
Interest rate risk and its impact on net interest income is a primary market risk exposure. The Company manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through policies approved by its Asset Liability Committee ("ALCO") and Board of Directors, both of which receive and review periodic reports of the Company's interest rate risk position.
The Company uses computer simulation analysis to measure the sensitivity of projected earnings to changes in interest rates. Simulation takes into account current balance sheet volumes and the scheduled repricing dates, instrument level optionality, and maturities of assets and liabilities. It incorporates numerous assumptions including growth, changes in the mix of assets and liabilities, prepayments, and average rates earned and paid. Based on this information, management uses the model to project net interest income under multiple interest rate scenarios.
A balance sheet is considered asset sensitive when its earning assets (loans and securities) reprice faster or to a greater extent than its liabilities (deposits and borrowings). An asset sensitive balance sheet will produce relatively more net interest income when interest rates rise and less net interest income when they decline. Based on the Company's simulation analysis, management believes the Company's interest sensitivity position at December 31, 2020 is asset sensitive.
Earnings Simulation
The table below shows the estimated impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income as of December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands), assuming instantaneous and parallel changes in interest rates, and consistent levels of assets and liabilities. Net interest income for the following twelve months is projected to increase when interest rates are higher than current rates.
Estimated Changes in Net Interest Income
__________________________
(1) This scenario is deemed invalid at this time due to the current low interest rate environment.
Management cannot predict future interest rates or their exact effect on net interest income. Computations of future effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. Certain limitations are inherent in such computations. Assets and liabilities may react differently than projected to changes in market interest rates. The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag changes in market interest rates. Interest rate shifts may not be parallel.
Changes in interest rates can cause substantial changes in the amount of prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed securities, which may in turn affect the Company's interest rate sensitivity position. Additionally, credit risk may rise if an interest rate increase adversely affects the ability of borrowers to service their debt.
Economic Value Simulation
Economic value simulation is used to calculate the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities over different interest rate environments. Economic values are calculated based on discounted cash flow analysis. The net economic value of equity is the economic value of all assets minus the economic value of all liabilities. The change in net economic value over different rate environments is an indication of the longer-term earnings capability of the balance sheet. The same assumptions are used in the economic value simulation as in the earnings simulation. The economic value simulation uses instantaneous rate shocks to the balance sheet.
The following table reflects the estimated change in net economic value over different rate environments using economic value simulation for the balances at the period ended December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands):

Liquidity Risk Management
Liquidity is the ability of the Company in a timely manner to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities. Liquidity management involves maintaining the Company's ability to meet the daily cash flow requirements of its customers, whether they are borrowers requiring funds or depositors desiring to withdraw funds. Additionally, the Company requires cash for various operating needs including dividends to shareholders, the servicing of debt, and the payment of general corporate expenses. The Company manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and liquidity needs through policies approved by the ALCO and Board of Directors, both of which receive periodic reports of the Company's interest rate risk and liquidity position. The Company uses a computer simulation model to assist in the management of the future liquidity needs of the Company.
Liquidity sources include on balance sheet and off balance sheet sources.
Balance sheet liquidity sources include cash, amounts due from banks, loan repayments, bond maturities and calls, and increases in deposits. Further, the Company maintains a large, high quality, very liquid bond portfolio, which is generally 50% to 60% unpledged and would, accordingly, be available for sale if necessary.
Off balance sheet sources include lines of credit from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta ("FHLB"), federal funds lines of credit, and access to the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond's discount window.
The Company has a line of credit with the FHLB, equal to 30% of the Company's assets, subject to the amount of collateral pledged. Under the terms of its collateral agreement with the FHLB, the Company provides a blanket lien covering all of its residential first mortgage loans, home equity lines of credit, commercial real estate loans and commercial construction loans. In addition, the Company pledges as collateral its capital stock in and deposits with the FHLB. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no principal advance obligations to the FHLB. The Company had outstanding $245,000,000 in FHLB letters of credit at December 31, 2020 compared to $170,000,000 in letters of credit at December 31, 2019. The letters of credit provide the Bank with additional collateral for securing public entity deposits above FDIC insurance levels, thereby providing less need for collateral pledging from the securities portfolio and accordingly increasing the Company's balance sheet liquidity.
Short-term borrowing is discussed in Note 11 and long-term borrowing is discussed in Note 12 of the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
The Company has federal funds lines of credit established with correspondent banks in the amount of $60,000,000 and has access to the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond's discount window. There were no amounts outstanding under these facilities at December 31, 2020. The Company, through its subsidiary bank, has a relationship with Promontory Network, the sponsoring entity for the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service® ("CDARS"). Through CDARS, the Company is able to provide deposit customers with access to aggregate FDIC insurance in amounts far exceeding $250,000. This gives the Company the ability, as and when needed, to attract and retain large deposits from insurance sensitive customers. Under the EGRRCPA signed into law on May 24, 2018, a well-capitalized bank with a CAMELS rating of 1 or 2 may hold reciprocal deposits up to the lesser of 20% of its total liabilities or $5 billion without those deposits being treated as brokered deposits. With CDARS, the Company has the option to keep deposits on balance sheet or sell them to other members of the network. Additionally, subject to certain limits, the Company can use CDARS to purchase cost-effective funding without collateralization and in lieu of generating funds through traditional brokered CDs or the FHLB. Thus, CDARS serves as a deposit-gathering tool and an additional liquidity management tool. Deposits through the CDARS program as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $4,342,000 and $14,864,000, respectively.
The Bank also participates with the Promontory Network using Insured Cash Sweep®, a product which provides the Bank the capability of providing additional deposit insurance to customers in the context of a money market account arrangement. The product is analogous to the CDARS product discussed above.
COVID-19 and the participation in the PPP and the DAP programs could significantly impact the Company's liquidity. Average deposits grew 22.3% in 2020 compared to 2019, partially due to customer deposits of loan proceeds from participation in the PPP program. Customers have continued to maintain higher cash balances throughout the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2020 as future liquidity needs remain uncertain. This buildup of cash reserves primarily accounts for the significant increase over the same period of 2019. Management believes that the resources available to the Company will provide sufficient and timely liquidity, both on and off the balance sheet to support the programs and operations.
BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS
Securities
The securities portfolio generates income, plays a strategic role in the management of interest rate sensitivity, provides a source of liquidity, and is used to meet collateral requirements. The securities portfolio consists of high quality investments, mostly federal agency, mortgage-backed, and state and municipal securities.
The Company is cognizant of the continuing historically low and currently steady rate environment and has elected to execute an asset liability strategy of purchasing high quality taxable securities with relatively low optionality and short and overall balanced duration.
The following table presents information on the amortized cost, maturities, and taxable equivalent yields of available for sale securities at the end of the last three years (dollars in thousands):
The Company adopted ASU 2016-01 effective January 1, 2018 and had no equity securities at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The Company recognized in income $333,000 of unrealized holding gains during 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company sold $445,000 in equity securities at fair value.
Loans
The loan portfolio consists primarily of commercial and residential real estate loans, commercial loans to small and medium-sized businesses, construction and land development loans, and home equity loans. At December 31, 2020, the commercial real estate portfolio included concentrations of $75,235,000, $44,738,000 and $190,840,000 in hotel, restaurants, and retail, respectively. The concentrations total 15.5% of total loans, excluding loans in process.
Average loans increased $310,962,000, or 18.2%, from 2019 to 2020, primarily related to PPP lending. Average loans increased $371,432,000, or 27.9%, from 2018 to 2019, mostly impacted by the HomeTown merger.
At December 31, 2020, total loans, net of deferred fees and costs, were $2,015,056,000, an increase of $184,241,000, or 10.1%, from the prior year. Excluding PPP loans of $211,275,000 at December 31, 2020, loans held for investment were slightly lower year over year.
Loans held for sale and associated with secondary mortgage activity totaled $15,591,000 at December 31, 2020 and $2,027,000 at December 31, 2019. Loan production volume was $165,755,000 and $102,708,000 for 2020 and 2019, respectively. These loans were approximately 40% purchase, 60% refinancing for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to approximately 60% purchase, 40% refinancing for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Management of the loan portfolio is organized around portfolio segments. Each segment is comprised of various loan types that are reflective of operational and regulatory reporting requirements. The following table presents the Company's portfolio as of the dates indicated by segment (dollars in thousands):
Loans
The following table provides loan balance information by geographic regions. In some circumstances, loans may be originated in one region for borrowers located in other regions (dollars in thousands):
Loans by Geographic Region
The Danville region consists of offices in Danville, Virginia and Yanceyville, North Carolina. The Central region consists of offices in Lynchburg, and Campbell County, Virginia. The Southside region consists of offices in Martinsville and Henry County, Virginia. The Eastern region consists of offices in South Boston and the counties of Halifax and Pittsylvania, Virginia. The Franklin region consists of offices in Rocky Mount and Hardy, Virginia. The Roanoke region consists of offices in Roanoke, Salem, and Roanoke County, Virginia. The New River Valley region consists of an office in Christiansburg, Virginia. The Alamance region consists of offices in Burlington, Graham, and Mebane, North Carolina. The Guilford region consists of offices in Greensboro, North Carolina. The Winston-Salem region consists of an office in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. The Triangle region consists of an office in Raleigh, North Carolina.
The Company does not participate in or have any highly leveraged lending transactions, as defined by bank regulations. The Company has no foreign loans. There were no concentrations of loans to any individual, group of individuals, business, or industry that exceeded 10% of total loans at December 31, 2020 or 2019.
The following table presents the maturity schedule of selected loan types (dollars in thousands):
Maturities of Selected Loan Types

Of the loans due after one year, $459,488 have predetermined interest rates and $83,298 have floating or adjustable interest rates.
Provision for Loan Losses
The Company had a provision for loan losses of $8,916,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a provision for loan losses of $456,000 and a negative provision for loan losses of $103,000 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The larger provision for 2020 reflects an increase in allowance requirements in response to the declining and uncertain economic landscape caused by the COVID-19 pandemic during the period. The increase in 2020 can be attributed to a measurable increase in qualitative factors related to significant contractions in economic data for both national and local economies and a significant increase in unemployment rates. The provision for 2019 primarily related to a $156,000 increase in the impaired loan reserve and loan growth during the fourth quarter of 2019. The negative provision for 2018 related to favorable adjustments on the purchased credit impaired loan loss allowance.
Allowance for Loan Losses
The purpose of the ALLL is to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses and by recoveries of previously charged-off loans. Loan charge-offs decrease the allowance.
The ALLL was $21,403,000, $13,152,000, and $12,805,000 at December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The ALLL as a percentage of loans at each of those dates was 1.06%, 0.72%, and 0.94%, respectively. Excluding PPP loans, the allowance as a percentage of loans increased to 1.19% at December 31, 2020.
The increase in the allowance as a percentage of loans during 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease in the allowance as a percentage of loans during 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to the acquired loan portfolio of HomeTown recorded at fair value with no continuing allowance and the continued high asset quality, low charge-offs, and improvement in various qualitative factors, notably economic, used in the determination of the allowance.
In an effort to better evaluate the adequacy of its ALLL, the Company computes its ASC 450, Contingencies, loan balance by reducing total loans by acquired loans and loans that were evaluated for impairment individually or smaller balance nonaccrual loans evaluated for impairment in homogeneous pools. It also adjusts its ASC 450 loan loss reserve balance total by removing allowances associated with these other pools of loans.
The general allowance, ASC 450 (FAS 5) reserves to ASC 450 loans, was 1.16% at December 31, 2020, compared to 0.87% at December 31, 2019. On a dollar basis, the reserve was $20,534,000 at December 31, 2020, compared to $12,684,000 at December 31, 2019. The percentage of the reserve to total loans has increased due to economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. This segment of the allowance represents by far the largest portion of the loan portfolio and the largest aggregate risk.
The specific allowance, ASC 310-40 (FAS 114) reserves to ASC 310-40 loans, was 1.06% at December 31, 2020, compared to 10.51% at December 31, 2019. On a dollar basis, the reserve was $30,000 at December 31, 2020, compared to $230,000 at December 31, 2019. There is ongoing turnover in the composition of the impaired loan population, which increased $660,000 from December 31, 2019. The decrease in the specific allowance from the prior year is primarily due to the write-off of the specific reserves on two loans for which we have received a commitment to purchase.
The specific allowance does not include reserves related to acquired loans with deteriorated credit quality. This reserve was $839,000 at December 31, 2020, compared to $238,000 at December 31, 2019. This is the only portion of the reserve related to acquired loans. Cash flow expectations for these loans are reviewed on a quarterly basis and unfavorable changes in those estimates relative to the initial estimates can result in the need for specific loan loss provisions.

Nonperforming Assets (Loans and Other Real Estate Owned)
Nonperforming loans include loans on which interest is no longer accrued and accruing loans that are contractually past due 90 days or more. Nonperforming loans include loans originated and loans acquired exclusive of purchased credit impaired loans.
Nonperforming loans to total loans were 0.13% at both December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The increase in nonperforming loans during 2020 was $391,000.
Nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and foreclosed real estate. Nonperforming assets represented 0.12% at December 31, 2020 compared to 0.15% of total assets at December 31, 2019. The Company continues to monitor the significant impact to its borrowers caused by COVID-19 and anticipates increases in nonperforming assets as a result, but the total cannot be determined at this time.
In most cases, it is the policy of the Company that any loan that becomes 90 days past due will automatically be placed on nonaccrual loan status, accrued interest reversed out of income, and further interest accrual ceased. Any payments received on such loans will be credited to principal. In some cases a loan in process of renewal may become 90 days past due. In these instances the loan may still be accruing because of a delayed renewal process in which the customer has not been billed. In accounting for acquired impaired loans, such loans are not classified as nonaccrual when they become 90 days past due. They are considered to be accruing because their interest income relates to the accretable yield and not to contractual interest payments.
Loans will only be restored to full accrual status after six consecutive months of payments that were each less than 30 days delinquent. The Company strictly adheres with this policy before restoring a loan to normal accrual status.
The following table presents the Company's nonperforming asset history, including acquired impaired loans as of the dates indicated (dollars in thousands):
Nonperforming Assets
Impaired Loans
A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The following table shows loans that were considered impaired, exclusive of purchased credit impaired loans, as of the dates indicated (dollars in thousands):
Impaired Loans
Troubled Debt Restructurings
TDRs exist whenever the Company makes a concession to a customer based on the customer's financial distress that would not have otherwise been made in the normal course of business.
There were $1,976,000 in TDRs at December 31, 2020 compared to $1,058,000 at December 31, 2019.
In March 2020 (revised in April 2020), the federal banking agencies issued an "Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus." This was in response to the COVID-19 pandemic affecting societies and economies around the world. This guidance encourages financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers that may be unable to meet their contractual obligations because of the effects of COVID-19. The guidance explains that, in consultation with the FASB staff, the federal banking agencies have concluded that short-term modifications (e.g. six months) made on a good faith basis to borrowers who were current as of the implementation date of a relief program are not TDR. The CARES Act was passed by the U.S. Congress on March 27, 2020. Section 4013 of the CARES Act also addressed COVID-19 related modifications and specified that COVID-19 related modifications on loans that were current as of December 31, 2019 were not TDRs. The Bank implemented a DAP to provide relief to its borrowers under this guidance. The Bank provided assistance to customers with loan balances of $405.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Other Real Estate Owned
OREO is carried on the consolidated balance sheets at $958,000 and $1,308,000 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Foreclosed assets are initially recorded at fair value, less estimated costs to sell, at the date of foreclosure. Loan losses resulting from foreclosure are charged against the ALLL at that time. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management, and the assets are carried at the lower of the new cost basis or fair value, less estimated costs to sell, with any additional write-downs charged against earnings. For significant assets, these valuations are typically outside annual appraisals.
The following table shows OREO as of the dates indicated (dollars in thousands):
Deposits
The Company's deposits consist primarily of checking, money market, savings, and consumer and commercial time deposits. Average deposits increased $427,156,000, or 22.3%, in 2020, mostly a result of continued higher than average cash balances being maintained by customers as the uncertainty of the pandemic continues and is a trend that is consistent for all commercial banks. Average deposits increased $359,158,000, or 23.1%, from 2018 to 2019, mostly impacted by the HomeTown merger.
Period-end total deposits increased $550,783,000, or 26.7%, during 2020. Customers have continued to maintain higher cash balances as future liquidity needs remain uncertain. The Company has only a relatively small portion of its time deposits provided by wholesale sources. These include time deposits through the CDARS program, which at year end totaled $4,342,000 for 2020, $14,864,000 for 2019, and $22,431,000 for 2018. Management considers the CDARS deposits the functional equivalent of core deposits because they relate to balances derived from customers with long standing relationships with the Company.

Borrowed Funds
In addition to internal deposit generation, the Company also relies on borrowed funds as a supplemental source of funding. Borrowed funds consist of customer repurchase agreements, overnight borrowings from the FHLB and longer-term FHLB advances, subordinated debt acquired in the HomeTown merger, and trust preferred capital notes. Additionally, on August 21, 2019, the Company secured a $3,000,000 line of credit with a regional commercial bank at 0.25% under Prime that matured August 21, 2020. Customer repurchase agreements are borrowings collateralized by securities of the U.S. Government, its agencies, or Government Sponsored Enterprises ("GSEs") and generally mature daily. The Company considers these accounts to be a stable and low cost source of funds. The securities underlying these agreements remain under the Company's control. Refer to Notes 12, 13 and 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a discussion of long-term debt.
The following table presents information pertaining to the Company's short-term borrowed funds as of the dates indicated (dollars in thousands):
Short-Term Borrowings
In the regular course of conducting its business, the Company takes deposits from political subdivisions of the states of Virginia and North Carolina. At December 31, 2020, the Bank's public deposits totaled $326,774,000. The Company is legally required to provide collateral to secure the deposits that exceed the insurance coverage provided by the FDIC. This collateral can be provided in the form of certain types of government agency bonds or letters of credit from the FHLB. At year-end 2020, the Company had $245,000,000 in letters of credit with the FHLB outstanding to supplement collateral for such deposits.
Shareholders' Equity
The Company's goal with capital management is to comply with all regulatory capital requirements and to support growth, while generating acceptable returns on equity and paying a high rate of dividends.
Shareholders' equity was $337,894,000 at December 31, 2020 and $320,258,000 at December 31, 2019.
The Company declared and paid quarterly dividends totaling $1.08 per share for 2020, $1.04 per share for 2019, and $1.00 per share for 2018. Cash dividends in 2020 totaled $11,842,000 and represented a 39.4% payout of 2020 net income, compared to a 52.4% payout in 2019, and a 38.5% payout in 2018.
Effective January 1, 2015, the Company and the Bank became subject to the Basel III Capital Rules. The Basel III Capital Rules require the Company and the Bank to comply with the following minimum capital ratios: (i) a ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% "capital conservation buffer" (effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%), (ii) a ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer (effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%), (iii) a ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer (effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5%), and (iv) a leverage ratio of 4%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets. The phase-in of the capital conservation buffer requirement began on January 1, 2016, at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets, increasing by the same amount each year until it was fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. In addition, to be well capitalized under the "prompt corrective action" regulations pursuant to Section 38 of the FDIA, the Bank must have the following minimum capital ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 8.0%; (iii) a total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 10.0%; and (iv) a leverage ratio of at least 5.0%.
On August 28, 2018, the FRB issued an interim final rule required by the EGRRCPA that expands the applicability of the FRB's SBHC Policy Statement to bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $3 billion (up from the prior $1 billion threshold). Under the SBHC Policy Statement, qualifying bank holding companies, such as the Company, have additional flexibility in the amount of debt they can issue and are also exempt from the Basel III Capital Rules. However, the Company does not currently intend to issue a material amount of debt or take any other action that would cause its capital ratios to fall below the minimum ratios required by the Basel III Capital Rules. The SBHC Policy Statement does not apply to the Bank, and the Bank must comply with the Basel III Capital Rules.
On September 17, 2019, the federal banking agencies jointly issued a final rule required by the EGRRCPA that will permit qualifying banks and bank holding companies that have less than $10 billion in consolidated assets to elect to opt into the CBLR framework. Under the final rule, banks and bank holding companies that opt into the CBLR framework and maintain a CBLR of greater than 9% would not be subject to other risk-based and leverage capital requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules and will be deemed to have met the well capitalized ratio requirements under the "prompt corrective action" framework. In addition, a community bank that falls out of compliance with the framework will have a two-quarter grace period to come back into full compliance, provided its leverage ratio remains above 8%, and will be deemed well-capitalized during the grace period. The CBLR framework was first available for banking organizations to use in their March 31, 2020 regulatory reports.
On April 6, 2020, the federal bank regulatory agencies announced the issuance of two interim final rules that make changes to the CBLR framework and implement Section 4012 of the CARES Act. One interim final rule provides that, as of the second quarter of 2020, a banking organization with a leverage ratio of 8% or greater (and that meets the other existing qualifying criteria) could elect to use the CBLR framework. This rule also establishes a two-quarter grace period for a qualifying community banking organization whose leverage ratio fell below 8% so long as the banking organization maintained a leverage ratio of 7% or greater. The second interim final rule provides a transition back to the leverage ratio requirement of 9%. Under this rule, the required leverage ratio was 8% beginning in the second quarter and for the remainder of calendar year 2020 and will be 8.5% for calendar year 2021 and 9% thereafter. This rule also maintains a two-quarter grace period for a qualifying community banking organization whose leverage ratio falls no more than 1% below the applicable ratio. This transition will allow community banking organizations to focus on supporting lending to creditworthy households and businesses given the recent strains on the U.S. economy caused by COVID-19. The Company and the Bank do not currently expect to opt into the CBLR framework.
The following table represents the major regulatory capital ratios for the Company as of the dates indicated:
Management believes the Company is in compliance with all regulatory capital requirements applicable to it, and the Bank meets the requirements to be considered "well capitalized" under the prompt corrective action framework as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Stock Repurchase Programs
On December 19, 2019, the Company filed a Form 8-K with the SEC to announce the approval by its Board of Directors of a stock repurchase program. The program authorized the repurchase of up to 400,000 shares of the Company's common stock through December 31, 2020. The program was suspended since in second quarter of 2020 in an effort to conserve capital due to COVID-19.
In 2020, the Company repurchased 140,526 shares at an average cost of $35.44 per share for a total cost of $4,981,000. In 2019, the Company repurchased 85,868 shares at an average cost of $36.64 per share, for a total cost of $3,146,000. The Company did not repurchase any shares in 2018.
On January 12, 2021, the Company filed a Form 8-K with the SEC to announce the approval by its Board of Directors of another stock repurchase program. The program authorizes the repurchase of up to 350,000 shares of the Company's common stock through December 31, 2021.
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
The following items are contractual obligations of the Company as of December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands):
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ACTIVITIES
The Company enters into certain financial transactions in the ordinary course of performing traditional banking services that result in off-balance sheet transactions. Other than AMNB Statutory Trust I, formed in 2006 to issue trust preferred securities, and MidCarolina Trust I and MidCarolina Trust II, the Company does not have any off-balance sheet subsidiaries. Refer to Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a discussion of junior subordinated debt. Off-balance sheet transactions were as follows as of the dates indicated (dollars in thousands):
Commitments to extend credit to customers represent legally binding agreements with fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being funded, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future funding requirements. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company guaranteeing the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements.
