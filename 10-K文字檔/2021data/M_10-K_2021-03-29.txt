COVID-19 Impact
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the United States. The COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on the Company's 2020 operations and financial results, and the full financial impact of the pandemic cannot be reasonably estimated at this time due to uncertainty as to the severity and duration of the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to cause significant disruption to organizations and communities across the globe. The Company is navigating through the pandemic with a focus on prudent cash management, strengthening liquidity and executing its strategic initiatives. In addition, as its stores began to reopen in the second quarter of 2020, the Company prioritized the implementation of significant health and safety measures to allow its customers and colleagues to feel safe in the Company's stores and facilities. In response to the operational and financial challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the specific steps taken by the Company to manage its business through this uncertain period, include, but are not limited to, the following.
•
The Company temporarily closed all stores on March 18, 2020, which included all Macy’s, Bloomingdale’s, bluemercury, Macy’s Backstage, Bloomingdales the Outlet and Market by Macy’s stores. Stores began reopening on May 4, 2020 and substantially all of the Company's stores were open by the end of the second quarter of 2020.
•
In an effort to increase liquidity, the Company fully drew on its $1,500 million credit facility, announced the suspension of quarterly cash dividends beginning in the second quarter of 2020 and took additional steps to reduce discretionary spending. The Company's Board of Directors also rescinded its authorization of any unused amounts under the Company's share repurchase program. In June 2020, the Company completed financing activities totaling nearly $4.5 billion and used a portion of the proceeds from these activities, as well as cash on hand, to repay its credit facility. To create greater flexibility for future liquidity needs, the Company executed an exchange offer and consent solicitation in July 2020 for $465 million of previously issued unsecured notes.
•
To improve the Company's cash position and reduce its cash expenditures, the Company's Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer did not receive compensation from April 1, 2020 through June 30, 2020. In addition, the Company deferred cash expenditures where possible and temporarily implemented a furlough for the majority of its colleague population which ended for most colleagues at the beginning of July 2020. Certain executives at the director level and above not impacted by the furlough took a temporary reduction of their pay through June 30, 2020.
•
In June 2020, the Company announced a restructuring to align its cost base with anticipated near-term sales as the business recovers from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company reduced corporate and management headcount by approximately 3,900. Additionally, the Company reduced staffing across its stores portfolio, supply chain and customer support network, which it expects to adjust as sales recover. During the second quarter of 2020, the Company recognized $154 million of expense for severance related to this reduction
in force, of which substantially all has been paid as of January 30, 2021.
•
During 2020, the Company deferred occupancy payments for a significant number of its stores. Such pandemic related deferrals were included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and the Company continued to recognize expense during the deferral periods based on the contractual terms of the lease agreements. As of January 30, 2021, substantially all occupancy payment deferrals have been paid.
•
During 2020, the Company incurred approximately $200 million of non-cash impairment charges primarily related to long-lived tangible and right of use assets to adjust the carrying value of certain store locations to their estimated fair value. The Company also incurred $3,080 million of non-cash impairment charges during 2020 on goodwill as a result of the sustained decline in the Company's market capitalization and decrease in projected cash flows primarily as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
•
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company implemented work-from-home policies for its colleagues except those involved in business critical activities and functions. Such policies are expected to remain in place for the duration of the pandemic. Post-pandemic, the Company may modify work environment policies which could impact the use of certain corporate assets. Such changes could lead to additional long-lived tangible and right of use corporate asset impairment.
•
On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ("the CARES Act") was signed into law, which included payroll tax credits for employee retention, deferral of payroll taxes, and several income tax provisions, including modifications to the net interest deduction limitation, changes to certain property depreciation and carryback of certain operating losses.
The CARES Act impacted the Company's annual effective tax rate and the income tax benefit recognized during 2020. Specifically, the Company recognized an annual net operating loss that is available for carryback at a 35% federal income tax rate rather than the current 21% federal income tax rate. During 2020, the resultant benefit of this rate differential was offset by the impact of the non-tax deductible component of the goodwill impairment charge. The net impact of these items is the primary driver of the effective tax rate decrease when compared to 2019. As of January 30, 2021, the Company recognized a $520 million income tax receivable, which is included within Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Under the terms of the Amended and Restated Credit Card Program Agreement (the “Program Agreement”) between the Company and Citibank, if sales decrease by more than 34% over a twelve-month period as compared to the Benchmark Year, defined as the twelve-month period from July 2006 to June 2007 in the Program Agreement, Citibank has the ability to provide written notice to terminate the agreement prior to the end of its current term. Based on the results for the Company’s February 2021 fiscal period, sales for the most recent twelve-month period ended February 27, 2021, have decreased by more than 34% as compared to the Benchmark Year. We are in on-going discussions with Citibank concerning the Program Agreement and as of the date of this filing, the Company has not received a notice to terminate the agreement. The Company is currently unable to estimate any impact this event might have on the Program Agreement or on the Company’s future financial results.
The COVID-19 pandemic has had and continues to have a material adverse impact on the Company's operational performance, financial results and cash flows, although the full impact will depend on future developments, including the continued spread and duration of the outbreak, variant strains of COVID-19, the availability and distribution of effective medical treatments or vaccines as well as any related federal, state or local governmental orders or restrictions, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.
Management Overview
2020 was a year of unprecedented challenges and required the Company to adapt its business to address the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Faced with the temporary closure of stores and changes in consumer shopping behaviors, the Company had to right-size its cost base and operating model, offer new fulfillment options to customers, focus on product categories with higher consumer demand, and accelerate its focus on digital shopping and underlying investments to support these trends. Financial results in the first and second quarter of 2020 were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic but the Company saw sequential improvement in its operating results during the third and fourth quarters of 2020. Although uncertainty surrounds the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has positioned itself to focus on the recovery of its business in 2021 and execute on its corporate strategy for profitable growth in the future.

Polaris Strategy
On February 4, 2020, Macy’s, Inc. announced its Polaris strategy, a multi-year plan designed to stabilize profitability and position the Company for sustainable, profitable growth. Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has refined the components of the Polaris strategy to focus where the Company can drive competitive advantage and differentiation to first recover the business and then drive both top- and bottom-line growth. The Polaris strategy was designed for flexibility and this was greatly tested in 2020. Although the Company’s operations were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the Polaris strategy proved durable and allowed for a number of accomplishments in 2020, notably:
•
Increasing relevance by introducing new customers to the Macy’s brand. During 2020, Macy’s saw a 45% increase in active bronze memberships in its Star Rewards loyalty program. This increase partially offset the overall drop in active Star Rewards members, which was caused by declines in Macy’s upper loyalty program tiers. In addition, the Company launched Macy’s Media Network in 2020, a new fashion and beauty advertising platform providing a new income stream.
•
In response to the pandemic and consumer behavior, the Company expanded merchandise assortments in categories such as home, outdoor furniture, loungewear and active. In addition, new categories were added to meet emerging demand, including baby gear and skin care devices, home fragrances, outdoor recreation and
gourmet food. In total, the Company added more than 1,000 new brands to meet the demands of customers in this ever-changing environment.
•
Given the significant shift to digital shopping in 2020 that is expected to be permanent in nature, the Company accelerated its focus on and investments in digital shopping. During 2020, the Company quickly launched a curb-side pick-up fulfillment option and improved the integration of its digital and physical assets as well as the design of its digital platforms to improve customers’ shopping experiences. This focus on optimizing customers’ omnichannel experience will continue and the Company has and will continue to utilize its entire network of stores, distribution centers and vendor-direct programs to fill customer orders.
•
Through the initial Polaris restructuring efforts in February 2020 and those executed in July 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company exited 2020 with an annualized run-rate cost savings of approximately $900 million that is expected to be permanent in nature. Through focus on rigorous expense reduction, prudent cash management and execution of its 2020 financing activities, the Company ended 2020 with significant liquidity to help fund the recovery of its business and the necessary investments to execute on the Polaris strategy.
While the underlying components of the Polaris strategy are unchanged from those presented in February 2020, the components were refined during 2020 to align with customer demands in the COVID-19 pandemic environment as well as expected consumer behavior post-pandemic. The following are the key pillars of the Polaris strategy:
•
Win With Fashion and Style: Delivering fashion and style that meets core and new customer needs for all occasions through existing and new retail platforms. The Company is focusing on the transformation of its assortment architecture, fashion curation, inventory productivity, and vendor relationships to support these changes.
•
Deliver Clear Value: Build trust and deliver value to customers through simple, easy-to-understand pricing and promotions driven by advanced analytics. The Company intends to deepen core and new customer engagement through a personalized loyalty program as well as personalized communication and customer experiences across all touchpoints.
•
Excel in Digital Shopping: Deliver profitable omnichannel growth by investing in a modern, frictionless digital shopping journey, supported by a seamless user experience, immersive category-level experiences and a convenient delivery and returns experience that is fully connected to stores. To support these efforts, the Company will focus on enhancements to product discovery, the checkout process and launch of new digital business models.
•
Enhance Store Experience: Create a tech-enabled, connected omni-ecosystem that supports reimagined store experiences focused on discovery, convenience, service and engagement; delivered through a streamlined stores portfolio and new off-mall formats. The Company will enhance the connection between its store and digital channels by elevating customer experience standards across the organization, enhancing fulfillment options and providing convenience no matter where the customer shops.
•
Modernize Supply Chain: The Company is moving towards a faster and more efficient customer fulfillment infrastructure by optimizing its network to profitably support the expected continued growth in digital and provide enhanced customer delivery options to create a convenient, fast and efficient customer experience for delivery and returns.
•
Enable Transformation: Enabling and accelerating the Company’s core priorities through foundational improvements by modernizing technology platforms to support and enable growth, embedding data and analytics into every aspect of the Company’s business and defining and creating a performance-driven operation model that sets the tone, pace and expectations across the business to execute against the Polaris strategy.

Comparison of 2020 and 2019
Net Sales and Comparable Sales
Net sales for 2020 were significantly impacted by the pandemic and the temporary closure of stores during the first
and second quarters. For 2020, net sales were $17,346 million, a decrease of $7,214 million, or 29.4%, from 2019. The decrease in comparable sales on an owned basis and on an owned plus licensed basis for 2020 was 27.9% compared to 2019. Driven by changes in consumer shopping behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, digital sales grew significantly in 2020, with digital sales as a percent of net sales increasing to 44.3% from 25.3% in 2019. By family of business, home, fine jewelry and watches, fragrances, activewear and sleepwear performed well during 2020 as customers began to work, cook, dine and learn from home due to the pandemic. Driven by these changes to consumer behaviors, sales in 2020 were weaker in apparel categories such as dresses, women's and men’s sportswear and men’s tailored.
Credit Card Revenues, Net
Net credit card revenues were $751 million for 2020, a decrease of $20 million compared to $771 million recognized in 2019. Credit card penetration declined in 2020 to approximately 43% from approximately 47% in 2019. Combined with a decline in new accounts driven by temporary store closures, this decrease in credit sales drove the decrease in net credit card revenues. This was offset by an increase in profit share revenues associated with the underlying credit card portfolio performance, which was driven by improved bad debt activity and delinquencies.
Cost of Sales and Gross Margin
Cost of sales for 2020 decreased $2,885 million from 2019. The cost of sales rate as a percent to net sales of 70.8% in 2020 increased 900 basis points compared to 2019. The gross margin rate in 2020 was 29.2% compared to 38.2% in 2019. The increase in the cost of sales rate as a percent to net sales and the decrease in the gross margin rate were primarily due to increased markdowns in the first and second quarters of 2020. Higher delivery expenses associated with the increase in digital sales as well as carrier surcharges that the Company incurred in the fourth quarter of 2020 also contributed to these results.
SG&A Expenses
SG&A expenses for 2020 decreased $2,231 million and the SG&A rate as a percent to net sales increased 240 basis points, to 39.0%, from to 2019. The decrease in SG&A expenses is a reflection of lower sales as well as the implementation of various expense management strategies undertaken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These strategies include the July 2020 restructuring, a significant reduction in discretionary spending and the colleague furlough implemented in 2020.
Gains on Sale of Real Estate
The Company recognized gains of $60 million in 2020 associated with real estate sales, as compared to $162 million in 2019. 2019 included a gain of $52 million associated with the sale of the Macy's Downtown Seattle location.
Restructuring, Impairment, Store Closing and Other Costs
Restructuring, impairment, store closing and other costs for 2020 of $3,579 million included goodwill and asset impairment charges, severance and other human resource-related costs, and other costs associated with organizational changes and store closings, driven by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. 2019 costs of $354 million included costs primarily associated with the Polaris strategy, including $161 million of non-cash impairment charges associated with store closures and campus consolidations and $157 million related to severance and other human resource-related costs.
Benefit Plan Income, Net
2020 and 2019 included $54 million and $31 million, respectively, of non-cash net benefit plan income relating to the Company's defined benefit plans. This income includes the net of: interest cost, expected return on plan assets and amortization of prior service costs or credits and actuarial gains and losses.
Settlement Charges
$84 million and $58 million of non-cash settlement charges were recognized in 2020 and 2019, respectively. These charges relate to the pro-rata recognition of net actuarial losses associated with the Company’s defined benefit retirement plans and are the result of lump sum distributions associated with retiree distribution elections and restructuring activity.
Net Interest Expense
Net interest expense, excluding financing costs and losses on early retirement of debt, for 2020 increased $95 million from 2019 to $280 million. This increase was primarily driven by the financing activities executed by the Company in June 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Losses on Early Retirement of Debt
In 2019, the Company completed a tender offer debt repurchase of $525 million of senior notes and debentures. As a result of these transactions, the Company recognized $30 million in expenses and fees.
Effective Tax Rate
The Company's effective tax rate was 17.7% for 2020 and 22.5% for 2019 compared to the federal income tax statutory rate of 21%. The effective tax rate in 2020 was impacted by the non-tax deductible component of the Company’s goodwill impairment charge, which was largely offset by the benefit associated with the carryback of net operating losses permitted under the CARES Act . The effective tax rate in 2019 was impacted by the settlement of certain state and local tax matters.
Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Macy's, Inc. Shareholders
Net loss attributable to Macy's, Inc. shareholders for 2020 decreased $4,508 million to $3,944 million, compared to 2019, driven by lower operating results resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and goodwill impairment charges.
Guidance
The Company expects the COVID-19 pandemic to have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows from operations in future periods. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's operational and financial performance depends on future developments outside of the Company's control, including the duration and spread of the pandemic and related actions taken by federal, state and local government officials, and international governments to prevent disease spread. On February 23, 2021, the Company disclosed in its release of preliminary earnings its performance expectations for 2021, while acknowledging the significant uncertainty surrounding consumer behavior and economic conditions in the current environment. The Company’s annual guidance contemplates continued pandemic-related challenges in the spring season with momentum building in the back half of
2021.For a more complete discussion of the COVID-19 pandemic related risks facing the Company's business, refer to Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”

Cash Flow, Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company's principal sources of liquidity are cash from operations, cash on hand and the asset based credit facility described below.
Because of the COVID-19 outbreak, there is significant uncertainty surrounding the potential impact on the Company's results of operations and cash flows. The Company’s liquidity was negatively impacted by store closures. The Company proactively took steps to increase available cash on hand including, but not limited to, targeted reductions in discretionary operating expenses and capital expenditures, suspension of the Company's quarterly dividend and executing additional financing transactions during the second quarter of 2020 as discussed in more detail below. While the Company has obtained additional financing, due the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic, further actions may be required to improve the Company’s cash position, including but not limited to, monetizing Company assets, reinstituting colleague furloughs, and foregoing capital expenditures and other discretionary expenses.
Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities was $649 million in 2020 compared to $1,608 million in 2019. The decline was driven by lower EBITDA, which was partially offset by lower tax payments and a net improvement in merchandise inventory and payables.
Investing Activities
Net cash used by investing activities for 2020 was $325 million, compared to $1,002 million for 2019. Investing activities for 2020 included purchases of property and equipment totaling $338 million and capitalized software of $128 million, compared to purchases of property and equipment totaling $902 million and capitalized software of $255 million for 2019. In addition, property and equipment sales, primarily related to real estate, generated cash proceeds of $113 million in 2020 compared to $185 million in 2019.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by the Company for financing activities was $699 million for 2020, including debt issued of $2,780 million related to a $1,500 million draw on its revolving credit agreement and issuance of $1,300 million 8.375% senior secured notes, partially offset by repayment of the $1,500 million revolving credit facility draw and the approximate $530 million repayment of debt at maturity. 2020 also included $117 million of cash dividends paid.
Net cash used by the Company for financing activities was $1,123 million for 2019, including the repayment of $597 million of debt and the payment of $466 million of cash dividends. 2019 debt repayments included the repayment at maturity of $36 million of 8.5% senior debentures.
Secured Debt Issuance
On June 8, 2020, the Company issued $1,300 million aggregate principal amount of 8.375% senior secured notes due 2025 (the "Notes"). The Notes bear interest at a rate of 8.375% per annum, which accrues from June 8, 2020 and is payable in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The Notes mature on June 15, 2025, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased, and are subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the related indenture. The Notes were issued by Macy’s, Inc. and are secured on a first-priority basis by (i) a first mortgage/deed of trust in certain real property of subsidiaries of Macy’s, Inc. that was transferred to subsidiaries of Macy’s Propco Holdings, LLC, a newly created direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Macy’s, Inc. (“Propco”), and (ii) a pledge by Propco of the equity interests in its subsidiaries that own such transferred real property. The Notes are, jointly and severally, unconditionally guaranteed on a secured basis by Propco and its subsidiaries and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis by Macy’s Retail Holdings, LLC (f/k/a Macy’s Retail Holdings, Inc.) (“MRH”), a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Macy’s, Inc. The Company used the proceeds of the Notes offering, along with cash on hand, to repay the outstanding borrowings under the existing $1,500 million unsecured credit agreement.
Entry into Asset-Based Credit Facility
On June 8, 2020, Macy’s Inventory Funding LLC (the “ABL Borrower”), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and its parent, Macy’s Inventory Holdings LLC (the “ABL Parent”), entered into an asset-based credit agreement (“the ABL Credit Facility”) with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent, and the lenders party thereto. As of January 30, 2021, the ABL Credit Facility provides the ABL Borrower with a $2,941 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving ABL Facility”), including a swingline sub-facility and a letter of credit sub-facility. The ABL Borrower may request increases in the size of the Revolving ABL Facility up to an additional aggregate principal amount of $750 million. As of January 30, 2021, the Company had $142 million of standby letters of credit outstanding under the ABL Credit Facility, which reduces the available borrowing capacity. The Company had no borrowings outstanding under the ABL Credit Facility as of January 30, 2021.
Additionally on June 8, 2020 and concurrently with closing the ABL Credit Facility, the ABL Borrower purchased all presently existing inventory, and assumed the liabilities in respect of all presently existing and outstanding trade payables owed to vendors in respect of such inventory, from MRH and certain wholly owned subsidiaries of MRH. The ABL Credit Facility is secured on a first priority basis (subject to customary exceptions) by (i) all assets of the ABL Borrower including all such inventory and the proceeds thereof and (ii) the equity of the ABL Borrower. The ABL Parent guaranteed the ABL Borrower’s obligations under the ABL Credit Facility. The Revolving ABL Facility matures on May 9, 2024.
The ABL Credit Facility contains customary borrowing conditions including a borrowing base equal to the sum of (a) 80% (which shall automatically increase to 90% upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the delivery of an initial appraisal of the inventory) of the net orderly liquidation percentage of eligible inventory, minus (b) customary reserves. Amounts borrowed under the ABL Credit Facility are subject to interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) prior to the Step Down Date (as defined in the ABL Credit Facility), at the ABL Borrower’s option, either (a) adjusted LIBOR plus a margin of 2.75% to 3.00% or (b) a base rate plus a margin of 1.75% to 2.00%, in each case depending on revolving line utilization and (ii) after the Step Down Date, at the ABL Borrower’s option, either (a) adjusted LIBOR plus a margin of 2.25% to 2.50% or (b) a base rate plus a margin of 1.25% to 1.50%, in each case depending on revolving line utilization. The ABL Credit Facility also contains customary covenants that provide for, among other things, limitations on indebtedness, liens, fundamental changes, restricted payments, cash hoarding, and prepayment of certain indebtedness as well as customary representations and warranties and events of default typical for credit facilities of this type.
The ABL Credit Facility also requires (1) the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.00 to 1.00 as of the end of any fiscal quarter on or after April 30, 2021 if (a) certain events of default have occurred and are continuing or (b) Availability plus Suppressed Availability (each as defined in the ABL Credit Facility) is less than the greater of (x) 10% of the Loan Cap (as defined in the ABL Credit Facility) and (y) $250 million, in each case, as of the end of such fiscal quarter and (2) prior to April 30, 2021, that the ABL Borrower not permit Availability plus Suppressed Availability to be lower than the greater of (x) 10% of the Loan Cap and (y) $250 million.
Amendment to Existing Credit Agreement
On June 8, 2020, the Company substantially reduced the credit commitments of its existing $1,500 million unsecured credit agreement, which as of January 30, 2021, provides the Company with unsecured revolving credit of up to $1 million. The unsecured revolving credit facility contains covenants that provide for, among other things, limitations on fundamental changes, use of proceeds, and maintenance of property, as well as customary representations and warranties and events of default. In conjunction with this amendment, the interest coverage ratio and leverage ratio were eliminated as covenant requirements. As of January 30, 2021, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement.
Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations for Certain Outstanding Debt Securities of MRH
During the second quarter of 2020, MRH completed exchange offers (each, an “Exchange Offer” and, collectively, the “Exchange Offers”) with eligible holders and received related consents in consent solicitations for each series of notes as follows:
(i) $81 million aggregate principal amount of 6.65% Senior Secured Debentures due 2024 (“New 2024 Notes”) issued by MRH for validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) outstanding 6.65% Senior Debentures due 2024 issued by MRH (“Old 2024 Notes”);
(ii) $74 million aggregate principal amount of 6.7% Senior Secured Debentures due 2028 (“New 2028 Notes”) issued by MRH for validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) outstanding 6.7% Senior Debentures due 2028 issued by MRH (“Old 2028 Notes”);
(iii) $13 million aggregate principal amount of 8.75% Senior Secured Debentures due 2029 (“New 2029 Notes”) issued by MRH for validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) outstanding 8.75% Senior Debentures due 2029 issued by MRH (“Old 2029 Notes”);
(iv) $5 million aggregate principal amount of 7.875% Senior Secured Debentures due 2030 (“New 2030 Notes”) issued by MRH for validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) outstanding 7.875% Senior Debentures due 2030 issued by MRH (“Old 2030 Notes”);
(v) $5 million aggregate principal amount of 6.9% Senior Secured Debentures due 2032 (“New 2032 Notes”) issued by MRH for validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) outstanding 6.9% Senior Debentures due 2032 issued by MRH (“Old 2032 Notes”); and
(vi) $183 million aggregate principal amount of 6.7% Senior Secured Debentures due 2034 (“New 2034 Notes” and, together with the New 2024 Notes, New 2028 Notes, New 2029 Notes, New 2030 Notes and New 2032 Notes, the “New Notes” and each series, a “series of New Notes”) issued by MRH for validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) outstanding 6.7% Senior Debentures due 2034 issued by MRH (“Old 2034 Notes” and, together with the Old 2024 Notes, Old 2028 Notes, Old 2029 Notes, Old 2030 Notes and Old 2032 Notes, the “Old Notes” and each series, a “series of Old Notes”).
Each New Note issued in the Exchange Offers for a validly tendered Old Note has an interest rate and maturity date that is identical to the interest rate and maturity date of the tendered Old Note, as well as identical interest payment dates and optional redemption prices. The New Notes are MRH’s and Macy’s general, senior obligations and are secured by a second-priority lien on the same collateral securing the Notes. Following the settlement, the aggregate principal amounts of each series of Old Notes outstanding are: (i) $41 million Old 2024 Notes, (ii) $29 million Old 2028 Notes, (iii) $5 million Old 2030 Notes, (iv) $12 million Old 2032 Notes and (v) $18 million Old 2034 Notes.
In addition, MRH solicited and received consents from holders of each series of Old Notes (each, a “Consent Solicitation” and, collectively, the “Consent Solicitations”) pursuant to a separate Consent Solicitation Statement to adopt certain proposed amendments to the indenture governing the Old Notes (the “Existing Indenture”) to conform certain provisions in the negative pledge covenant in the Existing Indenture to the provisions of the negative pledge covenant in MRH’s most recent indenture (the “Proposed Amendments”). MRH received consents from holders of (i) $85 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding Old 2024 Notes, (ii) $77 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding Old 2028 Notes, (iii) $13 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding Old 2029 Notes, (iv) $5 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding Old 2030 Notes, (v) $6 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding Old 2032 Notes and (vi) $185 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding Old 2034 Notes.
At January 30, 2021, no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a debt rating downgrade. However, the terms of approximately $4,159 million in aggregate principal amount of the Company's senior notes outstanding at that date require the Company to offer to purchase such notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest if there is both a change of control (as defined in the applicable
indenture) of the Company and the notes are rated by specified rating agencies at a level below investment grade.
As of January 30, 2021, the Company's credit rating and outlook were as described in the table below.
March 2021 Financing Activities
On March 17, 2021, MRH completed an offering of $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.875% senior notes due 2029 (the “2029 Notes”) in a private offering (the “Notes Offering”). The 2029 Notes mature on April 1, 2029. The 2029 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of MRH and are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Macy’s, Inc. MRH used the net proceeds from the Notes Offering, together with cash on hand, to fund a separately announced tender offer in which $500 million of senior notes and debentures were tendered for early settlement and purchased by MRH on March 17, 2021.
Dividends
On February 28, 2020, the Company's board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 37.75 cents per share on its common stock, payable April 1, 2020, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 13, 2020. The Company announced the suspension of quarterly cash dividends beginning in the second quarter of 2020.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
At January 30, 2021, the Company had contractual obligations (within the scope of Item 303(a)(5) of Regulation S-K) as follows:
(a)
Operating lease payments include $3,060 million related to options to extend lease terms that are reasonably certain of being exercised and exclude $2 million of legally binding minimum lease payments for leases signed but not yet commenced.
(b)
Operating lease payments include $1,151 million related to non-lease component payments, with $840 million related to options to extend lease terms that are reasonably certain of being exercised.
“Other obligations” in the foregoing table includes post employment and postretirement benefits, self-insurance reserves, group medical/dental/life insurance programs, merchandise purchase obligations and obligations under outsourcing arrangements, construction contracts, energy and other supply agreements identified by the Company and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits that the Company expects to settle in cash in the next year excluding interest and penalties. The Company's merchandise purchase obligations fluctuate on a seasonal basis, typically being higher in the summer and early fall and being lower in the late winter and early spring. The Company purchases a substantial portion of its merchandise inventories and other goods and services otherwise than through binding contracts. Consequently, the amounts shown as “Other obligations” in the foregoing table do not reflect the total amounts that the Company would need to spend on goods and services in order to operate its businesses in the ordinary course.
Of the Company's $113 million of unrecognized tax benefits at January 30, 2021, within "other obligations" in the foregoing table, the Company has excluded $3 million of deferred tax assets and $104 million of long-term liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits for various tax positions taken. The table also excludes federal, state and local interest and
penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits of $60 million. These liabilities may increase or decrease over time as a result of tax examinations, and given the status of examinations, the Company cannot reliably estimate the period of any cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities.
Guarantor Summarized Financial Information
The Company has senior unsecured notes and senior unsecured debentures (collectively the “Unsecured Notes”) outstanding with an aggregate principal amount of $3,246 million outstanding as of January 30, 2021, with maturities ranging from 2022 to 2043. The Unsecured Notes constitute debt obligations of MRH ("Subsidiary Issuer"), a 100%-owned subsidiary of Macy's, Inc. ("Parent" together with the "Subsidiary Issuer" are the "Obligor Group"), and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Parent. The Unsecured Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company’s existing and future senior unsecured obligations, senior to any of the Company’s future subordinated indebtedness, and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future obligations of each of the Company’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Unsecured Notes. Holders of the Company’s secured indebtedness, including the Notes and any borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility, will have a priority claim on the assets that secure such secured indebtedness; therefore, the Unsecured Notes and the related guarantee are effectively subordinated to all of the Subsidiary Issuer’s and Parent and their subsidiaries’ existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness.
The following tables include combined financial information of the Obligor Group. Investments in and equity in the earnings of non-Guarantor subsidiaries of $6,126 million have been excluded. The combined financial information of the Obligor Group is presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances and transactions within the Obligor Group eliminated.
Summarized Balance Sheet
a)
Includes net amounts due to non-Guarantor subsidiaries of $2,702 million
Summarized Statement of Operations
a)
Income pertains to transactions with ABL Borrower, a non-Guarantor subsidiary
b)
Includes $1,268 million of dividend income from non-Guarantor subsidiaries
Important Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP. However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users of the Company's financial information with additional useful information in evaluating operating performance. Management believes that providing supplemental changes in comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis, which includes the impact of growth in comparable sales of departments licensed to third parties, assists in evaluating the Company's ability to generate sales growth, whether through owned businesses or departments licensed to third parties, on a comparable basis, and in evaluating the impact of changes in the manner in which certain departments are operated. In addition, management believes that excluding certain items that are not associated with the Company's core operations and that may vary substantially in frequency and magnitude period-to- period from diluted earnings per share attributable to Macy's, Inc. shareholders, EBIT and EBITDA, including as a percent to sales, provide useful supplemental measures that assist in evaluating the Company's ability to generate earnings and leverage sales, respectively, and to more readily compare these metrics between past and future periods. Management also believes that EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA are frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies, and that such supplemental measures facilitate comparisons between companies that have different capital and financing structures and/or tax rates. In addition, management believes that ROIC is a useful supplemental measure in evaluating how efficiently the Company employs its capital. The Company uses some of these non-GAAP financial measures as performance measures for components of executive compensation. The company does not provide the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measure of EBITDA, earnings (loss) per share and the effective tax rate, excluding certain items, because the timing and amount of excluded items are unreasonably difficult to fully and accurately estimate.
Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain of the items that may be excluded or included in non-GAAP financial measures may be significant items that could impact the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows and should therefore be considered in assessing the Company's actual and future financial condition and performance. Additionally, the amounts received by the Company on account of sales of departments licensed to third parties are limited to commissions received on such sales. The methods used by the Company to calculate its non-GAAP financial measures may differ significantly from methods used by other companies to compute similar measures. As a result, any non-GAAP financial measures presented herein may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies.
Changes in Comparable Sales
The following is a tabular reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure of changes in comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis, to GAAP comparable sales (i.e., on an owned basis), which the Company believes to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
(1)
Represents the period-to-period percentage change in net sales from stores in operation throughout the year presented and the immediately preceding year and all online sales, excluding commissions from departments licensed to third parties. Stores impacted by a natural disaster or undergoing significant expansion or shrinkage remain in the comparable sales calculation unless the store, or a material portion of the store, is closed for a significant period of time. No stores have been excluded as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Definitions and calculations of comparable sales differ among companies in the retail industry.
(2)
Represents the impact of including the sales of departments licensed to third parties occurring in stores in operation throughout the year presented and the immediately preceding year and all online sales in the calculation of comparable sales. The Company licenses third parties to operate certain departments in its stores and online and receives commissions from these third parties based on a percentage of their net sales. In its financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP, the Company includes these commissions (rather than sales of the departments licensed to third parties) in its net sales. The Company does not, however, include any amounts in respect of licensed department sales (or any commissions earned on such sales) in its comparable
sales in accordance with GAAP (i.e., on an owned basis). The amounts of commissions earned on sales of departments licensed to third parties are not material to its net sales for the periods presented.
Adjusted Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Macy's, Inc. Shareholders
The following is a tabular reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure diluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to Macy's, Inc. shareholders, excluding certain items, to GAAP diluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to Macy's, Inc. shareholders, which the Company believes to be the most directly comparable GAAP measure.
(a)
2018 excludes impairment, restructuring, and other costs attributable to the noncontrollling interest shareholder of $8 million.
Adjusted EBIT and EBITDA as a Percent to Net Sales
The following is a tabular reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures EBIT and EBITDA, as adjusted to exclude certain items ("Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA"), as a percent to net sales to GAAP net income attributable to Macy's, Inc. shareholders as a percent to net sales, which the Company believes to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
(a)
2018 excludes impairment, restructuring, and other costs attributable to the noncontrollling interest shareholder of $8 million.
ROIC
Historically, the Company defined ROIC as adjusted EBITDA, excluding net lease expense, as a percent to average invested capital. Average invested capital is comprised of an annual two-point (i.e., end of the year presented and the immediately preceding year) average of gross property and equipment, a capitalized value of non-capitalized leases equal to periodic annual reported net rent expense multiplied by a factor of eight and a four-point (i.e., end of each quarter within the period presented) average of other selected assets and liabilities. The calculation of the capitalized value of non-capitalized leases is consistent with industry and credit rating agency practice and the specified assets are subject to a four-point average to compensate for seasonal fluctuations.
In conjunction with the Company's adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 on February 3, 2019, the Company recognized lease liabilities and related right of use ("ROU") assets on the balance sheet for its operating leases. In the calculation of the Company's ROIC as of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020, the Company utilized the total lease ROU assets in lieu of the capitalized value of non-capitalized leases, excluding variable rent which is still multiplied by a factor of eight, as a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-02. In the Company's ROIC calculation as of February 2, 2019, a capitalized value of non-capitalized leases equal to periodic annual reported net rent expense multiplied by a factor of eight was utilized. Rent expense in 2020 and 2019 reflects lease expense related to the Company's operating leases in accordance with ASU 2016-02 and excludes non-lease component expenses. See Note 5, Properties and Leases, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on leases, including non-lease components.
In 2020 and 2019, the calculation of ROIC reflected certain refinements to better reflect the company's adjusted EBITDA, excluding lease expense, and invested capital which are summarized below (4-point average of balance, as applicable):
•
Exclude non-lease components of $87 million and $83 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively, from lease expense.
•
Exclude benefit plan income, net of $54 million and $31 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively, from Adjusted EBITDA, excluding lease expense.
•
Exclude rabbi trust investments related to company's deferred compensation plan from prepaid expenses and other current assets ($32 million for both 2020 and 2019).
•
Exclude deferred financing costs ($38 million for 2020 and $4 million for 2019) and net pension asset ($168 million for 2020 and $46 million for 2019) from other assets.
•
Exclude dividend payable ($29 million for 2019), current liabilities for other postretirement health care and life insurance benefits and the supplementary retirement plan ($64 million for 2020 and $76 million for 2019), and the current lease liability ($287 million for 2020 and $306 million for 2019) from accounts payable and accrued liabilities.
•
Include long-term workers' compensation and general liability ($348 million for 2020 and $371 million for 2019).
The following is a tabular reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure of ROIC to net income as a percent to property and equipment - net, which the Company believes to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
Critical Accounting Policies
Merchandise Inventories
Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") retail inventory method. Under the retail inventory method, inventory is segregated into departments of merchandise having similar characteristics and is stated at its current retail selling value. The retail inventory method inherently requires management judgments and estimates, such as the amount and timing of permanent markdowns to clear unproductive or slow-moving inventory, which may impact the ending inventory valuation as well as gross margins.
Permanent markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the utility of the inventory has diminished. Factors considered in the determination of permanent markdowns include current and anticipated demand, customer preferences, age of the merchandise and fashion trends. When a decision is made to permanently mark down merchandise, the resulting gross margin reduction is recognized in the period the markdown is recorded.
Long-Lived Asset Impairment and Restructuring Charges
The carrying values of long-lived assets, inclusive of ROU assets, are periodically reviewed by the Company whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, such as historical operating losses or plans to close stores before the end of their previously estimated useful lives. Additionally, on an annual basis, the recoverability of the carrying values of individual stores is evaluated. A potential impairment has occurred if projected future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets. The estimate of cash flows includes management's assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations. When a potential impairment has occurred, an impairment write-down is recorded if the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. The Company believes its estimated cash flows are sufficient to support the carrying value of its long-lived assets. If estimated cash flows significantly differ in the future, the Company may be required to record asset impairment write-downs.
If the Company commits to a plan to dispose of a long-lived asset before the end of its previously estimated useful life or changes its use of corporate assets, estimated cash flows are revised accordingly, and the Company may be required to record an asset impairment charge. Additionally, related liabilities arise such as severance, contractual obligations and other accruals associated with store closings from decisions to dispose of assets. The Company estimates these liabilities based on the facts and circumstances in existence for each restructuring decision. The amounts the Company will ultimately realize or disburse could differ from the amounts assumed in arriving at the asset impairment and restructuring charge recorded.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
The Company reviews the carrying value of its goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually, as of the end of fiscal May, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change, for possible impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. For impairment testing, goodwill has been assigned to reporting units which consist of the Company's retail operating divisions. Macy's and bluemercury are the only reporting units with goodwill as of January 30, 2021, and 98% of the Company's goodwill is allocated to the Macy's reporting unit.
The Company may elect to evaluate qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is less than its carrying value. If the qualitative evaluation indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset and directly perform the quantitative assessment. This determination can be made on an individual reporting unit or asset basis, and performance of the qualitative assessment may resume in a subsequent period.
The quantitative impairment test involves estimating the fair value of each reporting unit and indefinite lived intangible asset and comparing these estimated fair values with the respective reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to such excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. If the carrying value of an individual indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, such individual indefinite lived intangible asset is written down by an amount equal to such excess.
Estimating the fair values of reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets involves the use of significant assumptions, estimates and judgments with respect to a variety of factors, including sales, gross margin and SG&A expense rates, capital expenditures, cash flows and the selection and use of an appropriate discount rate and market values and multiples of earnings and revenues of similar public companies. Projected sales, gross margin and SG&A expense rate assumptions and capital expenditures are based on the Company's annual business plan or other forecasted results. Discount rates reflect market-based estimates of the risks associated with the projected cash flows of the reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset.
The use of different assumptions, estimates or judgments in the goodwill impairment testing process, including with respect to the estimated future cash flows of the Company's reporting units, the discount rate used to discount such estimated cash flows to their net present value, and the reasonableness of the resultant implied control premium relative to the Company's market capitalization, could materially increase or decrease the fair value of the reporting unit and/or its net assets and, accordingly, could materially increase or decrease any related impairment charge.
During the first quarter of 2020, as a result of the sustained decline in the Company's market capitalization and changes in the Company's long-term projections driven largely by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company determined a triggering event had occurred that required an interim impairment assessment for all of its reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets. The Company determined the fair value of each of its reporting units using a market approach or a combination of a market approach and income approach, as appropriate. Relative to the prior assessment, as part of this interim 2020 assessment, it was determined that an increase in the discount rate applied in the valuation was required to align with market-based assumptions and company-specific risk. The revised long-term projections, in conjunction with this higher discount rate, resulted in lower fair values of the reporting units. As a result, the Company recognized $2,982 million and $98 million of goodwill impairment for the Macy's and bluemercury reporting units, respectively, during 2020, the majority of which was recognized during the first quarter of 2020.
As of May 2, 2020, the Company elected to perform a qualitative impairment test on its intangible assets with indefinite lives and concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair values exceeded the carrying values and the intangible assets with indefinite lives were not impaired.
For the Company's annual impairment assessment as of the end of fiscal May, the Company elected to perform a qualitative impairment test on its goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives and concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair values exceeded the carrying values and goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives were not impaired.
The Company continues to monitor the key inputs to the fair values of its reporting units. A decline in market capitalization or future declines in macroeconomic factors or business conditions may result in additional impairment charges in future periods.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are estimated based on the tax statutes, regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred income tax assets are evaluated for recoverability based on all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. Deferred income tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized.
Uncertain tax positions are recognized if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Uncertain tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are then measured to determine the amount of benefit eligible for recognition in the financial statements. Each uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement.
Uncertain tax positions are evaluated and adjusted as appropriate, while taking into account the progress of audits of various taxing jurisdictions. Resolution of these matters could have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Significant judgment is required in evaluating the Company's uncertain tax positions, provision for income taxes, and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. Although the Company believes that its judgments are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company's historical income provisions and accruals.
Pension and Supplementary Retirement Plans
The Company has a funded defined benefit pension plan (the “Pension Plan”) and an unfunded defined benefit supplementary retirement plan (the “SERP”). The Company accounts for these plans in accordance with ASC Topic 715, Compensation - Retirement Benefits. Under ASC Topic 715, an employer recognizes the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability on the balance sheet and recognizes changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income (loss). Additionally, pension expense is generally recognized on an accrual basis over the average remaining lifetime of participants. The pension expense calculation is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements.
The Pension Protection Act of 2006 provides the funding requirements for the Pension Plan which are different from the employer's accounting for the plan as outlined in ASC Topic 715. No funding contributions were required, and the Company made no funding contributions to the Pension Plan in 2020 and 2019. As of the date of this report, the Company does not anticipate making funding contributions to the Pension Plan in 2021.
The calculation of pension expense and pension liabilities requires the use of a number of assumptions. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, and future actual experience may differ significantly from current expectations. The Company believes that the most critical assumptions relate to the long-term rate of return on plan assets (in the case of the Pension Plan) and the discount rate used to determine the present value of projected benefit obligations.
The Company's assumed annual long-term rate of return for the Pension Plan's assets was 6.25% for 2020, 6.50% for 2019 and 6.75% for 2018 based on expected future returns on the portfolio of assets. As of January 30, 2021, the Company lowered the assumed annual long-term rate of return for the Pension Plan's assets from 6.25% to 5.75% based on expected future returns on the portfolio of assets. The Company develops its expected long-term rate of return assumption by evaluating input from several professional advisors taking into account the asset allocation of the portfolio and long-term asset class return expectations, as well as long-term inflation assumptions. Pension expense increases or decreases as the expected rate of return on the assets of the Pension Plan decreases or increases, respectively. Lowering or raising the expected long-term rate of return assumption on the Pension Plan's assets by 0.25% would increase or decrease the estimated 2021 pension expense by approximately $7 million.
The Company discounted its future pension obligations using a weighted-average rate of 2.43% at January 30, 2021 and 2.83% at February 1, 2020, for the Pension Plan and 2.51% at January 30, 2021 and 2.89% at February 1, 2020 for the SERP. The discount rate used to determine the present value of the Company's Pension Plan and SERP obligations is based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with various maturities. Each year's expected future benefit payments are discounted to their present value at the appropriate yield curve rate, thereby generating the overall discount rate for Pension Plan and SERP obligations. As the discount rate is reduced or increased, the pension liability would increase or decrease, respectively, and future pension expense would decrease or increase, respectively. Lowering the discount rates by 0.25% would increase the projected benefit obligations at January 30, 2021 by approximately $86 million and would decrease estimated 2021 pension expense by approximately $4 million. Increasing the discount rates by 0.25% would decrease the projected benefit obligations at January 30, 2021 by approximately $82 million and would increase estimated 2021 pension expense by approximately $3 million.
The Company estimates the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs for the Pension Plan and SERP. This method uses a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components of net periodic benefit costs. Under this approach, the Company applies discounting using individual spot rates from the yield curve composed of the rates of return from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities available at the measurement date. These spot rates align to each of the projected benefit obligation and service cost cash flows.
