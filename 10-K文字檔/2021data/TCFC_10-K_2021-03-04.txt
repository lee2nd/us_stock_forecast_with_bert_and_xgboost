Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Critical Accounting Policies
Critical accounting policies are defined as those that involve significant judgments and uncertainties and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. The Company considers its determination of the allowance for loan losses, goodwill impairment, the valuation of foreclosed real estate (OREO) and the valuation of deferred tax assets to be critical accounting policies.
The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the general practices of the United States banking industry. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements. Accordingly, as this information changes, the financial statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions and judgments. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported.
Estimates, assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value, when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write-down or valuation reserve to be established or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event. Carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility. The fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third-party sources, when available. When these sources are not available, management makes estimates based upon what it considers to be the best available information.
Allowance for Loan Losses
The allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that exist in the loan portfolio. The allowance is based on two principles of accounting: (1) FASB ASC Topic 450 “Contingencies,” which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and are estimable and (2) FASB ASC 310 “Receivables,” which requires that losses be accrued when it is probable that the Company will not collect all principal and interest payments according to the contractual terms of the loan. The loss, if any, is determined by the difference between the loan balance and the value of collateral, the present value of expected future cash flows and values observable in the secondary markets.
The allowance for loan losses balance is an estimate based upon management’s evaluation of the loan portfolio. The allowance includes a specific and a general component. The specific component consists of management’s evaluation of impaired loans. Impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis using one of three acceptable methods: the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, the loan’s observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent. Management assesses the ability of the borrower to repay the loan based upon all information available. Loans are examined to determine a specific allowance based upon the borrower’s payment history, economic conditions specific to the loan or borrower and other factors that would impact the borrower’s ability to repay the loan on its contractual basis. Depending on the assessment of the borrower’s ability to pay and the type, condition and value of collateral, management will establish an allowance amount specific to the loan.
Management uses a risk scale to assign grades to commercial relationships, which include commercial real estate, residential rentals, construction and land development, commercial loans and commercial equipment loans. Commercial loan relationships with an aggregate exposure to the Bank of $1,000,000 or greater are risk rated. Residential first mortgages, home equity and second mortgages and consumer loans are monitored on an ongoing basis based on borrower payment history. Consumer loans and residential real estate loans are classified as unrated unless they are part of a larger commercial relationship that requires grading or are troubled debt restructures or nonperforming loans with an Other Assets Especially Mentioned or higher risk rating due to a delinquent payment history.
The Company’s commercial loan portfolio is periodically reviewed by regulators and independent consultants engaged by management.
In establishing the general component of the allowance, management analyzes non-impaired loans in the portfolio including changes in the amount and type of loans. This analysis includes trends by portfolio segment in charge-offs, delinquency, classified loans, loan concentrations and the rate of portfolio segment growth. Qualitative factors also include an assessment of the current regulatory environment, the quality of credit administration and loan portfolio management and national and local economic trends. Based upon this analysis a loss factor is applied to each loan category and the Bank adjusts the loan loss allowance by increasing or decreasing the provision for loan losses.
Management has significant discretion in making the judgments inherent in the determination of the allowance for loan losses, including the valuation of collateral, assessing a borrower’s prospects of repayment and in establishing loss factors on the general component of the allowance. Changes in loss factors have a direct impact on the amount of the provision and on net income. Errors in management’s assessment of the global factors and their impact on the portfolio could result in the allowance not being adequate to cover losses in the portfolio and may result in additional provisions.
For additional information regarding the allowance for loan losses, refer to Notes 1 and 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the discussion in this MD&A.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of businesses acquired over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is assigned to reporting units and tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. The Bank is the only reporting unit of the Company with intangible assets.
In the third quarter of 2020, management determined that the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the banking industry was deemed a triggering event that required an interim impairment test for goodwill. Management engaged an independent consultant to assist management with a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis as of September 15, 2020 ("the measurement date"). The impairment analysis used both market and income approaches. The market approach used transaction and control premium analyses and compared resulting valuations both individually and to a selected peer group. The income approach analyzed discounted cash flows. The results of the methods were weighted to determine an overall value. The calculation of the goodwill impairment involves significant estimates and subjective assumptions which require a high degree of management judgment. Significant estimates and assumptions included, but were not limited to, projected profitability ratios, discount rates, cash flows projections, selection and evaluation of control premiums in appropriate market transactions and selection of peers.
Management concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of the measurement date. Management performed an annual analysis during the fourth quarter, as there were no changes in the Company's financial statements or operations that would indicate that it was more likely than not that goodwill was impaired subsequent to the measurement date, management concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of December 31, 2020.
It is possible that the length and severity of the COVID-19 crisis could cause the Company's goodwill to become impaired in future periods due to a sustained decline in the Company's stock price or other financial or qualitative measures. In the event that the Company concludes that all or a portion of its goodwill is impaired, a non-cash charge for the amount of such impairment would be recorded to earnings in that quarter. Such a charge would have no impact on tangible capital or regulatory capital.
For additional information regarding goodwill, refer to Notes 1 and 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Other Real Estate Owned (“OREO”)
The Company maintains a valuation allowance on OREO. As with the allowance for loan losses, the valuation allowance on OREO is based on FASB ASC 450 “Contingencies,” as well as the accounting guidance on impairment of long-lived assets. These statements require the Company to establish a valuation allowance when it has determined that the carrying amount of a foreclosed asset exceeds its fair value. Fair value of a foreclosed asset is measured by the cash flows expected to be realized from its subsequent disposition. These cash flows include the costs of selling or otherwise disposing of the asset.
In estimating the fair value of OREO, management must make significant assumptions regarding the timing and amount of cash flows. For example, in cases where the real estate acquired is undeveloped land, management must gather the best available evidence regarding the market value of the property, including appraisals, cost estimates of development and broker opinions. Due to the highly subjective nature of this evidence, as well as the limited market, long time periods involved and substantial risks, cash flow estimates are highly subjective and subject to change. Errors regarding any aspect of the costs or proceeds of developing, selling or otherwise disposing of foreclosed real estate could result in the allowance being inadequate to reduce carrying costs to fair value and may require an additional provision for valuation allowances.
For additional information regarding OREO, refer to Notes 1 and 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Deferred Tax Assets
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC 740, “Income Taxes,” which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. FASB ASC 740 requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized.
Management periodically evaluates the ability of the Company to realize the value of its deferred tax assets. If management were to determine that it would not be more likely than not that the Company would realize the full amount of the deferred tax assets, it would establish a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax asset to the amount it believes would be realized. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the Company’s forecast of future taxable income and available tax-planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets.
Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income might affect the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets. Factors that may affect the Company’s ability to achieve sufficient forecasted taxable income include, but are not limited to, the following: increased competition, a decline in net interest margin, a loss of market share, decreased demand for financial services and national and regional economic conditions.
The Company’s provision for income taxes and the determination of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities involve a significant amount of management judgment and are based on the best information available at the time. The Company operates within federal and state taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions.
For additional information regarding income taxes and deferred tax assets, refer to Notes 1 and 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
COMPARISON OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
A comparison of the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019 is presented below.
Summary Financial Results
The COVID-19 pandemic presented both economic and operational challenges in 2020. Despite these challenges, the Company's 2020 operating results were strong. Our core profitability increased from a stable net interest margin primarily due to improved funding composition, increased non-interest income from additional products and services and expense control. The Company addressed COVID-19 credit concerns by increasing the allowance for loan losses, resolving multiple OREO assets and adding subordinated debt to strengthen regulatory capital. We helped our community and customers navigate economic uncertainty by originating U.S. Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program loans ("SBA PPP") and providing payment deferrals on our own portfolio loans.
We believe current market disruptions caused by both the COVID-19 pandemic and industry consolidation will provide opportunities for continued organic growth in 2021. The addition of new customers during 2020, continued our success in increasing lower cost transaction deposits in every year the last five years. Non-interest-bearing accounts and transaction accounts increased to 20.7% and 79.7% of deposits at December 31, 2020 from 16.0% and 73.9% at December 31, 2019.
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $16.1 million or $2.74 per diluted share compared to net income of $15.3 million or $2.75 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2019. The Company’s ROAA and ROACE were 0.81% and 8.46% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 0.88% and 9.32% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The Company's PTPP ROAA and PTPP ROACE were 1.58% and 16.43% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 1.32% and 14.07% for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Increased earnings in 2020 were the result of improving Bank's funding composition of interest-bearing liabilities, controlling operating costs, and organic loan growth. The $0.9 million increase to net income in 2020 compared to 2019 included increased net interest income and noninterest income of $7.4 million and $2.7 million, respectively, and a decreased income tax expense of $1.2 million. These additions to net income were partially offset by an increased loan loss provision of $8.6 million for the comparable periods and an increase in noninterest expense of $1.8 million.
Net interest income increased in 2020 as funding costs decreased faster than interest-earning asset yields fell. The economic uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic increased the provision for loan losses and noninterest expense. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily attributable to OREO valuation adjustments in connection with sales. Noninterest income increased primarily due to gains on the sale of investment securities and interest rate protection referral fee income. The decrease in income tax expense was due to a change in the Company's state tax apportionment approach that was implemented in the first quarter of 2020 as well as lower pre-tax income.
The Company’s efficiency ratio improved from 61.10% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 54.81% for the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of our continued focus on expense control and increased non-interest income. Management believes it is important to continue to focus on creating additional operating leverage in the present low interest rate environment.
The expansion of the Bank's technology platforms over the last several years was instrumental in slowing the growth of expenses and increasing profitability. Our technology strategy goals include: protecting the data integrity of our platforms and customer information; enhancing operating efficiency; permitting management to quickly respond to unforeseen technology opportunities and challenges, such as our COVID-19 related employee transition to a remote work environment; and providing an improved experience for our digital customers, which has helped us expand our customer deposit base.
The following were balance sheet financial highlights for 2020:
•Gross loans increased 11.0% or $160.4 million to $1,614.6 million at December 31, 2020. The increase was driven by our participation in SBA PPP as well as $84.4 million of growth in our commercial real estate loan portfolio.
•The ALLL increased to $19.4 million or 1.3% of portfolio loans at December 31, 2020 compared to $10.9 million or 0.8% of portfolio at December 31, 2019. Economic uncertainty from the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the Company increasing provision expense to $10.7 million in 2020 from $2.1 million in 2019.
•At December 31, 2020, COVID-19 deferred loans were $35.4 million, 1.75% of assets, or 2.35% of gross loans, excluding SBA PPP loans.
•Non-performing assets improved in 2020 comparing December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2019:
◦Classified assets as a percentage of assets decreased 83 basis points to 1.10%.
◦Non-accrual loans, OREO and TDRs to total assets decreased 38 basis points to 1.08%.
•Total deposits increased $233.8 million or 15.5% to $1,745.6 million at December 31, 2020, which included an increase in transaction accounts of $274.1 million and a decrease in time deposits of $40.3 million. Transaction deposit accounts increased to 79.7% of deposits at December 31, 2020 from 73.9% at December 31, 2019.
•Liquidity increased in 2020 primarily due to the growth in transaction deposits which was partially offset by a reduction in time deposits. The Company’s net loan to deposit ratio has decreased from 95.6% at December 31, 2019 to 91.3% at December 31, 2020. The Company used available on-balance sheet liquidity during 2020 to fund loans, increase investments and pay down wholesale funding. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company used excess liquidity to pay-off higher rate long term FHLB advances. The decrease in wholesale funding increased available off-balance sheet lines of credit.
•The Company redeemed and issued subordinated notes:
◦On February 15, 2020, the Company redeemed $23.0 million of 6.25% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes.
◦On October 14, 2020, the Company issued and sold $20.0 million 4.75% Fixed to Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2030. The Company contributed $10.0 million of the net proceeds to the Bank as Tier 1 Capital and may use the remainder of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, to support bank regulatory capital ratios and for potential common stock share repurchases.
The following were balance sheet financial highlights for 2019:
•On December 31, 2019, the Company issued a total of 312,747 shares of its common stock, par value $0.01 in a private placement offering. The Company received net proceeds of $10.6 million after deal expenses.
•In the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company reclassified all HTM investments as AFS. The Company no longer intends to hold HTM investments. Management’s decision should improve interest rate risk management opportunities and increase available on-balance sheet liquidity. In addition, at the Bank’s current asset size, regulatory capital ratios will not be impacted as accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) is excluded.
Net Interest Income
The primary component of the Company’s net income is its net interest income, which is the difference between income earned on assets and interest paid on the deposits and borrowings used to fund them. Net interest income is affected by the difference between the yields earned on the Company’s interest-earning assets and the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, as well as the relative amounts of such assets and liabilities. Net interest income, divided by average interest-earning assets, represents the Company’s net interest margin.
Average Balances and Yields :
The following tables set forth average balances, average yields and costs, and certain other information for the periods indicated. No tax-equivalent yield adjustments were made, as the effect thereof was not material. All average balances are daily average balances. Non-accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or expense. There was $0.6 million and $0.9 million of accretion interest during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Average Balances and Yields : (Continued)
** Transaction deposits exclude time deposits.
The tables below summarize changes in interest income and interest expense of the Bank for the periods indicated. For each category of interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability, information is provided on changes attributable to (1) changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by old rate); and (2) changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by old volume). Changes in rate-volume (changes in rate multiplied by the change in volume) have been allocated to changes due to volume.
Net interest income totaled $60.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which represents a 13.8% increase from $53.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Net interest income increased during 2020 compared to the prior year as the positive impacts of average interest-earning asset growth, income from SBA PPP loans and decreased funding costs outpaced the negative impacts of lower yields earned on loans and investments and growth in the average balances of interest-bearing liabilities. The Bank has increased lower cost transaction deposits in every year over the last five years, including during the pandemic. Non-interest bearing accounts and transaction accounts increased to 20.7% and 79.7% of deposits at December 31, 2020 from 16.0% and 73.9% at December 31, 2019.
Net interest margin of 3.36% for the year ended December 31, 2020, was five basis points higher than the 3.31% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Increased net interest margin resulted primarily from the Company's overall funding costs decreasing at a faster rate (65 basis points) than interest earning asset yields (56 basis points). The sharp decline in interest rates in 2020 not only reduced interest income on floating-rate commercial loans and liquid interest-earning assets, but it also reduced competitive pressures and depositor expectations concerning deposit interest rates. In addition, the continued improvement in the Bank's funding mix, replacing wholesale funding and time deposits in favor of transaction accounts helped margins expand slightly.
Average total earning assets increased 12.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $1,815.0 million compared to $1,615.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Average loans increased a $174.7 million with growth in commercial real estate and other commercial loans, and SBA PPP program loans. Interest income decreased $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period of 2019. The decrease in interest income resulted from lower interest yields accounting for $9.3 million, partially offset by larger average balances of interest-earning assets contributing $7.9 million.
Average total interest-bearing liabilities increased 8.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $1,447.3 million compared to $1,328.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Interest expense decreased $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period of 2019. Interest expense decreased $7.8 million due to lower interest rates and $1.0 million from increased balances of interest-bearing liabilities.
The Bank's success at increasing transaction accounts, and in particular the increases in noninterest-bearing accounts, was the most important factor in increasing net interest margin in 2020. In addition, the decrease in time deposits positively impacted
margins. During the year ended December 31, 2020, average noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased $97.6 million, or 43.0% to $324.6 million. Average transaction accounts increased $251.3 million or 24.9% to $1,259.1 million from $1,007.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. During the same timeframe average time deposits decreased $78.2 million or 17.4%, to $370.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Funding costs decreased at a faster rate as the percentage of funding coming from transaction accounts increased from 64.8% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 71.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Interest income accretion on acquired loans contributed $0.6 million and $0.9 million to interest income in 2020 and 2019, respectively. SBA loan fees and interest income contributed $2.7 million in 2020. Interest expense increased by $0.6 million due to prepayment fees recognized on the early repayment of $30.0 million of higher-rate long-term FHLB advances in the last six months of 2020.
Interest rates decreased in 2020 following the FOMC attempts to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the U.S. economy. The FOMC reduced the Fed Funds rate from 1.75% at December 2019 to the current rate of 0.25% in March 2020. The below table illustrates how the Company's average rates responded during the five quarters ending December 31, 2020 and provides a summary of the Company's stable to slightly increasing margins throughout 2020:
Provision for Loan Losses
The following table shows the provision for loan losses for the periods presented.
The provision for loan losses increased by $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Net charge-offs remained stable decreasing from 0.16% of average loans for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 0.15% of average loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 as several relationships that were substandard prior to the pandemic were resolved in 2020. The increase in the loan loss provision during 2020 was mostly attributable to the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and considered the potential impact of credit losses due to our loan payment deferral programs. The current year growth in the commercial loan portfolio also contributed to provision expense. No credit issues are anticipated with US SBA PPP loans as they are guaranteed by the SBA. The Bank's allowance for loan losses does not include an allowance for US SBA PPP loans.
See further discussion of the provision under the Asset Quality section in the Comparison of Financial Condition section of MD&A.
Noninterest Income
The following table shows the components of noninterest income and the dollar and percentage changes for the periods presented.
Noninterest income increased from 0.33% of average assets in 2019 to 0.42% of average assets in 2020. The largest increase was due to a $1.5 million increase in interest rate protection referral fee income from a new product the Bank offered commencing in mid-2019. During 2019, the Bank began referring customers to a third-party financial institution that offers interest rate protection for the length of a loan. This product has enabled the Bank to be more rate competitive with larger institutions in our market area without increasing interest rate risk.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized net gains of $1.4 million on the sale of 42 AFS securities with aggregate carrying values of $62.5 million. There were 20 sales of securities during the year ended December 31, 2019 for net gains of $0.2 million with aggregate carrying values of $31.6 million. The importance of managing interest-rate risks has been heightened during the last two years due to the Bank's improved on-balance sheet liquidity and increased interest rate volatility from up and down rates and a flattened yield curve.
Increased service charges of $0.2 million were due to a larger customer base and the growth in organic deposits. In addition, the Bank revamped its digital suite of retail deposit account product offerings in late 2019 and focused on adding more consumer checking accounts. The new product offerings have provided our business development teams additional resources to increase consumer checking accounts and have contributed to the Bank's 2020 success in increasing non-interest bearing checking accounts. Our increased focus on our retail suite of products has resulted in commercial customers encouraging their employees to Bank with us.
Noninterest Expense
The following tables show the components of noninterest expense and the dollar and percentage changes for the periods presented.
The increase in non-interest expense for the comparable periods was primarily due to increased OREO expenses coupled with increased data processing expense, professional fees expense and FDIC insurance. The increases were partially offset by decreases in compensation and benefits, advertising and other expenses.
The following is a breakdown of OREO expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
The increased OREO valuation allowance during the year ended December 31, 2020 was due to management's actions to timely resolve non-performing assets. OREO balances decreased from $7.8 million at December 31, 2019 to $3.1 million at December 31, 2020.
Compensation and benefits decreased 4.4% or $0.9 million to $19.6 million in 2020, primarily due to the deferral of $0.5 million of costs for US SBA PPP loans originated during the second and third quarters of 2020. The Bank's overall full time equivalent ("FTE") head count slightly fluctuated between 189 and 196 employees for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Data processing expense increased $0.6 million or 20.4% to $3.7 million primarily due to the Bank's continued investment in new technology. The Company's investments in technology have slowed the growth of FTEs and related expenses as the asset size of the Bank has increased.
Professional fees increased $0.2 million in 2020 compared to 2019 due to several strategic initiatives, including the implementation of new data systems, repayment and issuance of subordinated debt, and consulting services supporting CECL implementation and COVID-19 programs.
Advertising expense decreased in 2020 as management modified the marketing strategy in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The increased FDIC insurance was the result of increased deposit balances in 2020 and credits totaling $0.3 million received in 2019 with no comparable credits in 2020. The 12.9% decrease in other expense was primarily due to a $0.3 million decrease in seminar and meetings expense due to COVID-19 travel and meeting restrictions that prohibited attendance at Company sponsored events and industry and professional seminars.
For the year ended December 31, 2020 the efficiency ratio and net operating expense to average asset ratio were 54.81% and 1.49%, respectively compared to 61.10% and 1.75%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019. Management remains committed to controlling expenses through leveraging technology to employ scalable solutions.
Income Tax Expense
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded income tax expense of $4.5 million and $5.7 million, respectively.
The Company's consolidated effective tax rate for 2020 was 21.8% compared to a normalized effective rate of 25.4%. During the first quarter of 2020, the Company's changed its state tax apportionment approach and filed amended income tax returns which reduced consolidated income tax expense by $0.7 million. Management evaluated the tax provision and determined the change in tax position qualified as a change in estimate under FASB ASC Section 250.
The following table shows a breakdown of income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 split between the apportionment adjustment and a normalized 2020 income tax provision:
The Company’s consolidated effective tax rate was 27.06% for the year ended December 31, 2019, reflecting a first quarter net deferred tax adjustment related to the accounting treatment for acquired Bank Owned Life Insurance, which was partially offset by holding company expenses that are not deductible for state tax purposes.
COMPARISON OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AT DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019
Assets
Total assets increased $228.9 million or 12.73% to $2.0 billion at December 31, 2020 compared to total assets of $1.8 billion at December 31, 2019 primarily due to increased net loans of $149.0 million with U.S. SBA PPP loans accounting for $108.0 million of the increase. Cash and cash equivalents increased $44.6 million, or 137.35%, to $77.1 million and total securities increased $38.1 million, or 17.88%, to $251.2 million. The differences in allocations between the cash and investment categories reflect both operational needs and excess liquidity that was not redeployed into loan originations.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents totaled $77.1 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $32.5 million at December 31, 2019. Total cash and cash equivalents fluctuate on a daily basis due to transactions in process and other liquidity demands. Management believes liquidity needs are satisfied by the current balance of cash and cash equivalents, readily available access to traditional and wholesale funding sources, and the portions of the investment and loan portfolios that mature within one year.
Investment Securities
Investment securities and FHLB stock at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, estimated fair value were $253.9 million and $216.5 million, respectively. In December 2019, the Company reclassified the HTM portfolio to the AFS portfolio. The Company held no HTM securities at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The Bank's primary reasons for the HTM reclassification were to better manage interest rate risks and provide additional on-balance sheet liquidity.
The following table sets forth the carrying value of the Company’s investment securities portfolio and FHLB of Atlanta stock at the dates indicated. FHLB of Atlanta stocks are carried at amortized cost and AFS securities are carried at fair value.
The amortized cost of AFS investment securities by contractual maturity at December 31, 2020 are shown below. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because the issuers of the securities may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties. The maturities and weighted average yields at December 31, 2020 are shown below.
Credit Quality of Investments Securities
The tables below present the Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) or equivalent credit rating from other major rating agencies for AFS investment securities by carrying value at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The Company considers noninvestment grade securities rated BB+ or lower as classified assets for regulatory and financial reporting. GSE asset-backed securities and GSE agency bonds with S&P AA+ ratings were treated as AAA based on regulatory guidance.
Management monitors and manages investment portfolio performance and liquidity through monthly reporting including analyses of expected cash inflows and outflows from investment securities. Management believes the risk characteristics inherent in the investment portfolio are acceptable.
The Company did not hold any noninvestment grade securities at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. AFS securities are evaluated quarterly to determine whether a decline in their value is other than temporarily impaired ("OTTI"). No OTTI charge was recorded for the periods reported.
Gross unrealized losses at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 for AFS securities were $0.4 million and $0.6 million, respectively, of amortized cost of $240.0 million and $206.1 million, respectively (see Note 2 in Consolidated Financial Statements). The change in unrealized losses was the result of changes in interest rates and other non-credit related factors, while credit risks remained stable. The Company intends to, and has the ability to, hold investment securities with unrealized losses until they mature, at which time the Company will receive full value for the securities. Management believes that the investment securities with unrealized losses will either recover in market value or be paid off as agreed.
The Bank holds 66.8% or $160.3 million of its AFS investment securities at amortized cost, as asset-backed securities issued by GSEs or U.S. Agencies, GSE agency bonds or U.S. government obligations. In addition, the Company's amortized cost investment of $37.1 million in student loan trusts, which represent 15.5% of the AFS investment portfolio, are 97% U.S. government guaranteed. At December 31, 2020, the Company also had $42.3 million or 17.6% of AFS investments in municipal bonds.
AFS asset-backed securities issued by GSEs and U.S. Agencies were guaranteed by their issuer as to credit risk and had average lives of 5.09 years and 4.39 years and average durations of 4.81 years and 3.94 years at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. At December 31, 2020, AFS asset-backed securities issued by student loan trust and others had an average life of 6.47 years and an average duration of 6.14 years. AFS municipal bonds issued by states, political subdivisions or agencies had an average life of 9.81 years and 9.51 years and an average duration of 8.53 years and 8.18 years at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.
Loan Portfolio and U.S. SBA PPP Loans
The Bank's primary market areas consist of the tri-county area in Southern Maryland and the greater Fredericksburg area in Virginia. The portfolio, which includes all loans except the U.S. SBA PPP loans, consists primarily of commercial and residential lending. Portfolio loans totaled $1,504.3 million as of December 31, 2020 and $1,454.2 million as of December 31, 2019. During 2020, the Bank experienced loan growth of $50.1 million or 3.4%. Growth in in the commercial portfolios was $91.1 million or 7.3% while the consumer portfolio declined by $41.0 million or 20.0%.
During 2020, the Company originated 971 U.S. SBA PPP loans with original balances of $140.9 million. As of December 31, 2020, there were 867 U.S. SBA PPP loans with outstanding balances of $110.3 million. The Company is presently assisting customers with forgiveness applications for outstanding loans as well as processing new loan applications for funding that became available in January 2021.
Our growth in commercial real estate and commercial portfolios has increased asset sensitivity over the last five years. Commercial real estate increased from 66.34% of gross loans at December 31, 2019 to 69.75% at December 31, 2020. The following is a breakdown of the Company’s loan portfolios as of the dates indicated:
Maturity of Loan Portfolio
The following table sets forth information at December 31, 2020 regarding the dollar amount of loans maturing in the Bank’s portfolio based on their contractual terms to maturity. Demand loans, loans having no stated schedule of repayments and no stated maturity, and overdrafts are reported as due in one year or less.
The following table sets forth the dollar amount of all loans due after one year from December 31, 2020, which have predetermined interest rates and have floating or adjustable interest rates.
Loan Concentrations
At December 31, 2020, commercial loans represented the largest component of the loan portfolio with a significant amount real estate secured. The Bank's commercial loans are concentrated in our market area; however, these loans are distributed among many different borrowers in numerous industries.
Non-owner-occupied commercial real estate as a percentage of risk-based capital at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $695.8 million or 316.05% and $639.1 million or 319.98%, respectively. Construction loans as a percentage of risk-based capital at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $139.2 million or 63.24% and $147.2 million and 73.68%, respectively.
Asset Quality
The following table shows asset quality ratios at and for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively:
___________________________________________
(1) Nonperforming loans include all loans that are 90 days or more delinquent.
(2) Non-accrual loans include all loans that are 90 days or more delinquent and loans that are non-accrual due to the operating results or cash flows of a customer.
(3) TDR loans include both non-accrual and accruing performing loans. All TDR loans are included in the calculation of asset quality financial ratios. Non-accrual TDR loans are included in the non-accrual balance and accruing TDR loans are included in the accruing TDR balance.
COVID-19 Loan Programs
While the outbreak of COVID-19 adversely impacted a range of industries in the Company's footprint, we have taken steps to protect the health and well-being of our employees and customers and to assist customers who have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security ("CARES") Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020. There have been additional clarifications to regulation and legislation since the original law was passed, including the December 2020 legislation that authorized another round of federal government funding for US SBA PPP loans.
During 2020 the Company originated 971 US SBA PPP loans with original balances of $140.9 million. As of December 31, 2020, US SBA PPP there were 867 loans with outstanding balances of $110.3 million. We are presently assisting our customers with the additional round of funding which began in January 2021. No credit issues are anticipated with US SBA PPP loans as they are guaranteed by the SBA and the Bank's allowance for loan loss does not include an allowance for US SBA PPP loans.
In April of 2020, the Company added COVID-19 payment deferral programs for impacted customers. The Company deferred either the full loan payment or the principal component of the loan payment between 90 and 180 days. As of December 31, 2020, $35.4 million or 2.4% of gross portfolio loans had deferral agreements. All COVID-19 deferred loans were current prior to the crisis and will not be considered delinquent loans or troubled debt restructures ("TDRs") upon completion of the modification agreements due to provisions in the CARES Act and regulations that permit U.S. financial institutions to temporarily suspend U.S. GAAP requirements to treat such loan modifications as TDRs.
Consistent with regulatory guidance, if new information during the deferral period indicates that there is evidence of default, the Bank may change the classification rating (e.g., change from passing credit to substandard) and accrual status (e.g., change from accrual to non-accrual status) as deemed appropriate. At December 31, 2020, deferrals were reflected in the Company’s asset quality measures for credit classifications (i.e., pass, special mention, substandard, doubtful) and accrual status. As of December 31, 2020, there were $3.4 million of COVID-19 deferred loans deemed to be non-accrual and substandard based on reviews. Below are schedules that provide information on COVID-19 deferred loans as of December 31, 2020:
Classified Assets and Special Mention Assets
In 2020, management expeditiously resolved non-performing or substandard credits that were not likely to become performing or passing credits in a reasonable timeframe. Management believes this approach is in the best long-term interest of the Company.
Classified assets decreased $12.3 million from $34.6 million at December 31, 2019 to $22.4 million at December 31, 2020 and as a percentage of assets and risk-based capital are the lowest for the periods presented. Management considers classified assets to be an important measure of asset quality. The following is a breakdown of the Company’s classified and special mention assets at December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively:
Non-Performing Assets
The following table sets forth information with respect to the Bank’s non-performing assets. There were no loans 90 days or more past due that were still accruing interest at the dates indicated.
(1) Non-accrual loans include all loans that are 90 days or more delinquent and loans that are non-accrual due to the operating results or cash flows of a customer.
(2) TDR loans include both non-accrual and accruing performing loans. All TDR loans are included in the calculation of asset quality financial ratios. Non-accrual TDR loans are included in the non-accrual balance and accruing TDR loans are included in the accruing TDR balance.
Non-accrual loans and OREO to total assets decreased from 1.43% at December 31, 2019 to 1.05% at December 31, 2020. Non-accrual loans, OREO and TDRs to total assets decreased from 1.46% at December 31, 2019 to 1.08% at December 31, 2020.
Non-accrual loans increased $0.4 million from $17.9 million at December 31, 2019 to $18.2 million at December 31, 2020. All interest accrued but not collected from loans that are placed on non-accrual or charged-off is reversed against interest income. In accordance with the Company’s policy, interest income is recognized on a cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual status. Loans are reviewed on a regular basis and are placed on non-accrual status when, in the opinion of management, the collection of additional interest is doubtful. The accrual of interest on loans is discontinued at the time the loan is 90 days delinquent unless the credit is well secured and in the process of collection. Non-accrual loans include certain loans that are current with all loan payments and are placed on non-accrual status due to customer operating results and cash flows. Non-accrual loans are evaluated for impairment on a loan-by-loan basis in accordance with the Company’s impairment methodology.
At December 31, 2020, there were $6.3 million (34%) of non-accrual loans current with all payments of principal and interest with no impairment and $12.0 million (66%) of delinquent non-accrual loans with a total of $1.3 million specifically reserved. At December 31, 2019, there were $5.1 million (28%) of non-accrual loans current with all payments of principal and interest with no impairment and $12.8 million (72%) of delinquent non-accrual loans with a total of $0.5 million specifically reserved. Non-accrual loans at December 31, 2020 and 2019 included three TDRs totaling $1.5 million and $1.4 million, respectively. These loans were classified solely as non-accrual for the calculation of financial ratios.
Non-accrual loans on which the recognition of interest has been discontinued, which did not have a specific allowance for impairment, amounted to $12.4 million and $11.7 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Interest due but not recognized on these balances at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $0.4 million and $0.3 million, respectively. Non-accrual loans with a specific allowance for impairment on which the recognition of interest has been discontinued amounted to $5.8 million and $6.1 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Interest due but not recognized on these balances at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $0.4 million and $0.3 million, respectively.
The following is a breakdown by loan classification of the Company's TDRs at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Other Real Estate Owned
The following is a summary roll-forward of OREO activity for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
The increased OREO valuation allowance during the year ended December 31, 2020 was due to management's actions to timely resolve non-performing assets. OREO balances decreased from $7.8 million at December 31, 2019 to $3.1 million at December 31, 2020. For additional information on OREO, refer to Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Allowance for Loan Losses
The following is a breakdown of the Company’s general and specific allowances as a percentage of gross loans at December 31, 2020 and 2019:
** Non-acquired loans include loans transferred from acquired pools following release of acquisition accounting FMV adjustments.
(1) Portfolio loans include all loan portfolios except the U.S. SBA PPP loan portfolio.
The provision for loan losses increased $8.6 million to $10.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Net charge-offs increased $54,000 from $2.2 million or 0.16% of average loans for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $2.2 million or 0.15% of average loans for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Economic uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of our loan payment deferral programs and commercial real estate loan growth, increased the allowance as a percentage of loans by 54 basis points to 1.29% of gross portfolio loans at December 31, 2020 compared to 0.75% at December 31, 2019. No credit issues are anticipated with U.S. SBA PPP loans as they are guaranteed by the SBA and the Bank's allowance for loan loss does not include an allowance for U.S. SBA PPP loans.
Management believes that loans that were part of the COVID-19 deferral program in 2020 are more likely to default in the future and that the identification and resolution of specific problem credits could be delayed. Our evaluation of qualitative factors considered current and previously deferred loans, the length of the deferral period, the type and amount of collateral and customer industries.
Management believes that the allowance is adequate at December 31, 2020. The ALLL as a percent of total loans may increase or decrease in future periods based on economic conditions. Management’s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is
based on a periodic evaluation of the portfolio. Improvements to baseline charge-off factors for the periods used to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance as well as improvements in some qualitative factors, such as classified assets, were offset by increases in other qualitative factors, such as a downgrade in economic factors. The specific allowance is based on management’s estimate of realizable value for particular loans. For additional information regarding the allowance for loan losses, refer to Notes 1 and 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Critical Accounting Policy section of the MD&A.
The following table allocates the allowance for loan losses by portfolio loan category at the dates indicated. The allocation of the allowance to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any category.
(1) Percent of loans in each category to total portfolio loans
The following table sets forth an analysis of activity in the Bank’s allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated.
(1) Portfolio loans include all loan portfolios except the U.S. SBA PPP loan portfolio.
Liabilities
Deposits and Borrowings - Funding
The Bank uses both retail deposits and wholesale funding. Wholesale funding includes short-term borrowings, long-term borrowings and brokered deposits. Retail deposits continue to be the most significant source of funds totaling $1,737.6 million or 98.0% of funding at December 31, 2020 compared to $1,510.8 million or 97.0% of funding at December 31, 2019. Wholesale funding, which consisted of FHLB advances and brokered deposits, was $35.3 million or 2.0% of funding at December 31, 2020 compared to $46.4 million or 3.0% of funding at December 31, 2019.
In addition to funding for operations, the Company had junior subordinated debentures of $12.0 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019. On February 15, 2020, the Company redeemed the Company’s outstanding $23.0 million of 6.25% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes. On October 14, 2020, the Company issued $20.0 million of 4.75% fixed to floating subordinated notes.
The following is a breakdown of the Company’s deposit portfolio at December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Total deposits increased 15.5% or $233.8 million at December 31, 2020, compared to December 31, 2019. During the same period, noninterest bearing demand deposits increased 50.13% or $120.9 million (20.74% of total deposits). Transaction deposit accounts increased from 73.93% of deposits at December 31, 2019 to 79.73% of deposits at December 31, 2020. Customer deposit balances increased in 2020 due to new customer acquisitions as well as lower levels of consumer and business spending related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Bank has added new customers and lower cost transaction deposits in every year in each of the last five years. Competitors, merger and acquisition activity in our market, the Bank's participation in the SBA US PPP program and focused efforts of our business development teams all contributed to deposit increases in 2020.
For FDIC call reporting purposes reciprocal deposits are classified as brokered deposits when they exceed 20% of a bank’s liabilities or $5.0 billion. Reciprocal deposits increased $4.9 million to $354.9 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $350.0 million at December 31, 2019. Reciprocal deposits as a percentage of the Bank’s liabilities at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 were 19.6% and 22.0%, respectively. No reciprocal deposits were considered brokered at December 31, 2020 and $31.4 million of reciprocal deposits were considered brokered deposits for call reporting purposes as of December 31, 2019.
The following table sets forth for the periods indicated the average balances outstanding and average interest rates for each major category of deposits.
The following table indicates the amount of the Bank’s certificates of deposit and other time deposits of $100,000 or more and $250,000 or more by time remaining until maturity as of December 31, 2020.
Note 7 includes the scheduled contractual maturities of total certificates of deposits of $353.9 million at December 31, 2020.
The following table sets forth information about short-term borrowings for the years indicated. Long-term debt of $27.3 million, junior subordinated debentures of $12.0 million and subordinated notes of $19.5 million are not included in the table. For more information on borrowings, see Notes 8, 9 and 10 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Stockholders’ Equity
The following table shows the Company’s equity and the dollar and percentage changes for the periods presented.
Total stockholders’ equity increased $16.5 million, or 9.1%, to $198.0 million at December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019. This increase primarily resulted from net income of $16.1 million, an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of $3.0 million and net stock related activities in connection with stock-based compensation and ESOP activity of $0.5 million. These increases to stockholders’ equity were partially offset by common dividends paid of $2.8 million, and repurchases of common stock of $0.3 million
At December 31, 2020, the Company had a book value of $33.54 per common share compared to $30.76 at December 31, 2019. The Company’s tangible book value was $31.45 at December 31, 2020 compared to $28.57 at December 31, 2019. The Company remains well capitalized at December 31, 2020 with a Tier 1 capital to average assets (leverage ratio) of 9.56% compared to 10.08% at December 31, 2019. The Company’s ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets decreased to 9.22% at December 31, 2020 from 9.44% at December 31, 2019. The Company’s Common Equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) ratio was 11.47% at December 31, 2020 compared to 11.11% at December 31, 2019.
In April 2020, banking regulators issued an interim final rule that excluded U.S. SBA PPP loans pledged under the PPPLF from the calculation of the leverage ratio. At December 31, 2020, the Bank had no advances under the PPPLF program. In addition, the interim final rule excluded U.S. SBA PPP loans from the calculation of risk-based capital ratios by assigning a zero percent risk weight.
The ESOP has promissory notes with the Company for the purchase of TCFC common stock for the benefit of the participants in the Plan. Loan terms are at prime rate plus one-percentage point and amortize over seven years. As principal is repaid, common shares are allocated to participants based on the participant account allocation rules described in the Plan. The Bank is a guarantor of the ESOP debt with the Company. Unencumbered shares held by the ESOP are treated as outstanding in computing earnings per share. Shares issued to the ESOP but pledged as collateral for loans obtained to provide funds to acquire the shares are not treated as outstanding in computing earnings per share.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, $0.1 million or 4,150 Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP") shares were allocated with the payment of promissory notes and there were no offsetting ESOP purchases of shares. During the year ended December 31, 2019, $0.2 million or 4,815 ESOP shares were allocated with the payment of promissory notes. This was offset by the purchase of 3,271 shares of the Company’s common shares for $39,000 by the ESOP during 2019.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Capital Resources
The Company has no business other than holding the stock of the Bank and does not currently have any material funding requirements, except for the payment of dividends on common stock, and the payment of interest on subordinated debentures and subordinated notes, and noninterest expense.
The Company evaluates capital resources by the ability to maintain adequate regulatory capital ratios. The Company and the Bank annually update a three-year strategic capital plan. In developing its plan, the Company considers the impact to capital of asset growth, income accretion, dividends, holding company liquidity, investment in markets and people and stress testing.
Federal banking regulations require the Company and the Bank to maintain specified levels of capital. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company and Bank were well-capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action under the Basel III Capital Rules. Management believes, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, that the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject. See Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
On March 31, 2015, the Bank made the election to continue to exclude most accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") from capital in connection with its quarterly financial filings and, in effect, to retain the AOCI treatment under the capital rules prior to Basel III.
Liquidity
Liquidity is our ability to meet cash demands as they arise. Cash needs may come from loan demand, deposit withdrawals or acquisition opportunities. Potential obligations resulting from the issuance of standby letters of credit and commitments to fund future borrowings to our loan customers are other factors affecting our liquidity needs. Many of these obligations and commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon; therefore, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements affecting our liquidity position.
Based on management’s going concern evaluation, we believe that there are no conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s or the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern, within one year of the date of the issuance of the financial statements.
The Company’s principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand and dividends received from the Bank. The Bank’s most liquid assets are cash, cash equivalents and federal funds sold. The levels of such assets are dependent on the Bank’s operating, financing and investment activities at any given time. The variations in levels of cash and cash equivalents are influenced by deposit flows and anticipated future deposit flows. Customer deposits are considered the primary source of funds supporting the Bank’s lending and investment activities.
Liquidity is provided by access to funding sources, which include core depositors and brokered deposits. Other sources of funds include our ability to borrow, such as purchasing federal funds from correspondent banks, sales of securities under agreements to repurchase and advances from the FHLB of Atlanta. The Bank uses wholesale funding (brokered deposits and other sources of funds) to supplement funding when loan growth exceeds core deposit growth and for asset-liability management purposes.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Bank had $66.5 million and $96.6 million, respectively, in loan commitments outstanding, $20.0 million and $22.3 million, respectively, in letters of credit and approximately $225.5 million and $230.5 million, respectively, available under lines of credit. Certificates of deposit due within one year of December 31, 2020 and 2019 totaled $266.1 million or 75.21% and $309.0 million, or 78.40%, respectively, of total certificates of deposit outstanding. If maturing deposits do not remain, the Bank will be required to seek other sources of funds, or use on balance sheet cash and investments. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposits. We believe, however, based on past experience that a significant portion of our certificates of deposit will remain with us. We have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered.
Management has increased oversight and review of customer line of credit usage. If we were to experience increases in draws on customer lines of credit or decreased deposit levels in future periods as a result of the distressed economic conditions in our market areas relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, our level of borrowed funds could increase.
During 2020, the Bank used the PPPLF to fund SBA PPP loans. Federal Reserve PPPLF advances are non-recourse and receive 100% value for the pledged PPP loan collateral. The SBA PPP loans that are pledged to the PPPLF are excluded from the leverage ratio according to regulatory policy. The Bank used excess liquidity in the fourth quarter of 2020 to pay off $85.9 million of PPPLF balances. The Bank has access to this facility in 2021 for any new SBA PPP loans funded.
At December 31, 2020, the Company had on-balance sheet liquidity of $77.1 million in cash and cash equivalents. At December 31, 2020, the Company had loans and securities pledged or in safekeeping at FHLB which provided for funding availability of $364.3 million at December 31, 2020.
Advances from the FHLB are secured by the Bank’s stock in the FHLB, a portion of the Bank’s loan portfolio and certain investments. Generally, the Bank’s ability to borrow from the FHLB of Atlanta is limited by its available collateral and also by an overall limitation of 30% of assets. FHLB long-term debt consists of adjustable-rate advances with rates based upon LIBOR, fixed-rate advances, and convertible advances. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, 100% of the Bank’s long-term debt was fixed for rate and term, as the conversion optionality of the advances have either been exercised or expired. In addition, the Bank has established unsecured and secured lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank and commercial banks. For a discussion of these agreements including collateral see Note 8 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Liquidity has improved in the last three years with the increase in transaction deposits and decrease in wholesale funding. The Company’s net loan to deposit ratio was 91.3% at December 31, 2020 compared to 95.6% at December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the average loan to deposit ratios were 94.9% and 94.2%, respectively. The Company intends to use available on-balance sheet liquidity to fund loans, increase investments and limit the use of wholesale funding.
The Bank’s principal sources of funds for investment and operations are net income, deposits, sales of loans, borrowings, principal and interest payments on loans, principal and interest received on investment securities and proceeds from the maturity and sale of investment securities. The Bank’s principal funding commitments are for the origination or purchase of loans, the purchase of securities and the payment of maturing deposits.
The Bank is subject to various regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends.
Comparison for the Years Ending December 31, 2020 and 2019
Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2020 totaled $77.1 million, an increase of $44.6 million from the December 31, 2019 total of $32.5 million. Changes to the level of cash and cash equivalents have minimal impact on operational needs as the Bank has substantial sources of funds available from other sources.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, all financing activities provided $209.2 million in cash compared to $80.2 million in cash provided for the same period in 2019. The Company was provided $129.0 million more cash from financing activities compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased deposit growth partially offset by the increased in net borrowings. Net deposits increased $233.8 million in 2020 compared to $82.2 million in 2019. Long-term debt decreased a net of $13.1 million from $40.4 million at December 31, 2019 to $27.3 million at December 31, 2020. The Company used $33.0 million more cash in 2020 compared to 2019 for net long-term debt activity. Short-term borrowings decreased from $5.0 million at December 31, 2019 and were fully repaid by December 31, 2020. Short-term borrowings activity used $25.0 million less cash in 2020 compared to 2019. The Company provided $11.0 million less in cash for stock related activities in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a $10.6 million private placement in December 2019, an increase in common stock repurchased, and an increase in common dividends paid in 2020 was partially offset by an increase in unearned ESOP shares. The Company used $3.5 million more cash in 2020 compared to 2019 for activity related to subordinated notes. The Company used cash dividends from the Bank and proceeds from the private placement to redeem the $23.0 million 6.25% subordinated notes which was partially offset by the issuance of $20.0 million of 4.75% Subordinated Notes due 2030 net of debt issuance costs.

In 2020, the level of net cash used in investing increased to $192.7 million from $96.5 million in 2019. The increase in cash used of $96.3 million was primarily the result of the net increase in cash used of $51.4 million from loan activities and net increase of $45.4 million in securities transactions partially offset by a decrease in cash used of $0.6 million for the purchase of premises and equipment. Cash used increased for the funding of loans originated, which increased $130.5 million from $485.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $615.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
In the normal course of operations, we engage in a variety of financial transactions that, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and to general practices within the banking industry, are not recorded in our financial statements. These transactions involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate and liquidity risk. Such transactions are used primarily to manage customers’ requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments, letters of credit and lines of credit. For a discussion of these agreements, including collateral and other arrangements, see Note 18 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company did not engage in any off-balance sheet transactions reasonably likely to have a material effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
IMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES
The Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and general practices within the banking industry, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, nearly all of the Company’s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on the Company's performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.
