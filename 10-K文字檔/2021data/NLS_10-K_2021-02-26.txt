Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties.
OVERVIEW
We empower healthier living through individualized connected fitness experiences. We are committed to build a healthier world, one person at a time. Our principal business activities include designing, developing, sourcing and marketing high-quality cardio and strength fitness products, related accessories and digital platform for consumer use, primarily in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Asia. Our products are sold under some of the most-recognized brand names in the fitness industry: Bowflex®, Schwinn®, JRNY® and Nautilus®.
We market our products through two distinct distribution channels, Direct and Retail, which we consider to be separate business segments. Our Direct business offers products directly to consumers primarily through websites. Our Retail business offers our products through a network of independent retail companies to reach consumers in the home use markets in the U.S. and internationally. We also derive a portion of our revenue from the licensing of our brands and intellectual property.
Our results for 2020 were primarily impacted by strong demand driven by changes we made to our operating model beginning in late 2019 and COVID-19 stay-at-home orders. The primary actions taken include extensive, in-depth consumer insights research, which has identified an effective new positioning for the Bowflex® brand, and which is now underway through a new advertising campaign and updates to our websites, television commercials, social media, and other digital platforms. Additionally, we expect to launch targeted new products across all our channels over the next twelve months. In parallel, we plan to continue our digital transformation with the inclusion of updated digital experience platforms on key new products, moving toward our goal of having the majority of our products equipped with subscription-based digital experience offerings.
•Net sales for 2020 were $552.6 million, reflecting a 78.7% increase as compared to net sales of $309.3 million for 2019.
•Net sales of our Direct segment increased by $121.3 million, or 101.4%, in 2020, compared to 2019.
•Net sales of our Retail segment increased by $121.5 million, or 65.1%, in 2020, compared to 2019, and up 95.4% excluding sales related to the Octane brand.
•Due to the severe shortage of shipping containers, some factory fulfilled orders, representing over $16 million in revenue, did not ship in late December. Container shortages, worsening global logistics disruptions, and continued factory capacity constraints resulted in $91.5 million of backlog.
•Royalty income for 2020 increased by $0.5 million compared to 2019.
•Gross profit for 2020 was $228.8 million, or 41.4% of net sales, an increase of $118.2 million, or 106.9%, as compared to gross profit of $110.6 million, or 35.8% of net sales, for 2019.
•Operating expenses for 2020 were $151.0 million, a decrease of $60.1 million, or 28.5%, as compared to operating expenses of $211.1 million for 2019.
•Operating income for 2020 was $77.8 million, an increase of $178.4 million, or 177.4%, as compared to an operating loss of $100.5 million for 2019.
•Income from continuing operations was $60.5 million for 2020, or $1.88 per diluted share, compared to loss from continuing operations of $92.3 million, or $3.11 per diluted share, for 2019. The effective tax rates for 2020 and 2019 were 16.8% and 9.4%, respectively.
•Net income for 2020 was $59.8 million, compared to a net loss of $92.8 million for 2019. Net income per diluted share was $1.86 for 2020, compared to net loss per diluted share of $3.13 per diluted share, for 2019.
Forward Looking Guidance
Turning now to our forward-looking guidance for the transition period from January 1, 2021 to March 31, 2021.
We expect sales growth of 55% to 75% versus the same period last year.
Due to pressure from increased logistics costs, higher commodity prices, and continued foreign exchange headwinds, we expect gross margins to be relatively flat to the same period last year.
We expect operating expenses to be higher in dollars but achieve leverage as these expenses are expected to be lower as a percent of sales than the same period last year, driven by increased marketing and investments in JRNY® and North Star.
Factors Affecting Our Performance
Our results of operations may vary significantly from period-to-period. Our revenues typically fluctuate due to the seasonality of our industry, customer buying patterns, product innovation, the nature and level of competition for health and fitness products, our ability to procure products to meet customer demand, the level of spending on, and effectiveness of, our media and advertising programs and our ability to attract new customers and maintain existing sales relationships. In addition, our revenues are highly susceptible to economic factors, including, among other things, the overall condition of the economy and the availability of consumer credit in both the U.S. and Canada. Our profit margins may vary in response to the aforementioned factors and our ability to manage product costs. Profit margins may also be affected by fluctuations in the costs or availability of materials used to manufacture our products, product warranty costs, the cost of fuel, and changes in costs of other distribution or manufacturing-related services. Our operating profits or losses may also be affected by the efficiency and effectiveness of our organization. Historically, our operating expenses have been influenced by media costs to produce and distribute advertisements of our products on television, websites and other media, facility costs, operating costs of our information and communications systems, product supply chain management, customer support and new product development activities. In addition, our operating expenses have been affected from time-to-time by asset impairment charges, restructuring charges and other significant unusual or infrequent expenses.
As a result of the above and other factors, our period-to-period operating results may not be indicative of future performance. You should not place undue reliance on our operating results and should consider our prospects in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties typically encountered by us and other companies, both within and outside our industry. We may not be able to successfully address these risks and difficulties and, consequently, we cannot assure you any future growth or profitability. For more information, see our discussion of Risk Factors located at Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Results from discontinued operations relate to the disposal of our former Nautilus® Commercial business, which was completed in April 2011. We reached substantial completion of asset liquidation at December 31, 2012. Although there was no revenue related to the Commercial business in 2020, 2019 and 2018, we continue to incur product liability expenses associated with product previously sold into the Commercial channel, and accrued interest associated with an uncertain tax position on discontinued international operations.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements. An accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria: (i) the nature of the estimate is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility
of such matters to change, and (ii) the impact of the estimate on financial condition or operating performance is material. Our critical accounting estimates are discussed below.
Goodwill and Other Long-Term Assets Valuation
We evaluate our indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for potential impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate their carrying value may be impaired. Definite-lived intangible assets, including acquired trade names, customer relationships, patents and patent rights, and other long-lived assets, primarily property, plant and equipment, are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired. In 2019, we recognized a non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of $72.0 million primarily related to the goodwill and indefinite-lived Octane Fitness brand name which was sold October 14, 2020. No goodwill remained as of December 31, 2019. In 2020, we recognized a loss on disposal for the sale of Octane Fitness related assets of $20.7 million.
Our impairment evaluations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment in order to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values. Our judgments regarding potential impairment are based on a number of factors including: the timing and amount of anticipated cash flows; market conditions; relative levels of risk; the cost of capital; terminal values; royalty rates; and the allocation of revenues, expenses and assets and liabilities to reporting units. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of our goodwill or other long-term assets and, thereby, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.
Income Tax
Significant judgments are required in determining tax provisions in relation to valuation allowance and tax positions. Such judgments require us to interpret existing tax law and other published guidance as applied to our circumstances. If our financial results or other relevant factors change, thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position or deferred tax assets, significant judgment would be applied in determining the effect of the change. A tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation. Furthermore, valuation allowance would be provided against deferred tax assets if we determine it is no longer more likely than not that such assets would be fully realized based on the objectively verifiable evidence available.
On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) was enacted and signed into law in response to coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”). The CARES Act, among other things, includes several significant provisions that could impact corporate taxpayers’ accounting for income taxes.
In 2020, we recorded income tax expense from continuing operations of $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and net non-current deferred income tax assets of $2.4 million, which included a deferred tax asset for the capital loss from the sale of the Octane business, net of valuation allowance.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The discussion that follows regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes in this report. All comparisons to prior year results are in reference to continuing operations only in each period, unless otherwise indicated. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 26, 2020, which is available free of charge on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and our Investors website at http://www.nautilusinc.com/investors/sec-filings/.

Results of operations information by segment and major product lines was as follows (in thousands):
Sales and Gross Profit
Direct Segment
Net sales for 2020 were $240.9 million, reflecting a 101.4% increase as compared to $119.7 million for 2019. Increased sales were driven primarily by cardio products which grew by 82.6% versus 2019 and were led by strong demand for our connected-fitness bikes, the Bowflex® C6 and Schwinn® IC4, offset by lower Max Trainer® sales. Strength product sales grew 185.5% versus the same period in 2019 driven by SelectTech® weights and Bowflex® Home Gyms. Positive customer response to the new JRNY® powered connected fitness products launched in 2020 also contributed to sales growth.
Gross margin rates for 2020 and 2019 were 54.3% and 49.8%, respectively, with the increase primarily driven by increased full-priced sales and favorable fixed cost leverage, partially offset by higher transportation costs.
Segment contribution income for 2020 was $60.0 million, compared to loss of $24.6 million for 2019. The $84.6 million improvement was primarily driven by higher gross profit.
Combined consumer credit approvals by our primary and secondary U.S. third-party financing providers were 52.0% in 2020 compared to 54.1% in 2019. The decrease in approvals reflects lower credit quality applications.
Retail Segment
Net sales for 2020 were $308.0 million, reflecting a 65.1% increase as compared to $186.6 million for 2019 or a 95.4% increase, excluding sales related to the Octane brand. Cardio sales were up 66.5% versus 2019, driven by the Schwinn® IC4 connected-fitness bikes, Bowflex® VeloCore® and Max Trainer®. Strength sales were up 60.7% versus 2019 led by the popular Bowflex® Home Gyms and SelectTech® weights.
Gross margin rates for 2020 and 2019 were 30.6% and 25.7%, respectively, with the increase primarily driven by favorable customer mix and fixed cost leverage, partially offset by higher transportation costs.
Segment contribution income for 2020 was $62.8 million, compared to $16.0 million for 2019. The $46.8 million improvement was primarily driven by higher gross profit.
Royalty
Royalty income increased by $0.5 million, or 18.0%, to $3.6 million for 2020, compared to 2019, due to a royalty settlement and increased license sales in 2020.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses for 2020 were $151.0 million, a decrease of $60.1 million, or 28.5%, as compared to operating expenses of $211.1 million for 2019. The decrease in operating expenses primarily related to a loss on disposal group of $20.7 million in 2020 compared to a goodwill and other intangible impairment charge of $72.0 million in 2019 and a reduction in media spending in 2020 to $34.1 million compared to $44.9 million in 2019. These expense reductions were partially offset by increases in general and administrative and research and development costs.
Selling and Marketing
Selling and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of media advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs.
Selling and marketing information was as follows (dollars in thousands):
Media advertising expense of our Direct business is the largest component of selling and marketing and was as follows (dollars in thousands):
The decrease in selling and marketing expenses in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to decreases, during the first six months of 2020, in media advertising, given strong organic demand and inventory scarcity. Additionally, COVID-19 reduced travel costs related to selling and marketing.
The decrease in selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2020 compared to 2019 was due to the increase in net sales combined with lower expenses.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with finance, legal, facilities, certain human resources and other administrative personnel, and other administrative fees.
General and administrative expenses was as follows (dollars in thousands):
The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2020 compared to 2019 was due to personnel costs, primarily in bonus and stock expenses, and consulting expenses.
The decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to the increase net sales.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, other headcount-related expenses and information technology associated with product development.
Research and development expenses was as follows (dollars in thousands):
The increase in research and development expenses in 2020 compared to 2019, was driven primarily by increased investments in our JRNY® digital platform.
Loss on Disposal Group, Goodwill and Other Intangible Impairment Charge
In 2019, we recognized a non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of $72.0 million primarily related to the goodwill and indefinite-lived Octane Fitness brand name which was sold October 14, 2020. No
goodwill remained as of December 31, 2019. In 2020, we recognized a loss on disposal for the sale of Octane Fitness related assets of $20.7 million.
Operating Income
Operating income for 2020 was $77.8 million, an increase of $178.4 million, as compared to an operating loss of $100.5 million for 2019. The increase in operating income was primarily due to higher gross profit and lower operating expenses as discussed in more detail above.
Income from continuing operations was $72.7 million for 2020, or $1.88 per diluted share, compared to a loss from continuing operations of $101.8 million, or $3.11 per diluted share, for 2019. The increase in income from continuing operations was primarily due to higher gross profit and lower operating expenses as discussed in more detail above and aided by the tax benefit related to the CARES act.
Interest Expense
Interest expense of $1.5 million and $1.0 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, was primarily related to the outstanding balance on our term loan and line of credit and a loss on debt extinguishment.
Other, Net
Other, net includes the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations with the U.S. and our foreign subsidiaries and equity investment impairments. Other, net for 2020 was $3.6 million, an increase of $3.1 million, as compared to $0.5 million in 2019. The increase in other, net was primarily due to an equity investment impairment for the significant fair value deterioration from adverse changes in the general market condition of investees' industry of $2.5 million.
Income Tax Expense (Benefit)
Income tax expense (benefit) includes U.S. and international income taxes, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions.
Income tax expense (benefit) was as follows (dollars in thousands):
The higher effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to profit generated in the U.S., partially offset by the 14% rate benefit of net operating loss carry-backs as a result of the enactment of the CARES Act.
Refer to Note 16, Income Taxes, to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.
Net Income
Net income was $59.8 million for 2020, compared to a net loss of $92.8 million for 2019. Net income per diluted share was $1.86 for 2020, compared to net loss per diluted share of $3.13 for 2019.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our future capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned and will depend on many factors, including our levels of revenue, the timing and extent of spending on research and development efforts and other business initiatives, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing of new product introductions, market acceptance of our products, and overall economic conditions. To the extent that current and anticipated future sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our future business activities and requirements, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. The sale of additional equity would result in additional dilution to our shareholders. The incurrence of debt financing would result in debt service obligations and the instruments governing such debt could provide for operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations.
As of December 31, 2020, we had $94.1 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments, compared to cash and cash equivalents of $11.1 million as of December 31, 2019.
Cash provided by operating activities was $71.7 million for 2020, compared to cash used in operating activities of $22.6 million for 2019. The increase in cash flows from operating activities for 2020, compared to 2019, was primarily due the increase in operating income, along with the changes in our operating assets and liabilities discussed below.
Trade receivables increased by $36.6 million to $91.2 million as of December 31, 2020, compared to $54.6 million as of December 31, 2019, due to the higher net sales and the timing of receipts in 2020.
Inventory decreased by $3.6 million to $51.1 million as of December 31, 2020, compared to $54.8 million as of December 31, 2019, primarily due to the surge in demand for home-fitness products and the divestiture of Octane Fitness in 2020.
Prepaids and other current assets increased by $10.9 million to $19.2 million as of December 31, 2020, compared to $8.3 million as of December 31, 2019, primarily related to short-term deposits.
Trade payables increased by $22.1 million to $96.4 million as of December 31, 2020, compared to $74.3 million as of December 31, 2019, primarily due to timing of payments for inventory and advertising related payments.
Accrued liabilities increased by $15.2 million to $22.8 million as of December 31, 2020, compared to $7.6 million as of December 31, 2019, primarily due to payroll related liabilities and customer deposits.
Warranty obligations decreased by $0.5 million to $5.2 million as of December 31, 2020, compared to $5.7 million as of December 31, 2019, primarily due to the sales mix offset by $2.8 million in warranty obligations assumed by True Fitness on the sale of Octane Fitness.
Net deferred income tax assets increased by $3.6 million to $2.4 million as of December 31, 2020, compared to net deferred income tax liabilities of $1.2 million as of December 31, 2019, primarily due to the divestiture of Octane Fitness in 2020.
Cash used in investing activities of $24.5 million for 2020 was related to the purchase of marketable securities of $36.2 million, $9.7 million used for capital expenditures during 2020, primarily for information technology assets, our digital platform JRNY®, and production tooling and equipment offset by proceeds from the sale of Octane Fitness of $21.4 million.
Cash used in financing activities of $3.1 million for 2020 was primarily related to principal repayments on our term loan and line of credit of $45.1 million, tax payments and proceeds on stock award issuances of $2.2 million and debt issuance costs of $1.8 million, offset by proceeds from our line of credit of $45.8 million.
Financing Arrangements
JP Morgan Chase Bank Credit Agreement
As of December 31, 2019, we had an outstanding credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. (“Chase Bank”) which consisted of an $80.0 million term loan and a $40.0 million revolving line of credit. The term loan was used to finance the acquisition of Octane Fitness and was scheduled to mature on December 31, 2020. The revolving line of credit was scheduled to mature December 31, 2021. Both the term loan and the revolving line of credit were secured by substantially all of our assets. The Chase Bank debt facilities were terminated in January 2020 upon entering into a new credit agreement described below.
Wells Fargo Bank Credit Agreement
On January 31, 2020, we entered into a Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (“Wells Fargo”) and lenders from time to time party thereto (collectively with Wells Fargo the “Lenders”) (“Credit Agreement”), pursuant to which the Lenders have agreed, among other things, to make available to us an asset-based revolving loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of up to $55.0 million, subject to a borrowing base (the “ABL Revolving Facility”), and a term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $15.0 million (the “Term Loan Facility” and together with the ABL Revolving Facility, the “Wells Fargo Financing"), in each case, as such amounts may increase or decrease in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. The Wells Fargo Financing expires and all outstanding amounts become due on January 31, 2025 unless the maturity is accelerated subject to the terms set forth in the Credit Agreement. The repayment of obligations under the Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all of our assets. Principal and interest amounts are required to be paid as scheduled.
We used the proceeds from the Wells Fargo Financing to extinguish our existing $40.0 million revolver with Chase Bank, pay transaction expenses, and for general corporate purposes. Our previously existing credit facilities and agreements with Chase Bank and all guarantees and liens existing in connection with those facilities and agreements were terminated upon the closing of this Wells Fargo financing. In connection with the termination of the Chase Bank facility, we recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of $0.2 million as interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations.
Interest on the ABL Revolving Facility will accrue at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.75% to 2.25% (based on average quarterly availability) and interest on the Term Loan Facility will accrue at LIBOR plus 5.00%. As of December 31, 2020, our interest rate was 1.90% for the ABL Revolving Facility and 5.15% for the Term Loan Facility.
As of December 31, 2020, outstanding borrowings totaled $13.8 million, with $13.6 million and $0.2 million under our Term Loan Facility and ABL Revolving Facility, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the financial covenants of the Wells Fargo Financing and $54.8 million was available for borrowing under the ABL Revolving Facility. Any outstanding balance is due and payable on January 31, 2025.
The balance sheet classification of the borrowings under the revolving loan credit facility has been determined in accordance with ASC 470, Debt. Borrowings outstanding under a revolving credit agreement that includes both a subjective acceleration clause and a requirement to maintain a springing lock-box arrangement are classified based on the provisions of ASC 470 because the lock-box remittances do not automatically reduce the debt outstanding. As of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all covenants contained in our Term Loan Facility and ABL Revolving Facility and assessed the probability that the creditor would accelerate the due date of the debt by exercising the subjective acceleration clauses of our Term Loan Facility and ABL Revolving Facility before its scheduled maturity as remote. Accordingly, this obligation has been classified as a long-term liability in the balance sheet.
The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for financings of this type, including, among other terms and conditions, delivery of financial statements, reports and maintenance of existence, revolving availability subject to a calculated borrowing base, as well as limitations and conditions on our ability to: create, incur, assume or be liable for indebtedness; dispose of assets outside the ordinary course; acquire, merge or consolidate with or into another person or entity; create, incur or allow any lien on any of our property; make investments; or pay dividends or make distributions, in each case subject to certain exceptions. The financial covenants set forth in the Credit Agreement include a minimum liquidity covenant of $7.5 million. Beginning February 1, 2022, the minimum liquidity covenant will decrease to $5.0 million and only a minimum EBITDA covenant will apply. In addition, the Credit Agreement includes customary events of default, including but not limited to, the nonpayment of principal and interest when due thereunder, breaches of representations and warranties, noncompliance with covenants, acts of insolvency and default on indebtedness held by third parties (subject to certain limitations and cure periods).
Shelf Registration Statement
On November 9, 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (“Shelf Registration”) with the SEC under which we may, from time to time, sell securities in one or more offerings up to a total dollar amount of $100,000,000. Our ability to issue securities is subject to market conditions. We have not made any offerings of securities under the Shelf Registration.
Stock Repurchase Program
On February 21, 2018 our Board of Directors authorized an additional $15.0 million share repurchase program. Under this program, shares of our common stock may be repurchased from time to time through February 21, 2020. During 2019, we repurchased 990,229 shares at an average price of $13.12 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $13.0 million. As of February 2020, the stock repurchases under this program were completed in full and the program expired.
Repurchases were made in open market transactions at prevailing market prices, in privately negotiated transactions, or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws. Share repurchases were funded with existing cash balances, and the repurchased shares were retired and returned to unissued authorized shares.
Commitments and Contingencies
For a description of our commitments and contingencies, refer to Note 22, Commitments and Contingencies, to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.
Non-Cancellable Contractual Obligations
Our operating cash flows include the effect of certain non-cancellable contractual obligations. A summary of such obligations as of December 31, 2020 is as follows (in thousands):
(1) Our purchase obligations are comprised primarily of inventory purchase commitments to our third-party manufactures. Because substantially all of our inventory is sourced from Asia, we have long lead times and therefore need to secure factory capacity from our vendors in advance. Our third-party manufacturing contracts are generally of annual or shorter duration, or manufactured products are sourced on the basis of individual purchase orders.
Due to uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2020, we are unable to make reasonable reliable estimates of the timing of any cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, approximately $4.4 million of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions, have been excluded from the contractual table above. For further information, refer to Note 16, Income Taxes.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements that require us to indemnify counterparties against third-party claims. These may include: agreements with vendors and suppliers, under which we may indemnify them against claims arising from our use of their products or services; agreements with customers, under which we may indemnify them against claims arising from their use or sale of our products; real estate and equipment leases, under which we may indemnify lessors against third-party claims relating to the use of their property; agreements with licensees or licensors, under which we may indemnify the licensee or licensor against claims arising from their use of our intellectual property or our use of their intellectual property; and agreements with parties to debt arrangements, under which we may indemnify them against claims relating to their participation in the transactions.
The nature and terms of these indemnifications vary from contract to contract, and generally a maximum obligation is not stated. We hold insurance policies that mitigate potential losses arising from certain types of indemnifications. Because we are unable to estimate our potential obligation, and because management does not expect these obligations to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, no liabilities are recorded at December 31, 2020.
INFLATION
We do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations in 2020, 2019 or 2018. Inflation pressures do exist in countries where our contract manufacturers are based; however, we have largely mitigated these increases through cost improvement measures.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
See Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.
