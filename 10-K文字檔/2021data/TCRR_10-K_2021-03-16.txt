Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the ‘‘Risk Factors’’ section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.
Overview
We are a clinical-stage cell therapy company developing a pipeline of novel T cell therapies for patients suffering from cancer by powering the T cell receptor (TCR) with our proprietary, first-in-class TCR Fusion Construct T cells (TRuC-T cells). Designed to overcome the limitations of current cell therapy modalities, our TRuC-T cells specifically recognize and kill cancer cells by harnessing the entire T cell receptor TCR signaling complex, which we believe is essential for T cell therapies to be effective in patients with solid tumors.
Since our inception in May 2015, we have focused significant efforts and financial resources on developing our TRuC platform, establishing and protecting our intellectual property portfolio, conducting research and development of our product candidates, manufacturing drug product material for use in preclinical studies, staffing our company and raising capital. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales.
Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $249.7 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years. We expect that our expenses and capital requirements will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly if and as we:
•
conduct additional preclinical studies for our product candidates;
•
initiate and conduct clinical trials for our product candidates;
•
continue to discover and develop additional product candidates;
•
acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies;
•
maintain, expand, and protect our intellectual property portfolio;
•
hire additional clinical and scientific personnel;
•
expand our manufacturing capabilities with third parties and establish manufacturing capabilities in-house;
•
seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; and
•
add operational, financial, and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts, and our operations as a public reporting company.
We will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates and do not enter into a commercialization partnership, we expect to incur significant expenses related to developing our internal commercialization capability to support product sales, marketing and distribution. Additionally, we expect to incur significant expenses if we acquire and establish our own commercial manufacturing facility, which will be a costly and time-consuming process, and in our operations as a public company.
As a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when, needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates.
Recent Developments
On January 19, 2021, we entered into an underwriting agreement with Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, Jefferies LLC, Piper Sandler & Co. and BMO Capital Markets Corp., related to the issuance and sale by us of 4,590,164 shares of the Company’s common stock, at a price to the public of $30.50 per share, less underwriting discounts and commissions. The Company granted the Underwriters a 30-day option to purchase, at the public offering price less any underwriting discounts and commissions, up to an additional 688,524 shares of Common Stock. The offering was made pursuant to the Company’s shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-236965), filed with the SEC on March 6, 2020 and declared effective on April 28, 2020, as supplemented by a
prospectus supplement dated January 19, 2021 that was filed with the SEC on January 21, 2021. The offering closed on January 22, 2021. The Company received net proceeds from the Offering, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company, of approximately $131.1 million.
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. COVID-19 has since spread to Europe, the United States and most other countries, and has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 have intensified and the United States, including the Commonwealth of Massachusetts where a majority of our operations are located, Europe and Asia, all of which to varying degrees have implemented severe travel restrictions, social distancing requirements, and stay-at-home orders, and such restrictions have had the effect of delaying the commencement of non-COVID-19-related clinical trials, among other restrictions. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruptions to the U.S., regional and global economies and has contributed to significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets. Safety measures in response to the pandemic continue to evolve and vary by jurisdiction.
We have been carefully monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential impact on our business and have taken important steps to help ensure the safety of employees and their families and to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in our communities while balancing our commitment to conduct our clinical trials. We have requested that our employees work from home if they are able to perform their duties remotely and limited the number of on-site employees to allow for proper social distancing in our offices and laboratories. For those employees on-site, we have implemented stringent safety measures designed to comply with applicable federal, state and local guidelines instituted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have also maintained efficient communication with our partners and clinical sites as the COVID-19 situation has progressed. We have taken these precautionary steps while maintaining business continuity so that we can continue to progress our programs. COVID-19 has significantly impacted the global healthcare system, including the conduct of clinical trials as medical institutions prioritize the treatment of those afflicted with COVID-19. We continue to closely monitor the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and ongoing clinical and preclinical development.
The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our development timelines for TC-210 and TC-110, and its effect on our ability to manufacture for our clinical trials is uncertain. We believe that we have been able, as of the date of this Annual Report, to mitigate some of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic on our ongoing clinical programs, however, we have been affected.
The future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our industry, the healthcare system, clinical trials and our current and future operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact, as well as the effect of any relaxation of current restrictions within the Cambridge community or regions in which our partners and clinical sites are located, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures, among others. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of the potential adverse impact of COVID-19 on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Components of Our Results of Operations
Operating Expenses
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our drug discovery efforts and the development of our product candidates, which include:
•
employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation;
•
expenses incurred in connection with the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants, contractors and contract research organizations (CROs);
•
the cost of acquiring and manufacturing preclinical and clinical trial materials, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants, contractors and contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs);
•
consultant fees and expenses associated with outsourced professional scientific development services;
•
facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and insurance; and
•
payments made under third-party licensing agreements.
We expense research and development costs as incurred. Any non-refundable advance payments that we make for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. The prepaid amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.
We typically use our employee, consultant and infrastructure resources across our development programs. We track certain outsourced development costs by product candidate, but we do not allocate personnel costs or other internal costs to specific product candidates.
Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially in connection with our planned preclinical and clinical development and manufacturing activities in the near term and in the future. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing, and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the preclinical and clinical development of any of our product candidates. The successful development and commercialization of our product candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, including the following:
•
the timing and progress of our preclinical studies and clinical trials, which may be significantly slower or cost more than we currently anticipate and will depend substantially upon the performance of third-party contractors;
•
the number and scope of preclinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue;
•
the progress of the development efforts of parties with whom we may enter into collaboration arrangements;
•
our ability to maintain our current research and development programs and to establish new ones;
•
our ability to establish licensing or collaboration arrangements;
•
our ability to complete investigational new drug application (IND)-enabling studies and successfully submit IND or comparable applications;
•
whether we are required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or similar foreign regulatory authorities to conduct additional clinical trials or other studies beyond those planned to support the approval and commercialization of our product candidates or any future product candidates;
•
the timely receipt of necessary marketing approvals from the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities;
•
our ability and the ability of third parties with whom we contract to manufacture adequate clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates or any future product candidates, remain in good standing with regulatory agencies and develop, validate and maintain commercially viable manufacturing processes that are compliant with current good manufacturing practices (cGMP);
•
our ability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities the safety, potency, purity and acceptable risk to benefit profile of our product candidates or any future product candidates;
•
the prevalence, duration and severity of potential side effects or other safety issues experienced with our product candidates or future product candidates, if any;
•
our ability to establish and enforce intellectual property rights in and to our product candidates or any future product candidates;
•
our ability to successfully develop a commercial strategy and thereafter commercialize our product candidates or any future product candidates in the United States and internationally, if licensed for marketing, reimbursement, sale and distribution in such countries and territories, whether alone or in collaboration with others;
•
the willingness of physicians, operators of clinics and patients to utilize or adopt any of our product candidates or future product candidates to treat solid and hematologic cancers;
•
patient demand for our product candidates and any future product candidates, if licensed;
•
competition with other products; and
•
continued acceptable safety profile of our therapies following approval.
A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. We may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for any of our product candidates.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include direct and allocated facility-related costs as well as professional fees for legal, patent, consulting, investor and public relations, accounting and audit services. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our continued research activities and development of our product candidates. We also anticipate that we will incur increased accounting, audit, legal, regulatory, compliance, and director and officer insurance costs as well as investor and public relations expenses associated with operating as a public company.
Other Income, net
Other income, net consists of interest earned on our cash equivalents and investment balances, net of investment charges.
Income Tax Expenses
Income tax expense is generated by investment income of our investment portfolio and the profit margin on our UK operations.
Consolidated Statements of Operations
(in thousands)
Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Research and development expenses
Research and development expenses were $52.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
(in thousands)
Spending increased in all areas as we have expanded our research and development efforts. The $14.5 million increase in research and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 is primarily attributable to the increase in personnel expenses of $5.5 million due to a significant increase in headcount. Our clinical trial program expenses increased $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 as our TC-110 clinical trial began during 2020 and our gavo-cell trial has continued. Platform development expenses increased by $1.8 million and other research and development expenses increased by $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 as we increased research activities related to our platform, new programs, and enhancements. Allocated facilities costs increased $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 as we expanded our lab space.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses were $16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of $2.4 million due to our increase in headcount including share-based compensation. Other costs under general and administration expenses increased by $0.4 million as we increased the size and activities of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
Other Income, net
Interest income, net was $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was due to a significant decrease in interest rates earned on our accounts during 2020 due to the macroeconomic factors impacting the economy.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Since our inception, we have incurred net losses and generated negative cash flows from operations. Since inception, we have funded our operations with proceeds from the sale of our stock. We have received gross proceeds of $400 million from the sale of our stock since inception, including as a result of proceeds from public offerings. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $228.0 million, and subsequent to December 31, 2020, we raised $131.1 million in net proceeds from our January 2021 stock offering.
Cash flows
The following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented:
(in thousands)
Operating Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we used $56.7 million of cash in operating activities, resulting primarily from our net loss of $67.1 million partially offset by non-cash charges of $10.2 million, which related to depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation. Non-cash charges have increased as we have increased our equipment base and therefore increased depreciation. In addition, as we have increased personnel the number of shares and value of share-based compensation has substantially increased for the year ended December 31, 2020 over the year ended December 31, 2019.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we used $41.4 million of cash in operating activities, resulting primarily from our net loss of $47.6 million partially offset by non-cash charges of $7.6 million, which related to depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and a net decrease in operating assets and liabilities of $1.4 million. The net decreases in operating assets and liabilities were primarily attributable to the timing in which we paid our vendors.
Investing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2020, cash used in investing activities was $48.9 million, consisting primarily of purchases of investments net of maturities of $41.8 million and purchases of property and equipment of $7.1 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in investing activities was $20.4 million, consisting primarily of purchases of investments net of maturities of $16.5 million and purchases of property and equipment of $3.9 million.
Financing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $134.7 million from the sale of our stock.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was $79.5 million consisting primarily from the sale of stock in our initial public offering.
Funding Requirements
We expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance the preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates in development and we will incur additional costs associated with operating as a public reporting company. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to establishing sales, marketing, distribution and other commercial infrastructure to commercialize such products.
In addition, our expenses will increase as we:
•
commence enrollment of clinical trials for our product candidates;
•
seek regulatory approval for any product candidates that successfully complete preclinical and clinical trials;
•
establish manufacturing capabilities in-house for the production of preclinical and clinical supply;
•
hire additional clinical, medical, research and operational personnel; and
•
maintain, expand, and protect our intellectual property portfolio.
As of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $228.0 million and subsequent to December 31, 2020, we raised $131.1 million in net proceeds from our January 2021 stock offering. We believe that the net proceeds from sales of our stock, together with our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements at least into 2024. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect. Additionally, changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate, and we may need to spend more money than currently expected because of circumstances beyond our control.
Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, and marketing, distribution, or licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making acquisitions or capital expenditures, or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances, or marketing, distribution, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or drug candidates, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate our research, product development, or future commercialization efforts, or grant rights to develop and market drug candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred in connection with the development of our product candidates. We expense research and development costs as incurred.
As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf, and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advance payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in the consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of the estimates with the service providers and make adjustments, if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:
•
vendors in connection with preclinical development activities;
•
CMOs in connection with the production of preclinical and clinical trial materials; and
•
CROs in connection with preclinical studies and clinical trials.
We base our expenses related to preclinical studies and clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with multiple CMOs and CROs that supply, conduct, and manage preclinical studies on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract, and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of
effort varies from the estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid expense accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period.
Stock-Based Compensation
We measure stock options and other stock-based awards granted to employees based on their fair value on the date of the grant and recognize compensation expense of those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. We apply the straight-line method of expense recognition to all awards with service-based vesting conditions.
For stock-based awards granted to non-employees, compensation expense is recognized over the period during which services are rendered by such non-employees until completed. In the second quarter of 2019, we adopted ASU 2018-07 on a retrospective basis as of January 1, 2019, the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2018-07, share-based payments awards granted to non-employees were measured at fair value on their grant date, subject to periodic remeasurement at each reporting period, and share-based compensation expense was recognized over their vesting terms. After the adoption of ASU 2018-07, the fair value of all outstanding and unvested previously granted non-employee awards was established on January 1, 2019, the effective date of adoption, and share-based compensation expense will continue to be recorded on a straight-line basis over their remaining vesting period, consistent with share-based payment awards granted to employees.
We estimate the fair value of restricted stock at the then-current fair value of our common stock and for other stock-based awards we use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires subjective assumptions, including the fair value of our common stock, volatility, the expected term of our common stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our common stock options, and our expected dividend yield. The assumptions used in our Black-Scholes option-pricing model represent management’s best estimates and involve a number of variables, uncertainties and assumptions and the application of management’s judgment, as they are inherently subjective. If any assumptions change, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.
We do not estimate and apply a forfeiture rate as we have elected to account for forfeitures as they occur.
These assumptions are estimated as follows:
•
Fair Market Value of Common Stock. Since our IPO, our stock is traded on The Nasdaq Global Select Market. Fair market value of our stock is considered the quoted market price. Prior to our IPO, we have periodically estimated the fair market value of common stock. See “- Common and Preferred Stock Valuation Methodology”
•
Volatility. The expected volatility is based on the historical stock volatility of ours and several comparable publicly traded companies over a sufficient period of time equal to the expected term of the options, as we do not have sufficient trading history to use the volatility of our own common stock.
•
Expected Term. The expected term represents the period that our stock options are expected to be outstanding. We calculated the expected term using the simplified method based on the average of each option’s vesting term and the contractual period during which the option can be exercised, which is typically 10 years following the date of grant.
•
Risk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate was based on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities commensurate with the expected term of the award.
•
Expected Dividend Yield. We have not paid dividends on our common stock nor do we expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.
Pre-IPO Common and Preferred Stock Valuation Methodology
Prior to our IPO, our common and preferred stock valuations were prepared using a hybrid between the option pricing method (OPM) and the probability-weighted expected return method (PWERM), both of which used market approaches to estimate our enterprise value. The OPM treats common stock and preferred stock as call options on the total equity value of a company, with exercise prices based on the value thresholds at which the allocation among the various holders of a company’s securities changes. Under this method, the common stock has value only if the funds available for distribution to stockholders exceeded the value of the preferred stock liquidation preferences at the time of the liquidity event, such as a strategic sale, a merger or initial public offering. The common stock has a claim on the equity value at an exercise price equal to the remaining value immediately after the preferred stock is liquidated. The OPM is appropriate to use when the range of possible future outcomes is so difficult to predict that forecasts would be highly speculative. The OPM commonly uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the price of the call option.
In the OPM, the backsolve method can be used to infer the total equity value implied by the pricing and terms of our Series A and Series B preferred stock financing transactions by making assumptions regarding the expected time to liquidity, expected volatility and risk-free interest rate, and then solve for the value of equity such that the implied value for the most recent financing equals the
amount paid. At certain valuation dates, the equity value inferred from the OPM backsolve method was adjusted for company and market specific events that occurred between the financing date and the valuation date.
The PWERM involves a forward-looking analysis of the possible future outcomes, estimation of ranges of future and present value under each outcome and application of a probability factor to each outcome as of the valuation date. Under this method, discrete future outcomes, including an IPO, and non-IPO scenarios, are weighted based on the estimated probability of each scenario.
The hybrid method is generally appropriate to use when the time to a liquidity event is short, making the range of possible future outcomes relatively easy to predict. In the IPO scenario, all shares of preferred stock were assumed to convert to common stock. Accordingly, the estimated equity value was allocated pro rata among our preferred stock and common stock on an as converted basis, which caused the common stock to have a higher relative value per share than under the scenarios captured by the OPM.
The weighting between the PWERM and OPM employed in the hybrid method was based on our board of directors’ estimate of the probability of each scenario as of each valuation date. These third-party valuations were performed at various dates, which resulted in valuations of our common stock of $0.74 per share as of September 30, 2016, $1.73 per share as of December 31, 2017, $5.88 per share as of February 28, 2018, $8.05 per share as of August 31, 2018 and $9.23 per share as of December 31, 2018. The fair value of our Series A preferred stock was $1.50 per share as of August 31, 2018 and $1.64 per share as of December 31, 2018. The fair value of our Series B preferred stock was $2.22 per share as of August 31, 2018 and $2.18 per share as of December 31, 2018.
The assumptions underlying these valuations represented management’s best estimate, which involved inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. As a result, if we had used significantly different assumptions or estimates, the fair value of our common stock and our stock-based compensation expense could have been materially different.
Upon the closing of the IPO, all of our outstanding preferred stock converted to common stock and it is no longer necessary for management to estimate the fair value of our common stock in connection with our accounting for granted stock options and other such awards we may grant, as the fair value of our common stock will be determined based on the quoted market price of our common stock.
Royalty Transfer Agreement
In connection with the sale of Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock, certain investors are entitled to receive, in the aggregate, a royalty from us equal to one percent of (i) all global net sales of any of our products and (ii) any license income on intellectual property that was in existence at the time of the Series A preferred stock financing. We have elected to account for this liability at fair value with changes recognized in the Statement of Operations. Given the early stage nature of the underlying technology and inherent risks associated with obtaining regulatory approval and achieving commercialization, we ascribed no value to the royalty agreement at inception and at December 31, 2020 and 2019. We continue to evaluate our scientific progress to assess our obligations under this agreement. There is substantial judgment involved in our assessment.
Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
A description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results of operations is disclosed in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Emerging Growth Company Status
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (JOBS Act), and are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company may take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933 for complying with new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that we can elect to opt out of the extended transition period at any time, which election is irrevocable. We have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption from complying with new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
We are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements under the JOBS Act.
