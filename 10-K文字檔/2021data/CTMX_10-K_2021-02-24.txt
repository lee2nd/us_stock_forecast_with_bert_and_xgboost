Overview
We are a clinical-stage, oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company with a vision of transforming lives with safer, more effective therapies. We are advancing a robust pipeline of novel, potential first-in-class antibody-based therapeutics created using our Probody® technology platform. These Probody therapeutics are designed to be conditionally activated in the tumor microenvironment, effectively enabling them to target cancer tissues more specifically, while minimizing deleterious activity in healthy tissues and circulation. We achieve this “conditional activation” by modifying our Probody therapeutics with a mask that is designed to block binding to target until the mask is removed by proteases. Proteases are enzymes that are more abundant in the tumor microenvironment than in normal tissue, leading to potentially an enrichment of therapeutic activity in the tumor. We believe this innovative approach has the potential to improve cancer treatments in three ways by: (1) enhancing a product candidate’s therapeutic window, the balance between tolerability and activity; (2) allowing the pursuit of targets that were previously considered “undruggable,” due to their presence on normal tissues; and (3) improving combination therapies that are, otherwise, poorly tolerated.
Our lead product candidates, praluzatamab ravtansine (CX-2009) and CX-2029, are two conditionally activated antibody-drug conjugates (“ADCs”) against the previously undruggable targets CD166 and CD71, respectively. These cancer targets were considered inaccessible to conventional ADCs due to their ubiquitous expression in many healthy tissues, but which we believe are potentially addressable with our Probody technology. After demonstrating favorable tolerability and encouraging anti-tumor activity in separate dose-escalation Phase 1 studies, praluzatamab ravtansine, our wholly-owned conditional ADC, and CX-2029, a conditionally activated ADC partnered with AbbVie, are currently in Phase 2 clinical studies. Our clinical-stage pipeline also includes cancer immunotherapeutic candidates against validated targets such as our wholly-owned PD-L1 inhibitor, pacmilimab (CX-072), being studied in combination with praluzatamab ravtansine. Our partner, Bristol Myers Squibb is conducting clinical studies with CTLA-4-targeting Probody therapeutics, BMS-986249, currently in a randomized Phase 2 study, and BMS-986288, currently in a Phase 1/2a study.
We also have two preclinical agents in investigational new drug application (“IND”)-enabling studies, including CX-2043, our third conditionally activated ADC targeting the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (“EpCAM”), a widely expressed tumor antigen. CX-2043 has demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity across multiple cancer types and superior tolerability in animal models compared to the corresponding, unmasked ADC. Pursuant to our partnership with Amgen, we have also recently advanced CX-904, a conditionally activated T-cell engaging bispecific antibody candidate against the epidermal growth factor receptor (“EGFR”) on tumor cells and CD3 on T cells, into IND-enabling studies. We intend to file INDs for both CX-2043 and CX-904 in late 2021.
In December 2019, a strain of novel coronavirus-caused disease (now commonly known as COVID-19) was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. COVID-19 has since spread rapidly throughout many countries and has been declared to be a pandemic. In an effort to contain and mitigate the spread of COVID-19, many countries, including the United States, Canada and countries in Europe and Asia, have imposed unprecedented restrictions on travel, business operations and public gatherings, and there have been business closures and limitations on business operations, which have resulted in a substantial reduction in economic activity.
In March 2020, in assessing the evolving COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental restrictions, the emerging challenges for clinical trial execution within our studies and across the industry, and the need of healthcare facilities and providers to prioritize resources for management of the pandemic, we made the decision to temporarily pause new patient enrollment and new site activation in the PROCLAIM-CX-2009-001 study of praluzatamab ravtansine. This study included a Phase 2 expansion designed to evaluate praluzatamab ravtansine in patients with various cancers, including hormone receptor-positive (“HR+”), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (“HER2”)-non-amplified breast cancer. Since then, we have revised our strategy for praluzatamab ravtansine to also include patients with triple-negative breast cancer (“TNBC”). A new three-arm study, CX-2009-002, was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2020 targeting investigators who treat breast cancer. Arms A and B will evaluate praluzatamab ravtansine monotherapy at 7 mg/kg administered every three weeks in patients with HR+/HER2-non-amplified breast cancer and TNBC, respectively. Arm C will evaluate praluzatamab ravtansine in combination with pacmilimab in patients with TNBC. Approximately 40 evaluable patients will be enrolled into each arm of the study.
We also made the strategic decision, in March 2020, to terminate the PROCLAIM-CX-072-002 study evaluating pacmilimab in combination with ipilimumab in melanoma. This decision followed a re-evaluation of the evolving clinical, competitive and commercial landscapes in immuno-oncology, along with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and allowed for resources to be redirected towards our potential first-in-class assets, including a combination of praluzatamab ravtansine and pacmilimab, and to the generation of additional clinical candidates for advancement to the filing of INDs and human testing.
We continue to work with our partner, AbbVie, on the clinical development of CX-2029, and, in the fourth quarter of 2020, we dosed the first patient in the Phase 2 expansion study in patients with squamous non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck squamous cell cancer, esophageal cancer and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In addition, Bristol Myers Squibb initiated a randomized Phase 2 study evaluating BMS-986249, a Probody version of ipilimumab, as monotherapy or in combination with its anti PD-1 antibody, nivolumab, in patients with metastatic melanoma. This study has been modified to include three additional single-arm cohorts: advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, and unresectable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC. Bristol Myers Squibb continues its Phase 1 dose-escalation study of BMS-986288, a Probody version of non-fucosylated ipilimumab.
On February 27, 2020, we entered into an Open Market Sale Agreement (the “Sales Agreement”) with Jefferies LLC (“Jefferies”), to sell shares of our common stock, par value $0.00001 per share, with aggregate gross sales proceeds of up to $75,000,000, from time to time, through an at the market offering under which Jefferies will act as sales agent. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold 1,535,217 shares of our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of $11.7 million under the Sales Agreement. Pursuant to the Sales Agreement, Jefferies, as sales agent, received a commission of 3.0% of the gross sales price for shares of common stock sold under the Sales Agreement.
We do not have any product candidates approved for sale, and we continue to incur significant research and development and general administrative expenses related to our operations. We are not profitable and have incurred losses in each year since our founding in 2008. Our net loss was $32.9 million, $102.2 million and $84.6 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $450.1 million and $ 417.2 million, respectively. We expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future.
The COVID-19 outbreak and any preventative or protective actions that we or our collaboration partners may take in respect of this virus may result in a period of further disruption for our clinical trials, manufacturing, research, financial reporting capabilities and operations generally and could potentially impact our patients, partners, employees and third parties. Any resulting financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but may materially affect the business and our financial condition and results of operations. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions necessary to contain the virus or treat its impact, among others. Although our operations have been modified, they are continuing at a reduced operational rate. Currently, it is not possible to predict how long the pandemic will last or the time that it will take for economic activity to return to its prior levels. We do not yet know the full extent of any impact or delay on our business or our operations, including clinical trial activity, however, we will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely and operate in accordance with all relevant health and safety guidelines as they evolve.
Regulatory agencies, including the FDA, regulate many aspects of a product candidate’s life cycle, including research and development and preclinical and clinical testing. We will need to commit significant time, resources, and funding to develop our wholly-owned and partnered product candidates in clinical trials, including praluzatamab ravtansine, CX-2029, and pacmilimab, as well as any additional product candidates for which we initiate clinical studies in the future. We are unable to provide the nature, timing, and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our product candidates because, among other reasons, of regulatory uncertainty, manufacturing limitations, and the pace of enrollment of our clinical trials, which is a function of many factors, including the availability and proximity of patients with the relevant condition.
We currently have no manufacturing capabilities and do not intend to establish any such capabilities in the near term. As such, we are dependent on third parties to supply our product candidates according to our specifications, in sufficient quantities, on time, in compliance with appropriate regulatory standards and at competitive prices.
Components of Results of Operations
Revenue
Our revenue to date has been primarily derived from non-refundable license payments, milestone payments and reimbursements for research and development expenses under our research, collaboration, and license agreements. We recognize revenue from upfront payments over the term of our estimated period of performance under the agreement using a cost-based input method or a common measure of progress for the entire performance obligation. In addition to receiving upfront payments, we may also be entitled to milestone and other contingent payments upon achieving predefined objectives. Revenue from milestones and other contingent payments, when it is probable that there will not be a significant revenue reversal, is also recognized over the performance period based on a similar method. Reimbursements from Astellas and Bristol Myers Squibb for research and development costs when incurred under our research, collaboration and license agreements with them are classified as revenue.
For the foreseeable future, we do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products unless and until such time as our product candidates have advanced through clinical development and obtained regulatory approval. We expect that any revenue we generate in the foreseeable future will fluctuate from year to year as a result of the timing and amount of milestones and other payments from our collaboration agreements with AbbVie, Amgen, Astellas, Bristol Myers Squibb and any other collaboration partners, and as a result of the fluctuations in the research and development expenses we incur in the performance of assigned activities under these agreements.
AbbVie, one of our collaboration partners, entered into a license agreement with Seattle Genetics, Inc. (“SGEN”) to license certain intellectual property rights. As part of our collaboration agreement with AbbVie, we received a sublicense to these intellectual property rights and therefore pay SGEN sublicense fees. These sublicense fees are treated as reductions to the transaction price and combined with the performance obligation to which they relate. Milestone payments, when considered probable of being reached and when a significant revenue reversal would not be probable of occurring, are also recorded net of the associated sublicense fees and included in the transaction price.
Research and Development Expenses
Our research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred to conduct research, such as the discovery and development of our product candidates, clinical development including activities with third parties, such as contract research organizations (“CRO”) and contract development and manufacturing organizations (“CMO”), the manufacture of drug products used in clinical trials, as well as the development of product candidates pursuant to our research, collaboration and license agreements. Research and development expenses include personnel costs, including stock-based compensation expense, contractor services, laboratory materials and supplies, depreciation and maintenance of research equipment, and an allocation of related facilities costs. We expense research and development costs as incurred.
We expect our research and development expenses to increase substantially in absolute dollars in the future as we advance our product candidates through clinical trials, initiate additional clinical trials, and pursue regulatory approval of our product candidates. Examples include our Phase 2 clinical trials for praluzatamab ravtansine (CX-2009) and CX-2029 and potential future clinical trials for CX-2029 and for praluzatamab ravtansine in combination with pacmilimab (CX-072). The process of conducting the necessary clinical research to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming. The actual probability of success for our product candidates may be affected by a variety of factors including: the safety and efficacy of our product candidates, early clinical data, investment in our clinical program, the ability of collaborators to successfully develop our licensed product candidates, competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when and to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of our product candidates.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses include personnel costs, expenses for outside professional services and other allocated expenses. Personnel costs consist of salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation. Outside professional services consist of accounting and audit services, legal and other consulting fees. Allocated expenses primarily consist of rent expense related to our office and information technology related costs.
Interest Income
Interest income primarily consists of interest income from our cash equivalents and short-term investments, and accretion of discounts or amortization of premiums on our short-term investments.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net consists primarily of income (expense) resulting from changes to currency exchange rates.
Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes
Income taxes are recorded in accordance with ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes, or ASC 740, which provides for deferred taxes using an asset and liability approach. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our financial statements or tax returns. We determine our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, which are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided, if based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
We also account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740. When uncertain tax positions exist, we recognize the tax benefit of tax positions to the extent that the benefit will more likely than not be realized. The determination as to whether the tax benefit will more likely than not be realized is based upon the technical merits of the tax position as well as consideration of the available facts and circumstances.
On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The tax relief measures under the CARES Act for businesses include a five-year net operating loss carryback, suspension of annual deduction limitation of 80% of taxable income from net operating losses generated in a tax year beginning after December 31, 2017, changes in the deductibility of interest, acceleration of alternative minimum tax credit refunds, payroll tax relief, and a technical correction to allow accelerated deductions for qualified improvement property. We record the effect of an enacted change in a tax law in the period that includes the enactment date in accordance with ASC 740.
Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Revenue
The following table summarizes our revenue by collaboration partner during the respective periods:
The increase in revenue of $42.9 million for 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to:
•
an increase in revenue of $32.3 million from AbbVie primarily due to (a) $28.9 million of revenue recognized related to the $40.0 million milestone payment earned in the first quarter of 2020 for satisfying the CD71 dose escalation success criteria milestone under the CD71 Co-Development and Licensing Agreement with AbbVie (the “CD71 Agreement”), reflecting the percentage completed to-date of the project for of 2020, (b) a $1.0 million increase in revenue recognized related to the $10.0 million upfront payment earned for the second target selected by AbbVie in June 2019 under the Discovery Collaboration and Licensing Agreement (the “Discovery Agreement”), which amount is being recognized as revenue over the estimated research service period of five years and (c) a higher percentage of completion progress under the CD71 Agreement in 2020 compared to 2019 as a result of additional FTE hours incurred;
•
an increase in revenue of $4.7 million from Amgen primarily due to an increase in the percentage of completion progress for 2020 as a result of additional FTE hours incurred, and the completion of the clinical candidate characterization phase and moving to the IND-enabling phase earlier than planned in the second quarter of 2020 which resulted in a reduction of the estimated FTE hours-to-completion of the Amgen EGFR program under the Collaboration and License Agreement with Amgen (the “Amgen Agreement”);
•
an increase in revenue of $13.9 million from Astellas due to the recognition of revenue of $12.4 million related to the $80.0 million upfront payment being recognized over the estimated research service period of five years, as well as service revenue of $1.5 million representing research and development services provided to Astellas under the Collaboration and License Agreement (the “Astellas Agreement”) entered into in March 2020; and
•
a decrease in revenue of $8.1 million from Bristol Myers Squibb primarily due to the recognition of revenue of $18.1 million related to certain targets terminated under the Collaboration and License Agreement with Bristol Myers Squibb (the “BMS Agreement”) in the first quarter of 2019; partially offset by the recognition in full of the $10.0 million milestone payment earned for achieving the dosing of first patient in the Part 2 cohort expansion of the ongoing CTLA-4 program by Bristol Myers Squibb in February 2020.
Operating Costs and Expenses
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses decreased by $18.7 million during 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease was attributable to the following:
•
a decrease of $10.4 million in clinical trial related expenses resulting from decreased clinical activities primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic and revision of our development strategies;
•
a decrease due to a $5.0 million charge for acquiring the technical know-how related to drug conjugate linker-toxin and CD3-based bispecific technologies during the first quarter of 2019;
•
a decrease of $2.3 million in laboratory contracts services and supplies related expenses due to timing of manufacturing and other research activities;
•
a decrease of $1.0 million in consulting expenses primarily due to shifting of more previously outsourced research and development work in house; and
•
a decrease of $1.1 million in travel related expenses due to a decrease in business travel activities as a result of the pandemic.
The above decreases were offset by the following:
•
a net increase of $0.7 million in personnel related expenses primarily due to an increase of $1.8 million as a result of merit increase and increase in new hires of senior positions, and an increase of $1.0 million related to severance payments during 2020, partially offset by a decrease of $2.1 million in stock-based compensation driven primarily by increased cancellations of stock options due to employee departures as well as decreases in the grant date fair values of new option grants resulting from decreases in prices of our common stock during the current year; and
•
an increase of $0.5 million in allocation of information technology and facilities related expenses resulting from an increase in the ratio of headcount in the research and development function relative to that for the general and administrative function.
The following table summarizes our research and development expenses by program incurred during the respective periods presented:
The decrease in research and development expenses for 2020 compared to 2019 was attributable to the following changes by project:
•
The increase in praluzatamab ravtansine (CX-2009) expenses was primarily due to a $3.0 million licensing payment to ImmunoGen for achieving the milestone of the first dosing of a patient in the praluzatamab ravtansine Phase 2 clinical trial during the first quarter of 2020, offset by a $0.7 million decrease in clinical trial related expenses and a $0.4 million decrease in laboratory contract services due to the pause in clinical activity related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
•
The decrease in CX-2029 expenses was primarily due to a decrease of $4.5 million in laboratory contract services resulting from the timing of manufacturing and other research activities, partially offset by a $1.4 million increase in sublicense fee expense to UCSB related to the $40.0 million milestone payment earned in March 2020 for satisfying the CD71 dose escalation success criteria under the CD71 Agreement.
•
The decrease in pacmilimab (CX-072) expenses was primarily due to $9.2 million decrease in clinical trial related expenses and a $7.3 million decrease in laboratory contract services as a result of the timing of manufacturing and other research activities in the pacmilimab study and the termination in March 2020 of the CX-072-002 study to evaluate the conditionally activated anti-PD-L1 pacmilimab in combination with ipilimumab in melanoma.
•
The increase in “Other wholly owned and partnered programs” was primarily due to a $6.0 million sublicense fee payment to UCSB related to the $80.0 million upfront payment under the Astellas Agreement during the first quarter of 2020, an increase of $6.3 million in laboratory contract services related to the Amgen EGFR project as it ramped up during the IND-enabling phase, and an increase of $2.5 million in laboratory contract services largely related to the EpCAM program that began in December 2019, partially offset by the $7.5 million of upfront license fee paid for the EpCAM program we entered into with Immunogen in the fourth quarter of 2019 (the “ImmunoGen 2019 License”).
•
The decrease in general research and development expenses was primarily due to a $5.0 million charge for acquiring technical know-how related to drug conjugate linker-toxin and CD3-based bispecific technologies during the first quarter of 2019, and the $3.4 million sublicense and maintenance fees associated with entering into Amendment No.3 to the UCSB Agreement in the second quarter of 2019.
•
The increase in internal costs was primarily due to increase in personnel-related expenses.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses decreased by $0.7 million during 2020 compared to that in 2019. The decrease was attributable to the following:
•
a decrease of $2.3 million in personnel-related expense primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation driven primarily by increased cancellations of stock options due to employee departures as well as decreases in the grant date fair values of new option grants resulting from decreases in prices of our common stock during the current year; and
•
a decrease of $0.5 million in travel related expenses due to decrease in business travel activities;
The above decreases were offset by the following:
•
an increase of $1.2 million in outside professional services primarily related to legal services for new patent filings and maintenance, business development and other legal matters;
•
an increase of $0.5 million in dues and subscriptions primarily due to increase in software application hosting projects to improve operational processes; and
•
an increase of $0.4 million in business insurance premium expenses.
Interest Income and Other Expense, Net
Interest Income
Interest income decreased by $6.5 million for 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower average cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments during 2020 and lower interest rates as we experienced a sharp decrease in interest rates starting in March 2020.
Other Expense, net
Other expense, net decreased by $0.1 million for 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in foreign currency losses resulting from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro and British Pound Sterling.
Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes
Income tax benefit increased by $13.5 million for 2020 compared to 2019. The income tax benefit of $13.9 million for 2020 was generated due to the recognition of net operating loss carrybacks under the CARES Act, which generated a tax refund of taxes paid for 2018. The income tax benefit of $0.4 million for 2019 was primarily due to a true-up of 2018 federal income tax expense and an unrealized gain on the available-for-sale securities recorded in other comprehensive income for 2019.
Discussion of 2018 items and the year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 filed on February 27, 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources of Liquidity
As of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $316.1 million and an accumulated deficit of $450.1 million, compared to cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $296.1 million and an accumulated deficit of $417.2 million as of December 31, 2019. Additionally, in January and February 2021 in an underwritten public offering of our common stock, we raised an aggregate net proceeds of approximately $107.7 million. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through sales of our common stock in conjunction with the IPO, subsequent stock offerings and through our at-the-market offering, sales of our convertible preferred securities prior to our IPO and payments received under our collaboration agreements.
Based upon our current operating plan, we expect our existing capital resources will be sufficient to fund operations for a period of at least twelve months from the date the financial statements included in this report are issued. However, if the anticipated operating results and future financing are not achieved in future periods, our planned expenditures may need to be reduced in order to extend the time period over which the then-available resources would be able to fund the operations. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures depend on numerous factors, including the progress of our preclinical and clinical development efforts, the results of any clinical trials and other studies, our operating costs and expenditures and other factors described under the caption “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The cost and timing of developing our products, including praluzatamab ravtansine (CX-2009), CX-2029, and pacmilimab (CX-072) are highly uncertain, are subject to substantial risks and many changes. As such, we may alter our expenditures as a result of contingencies such as the failure of one or all of our product candidates currently in clinical development, the acceleration of one or all of our product candidates in clinical development, the initiating of clinical trials for additional product candidates, the identification of more promising product candidates in our research efforts or unexpected operating costs and expenditures. We will need to raise additional funds in the future. There can be no assurance, however, that such efforts will be successful or that, in the event that they are successful, the terms and conditions of such financing will be favorable to us.
Summary Statement of Cash Flows
The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by operating activities was $5.3 million, which consisted of a net loss of $32.9 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of $20.1 million and a net increase of $18.1 million relating to the change of our net operating assets and liabilities. The non-cash charges primarily consisted of $14.8 million in stock-based compensation, $2.9 million in non-cash lease expense and $2.6 million in depreciation and amortization, which amounts were partially offset by $0.2 million in accretion of discounts on our short-term investments.
The change of our net operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to:
•
a net increase of $30.9 million in deferred revenue resulting primarily from the $80.0 million upfront payment from Astellas as well as the $40.0 million milestone payment from AbbVie, partially offset by the continued recognition of deferred revenue from other existing customers;
•
an increase of $0.1 million in cash flows from prepaid expenses and other current assets;
•
a decrease of $0.2 million in cash flows from other assets;
•
a decrease of $11.0 million in accrued liabilities primarily due to payment of $7.5 million for the ImmunoGen 2019 License and $2.8 million for lease liabilities;
•

The non-cash charges primarily consisted of $19.1 million in stock-based compensation; $1.6 million of common stock issued in connection with our entry into Amendment No.3 to the UCSB Agreement, $2.7 million in non-cash lease expense and $2.6 million in depreciation and amortization expense; which amounts were partially offset by $2.2 million in accretion of discounts on our short-term investments.
The change in our net operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to:
•
a decrease of $47.7 million in deferred revenue resulting from continued recognition of deferred revenue from existing customers and the accelerated recognition of revenue of $17.4 million related to the termination of certain targets under the BMS Agreement in the first quarter of 2019, partially offset by the additional $10.0 million milestone payment due from AbbVie in June 2019, which payment was triggered by its selection of the second target under the Discovery Collaboration and Licensing Agreement with AbbVie (as amended, the “Discovery Agreement”);
•
a decrease of $15.4 million in accrued liabilities and income tax payable primarily due to the net payment of $13.1 million for our 2018 income tax liability and $3.8 million in sublicense fees, partially offset by $1.5 million increase in other liabilities during 2019;
•
a decrease of $1.0 million in cashflow with $0.4 million from accounts payable and $0.6 million from other assets; and
•
an increase of $2.0 million in cash flows from prepaid expenses and other current assets.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2020, cash used in investing activities was $18.7 million, which consisted of $199.1 million used in the purchase of short-term investments and $2.3 million of capital expenditures used to purchase property and equipment, partially offset by $182.7 million in proceeds received upon the maturity of marketable securities.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, cash provided by investing activities was $79.7 million, which consisted of $258.2 million in proceeds received upon the maturity of marketable securities, partially offset by $175.0 million used in the purchases of short-term investments and $3.5 million of capital expenditures used to purchase property and equipment.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by financing activities was $16.9 million, which primarily consisted of proceeds from our common stock issuance of $11.3 million under the Open Market Sales Agreement (net of underwriting discounts and stock issuance costs of $0.4 million) and $5.6 million from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchases under the employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”).
During the year ended December 31, 2019, cash provided by financing activities was $1.6 million, primarily consisted of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchases under the employee stock purchase plan.
Contractual Obligations
The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands):
(1)
We lease our current facility under a long-term operating lease, which expires in 2026. The lease provides us with one option to extend the lease term for a period of five years at the then fair market rental value.
(2)
We have royalty obligations under the terms of certain exclusive licensed patent rights. The royalty obligations are cancellable any time by giving notice to the licensor, with the termination being effective 60 days after giving notice. See Part II. Item 8.

We have annual license maintenance fees under the terms of certain license agreement with UCSB. See Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 10 - “License Agreement” in the accompanying Notes to the financial statements for more information.
(4)
This table does not include any milestone payments or royalty payments to third parties as the amounts, timing and likelihood of such payments are not known. See Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 9 - “Research and Collaboration Agreements” in the accompanying Notes to the financial statements for more information.
We enter into agreements in the normal course of business with CROs for clinical trials and with vendors for pre-clinical studies and other services and products for operating purposes, which are cancelable at any time by us, generally upon 30 to 60 days prior written notice. These payments are not included in the above table of contractual obligations. The above table also excludes unrecognized tax benefits of $6.5 million as of December 31, 2020 because these uncertain tax positions, if recognized, would be an adjustment to our deferred tax assets, which are subject to a valuation allowance.
Segment Information
We have one primary business activity and operate as one reportable segment.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these judgments and estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any such differences may be material. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management’s judgments and estimates.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue when our customer obtains control of the promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which we have received or expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services.
Our revenues are primarily derived through our license, research, development and commercialization agreements. The terms of these types of agreements may include (i) licenses for our technology or programs, (ii) research and development services, and (iii) services or obligations in connection with participation in research or steering committees. Payments to us under these arrangements typically include one or more of the following: nonrefundable upfront and license fees, research funding, milestone and other contingent payments to us for the achievement of defined collaboration objectives and certain preclinical, clinical, regulatory and sales-based events, as well as royalties on sales of any commercialized products. We assess whether the promises in its arrangements with customers are considered as distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately. Judgment is required to determine whether the license to our intellectual property is distinct from the research and development services or participation on steering committees.
Our collaboration and license agreements may include contingent payments related to specified research, development and regulatory milestones. Such milestone payments are typically payable under the collaborations when the collaboration partner claims or selects a target, or initiates or advances a covered product candidate in preclinical or clinical development, upon submission for marketing approval of a covered product with regulatory authorities; or upon receipt of actual marketing approvals of a covered product or for additional indications. Milestone payments that are not within the control of us or the licensee, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. At each reporting date, we re-evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and estimates the amount to be included in the transaction price by using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price in such period of determination.
Our collaboration and license agreements may also include contingent payments related to sales-based milestones. Sales-based milestones are typically payable when annual sales of a covered product reach specified levels. Sales-based milestones are recognized at the later of when the associated performance obligation has been satisfied or when the sales occur. Unlike other contingency payments, such as regulatory milestones, sales-based milestones are not included in the transaction price based on estimates at the inception of the contract, but rather, are included when the sales or usage occur.
The transaction price in each arrangement is allocated to the identified performance obligations based on the relative standalone selling price (“SSP”) of each distinct performance obligation, which requires judgment. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when a license or service is not sold separately, SSP is determined using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. Due to the early stage of our licensed technology, the license of such technology is typically combined with research and development services and steering committee participation as one performance obligation. In the event that we receive non-cash consideration such as consideration in the form of a research license and research support services from the counterparty, the transaction price of a non-monetary exchange that has commercial substance is estimated based on the fair value of the non-cash consideration received, which may be determined through a valuation analysis.
In certain cases, our performance creates an asset that does not have an alternative use to the customer and we have an enforceable right to payment at all times for performance completed to date. In these cases, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, we adjust the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. There have been changes in estimates of research service periods and the related estimated FTE hours-to-completion, of certain of our research development programs in 2020, 2019 and 2018. Such adjustments have impacted and may continue to impact the amounts and timing of our revenue recognized.
Research and Development Expenses
We record accrued liabilities for estimated costs of research, preclinical and clinical studies and contract manufacturing activities, which are a significant component of research and development expenses. A substantial portion of our ongoing research and development activities is conducted by third-party service providers, including CROs. Our contracts with CROs generally include pass-through costs, such as regulatory expenses, investigator fees, travel costs and other miscellaneous costs. The financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations, which vary from contract to contract and may result in payments that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided to us under such contracts. We accrue the costs incurred under agreements with these third parties based on actual work completed in accordance with the respective agreements. In the event we make advance payments, they are recorded as prepaid expenses and recognized as the services are performed. We determine the estimated costs through discussions with internal personnel and external service providers as to the progress of stage of completion of the services and the agreed-upon fees to be paid for such services.
We make significant judgments and estimates in determining the accrual balance in each reporting period. As actual costs become known, we adjust our accruals. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different than the actual amounts incurred, such estimates for the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any one period. Our accrual is dependent, in part, upon the receipt of timely and accurate reporting from CROs and other third-party vendors. Variations in the assumptions used to estimate accruals including, but not limited to, the number of patients enrolled, the rate of patient enrollment and the actual services performed, may vary from our estimates, resulting in adjustments to clinical trial expenses in future periods. Changes in these estimates that result in material changes to our accruals could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Income Taxes
We account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to reflect the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income, the amount and timing of which are uncertain. The valuation allowance requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. Based upon the weight of available evidence at December 31, 2020, we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets after management considered all available evidence, both positive and negative, including but not limited to our historical operating results, income or loss in recent periods, cumulative income in recent years, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and significant risk and uncertainty related to forecasts.
We recognize the tax effects of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that it will be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date and only in an amount more likely than not that it will be sustained upon review by the tax authorities. We evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and adjust the liability for changes in facts and circumstances, such as new regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, including the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”), new information obtained during a tax examination, significant amendment to an existing tax law, or resolution of an examination. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made. The resolution of our uncertain income tax positions is dependent on uncontrollable factors such as law changes, new case law, and the willingness of the income tax authorities to settle, including the timing thereof and other factors. Although we do not anticipate significant changes to our uncertain income tax positions in the next twelve months, items outside of our control could cause our uncertain income tax positions to change in the future, which would be recorded in our statements of operations. Interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters are recognized as a component of income tax expense.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements and do not have any holdings in variable interest entities.
