EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
Overview
Since our inception in 1992, we have been primarily engaged in developing and operating gaming establishments and related lodging, restaurant and entertainment facilities. Our primary source of revenue is from the net proceeds of our gaming machines and tables, with ancillary revenue generated from hotel, restaurant, horse racing (including off-track betting), sports wagering, bowling and entertainment facilities that are in most instances a part of the casinos.
We view each market in which we operate as a separate operating segment and each casino within those markets as a reporting unit. We aggregate all operating segments into three reportable segments based on the geographical locations in which our casinos operate: United States, Canada and Poland. We have additional business activities including concession agreements, management agreements, consulting agreements and certain other corporate and management operations that we report as Corporate and Other.
‎
The table below provides information about the aggregation of our operating segments and reporting units into reportable segments. The reporting units except for Century Downs Racetrack and Casino and Casinos Poland are owned, operated and managed through wholly-owned subsidiaries. Our ownership and operation of Century Downs Racetrack and Casino and Casinos Poland are discussed below. The real estate assets at our West Virginia and Missouri operating segments are owned by VICI PropCo.
Century Bets operates the pari-mutuel off-track betting network in southern Alberta, Canada. Prior to August 2019, we had a 75% controlling financial interest in CBS through CRM. In August 2019, we purchased the remaining 25% non-controlling financial interest from Rocky Mountain Turf Club for CAD 0.2 million ($0.2 million based on the exchange rate in effect on August 5, 2019), resulting in CBS becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary.
On March 17, 2020, we announced that we had permanently closed CCB. CCB voluntarily surrendered its casino gaming license on April 28, 2020 and entered into a creditors voluntary liquidation on May 6, 2020. For additional information related to CCB, see Note 1, “Description of Business and Basis of Presentation,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report.
We have controlling financial interests through our subsidiary CRM in the following reporting units:
We have a 66.6% ownership interest in CPL and we consolidate CPL as a majority-owned subsidiary for which we have a controlling financial interest. Polish Airports owns the remaining 33.3% in CPL. We account for and report the 33.3% Polish Airports ownership interest as a non-controlling financial interest. CPL has been in operation since 1989 and, as of December 31, 2020, owned eight casinos throughout Poland.
We have a 75% ownership interest in CDR and we consolidate CDR as a majority-owned subsidiary for which we have a controlling financial interest. We account for and report the remaining 25% ownership interest in CDR as a non-controlling financial interest. CDR operates Century Downs Racetrack and Casino, a REC in Balzac, a north metropolitan area of Calgary, Alberta, Canada.
We also have a concession agreement for ship-based casinos and ownership in and a consulting agreement with MCE, which are detailed further under “Corporate and Other” below.
Acquisition
On December 6, 2019, we completed the Acquisition of the operations of Cape Girardeau, Caruthersville and Mountaineer from Eldorado Resorts, Inc. for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $111.7 million, which consisted of $110.6 million at closing and an additional $1.1 million in working capital adjustments. Immediately prior to the Acquisition, the real estate assets underlying the Acquired Casinos were sold to VICI PropCo, and we and VICI PropCo subsidiaries entered into a triple net Master Lease for the three Acquired Casino properties. See “Master Lease” in Item 2 for more information.
Additional Projects Under Development
We currently are exploring additional potential gaming projects and acquisition opportunities. Along with the capital needs of potential projects, there are various other risks which, if they materialize, could affect our ability to complete a proposed project or acquisition or could eliminate its feasibility altogether.
Presentation of Foreign Currency Amounts
The average exchange rates to the US dollar used to translate balances during each reported period are as follows:
We recognize in our statement of (loss) earnings, foreign currency transaction gains or losses resulting from the translation of casino operations and other transactions that are denominated in a currency other than US dollars. Our casinos in Canada and Poland represent a significant portion of our business, and the revenue generated and expenses incurred by these operations are generally denominated in Canadian dollars and Polish zloty. A decrease in the value of these currencies in relation to the value of the US dollar would decrease the earnings from our foreign operations when translated into US dollars. An increase in the value of these currencies in relation to the value of the US dollar would increase the earnings from our foreign operations when translated into US dollars. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report.
Recent Developments Related to COVID-19
In late 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 was identified in China and has since spread throughout much of the world. The COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse effect on our 2020 results of operations and financial condition, and we expect the situation will continue to have an adverse impact on our results into 2021. The duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic otherwise remains uncertain. The table below provides a summary of the time periods in 2020 in which we closed our casinos, hotels and other facilities to comply with quarantines issued by governments to contain the spread of COVID-19 and the percentage of gaming floors currently open unless otherwise indicated.
(1)CRC’s slot floor is fully open. CTL’s slot floor is 71% open due to a county variance requiring every other machine to be powered off. Table games at CRC were closed from June to December 2020. Table games at CTL were closed from June to September 2020 and closed again in December 2020. When table games at CTL were open, there were restrictions on the number of gaming positions. CRC and CTL reopened table games in February 2021 with restrictions on the number of gaming positions.
(2)Percentage of the gaming floor open prior to the second closure in December 2020. Prior to the second closure in December 2020, slot floors were open with restrictions on the number of slot machines operating. Table games were open from September 2020 to November 2020 with restrictions on the number of gaming positions.
(3)CPL’s slot floors are fully open. Table games are open with restrictions on the number of gaming positions.
Our casinos have varied their operations based on the governmental health and safety requirements in the jurisdictions in which they are located. In Colorado, each city has different gaming floor restrictions, and table games in both Cripple Creek and Central City were closed during portions of 2020 but were able to reopen in February 2021. The full slot floor is open in Cripple Creek compared to approximately 65% in Central City. For both Colorado cities, there are capacity restrictions within the casinos and alcohol sales must stop at 2:00 a.m. but the casinos are able to operate 24 hours a day, seven days per week. In Missouri, the full gaming floor is open with restrictions on gaming positions, hours of operation are reduced, and food outlets that have reopened have limited operating hours. In West Virginia, the majority of the gaming floor has reopened, the gaming floor is limited to machines that are six feet apart or with barriers, food and beverage outlets have reopened with limited hours of operation, the convention space remains closed, hours of operation are limited, there are capacity restrictions within the casino, and the hotel is
operating with limited rooms available. In Canada, casinos remain closed. In Poland, the slot floors are fully reopened, table games have reopened with capacity restrictions, alcohol sales are currently suspended and there are capacity restrictions within the casinos.
Temporary closures of all our facilities throughout 2020 due to COVID-19 negatively impacted results for the year ended December 31, 2020. We estimate that the closures during the first and second quarters of 2020 adversely impacted net operating revenue and Adjusted EBITDA by approximately $91.3 million and $34.3 million, respectively, and closures in December 2020 adversely impacted net operating revenue and Adjusted EBITDA by approximately $9.2 million and $1.7 million, respectively. We estimate that the net cash outflows related to operations during the time they were fully suspended were, on average, approximately $8.0 million per month. We continue to monitor our liquidity in light of the uncertainty resulting from COVID-19. We plan to continue to reduce marketing and operational expenditures where possible and to seek government subsidies in jurisdictions in which they are available and attainable. Planned capital expenditures in 2021 include approximately $8.0 million in gaming equipment, renovations to various properties and security system upgrades. Our planned capital expenditure projects in 2021 will be evaluated throughout the year and postponed to 2022 if necessary and permitted under our agreements.
In March 2020, as a proactive measure to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of the uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we borrowed $9.95 million on our revolving credit facility with Macquarie and $7.4 million on our credit facility with UniCredit Bank Austria AG (“UniCredit”). We repaid the revolving credit facility in July 2020 except for a $50,000 letter of credit that we cash collateralized. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report for further discussion of the Macquarie credit agreement and the UniCredit credit agreement, including discussion of a recent amendment to the Macquarie credit agreement that, among other things, waives compliance with a financial covenant under the Macquarie credit agreement.
We cannot predict the negative impacts that the failure to suppress the spread of COVID-19 will continue to have on our consumer demand, workforce, suppliers, contractors and other partners and whether future closures will be required. Such closures have had and will continue to have a material impact on us. While the severity and duration of such business impacts cannot currently be estimated, the effects of COVID-19 and the requirements of health and safety protocols are expected to continue to have a material impact on us.

DISCUSSION OF RESULTS
Years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018
Century Casinos, Inc. and Subsidiaries
(1)For a discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net (loss) earnings attributable to Century Casinos, Inc. shareholders, see Item 6, “Selected Financial Data” of this report.
Factors impacting year-over-year comparability of the results include the following:
United States
We acquired the operations at MTR, CCG and CCV in the Acquisition in December 2019. MTR is reported in the West Virginia operating segment and CCG and CCV are reported in the Missouri operating segment.
West Virginia contributed a total of $90.2 million in net operating revenue and ($5.9) million in net losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $8.7 million in net operating revenue and $0.4 million in net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2019, which consisted of the month of December 2019.
Missouri contributed a total of $79.6 million in net operating revenue and ($31.3) million in net losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $7.4 million in net operating revenue and $1.0 million in net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2019, which consisted of the month of December 2019.
Canada
In Edmonton, we began operating CMR in April 2019. CMR contributed a total of $14.7 million in net operating revenue and ($3.9) million in net losses for the year ended December 31, 2020, $18.9 million in net operating revenue and ($2.4) million in net losses for the year ended December 31, 2019 and ($1.1) million in net losses for the year ended December 31, 2018.
‎
Poland
Casino closures due to license expirations and delays in license tender awards in Poland impacted comparability of results for CPL beginning in 2017. We estimate that casino closures throughout 2018 decreased CPL’s net operating revenue by PLN 35.2 million ($9.8 million based on the average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2018), net income attributable to Century Casinos, Inc. shareholders by PLN 7.4 ($2.1 million based on the average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2018), and Adjusted EBITDA by PLN 12.0 ($3.3 million based on the average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2018). See the Poland discussion below for additional information.
Corporate and Other
We began operating CCB in May 2018. CCB was closed in March 2020 due to COVID-19 and CCB’s board of directors determined that CCB would enter into creditors voluntary liquidation, which occurred in May 2020. CCB was deconsolidated as a subsidiary in May 2020. We recorded a $23.7 million gain related to the deconsolidation to general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020. Due to historical and forecast losses at CCB due to changes in the current regulatory environment for casinos in England requiring enhanced due diligence of customers, we determined that the long-lived assets, ROU operating lease asset and intangible asset were impaired and wrote-off $16.5 million to impairment - intangible and tangible assets in December 2019. CCB contributed a total of $0.5 million in net operating revenue and $23.1 million in net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily related to the gain on deconsolidation. CCB contributed $3.2 million in net operating revenue and ($20.0) million in net losses for the year ended December 31, 2019, and $2.7 million in net operating revenue and ($2.1) million in net losses for the year ended December 31, 2018.
We incurred $5.4 million in acquisition costs in 2019 related to the Acquisition.

For a discussion of these items, see “Non-Operating Income (Expense)” and “Taxes” below in this Item 7.
REPORTABLE SEGMENTS
The following discussion provides further detail of consolidated results by reportable segment.
We acquired MTR in West Virginia and CCG and CCV in Missouri in the Acquisition in December 2019.
Sports wagering in Colorado became legal on May 1, 2020. We have partnered with sports betting operators that will conduct sports wagering under each of the three Colorado master licenses for sports wagering held by our Colorado subsidiaries. One of these mobile sports betting apps launched in July 2020. Each agreement with the sports betting operators provides for a share of net gaming revenue and a minimum revenue guarantee each year.
In November 2020, Colorado voters passed a constitutional amendment to allow voters in Cripple Creek, Black Hawk and Central City to increase or remove betting limits and approve new casino games. Elected officials in all three cities approved no limits on single bets at the casinos and new games to begin May 2021. The changes are expected to encourage gamblers who might otherwise travel to destination casinos to gamble in local Colorado casinos.
In December 2020, we entered into an agreement with a gaming partner to utilize our license with the state of West Virginia to operate an internet and mobile interactive gaming application. The application is estimated to launch in the second quarter of 2021. The agreement provides for a share of net gaming revenue.
‎
Our US operations closed due to COVID-19 on March 17, 2020 and reopened between June 1, 2020 and June 17, 2020. The results below are presented to illustrate the estimated impact of COVID-19 on net operating revenue in the United States segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 as well as the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. We did not acquire the West Virginia and Missouri properties until December 2019.
The results below are presented to illustrate the estimated impact of COVID-19 on operating expenses in the United States segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 as well as the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, excluding depreciation and amortization expense and impairment - intangible and tangible assets.
During the United States closures we suspended marketing initiatives, furloughed employees and reduced operating costs and expenses as much as possible. Additional savings related to gaming-related expenses. COVID-19 continues to impact results, and we are seeking to maintain operating cost efficiencies during 2021. We anticipate increasing our promotional offerings as needed to compete in the competitive markets in which we operate our US casinos. We plan to continue to encourage social distancing and other measures in compliance with governmental health and safety requirements.
A reconciliation of net earnings attributable to Century Casinos, Inc. shareholders to Adjusted EBITDA can be found in the “Non-GAAP Measures - Adjusted EBITDA” discussion in Item 6, “Selected Financial Data” of this report.
‎
In Edmonton, construction on the Century Mile project began in July 2017. In January 2019, CMR began operating the Northern Alberta off-track betting network. The CMR casino in Edmonton opened on April 1, 2019, and the first horse race was held on April 28, 2019.
Results in US dollars were impacted by (1.1%) and (2.4%) exchange rate decreases in the average rates between the US dollar and the Canadian dollar for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 and the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, respectively.
Our Canadian operations closed due to COVID-19 on March 17, 2020 and reopened on June 13, 2020. The Canadian operations closed again on December 13, 2020 due to COVID-19. The results below are presented to illustrate the estimated impact of COVID-19 on net operating revenue in the Canada segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 and the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, respectively.
‎
The results below are presented to illustrate the estimated impact of COVID-19 on operating expenses in the Canada segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 and the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, respectively, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, impairment - intangible and tangible assets and gain on sale of casino operations.
‎
Net operating revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was impacted negatively by closures due to COVID-19. Following the March 2020 closures, table games were reopened in mid-September 2020 and closed again in November 2020. Our casinos in Canada were operating with approximately 71% of the slot floor open prior to the second closures in December 2020. Attendance restrictions for racing and closures of our showroom in Edmonton also negatively impacted food and beverage revenue in 2020. We do not expect the Edmonton showroom to reopen until at least the third quarter of 2021. In addition, we sold the casino operations of CAL in December 2020, which will impact comparability of the Calgary operating segment in 2021.
Net operating revenue during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 was impacted in the Edmonton operating segment primarily due to opening CMR in April 2019 and in the Calgary operating segment due to a casino expansion that added 70 slot machines to CDR’s gaming floor in November 2019.
Operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 were impacted by COVID-19. We received wage subsidies provided by the Canadian government through the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy that was enacted in April 2020 as a result of COVID-19 to help employers offset a portion of their employee wages for a limited period. The qualified government wage subsidies reduced operating expenses by CAD 7.4 million ($5.5 million based on the average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2020). In addition, we sold the casino operations of CAL in December 2020. The gain on sale of the casino operations reduced operating expenses in the Calgary operating segment by $6.5 million, and the sale of the casino operations will reduce operating expenses in the Calgary operating segment going forward.
Operating expenses in the Edmonton operating segment during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 were impacted by the opening of CMR in April 2019.
During the Canadian closures we suspended marketing initiatives, furloughed employees and reduced operating costs and expenses as much as possible. Because COVID-19 continues to impact results, we are continuing to focus on managing costs. We continue to look for synergies between our Canadian properties including prizes that are available to guests at all locations instead of at individual casinos only. We expect payroll costs will begin to trend higher as it is expected that table games will reopen when the casinos reopen, and government wage subsidies are not forecast to continue once operations resume in 2021. We plan to continue to update our properties with enhancements to encourage social distancing and other measures to allow us to reopen additional gaming space and other facilities that currently are closed due to COVID-19 restrictions.

‎
In Poland, casino gaming licenses are granted for a term of six years. These licenses are not renewable. Before a gaming license expires, there is a public notification of the available license and any gaming company can apply for a new license for that city. The casino at the LIM Center in Warsaw reopened in August 2019. We expanded the gaming floor at the Marriott Hotel and added an additional six table games in May 2019.
Delays by the Polish government in awarding licenses following their expiration resulted in several casinos closing throughout Poland, lost gaming tax revenue for the government and additional costs and expenses for the casino operators, including CPL, during the year ended December 31, 2018. CPL’s results were significantly impacted for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 by the additional costs and expenses associated with the closure of several of its casinos during 2018. The next license expiration for a CPL casino occurs in September 2022.
Results in US dollars were impacted by (1.6%) and (6.3%) exchange rate decreases in the average rates between the US dollar and the Polish zloty for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 and the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, respectively.
The casinos in Poland closed due to COVID-19 on March 13, 2020 and reopened on May 18, 2020. The Poland casinos closed again in December 2020 and reopened in February 2021. The results below are presented to illustrate the estimated impact of COVID-19 on net operating revenue in the Poland segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 and the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, respectively.
The results below are presented to illustrate the estimated impact of COVID-19 on operating expenses in the Poland segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 and the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, respectively, excluding depreciation and amortization expense and impairment - intangible and tangible assets.
The net operating revenue decreases during 2020 relate primarily to temporary casino closures and reduced tourism in Warsaw.
The net operating revenue increases for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 were impacted by the following changes resulting from delays in issuing licenses.
The casino at the Dwor Kosciuszko Hotel in Krakow operated four additional months during 2019.
The casino at the Manufaktura Entertainment Complex in Lodz operated six additional months during 2019.
The casino at the HP Park Plaza Hotel in Wroclaw operated three additional months during 2019.
The casino at the Park Inn by Radisson in Katowice operated four additional months during 2019.
The casino at the LIM Center in Warsaw reopened in August 2019. The casino did not operate in 2018.
The casinos at the Hotel Andersia in Poznan and the Hotel Plock in Plock were closed in April 2018 and February 2018, respectively.
All other casinos were operational for the full year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.
We expanded the gaming floor at the Marriott Hotel and added an additional six table games in May 2019.
During the closures of our Poland casinos, we reduced operating costs and expenses as much as possible. Operating costs and expenses in the Poland segment continued to be lower during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 because of lower payroll and marketing expenditures as well as lower gaming related expenses corresponding to decreased gaming revenue. COVID-19 continues to impact results, and we continue to focus on analyzing staffing needs to match customer volumes to continue to manage our costs.
Operating expenses increases for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 were impacted by increased expenses related to additional months of operations in 2019 compared to 2018 as detailed above. Additional expense related to the disposal of assets at the Poznan and Plock casinos for the year ended December 31, 2018.
We currently operate three casinos in Warsaw. There is proposed legislation to split the Warsaw voivodship (or province), which could limit the number of casino licenses available in Warsaw in the future. If the legislation is passed, it is expected that as licenses in Warsaw expire a new tender would not be offered until the maximum number of licenses available is reached. Any change to the number of licenses available in a city could have a negative impact on results if we are unable to obtain new casino licenses.
We were in preliminary discussions with Totalizator Sportowy, Poland’s state-run gambling operator, regarding a potential sale of our interests in Casinos Poland; however, the discussions have been suspended and may not resume.
A reconciliation of net earnings (loss) attributable to Century Casinos, Inc. shareholders to Adjusted EBITDA can be found in the “Non-GAAP Measures - Adjusted EBITDA” discussion in Item 6, “Selected Financial Data” of this report.
The following operations and agreements make up the reporting unit Cruise Ships & Other in the Corporate and Other reportable segment:
The casino at CCB opened in May 2018. CCB was permanently closed in March 2020 due to COVID-19 and CCB’s board of directors determined that CCB would enter into creditors voluntary liquidation, which occurred in May 2020. CCB was deconsolidated as a subsidiary in May 2020. We recorded a $23.7 million gain related to the deconsolidation to general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020. Due to historical and forecast losses at CCB from changes in the current regulatory environment for casinos in England requiring enhanced due diligence of customers, we determined that the long-lived assets, ROU operating lease asset and intangible asset at CCB were impaired and wrote-off $16.5 million to impairment - intangible and tangible assets in December 2019. For additional information related to CCB, see Note 1, “Description of Business and Basis of Presentation,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report.
As of December 31, 2020, we had a concession agreement with TUI Cruises for four ship-based casinos, none of which was operating. The agreement ends in June 2022.
We have decreased our operation of ship-based casinos on cruise ships over the past few years, and mutually agreed with cruise lines with which we had concession agreements not to extend certain agreements at their termination dates. The following is a summary of concession agreements that ended between 2018 and 2020.
‎
Through our subsidiary CRM, we have a 7.5% ownership interest in MCE. In addition, CRM provides advice to MCE on casino matters pursuant to a consulting agreement for a service fee consisting of a fixed fee plus a percentage of MCE’s EBITDA. In March 2020, due to the impact of COVID-19 on MCE, we impaired the $1.0 million MCE investment and wrote-down a $0.3 million receivable related to MCE. For additional information related to MCE, see Note 4, “Investments,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report.
Through our subsidiary CRM, we had a 51% ownership interest in GHL. We sold our interest in GHL to the unaffiliated shareholders of GHL in May 2019 for a $0.7 million non-interest bearing promissory note. We recognized a loss on the sale of this investment of less than ($0.1) million in general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statement of (loss) earnings for the year ended December 31, 2019. The sale of our equity interest in GHL also ended our equity interest in MCL. For additional information related to GHL and MCL, see Note 4, “Investments,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report.
Results at CCB were impacted by a 0.5% exchange rate increase and (4.5%) exchange rate decrease for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 and the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, respectively.
Revenue Highlights
Years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Non-Corporate Reporting Units
Net operating revenue decreased due to the closure of CCB as detailed above. In addition, our four ship-based casinos were not operating for the majority of the year due to COVID-19 related shutdowns of the cruise ships on which they operate.
Years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018
Non-Corporate Reporting Units
Net operating revenue decreased by ($0.2) million, or (3.4%), due to decreased revenue from Cruise Ships & Other resulting from the expiration of certain of our concession agreements for the operation of ship-based casinos as detailed above. This decrease was offset by increased net operating revenue at CCB, which operated for a full year in 2019 compared to eight months in 2018.
Net operating revenue for CCB increased by GBP 0.5 million, or 22.5%, due to increased gaming and food and beverage revenue from operating for a full year in 2019 compared to eight months in 2018. Revenue growth was impacted by enforcement of anti-money laundering and social responsibility regulations that required us to limit customers’ play until the required information is provided by the player. In addition, we believe that concerns about the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (commonly referred to as “Brexit”) reduced discretionary consumer spending in the market. In US dollars, net operating revenue increased by $0.5 million, or 20.4%.
Operating Expense Highlights
Years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Non-Corporate Reporting Units
Total operating costs and expenses decreased due to casino closures at CCB and on the ships. In addition, the deconsolidation of CCB resulted in a gain of $7.4 million that we recognized in general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of (loss) earnings for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Corporate Reporting Units
Total operating costs and expenses decreased by ($5.8) million, or (35.5%). In March 2020, we impaired the MCE investment due to an assessment of MCE’s operations resulting from COVID-19. As a result of the impairment, we recorded $1.0 million to impairment - intangible and tangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, we assessed the collectability of a receivable from LOT Polish Airlines (“LOT”), which previously owned a 33.3% interest in CPL that we acquired in 2013, related to the Poland contingent liability and determined that, due to COVID-19, it was more likely than not that LOT would be unable to repay us for LOT’s portions of payments made by CPL to the Polish IRS for tax periods in January 2009 to March 2013. Due to COVID-19, LOT grounded flights in March 2020. Based on past efforts to collect on the receivable and analysis of LOT’s ability to pay, we wrote-down the $0.7 million receivable to general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020. Offsetting these increases, during the closures certain of our corporate staff voluntarily decreased their salaries. In addition, in 2019 there were additional expenses related to the Acquisition that did not reoccur in 2020, as discussed below.
Years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018
Non-Corporate Reporting Units
Total operating costs and expenses increased by $17.4 million, or 214.2%. In December 2019, we impaired certain assets at CCB due to historical and forecast operating losses at this casino resulting from the factors discussed above. As a result of the impairment, we wrote down $16.5 million to impairment - intangible and tangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, we evaluated our agreement with Diamond Cruises related to the operation of the ship-based casino onboard the Glory Sea. We determined that it was more likely than not that the agreement was impaired and wrote-down $0.9 million in receivables related to the Glory Sea along with increased expense of $0.3 million related to the loss on disposal of fixed assets related to the Glory Sea and disposal of assets from storage. These increased expenses were partially offset by decreased operating expenses related to the expiration of certain of our concession agreements for the operation of ship-based casinos as detailed above.
Corporate Reporting Units
Our corporate reporting units include certain other corporate and management operations. Total operating costs and expenses increased by $7.9 million, or 87.9%, due to one-time costs related to the Acquisition including $5.4 million in acquisition costs and a $0.6 million in bonuses. In addition, payroll costs and travel-related expenses increased.
A reconciliation of net loss attributable to Century Casinos, Inc. shareholders to Adjusted EBITDA can be found in the “Non-GAAP Measures - Adjusted EBITDA” discussion in Item 6, “Selected Financial Data” of this report.
Non-Operating Income (Expense)
Non-operating income (expense) for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was as follows:
Interest income
Interest income is directly related to interest earned on our cash reserves.
Interest expense
Interest expense is directly related to interest owed on our borrowings under our Macquarie Credit Agreement, our financing obligation with VICI PropCo, our credit agreement with the Bank of Montreal that was replaced by the Macquarie Credit Agreement, the fair value adjustments for our interest rate swap agreements, our CPL and CRM borrowings, our capital lease agreements and interest expense related to the CDR land lease.
Gain on foreign currency transactions, cost recovery income and other
Cost recovery income of $0.2 million and $0.4 million was received by CDR for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to infrastructure built during the development of the Century Downs REC project. The distribution to CDR’s non-controlling shareholders through non-controlling interest is part of a credit agreement between CRM and CDR. There was no cost recovery income received by CDR for the year ended December 31, 2018.
We adjusted the contingent liability related to the CPL taxes to remove the estimated taxes accrued for the 2015 and 2014 tax years due to the expiration of the statute of limitations for each tax year. This adjustment reduced the contingent liability by PLN 2.8 ($0.7 million) and PLN 2.2 million ($0.6 million) in for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Taxes
Income tax expense is recorded relative to the jurisdictions that recognize book earnings. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized income tax expense of $4.8 million on pre-tax loss of ($43.3) million, representing an effective income tax rate of 11.2%, compared to income tax expense of $4.2 million on pre-tax loss of ($12.0) million, representing an effective income tax rate of 34.9% and income tax expense of $1.9 million on pre-tax income of $5.9 million, representing an effective income tax rate of 32.4% for the same periods in 2019 and 2018, respectively. For further discussion on our effective income tax rates and an analysis of our effective income tax rate compared to the US federal statutory income tax rate, see Note 14, “Income Taxes,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our business is capital intensive, and we rely heavily on the ability of our casinos to generate operating cash flow. We use the cash flows that we generate to maintain operations, fund reinvestment in existing properties for both refurbishment and expansion projects, repay third party debt, and pursue additional growth via new development and acquisition opportunities. When necessary and available, we supplement the cash flows generated by our operations with either cash on hand or funds provided by bank borrowings or other debt or equity financing activities. In 2020, our liquidity has been adversely affected by temporary closures of all of our casinos, hotels and other facilities to comply with quarantines issued by governments to contain the spread of COVID-19, as discussed below.
As of December 31, 2020, our total debt under bank borrowings and other agreements net of $9.3 million related to deferred financing costs was $184.6 million, of which $173.7 million was long-term debt and $10.8 million was the current portion of long-term debt. The current portion relates to payments due within one year under our Macquarie Credit Agreement, CPL credit agreements, UniCredit loan and credit agreement and the CRM credit facility. For a description of our debt agreements, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report. Net Debt was $130.4 million as of December 31, 2020 compared to $134.2 million as of December 31, 2019. For the definition and reconciliation of Net Debt to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, see “Non-GAAP Measures - Net Debt” in Item 6, “Selected Financial Data” of this report. We intend to repay the current portion of our debt obligations with available cash.
The following table lists the 2021 maturities of our debt:
There is no set repayment schedule for the CPL credit facility, and we classify it as short-term debt due to the nature of the agreements. We plan to convert the UniCredit credit agreement to a term loan in 2021.
The following table lists the amount of 2021 payments due under our lease agreements:
In addition to these payment obligations, our scheduled payments for 2021 under the Master Lease are $23.1 million and under the CDR land lease financing obligation are $1.6 million, excluding variable rent payments. Cash payments related to the Master Lease and CDR land lease were $25.0 million and $1.3 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Cash Flows
Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled $63.7 million and working capital (current assets minus current liabilities) was $34.5 million at December 31, 2020 compared to cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $55.6 million and working capital of $22.8 million at December 31, 2019, and cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $46.3 million and working capital of $5.0 million at December 31, 2018. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 is due to $9.0 million of cash provided by operating activities; $4.2 million in proceeds from borrowings net of repayments; $6.6 million in proceeds from the sale of the casino operations of Century Casino Calgary, net of cash assumed by the buyer; and $1.2 million in exchange rate changes; offset by $1.2 million of cash used for payment related to the working capital adjustment in the Acquisition; $10.7 million of cash used to purchase property and equipment; $0.9 million in deferred financing costs; and $0.2 million of distributions to non-controlling interests.
‎
Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities was $9.0 million, $18.8 million and $22.3 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our cash flows from operations have historically been positive and sufficient to fund ordinary operations. Trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in earnings from operations, excluding non-cash charges. Please refer also to the consolidated statements of cash flows in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report and to management’s discussion of the results of operations above in this Item 7 for a discussion of (loss) earnings from operations.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities of $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted of a $1.2 million payment related to the working capital adjustment in the Acquisition; $0.6 million for slot machine purchases at our Colorado properties; $0.1 million for slot chairs at CTL; $1.0 million for slot machine purchases, $0.2 million in rebranding signage, $1.8 million for player tracking systems and upgrades to the slot accounting systems, and $0.6 million in computer upgrades at our Missouri properties; $0.2 million for surveillance upgrades, $1.1 million for slot machine purchases, $0.2 million for racetrack reconditioning, and $0.3 million in computer upgrades at our West Virginia property; $0.5 million for table game equipment, $0.9 million in building updates, and $0.2 million in racetrack and barn updates at our Edmonton properties; $0.2 million for table game equipment at our Calgary properties; $0.3 million in casino improvements in Poland; and $2.5 million in other fixed asset additions at our properties; offset by $6.6 million from the sale of Century Casino Calgary, net of cash assumed by the buyer.
Net cash used in investing activities of $120.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted of $96.6 million related to the Acquisition, net of cash acquired; $15.0 million for construction costs related to the Century Mile project; $4.3 million related to leasehold improvements at the Marriott Hotel in Warsaw, Poland and additional assets for the casinos in Poland; $0.8 million in Colorado for slot machines, chairs and security upgrades; $1.2 million in Calgary for the building expansion at CDR and a bar at CAL; $0.3 million in Edmonton for new carpet and surveillance equipment at CRA; $2.3 million in other fixed asset additions at our properties; and $0.2 million used to acquire the non-controlling interest in CBS.
Net cash used in investing activities of $57.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 consisted of $40.0 million for construction costs related to the Century Mile project; $7.8 million for the Century Casino Bath project; $5.1 million in leasehold improvements at the new casinos in Poland and additional assets for the casinos in Poland; $0.9 million in Calgary for racetrack improvements and a barn at CDR and surveillance upgrades at CAL; $0.8 million in Colorado for slot machines and carpet replacement; $2.4 million in other fixed asset additions at our properties; $0.3 million for CRM’s purchase of its ownership interest in GHL, net of cash acquired; and $0.6 million for GHL’s purchase of its ownership interest in MCL, offset by less than $0.1 million in proceeds from the disposition of assets.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities of $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted of $4.2 million in proceeds from borrowings net of principal payments, offset by $0.9 million in deferred financing costs and a $0.2 million distribution to non-controlling interests in CDR.
Net cash provided by financing activities of $113.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted of $124.7 million received from borrowings net of principal repayments and $0.3 million from the exercise of stock options, offset by $10.1 million of deferred financing costs paid and $1.0 million in distributions to non-controlling interests in CBS and CPL.
Net cash provided by financing activities of $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 consisted of $8.2 million received from borrowings net of principal repayments and $0.3 million from the exercise of stock options, offset by $0.3 million of principal repayments for capital leases, $0.4 million of deferred financing costs paid and $0.6 million in distributions to non-controlling interests in CBS and CPL.
Tax Act
During 2018, the Company completed its accounting of the one-time transition tax on undistributed and previously untaxed post-1986 foreign earnings and profits imposed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act permits a company to pay the one-time transition tax over eight years on an interest free basis. The Company paid $0.6 million of the transition tax in 2018. The remaining cash payments due related to the transition tax total $0.9 million as set forth in the Contractual Obligations and Contingencies table below.
Common Stock Repurchase Program
The total amount remaining under our stock repurchase program was $14.7 million as of December 31, 2020. We did not repurchase any common stock in 2020, 2019 or 2018. The repurchase program has no set expiration or termination date.
Potential Sources and Uses of Liquidity, Short-Term Liquidity
Historically, our primary source of liquidity and capital resources has been cash flow from operations. When necessary and available, we supplement the cash flows generated by our operations with funds provided by bank borrowings or other debt or equity financing activities. In addition, we have generated cash from sales of existing casino operations and proceeds from the issuance of equity securities upon the exercise of stock options.
The COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity for 2020, and we expect the situation will continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity into 2021. The duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic remains uncertain. Between March 13, 2020 and March 17, 2020, we closed all of our casinos, hotels and other facilities to comply with quarantines issued by governments to contain the spread of COVID-19. Our Polish locations reopened on May 18, 2020, and our North American operations reopened between June 1, 2020 and June 17, 2020. Additional closures of our Canada and Poland casinos were required in December 2020 to comply with quarantines issued by governments. Our Poland casinos reopened in February 2021, but our Canada casinos remain closed. Our casinos have varied their operations based on the governmental health and safety requirements in the jurisdictions in which they are located. These include capacity and gaming floor restrictions and limited hours of operations. We estimate that the net cash outflows related to operations during the time they were fully suspended in the first two quarters of 2020 were, on average, approximately $8.0 million per month.
We continue to monitor our liquidity in light of the uncertainty resulting from COVID-19. We plan to continue to reduce marketing and operating expenditures where possible. Planned capital expenditures in 2021 include approximately $8.0 million in gaming equipment, renovations to various properties and security system upgrades. Our 2021 planned capital expenditure projects will be evaluated throughout the year and postponed to 2022 if necessary and permitted under our agreements.
In March 2020, as a proactive measure to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of the uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we borrowed $9.95 million on our revolving credit facility with Macquarie and $7.4 million on our credit agreement with UniCredit. We repaid the Macquarie revolving credit facility in July 2020 except for a $50,000 letter of credit that we cash collateralized. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report for further discussion of the Macquarie credit agreement and the UniCredit credit agreement, including discussion of a recent amendment to the Macquarie credit agreement that, among other things, waives compliance with a financial covenant under the Macquarie credit agreement.
We cannot predict the negative impacts that the failure to suppress the spread of COVID-19 will have on our consumer demand, workforce, suppliers, contractors and other partners and whether future closures will be required. Such closures have had and will continue to have a material impact on our business. While the severity and duration of such business impacts cannot currently be estimated, the effects of COVID-19 and the requirements of health and safety protocols are expected to continue to have a material impact on our business.
We may be required to raise additional capital to address our liquidity and capital needs. We have a shelf registration statement with the SEC that became effective in July 2020 under which we may issue, from time to time, up to $100 million of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and other securities.
If necessary, we may seek to obtain further term loans, mortgages or lines of credit with commercial banks or other debt or equity financings to supplement our working capital and investing requirements. Our access to and cost of financing will depend on, among other things, global economic conditions, conditions in the financing markets, the availability of sufficient amounts of financing, our prospects and our credit ratings. A financing transaction may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and a financing transaction may be dilutive to our current stockholders. The failure to raise the funds necessary to fund our debt service and rent obligations and finance our operations and other capital requirements could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and liquidity.
In addition, we expect our US domestic cash resources will be sufficient to fund our US operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities. While we currently do not have an intent nor foresee a need to repatriate funds, we could require more capital in the US than is generated by our US operations for operations, capital expenditures or significant discretionary activities such as acquisitions of businesses and share repurchases. If so, we could elect to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions in the form of a cash dividend, which would generally be exempt from taxation with the exception of the adverse impact of withholding taxes. We also could elect to raise capital in the US through debt or equity issuances. We estimate that approximately $27.5 million of our total $63.4 million in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020 is held by our foreign subsidiaries and is not available to fund US operations unless repatriated.
Contractual Obligations and Contingencies
The following table summarizes our future commitments and contingency payments as of December 31, 2020.
(1)Represents principal payments only. These amounts do not reflect the impact of future foreign exchange rate changes. The CDR land lease is excluded from long-term debt because we are not obligated to purchase the land. The CDR land lease is accounted for using the financing method, and no principal payments will be made unless the land is purchased. The first option to purchase the land at fair market value is July 1, 2023. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report for further information.
(2)Represents minimum payments and estimates based on contingent rental payments due under the Master Lease. Variable payments and index rate adjustments over the minimum amount stated in the Master Lease are not included. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report for further information.
(3)Estimated contingencies related to the CPL contingent liability are not included in the table above because we are not able to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report for further information.
(4)Estimated interest payments are based on principal amounts and expected maturities of long-term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and management’s forecasted rates for our Macquarie Credit Agreement, CDR land lease, CPL credit agreements, UniCredit Loan and CRM credit facility. Estimated interest payments do not reflect the impact of future foreign exchange rate changes. Fixed payments related to the CDR land lease are presented as if we do not elect the purchase options. The table above excludes the variable payments related to the CDR land lease.
(5)Amounts reflect remaining cash payments due for the transition tax. The next payment is due April 15, 2023. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report for additional discussion of the effects of the Tax Act.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The unrecorded contractual obligations above are not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. We do not have any additional off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our consolidated financial statements.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Management's discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements. To prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report. Critical estimates inherent in these accounting policies are discussed in the following paragraphs.
Property and Equipment - We have significant capital invested in our property and equipment, which represented approximately 76% of our total assets as of December 31, 2020. Judgments are made in determining the estimated useful lives of assets, salvage values to be assigned to assets and if or when an asset has been impaired. The accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized in our financial results and the extent to which we have a gain or loss on the disposal of the asset. We assign lives to our assets based on our standard policy, which we believe is representative of the useful life of each category of assets. We review the carrying value of our property and equipment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. The factors we consider in performing this assessment include current operating results, trends and prospects, as well as the effect of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors. As of December 31, 2020, we believe that our investments in property and equipment are recoverable. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we wrote down the long-lived assets at CCB due to historical and forecast losses at the casino and charged $8.0 million to impairment - intangible and tangible assets on our consolidated statement of (loss) earnings.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets - We test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment as of October 1 each year, or more frequently as circumstances indicate it is necessary. Our identifiable intangible assets include trademarks, player’s club lists and casino licenses. Testing compares the estimated fair values of our reporting units to the reporting units’ carrying values. Assessing goodwill and intangible assets for impairment requires significant judgment and involves detailed qualitative and quantitative business-specific analysis and many individual assumptions that may fluctuate between assessments. Our properties’ estimated future cash flows are a primary assumption in the respective impairment analyses. Cash flow estimates include assumptions regarding factors such as recent and budgeted operating performance, growth percentages as well as competitive impacts from current and anticipated competition, operating margins and current regulatory, social and economic climates. The most significant of the assumptions used in our valuations include revenue growth/decline percentages, discount rates, future terminal values and capital expenditure assumptions. These assumptions are developed for each property based on historical trends, the current markets in which they operate and projections of future performance and competition.
We believe we have used reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets; however, these estimates and assumptions could be materially different from actual results. Unforeseen events, changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in estimates of future cash flows could negatively affect the fair value of our assets. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected, or if events occur or circumstances change that could reduce the fair value of our goodwill of intangible assets below the carrying value, we will recognize an impairment for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, which may be material.
Our reporting units with goodwill balances as of December 31, 2020 are included within Canada and Poland reportable segments. For the quantitative goodwill impairment test, the current fair value of each reporting unit with goodwill balances is estimated using a combination of (i) the income approach using the discounted cash flow method for projected revenue, EBITDA and working capital, (ii) the market approach observing the price at which comparable companies or shares of comparable companies are bought or sold, and (iii) fair value measurements using either quoted market price or an estimate of fair value using a present value technique. The cost approach, estimating the cost of reproduction or replacement of an asset, was considered but not used because it does not adequately capture an operating company’s intangible value. We make a variety of estimates and judgments about the relevance of these factors to the reporting units in estimating their fair values. During 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated closures of our casinos, we determined that goodwill was impaired related to certain reporting units. For information about the 2020 impairments, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report. As of December 31, 2020, the estimated fair value of our CRA reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 19%. Goodwill related to our CRA reporting unit was $3.9 million as of December 31, 2020. Key assumptions in the valuation of the CRA reporting unit relate to future earnings at CRA. A downturn in the Alberta economy could negatively affect the key assumptions management used in its analysis.
Our Century Casinos and Casinos Poland trademarks and our casino licenses, with the exception of CPL, are indefinite-lived intangible assets and therefore are not amortized. The fair values are determined primarily using the multi-period excess earnings methodology (“MPEEM”) and the relief from royalty method under the income approach. For information about impairments in 2020 and 2019, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report. As of December 31, 2020, the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets at our CSA reporting unit was 2% in excess of its related carrying value. Intangible assets related to our CSA reporting unit were $9.6 million as of December 31, 2020. Key assumptions in the valuation of intangible assets at the CSA reporting unit relate to future earnings at CSA. A downturn in the Alberta economy could negatively affect the key assumptions management used in its analysis.
Our casino licenses related to CPL, our Mountaineer trademark and our player’s club lists are finite-lived intangible assets and are amortized over their respective useful lives. Finite-lived intangibles are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if necessary. There were no impairment charges recorded for the finite-lived intangible assets for the periods presented in this report.
Income Taxes - The determination of our provision for income taxes requires management’s judgment in the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish contingency reserves for material, known tax exposures relating to deductions, transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item. Our reserves reflect our judgment as to the resolution of the issues involved if subject to judicial review. Several years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and finally resolved or clarified. While we believe that our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, issues raised by a tax authority may be finally resolved at an amount different from the related reserve. Such differences could materially increase or decrease our income tax provision in the current and/or future periods. When facts and circumstances change (including a resolution of an issue or statute of limitations expiration), these reserves are adjusted through the provision for income taxes in the period of change. To the extent we determine that we will not realize the benefit of some or all of the deferred tax assets, then these assets will be adjusted through our provision for income taxes in the period in which this determination is made. The Tax Act created a new requirement that certain income, such as global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”), earned by a controlled foreign corporation (“CFC”) must be included currently in the gross income of the CFC’s US shareholder, effective in 2018. We have elected to account for GILTI in the year the tax is incurred as a current period expense and recorded net tax expense of $0.5 million and less than $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We did not record a net tax expense related to GILTI for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Our undistributed foreign earnings were subject to the one-time transition tax for the year ended December 31, 2017. We continue to consider our foreign earnings indefinitely reinvested. Based on our capital, debt and liquidity position, there is no expected need for cash repatriation from foreign subsidiaries, and all cash held in foreign jurisdictions is considered permanently reinvested. These foreign earnings could become subject to additional taxes, such as withholding taxes and local country taxes, if they are repatriated to the United States.

Business Combinations - In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805, “Business Combinations” (“ASC 805”), the Acquisition was recorded using the acquisition method of accounting. We include the operating results of the Acquired Casinos from the date of acquisition. We recognize and measure the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest acquired at fair value at the acquisition date. The valuation of intangible assets requires management judgment, the utilization of independent valuation experts and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, market prices and asset lives, among other things. If the subsequent projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these fair values, we could record impairment charges. The valuation of intangible assets was determined using an income approach methodology. Our key assumptions used in valuing the intangible assets included projected future revenues, customer attrition rates and market recognition. The excess of total consideration transferred over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recognized as goodwill. Costs incurred as the result of the Acquisition other than costs related to the issuance of debt were recorded in the period the costs were incurred.
