Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Financial Statements
In December 2019, a novel strain of COVID-19 was reported in China. Since then, COVID-19 has spread globally, to include Canada, the United States and several European countries. The spread of COVID-19 from China to other countries has resulted in the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring the outbreak of COVID-19 as a “pandemic,” or a worldwide spread of a new disease, on March 11, 2020. Many countries around the world have imposed quarantines and restrictions on travel and mass gatherings to slow the spread of the virus and have closed non-essential businesses.
As local jurisdictions continue to put restrictions in place, our ability to continue to operate our business may also be limited. Such events may result in a period of business, supply and product manufacturing disruption, and in reduced operations, any of which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In response to COVID-19, the Company implemented remote working and thus far, has not experienced a significant disruption or delay in our operations
To date, COVID-19 has not had a material financial impact on the Company. However, COVID-19 has caused severe disruptions in transportation and limited access to the Company’s facility, resulting in limited support from its staff and professional advisors. The small size of the Company’s accounting staff and the additional responsibilities emanating from COVID-19 may cause a delay in the Company’s ability to complete subsequent reports in a timely manner.
RECENT ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards. The amendments in this update simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. The amendments also improve consistent application of and simplify GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. The amendments within ASU No. 2019-12 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this update on its consolidated financial statements.
Results of Operations - 2020 Compared to 2019
The following sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain components of our operating earnings, including such data stated as percentage of revenues:
* Includes $75,669 and $249,116 of non-cash stock compensation expense for 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to employee, director and consultant stock options.
Revenue generated during 2020 was $879,169 compared to $486,046 of revenue generated during the same period in 2019, an increase of $393,123 or 81%. The increase was driven primarily by a $537,042, or 796%, increase in sales of AMIRON iron oxide, partially offset by a $142,233, or 34%, decrease in sales of DRAGONITE halloysite clay.
Sales of DRAGONITE during 2020 totaled $274,323, a decrease of $142,233, or approximately 34% when compared to 2019. The decline was driven primarily by the absence of a sale of $288,000 to a large manufacture of molecular sieves that occurred during 2019, partially offset by $53,000 of sales to a manufacturer of high-performance polymer-based proppants, $47,000 of sales to a manufacturer of acrylic adhesives and $40,000 of sales of DRAGONITE-loaded polymer masterbatch to a large manufacturer of lawn and garden equipment.
Sales of AMIRON during 2020 totaled $604,501, an increase of $537,042, or approximately 796%, when compared to 2019. The increase was driven by a (i) $473,146, or 711%, increase in sales to a cement manufacturer and (ii) $64,800 sale to a manufacturer of hydrogen sulfide scavengers that did not occur in 2019.
Revenue for 2019 included $5,000 of tolling milling, which was not realized during 2020.
Operating expenses incurred during 2020 totalled $3,712,815, a decrease of $816,668, or 18%, when compared to 2019. The decline in operating expenses was driven primarily by a $1,132,462, or 33%, decline in general and administrative expense partially offset by a $310,911, or 33%, increase in production costs when compared to 2019.
Production costs include those operating expenses which management believes are directly related to the mining and processing of the Company’s iron oxide and halloysite minerals, which result in the production of its AMIRON and DRAGONITE products for commercial sale. Production costs include, but are not limited to, wages and benefits of employees who mine material and who work in the Company’s milling operations, energy costs associated with the operation of the Company’s two mills, the cost of mining and milling supplies and the cost of the maintenance and repair of the Company’s mining and milling equipment. Wages and energy expenses are the two largest components of the Company’s production costs.
Production costs during 2020 were $1,245,776, an increase of $310,911, or 33%, when compared to 2019. The increase was driven primarily by the incurrance of $212,998 of contract labor costs, a $55,761, or 1,009%, increase in explosive purchases and a $216,812, or 131%, increase in employee wages. These increases were driven by a significant increase in the Company’s rate of iron production during 2020.
Exploration costs include operating expenses incurred at the Dragon Mine that are not directly related to production activities. Exploration costs, excluding depreciation expense, incurred during 2020 totalled $201,234 compared to $196,351 incurred during 2019, an increase of $4,883.
The Company’s general and administrative expenses are associated with corporate overhead. General and administrative expenses for 2020 totalled $2,265,805 compared to $3,398,267 of expense incurred during the same period in 2019, a decline of $1,132,460 or 33%. The decline was driven primarily by a (i) $649,997, or 43%, reduction in management salary and benefit expense related to the elimination and consolidation of a number of management positions, (ii) $173,447, or 70%, decline in equity-based compensation expense, (iii) $91,689, or 14%, decrease in director expense due to the resignation of three directors during 2020, (iv) $70,321 decline in travel expense, (v) a $44,887 reduction in D&O insurance premiums and (vi) $44,627 decrease in rent expense due to the moving of the Company’s corporate offices to its Eureka, UT location.
Operating loss incurred during the year was $2,833,646, a decline of $1,209,791, or 30%, when compared to 2019. The decline in operating loss was driven primarily by the $1,132,460 decline in general and administrative expense and $393,123 increase in revenue, partially offset by a $310,911 increase in production costs.
Total other expense for 2020 was $454,065 compared to $1,929,695 during the same period in 2019, a reduction of $1,475,630 or 76%. The decrease in total other expense was driven primarily by (i) the receipt of $1,250,000 upon the exercise by CMC of an option to purchase the metallic mineral rights of the Dragon Mine and (ii) a $373,606 decrease in interest expense on the Company’s outstanding PIK Notes.
Net loss for 2020 was $3,287,711, a decline of 2,685,421, or 45%, when compared to a net loss of $5,973,132 for 2019. The decrease in net loss was driven primarily by the $1,209,791, or 30%, decrease in operating loss and a $1,475,630, or 76%, decrease in total other expense compared to 2019.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Company has a history of recurring losses from operations and the use of cash in operating activities. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company’s net loss was $3,287,711 and cash provided by operating activities was $845,123. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had current assets of $927,815 and current liabilities of $3,464,669 of which $365,121 was accrued PIK Note interest to be paid in additional PIK Notes. The Company’s current liabilities also include (i) $524,015 of accrued salaries and related taxes deferred by current and past members of management until the Company’s liquidity improves, (ii) $1,281,811 of accrued directors fee and other director compensation as determined by the Company’s Board, (iii) $119,269 of payables to a compounder for which it has agreed to satisfy in halloysite product, (iv) $132,635 of disputed or erroneously accrued expenses and (v) $223,075 of PPP Funding payable which the Company expects to be forgiven by the U.S. Treasury.
Cash provided by operating activities in 2020 was $845,123 compared to $2,380,328 of cash used during the same period in 2019. Cash used in operating activities during 2020, after adjusting for non-cash items but before adjusting for changes in operating assets and liabilities, was $1,285,871 compared to $3,595,185 of cash provided during the comparable period in 2019. The primary reason for the decrease in cash used was the $1,209,791 decrease in operating loss and the $1,102,024 increase in other income that occurred in 2020 when compared to 2019.
The Company has no cash activities in investing activities during 2020 and 2019.
Cash used in financing activities during 2020 was $228,356 compared to $459,220 in 2019.
Our total assets as of December 31, 2020 were $1,900,307 compared to $1,489,180 as of December 31, 2019, or an increase of $411,127. The increase in total assets was due primarily to a $616,767 increase in cash.
Management believes that in order for the Company to meet its obligations arising from normal business operations through March 31, 2022 that the Company may be required (i) to raise additional capital either in the form of a private placement of common stock or debt and/or (ii) generate additional sales of its products that will generate sufficient operating profit and cash flows to fund operations. Without additional capital or additional sales of its products, the Company’s ability to continue to operate may be limited.
Based on the Company’s current cash usage expectations, management believes it may not have sufficient liquidity to fund its operations through April 15, 2022. Further, management cannot provide any assurance that it is probable that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans to raise debt or equity financing or generate additional product sales. Collectively these factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company not be able to continue as a going concern.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
There are no off-balance sheet arrangements between the Company and any other entity that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to investors.
