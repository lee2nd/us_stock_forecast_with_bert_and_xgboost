ITEM 7. - MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. See “Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.
The following discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations is based on the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. You should read this discussion and analysis together with such financial statements and the related notes thereto.
General Overview
We are engaged in the business of manufacturing and distributing LED digital gauges, automotive electronics, and accessories for commercial and industrial customers, as well as LED lighting tubes and bulbs.
Principal Products
US Lighting Group designs, manufactures, and distributes 4’ LED tube lights that are superior in power usage, lifespan, warranty, and cost savings, because of the exclusive minimalistic design and proprietary manufacturing processes. Channels to market include The Home Depot drop ship program, and earlier in the company history, a chain of reginal distributors. US Lighting Group, Inc. has research and development, testing, and production facilities based in Euclid, Ohio, USA where all products are engineered and manufactured from domestic and imported components.
The US Lighting Group currently produces a series of bulbs, each with their own unique specifications and applications:
● BH4 Series is our flagship LED light bulb line and has remained our top seller throughout the years. The BH4 bulb is a powerful, highly efficient top-level bulb offering the greatest savings potential and longest life span at 21 years. This light has been engineered to emit zero RF.
● GFY Series designed for those looking for something a little less powerful and lower cost. This series combines the demand for lower-watt bulbs with the need for highly efficient, sustainable lighting options to create two highly affordable LED bulb options. This tube is more cost-effective on the upfront purchase, while still offering a 15-year warranty and significant savings on energy costs.
● FEB Series is our plug-and-play LED lighting option with power at each end that works with both electronic and magnetic ballasts.
Distribution and Current Market
LED lighting is a commodity product, which has become very competitive due to overseas imports with low pricing, making it a difficult climate for US Lighting Group, Inc. to operate in. We are looking into other LED lighting product lines that would leverage our electronics innovativeness to provide more specialty-type LED lighting. US Lighting Group has a supplier contractual relationship with The Home Depot. Customers can order product online at HomeDepot.com and it ships to the customer directly from our warehouse, however the sales have been minimal in the last two years.
US Lighting Group is looking at other industries such as robotics and fiberglass, but they are still in the early development stage.
Intellitronix Corporation
In recent years, the Company’s primary activity has been centered around Intellitronix. Intellitronix is engaged in automotive electronics manufacturing, serving a niche market of aftermarket electronics for customer installations as well as several emerging OEM applications.
Products
● Automotive - Our portfolio includes direct fit replacement gauge panels for specific vehicle models manufactured by Chevrolet, Ford, Jeep, etc. and universal gauges for numerous other makes and models of classic cars. Other products include vehicle lighting, ignition systems, RPM switches and other automotive electronics. Intellitronix Corporation is a well-established brand that is available to consumers through major aftermarket distributors. The Company offers a Limited Lifetime Factory Warranty on all its branded products.
● Marine - We design and manufacture products for the marine industry including GPS controlled marine speedometer and Prometheus Ignition System to guard against ignition failures.
● OEM - In recent years, we have developed several custom OEM projects from design to production for companies such as Kawasaki Motors and Coachman RV. The Energy Management Multifunctional System (EMMS) was designed and manufactured for recreational vehicles as an OEM project, and our first customer orders were recently received. The 4-in-1 unit that is currently in development incorporates energy management and load shed, a breaker panel, automatic transfer switch, automatic generator starter plus display unit, Bluetooth, WiFi and multiplexing capabilities.
Our capabilities include a broad range of design and manufacturing services, such as various microprocessor-controlled products for the automotive, electronic, marine, and recreational vehicle markets and the Company has been leveraging its competitive advantage as an efficient low-cost manufacturing partner to other OEM providers. We are focusing on growing the OEM and private label segments that provide high-volume and low-overhead manufacturing opportunities.
The vast majority of our products are manufactured at our facility in Euclid, Ohio.
Distribution
We currently have three sales channels, including Intellitronix branded automotive product lines sold through business-to-consumer (B2C) and retail channels, business-to-business (B2B) and private labeled product lines, and original equipment manufacturers (OEM). For OEM customers, we provide design and manufacturing services to meet original equipment manufacturer’s specifications, and these products are incorporated in the new vehicles. The most recent projects have been completed in the growing RV industry, meeting all applicable safety standards. Our customers include O’Reilly Auto Parts, Summit Racing Equipment, JEGS, Kawasaki Motors, Coachman RV, US Auto Parts, CJ Pony Parts, Corvette Central, Mid America Motorworks, Eckler’s, and others. We also sell our products through eBay, Amazon, and other e-commerce platforms.
COVID-19 Considerations
Through the date these financial statements were issued, the COVID-19 pandemic did not have a net material impact on our operating results. In the future, the pandemic may cause reduced demand for our products if, for example, the pandemic results in a recessionary economic environment, which negatively effects the consumers who purchase our products.
Our ability to operate without significant negative operational impact from the COVID-19 pandemic will in part depend on our ability to protect our employees and our supply chain. The Company has endeavored to follow the recommended actions of government and health authorities to protect our employees. Through the date that these financial statements were issued, we maintained the consistency of our operations during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the uncertainty resulting from the pandemic could result in an unforeseen disruption to our workforce and supply chain (for example, an inability of a key supplier or transportation supplier to source and transport materials) that could negatively impact our operations.
Through the date that these financial statements were issued, the COVID-19 pandemic has not negatively impacted the Company’s liquidity position as of such date, and the Company continues to generate cash flows to meet its short-term liquidity needs, and it expects to maintain access to the capital markets. The Company has not observed any material impairments of its assets or a significant change in the fair value of its assets due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019
Our revenue, operating expenses, and net loss from operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, were as follows:
Sales
Sales increased by $1.4 million (52%) to $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in revenue is attributed to the successful completion of several R&D projects that resulted in increased purchasing activity by OEM and private label customers as well as organic growth of the market share of Intellitronix branded products.
Cost of Goods Sold
Cost of goods sold increased by $279,000 (27%) to $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in costs of goods sold was primarily attributable to increased sales. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 67% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 61% for the year ended December 31, 2019, or 6%, an increase of 11%. The improved gross margin is attributed to increased automation implemented during the year ended December 31, 2020, leading to reduced labor costs and improved supply chain management.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses include selling, general and administrative expenses, product development costs, and non-cash stock-based compensation expense, and loss on disposal of property and equipment.
Selling, general and administrative expenses remained steady at $1.9 million for both of the years December 31, 2020 and 2019.

Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $235,000, as compared to $200,000 in the prior year period.
Net Income (Loss)
Net income was $485,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a net loss of $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in net income was due to increased gross profit, decreased operating expenses, decreased non-cash stock based compensation expense, and decreased other expenses, as discussed above.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our working capital deficiency as of December 30, 2020 and 2019 was as follows:
The following summarizes our cash flow activity for the years ended December 30, 2020 and 2019:
At December 31, 2020, we had a working capital deficit of approximately $2.9 million compared to a working capital deficit of $2.2 million at December 31, 2019. The increase in working capital deficit was primarily related to the increase in short-term debt.
Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $531,000, compared to net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $315,000. The improvement in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to our improved net income of $485,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020, and changes in our working capital accounts of $422,000 due primarily to the increase in our accounts receivable balance of $477,000.
Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $1,303,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $101,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019.

These proceeds were offset by the payment of $2,000 on a finance lease, repayment of $494,000 of notes payable, repayment of $11,000 on the line of credit, and repayment of $832,000 of notes payable to a related party. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $299,000, and included $622,000 of proceeds from the private placement of common stock, $113,000 from the issuance of secured convertible promissory notes, and $280,000 in proceeds from loans payable. These proceeds were offset by the payment of $8,000 on a finance lease, repayment of $174,000 of notes payable, and repayment of $534,000 of notes payable to a related party.
Since inception, our principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by financing, including through the private placement of convertible notes and equity securities, loans, and gross profit from the sales of our products. Our principal uses of cash have been primarily for labor and outside services, expansion of our operations, development of new products and improvement of existing products, expansion of marketing efforts to promote our products and brand, and capital expenditures. We anticipate that additional expenditures will be necessary to develop and expand our assets before sufficient and consistent positive operating cash flows will be achieved, including sufficient cash flows to service existing liabilities and related interest. Additional funds may be needed in order to continue production and operations, maintain profitability and to achieve our objectives. As such, our cash resources may not be sufficient to meet our current operating expense and production requirements, and planned business objectives beyond the date of this Form 10-K filing without additional financing.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to impairment of long-lived assets, including finite lived intangible assets, accrued liabilities, fair value of warrant derivatives and certain expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the following critical accounting policies are subject to estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
Revenue recognition
We recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09. This standard provides authoritative guidance clarifying the principles for recognizing revenue and developing a common revenue standard for U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in the exchange for those goods or services.
Under this guidance, revenue is recognized when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the Company’s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company reviews its sales transactions to identify contractual rights, performance obligations, and transaction prices, including the allocation of prices to separate performance obligations, if applicable. Revenue and costs of sales are recognized once products are delivered to the customer’s control and performance obligations are satisfied.
Products sold by the Company are distinct individual products. The products are offered for sale as finished goods only, and there are no performance obligations required post-shipment for customers to derive the expected value from them. Most of the Company’s sales are received through several eBay web-commerce websites, which requires customer payment at time of order placement.
The Company does offer a 30-day return policy from the date of shipment. The Company also provides a limited lifetime warranty on its products. Due to a limited history of returns, the Company does not maintain a warranty reserve.
