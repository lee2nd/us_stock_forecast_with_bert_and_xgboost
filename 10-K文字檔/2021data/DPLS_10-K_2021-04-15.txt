Background
DarkPulse, Inc. (the “Company”) is a technology-security company created to develop, market and distribute a full suite of engineering, installation and security management solutions to industries and governments and has not commenced its planned principal operations.

The Company’s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including failing to secure additional funding needed to finalize development of the Company’s technology and to commercialize its product in a profitable manner.

Going Concern
The Company generated net losses of $275,841 and $1,825,469 during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company did not generate any revenue from product sales during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s current liabilities exceeded its current assets by $3,241,567. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $337 of cash.
The Company will require additional funding during the next twelve months to finance the growth of its current operations and achieve its strategic objectives. These factors, as well as the uncertain conditions that the Company faces relative to capital raising activities, create substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company is seeking to raise additional capital principally through private placement offerings and is targeting strategic partners in an effort to finalize the development of its products and begin generating revenues. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the success of future capital offerings or alternative financing arrangements and expansion of its operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Management is actively pursuing additional sources of financing sufficient to generate enough cash flow to fund its operations through calendar year 2021. However, management cannot make any assurances that such financing will be secured.

The primary reason for the overall decrease in general and administrative expense in the current year is a decrease in payroll and compensation of $168,758.
General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $33,824 or 18.5% to $149,259 from $183,083 for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Payroll and compensation expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased to $187 from $168,945 or 99.9% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The primary reason for the overall decrease in payroll and compensation expense in the current year is a decrease in employees and a reduction in stock based compensation.
Amortization expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 remained constant at $51,028.
Legal expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $50,415 from $118,281 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is related to ongoing litigation as described in more detail in Note 12 of the attached financial statements.
Debt transaction expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $17,050 or 68.5% from $24,900 to $7,850. The primary reason for the decrease is related to the decrease in convertible notes entered into during 2020.

Total other expenses totaled $17,102 and $1,279,233 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The $1,262,131 decrease is primarily attributed to the decrease recognized due to changes in the fair value of derivative instruments of $422,787, loss on convertible notes of $401,497 and a decrease in interest expense of $370,619.
Net Loss
As a result, net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $1,549,627 to $275,842 from $1,825,469 for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Comprehensive loss was $296,785 as compared to $1,878,374 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. At December 31, 2020, we had a cash balance of $337. Our working capital deficit is approximately $3,241,567 at December 31, 2020.
As of December 31, 2020, we had cash of $337, compared to $1,210 as of December 31, 2019. The Company currently does not have sufficient cash to fund its operations for the next 12 months and will require working capital to complete development, testing and marketing of its products and to pay for ongoing operating expenses. The Company anticipates adding consultants for technology development and the corresponding operations of the Company, but this will not occur prior to obtaining additional capital. Management is currently in the process of looking for additional investors. Currently, loans from banks or other lending sources for lines of credit or similar short-term borrowings are not available to the Company. The Company has been able to raise working capital to fund operations through the issuances of convertible notes or obtained through the issuance of the Company’s restricted common stock.
As of December 31, 2020, our current liabilities of $3,241,904 exceeded our current assets of $337 by $3,241,567.
