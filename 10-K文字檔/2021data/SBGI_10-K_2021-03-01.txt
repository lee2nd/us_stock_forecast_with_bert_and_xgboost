EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
We are a diversified television media company with national reach and a strong focus on providing high-quality content on our local television stations, RSNs, and digital platforms. This content consists of programming provided by third-party networks and syndicators, local news, college and professional sports, and other original programming produced by us. Additionally, we own digital and internet media products that are complementary to our extensive portfolio of television station related digital properties. Outside of our media related businesses, we operate technical services companies focused on supply and maintenance of broadcast transmission systems as well as research and development for the advancement of broadcast technology, and we manage other non-media related investments.
We have two reportable segments: broadcast and local sports. Our broadcast segment is comprised of our television stations. Our local sports segment is comprised of our RSNs. We also earn revenues from our owned networks, original content, digital and internet services, technical services, and non-media investments. These businesses are included within other. Corporate and unallocated expenses primarily include our costs to operate as a public company and to operate our corporate headquarters location. Other and corporate are not reportable segments.
STG, for which certain assets and results of operations are included in the broadcast segment and which is one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, is the primary obligor under the STG Bank Credit Agreement, the STG 5.125% unsecured notes due 2027, the STG 5.875% unsecured notes due 2026, the STG 5.500% unsecured notes due 2030, and the STG 4.125% secured notes due 2030 (the STG notes are collectively referred to as the STG Notes). We and substantially all of STG’s subsidiaries (and not DSG nor any of its subsidiaries) are guarantors under the STG debt instruments. DSG, for which certain assets and results of operations are included in the local sports segment and which is one of our subsidiaries, is the primary obligor under the DSG Bank Credit Agreement, the DSG 5.375% secured notes due 2026, the DSG 6.625% unsecured notes due 2027, and the DSG 12.750% secured notes due 2026 (the DSG notes are collectively referred to as the DSG Notes). DSG’s wholly-owned subsidiaries (and not us, STG, or any of STG's subsidiaries) are guarantors under the DSG debt instruments. Our Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock remain securities of SBG and not obligations or securities of STG or DSG.
For more information about our business, reportable segments, and our operating strategy, see Item 1. Business in this Annual Report.

Industry Trends
•The traditional MVPD industry continues to experience a decline in subscribers, which has been even higher with the onset of COVID-19, which is partially offset by growth in subscribers of virtual MVPDs.
•The Distributor industry has continued to undergo significant consolidation, which gives top Distributors purchase power.
•The vMVPDs have continued to gain increasing importance and have quickly become a critical segment of the market. These vMVPDs offer a limited number of networks at a significantly lower price point as compared to the traditional cable offering.
•Political spending is significantly higher in the even-numbered years due to the cyclicality of political elections. In addition, every four years, political spending is typically elevated further due to the advertising related to the presidential election. 2020 proved to be a record year in political advertising.
•The FCC has permitted broadcast television stations to use their digital spectrum for a wide variety of services including multi-channel broadcasts. The FCC “must-carry” rules only apply to a station’s primary digital stream.
•Seasonal advertising increases within our broadcast segment occur in the second and fourth quarters due to the anticipation of certain seasonal and holiday spending by consumers.
•Seasonal advertising increases within our local sports segment occur in the second and third quarters due to a higher volume of sports games being played during this time, particularly the MLB season.
•Broadcasters have found ways to increase returns on their news programming initiatives while continuing to maintain locally produced content through the use of news sharing arrangements.
•Advertising revenue related to the Olympics occurs in even numbered years, with the exception of this year which was postponed due to COVID-19, and the Super Bowl is aired on a different network each year. Both of these popularly viewed events can have an impact on our advertising revenues.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition, goodwill and intangible assets, program contract costs, sports programming rights, income taxes and variable interest entities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. These estimates have been consistently applied for all years presented in this report and in the past we have not experienced material differences between these estimates and actual results. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material.
We consider the following accounting policies to be the most critical as they are important to our financial condition and results of operations, and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application. For a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to create significant uncertainty and disruption in the global economy and financial markets. It is reasonably possible that these uncertainties continue to impact our estimates related to, but not limited to, revenue recognition, goodwill and intangible assets, sports programming rights, and income taxes. As a result, many of our estimates and assumptions require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. See Distribution Revenue in Revenue Recognition, Sports Programming Rights, and Impairment of Goodwill, Intangibles, and Other Assets under Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on how COVID-19 has impacted distribution revenue, sports rights expense, and the value of goodwill and definite-lived intangible assets, respectively. Our estimates may further change in the future as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, new events occur, and additional information emerges, and such changes are recognized or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements.
Revenue Recognition. As discussed in Revenue Recognition under Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the Consolidated Financial Statements, we generate advertising revenue primarily from the sale of advertising spots/impressions on our broadcast television, RSN, and digital platforms. Advertising revenue is recognized in the period in which the advertising spots/impressions are delivered. In arrangements where we provide audience ratings guarantees; to the extent that there is a ratings shortfall, we will defer a proportionate amount of revenue until the ratings shortfall is settled through the delivery of additional advertising. The term of our advertising arrangements is generally less than one year and the timing between when an advertisement is aired and when payment is realized is not significant. In certain circumstances, we require customers to pay in advance; payments received in advance of satisfying our performance obligations are reflected as deferred revenue.
We generate distribution revenue through fees received from Distributors and other OTT providers for the right to distribute our broadcast channels and cable networks on their distribution platforms. Distribution arrangements are generally governed by multi-year contracts and the underlying fees are based upon a contractual monthly rate per subscriber. These arrangements represent licenses of intellectual property; revenue is recognized as the signal is provided to our customers (as usage occurs) which corresponds with the satisfaction of our performance obligation. Revenue is calculated based upon the contractual rate multiplied by an estimated number of subscribers. Our customers will remit payments based upon actual subscribers a short time after the conclusion of a month, which generally does not exceed 120 days. Historical adjustments to subscriber estimates have not been material.
Certain of our distribution arrangements contain provisions that require the Company to deliver a minimum number of live professional sports games or tournaments during a defined period which usually corresponds with a calendar year. If the minimum threshold is not met, we may be obligated to refund a portion of the distribution fees received if shortfalls are not cured within a specified period of time. If we are unable to meet these minimum requirements, we reduce revenue based upon estimated rebates due to our distribution customers over the measurement period of the rebate. See Revenue Recognition within Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
Impairment of Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets, and Other Long-Lived Assets. We evaluate our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may exist. As of December 31, 2020, our consolidated balance sheet includes $2,092 million and $171 million of
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, respectively. We evaluate long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our asset groups may not be recoverable.
In the performance of our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessments we have the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely-than-not that the respective asset has been impaired. If we conclude that it is more-likely-than-not that a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, we apply the quantitative assessment, which involves comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset to its respective carrying value. See Impairment of Goodwill, Intangibles and Other Assets under Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5. Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets, and Other Intangible Assets within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the significant judgments and estimates inherent in both qualitatively assessing whether impairment may exist and estimating the fair values of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets if a quantitative assessment is deemed necessary.
Our RSNs included in the local sports segment have been negatively impacted by the recent loss of three Distributors. In addition, our existing Distributors are experiencing elevated levels of subscriber erosion which we believe is influenced, in part, by shifting consumer behaviors resulting from media fragmentation, the current economic environment, the COVID 19 pandemic and related uncertainties. Most of these factors are also expected to have a negative impact on future projected revenue and margins of our RSNs. As a result of these factors, we performed an impairment test of the RSN reporting units' goodwill and long-lived asset groups during the third quarter of 2020 which resulted in a non-cash impairment charge on goodwill of $2,615 million, customer relationships of $1,218 million, and other definite-lived intangible assets of $431 million, included within impairment of goodwill and definite-lived intangible assets in our consolidated statements of operations. See Note 5. Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets, and Other Intangible Assets for more information. For our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles impairment tests related to our broadcast and other reporting units in 2020, 2019, and 2018, we concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that goodwill was not impaired based on our qualitative assessments. For one reporting unit in 2019, we elected to perform a quantitative assessment and concluded that its fair value significantly exceeded the carrying value.
We believe we have made reasonable estimates and utilized appropriate assumptions in the performance of our impairment assessments. If future results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, including future events such as a deterioration of market conditions, loss of significant customers, significant increases in discount rates, among other factors, we could be exposed to impairment charges in the future. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows.
Program Contract Costs. As discussed in Broadcast Television Programming under Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the Consolidated Financial Statements, we record an asset and corresponding liability for programming rights when the program is available for its first showing or telecast. These costs are expensed over the period in which an economic benefit is expected to be derived. To ensure the related assets for the programming rights are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value, management estimates future advertising revenue to be generated by the remaining program material available under the contract terms. Management’s judgment is required in determining the timing of expense for these costs, which is dependent on the economic benefit expected to be generated from the program and may significantly differ from the timing of related payments under the contractual obligation. If our estimates of future advertising revenues decline, amortization expense could be accelerated or fair value adjustments may be required.
Sports Programming Rights. As discussed in Sports Programming Rights under Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have multi-year program rights agreements that provide us with the right to produce and telecast professional sports games within a specified territory in exchange for an annual rights fee. A prepaid asset is recorded for rights acquired related to future games upon payment of the contracted fee. The assets recorded for the acquired rights are classified as current or non-current based on the period when the games are expected to be aired. Liabilities are recorded for any program rights obligations that have been incurred but not yet paid at period end. We amortize these programming rights as an expense over each season based upon contractually stated rates. Amortization is accelerated in the event that the stated contractual rates over the term of the rights agreement results in an expense recognition pattern that is inconsistent with the projected growth of revenue over the contractual term.
Income Tax. As discussed in Income Taxes under Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the Consolidated Financial Statements, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. We provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized. In evaluating our ability to realize net deferred tax assets, we consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including our past operating results, tax planning strategies, current and cumulative losses, and forecasts of future taxable income. In considering these sources of taxable income, we must make certain judgments that are based on the plans and estimates used to manage our underlying businesses on a long-term basis. As of December 31, 2020, a valuation allowance has been provided for deferred tax assets related to certain temporary basis differences, interest expense carryforwards under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 163(j) and a substantial amount of our available state net operating loss carryforwards based on past operating results, expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary basis differences, alternative tax strategies and projected future taxable income. As of December 31, 2019, a valuation allowance was provided for deferred tax assets related to a substantial amount of our available state net operating loss carryforwards based on past operating results, including the RSN impairment, expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary basis differences, alternative tax strategies and projected future taxable income. Future changes in operating and/or taxable income or other changes in facts and circumstances could significantly impact the ability to realize our deferred tax assets which could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Management periodically performs a comprehensive review of our tax positions, and we record a liability for unrecognized tax benefits if such tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on their technical merits, including the resolution of any appeals or litigation processes. Significant judgment is required in determining whether positions taken are more likely than not to be sustained, and it is based on a variety of facts and circumstances, including interpretation of the relevant federal and state income tax codes, regulations, case law and other authoritative pronouncements. Based on this analysis, the status of ongoing audits and the expiration of applicable statute of limitations, liabilities are adjusted as necessary. The resolution of audits is unpredictable and could result in tax liabilities that are significantly higher or lower than for what we have provided. See Note 12. Income Taxes within the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further discussion of accrued unrecognized tax benefits.
Variable Interest Entities (VIEs). As discussed in Note 14. Variable Interest Entities within the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have determined that certain third-party licensees of stations for which we perform services pursuant to arrangements, including LMAs, JSAs, and SSAs, are VIEs and we are the primary beneficiary of those variable interests because, subject to the ultimate control of the licensees, we have the power to direct the activities which significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE through the services we provide and because we absorb losses and returns that would be considered significant to the VIEs. We have determined that certain RSN joint ventures are VIEs. We are the primary beneficiary of those RSN joint ventures because we have the power to direct the activities which significantly impact the economic performance of certain regional sports networks, including sales and certain operational services and because we absorb losses and returns that would be considered significant to the VIEs.
Transactions with Related Parties. We have determined that we conduct certain business-related transactions with related persons or entities. See Note 15. Related Person Transactions within the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of these transactions.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See Recent Accounting Pronouncements under Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting policies and their impact on our financial statements.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Any references to the first, second, third or fourth quarters are to the three months ended March 31, June 30, September 30, or December 31, respectively, for the year being discussed. We have two reportable segments, broadcast and local sports, that are disclosed separately from our other and corporate activities.
Seasonality / Cyclicality
The operating results of our broadcast segment are usually subject to cyclical fluctuations from political advertising. In even numbered years, political spending is usually significantly higher than in odd numbered years due to advertising expenditures preceding local and national elections. Additionally, every four years, political spending is usually elevated further due to advertising expenditures preceding the presidential election (as was the case in 2020). Also, the second and fourth quarter operating results are usually higher than the first and third quarter operating results because advertising expenditures are increased in anticipation of certain seasonal and holiday spending by consumers.
The operating results of our local sports segment are usually subject to cyclical fluctuations based on the timing and overlap of the MLB, NBA, and NHL seasons. Usually, the second and third quarter operating results are higher than the first and fourth quarter operating results.
However, with the exception of political advertising, our usual seasonality and cyclicality, as described above, did not occur in 2020, and may not occur in 2021, for either segment due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Consolidated Operating Data
The following table sets forth certain of our consolidated operating data for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 (in millions). For definitions of terms, see the footnotes to the table in Item 6. Selected Financial Data.
The Impact of COVID-19 on our Results of Operations
Overview
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and by the end of the following day, each of the MLB, NBA, and NHL had suspended their seasons. On March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national state of emergency. Since that time, efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 have intensified. Several countries, including the United States, have taken steps to restrict travel, temporarily close businesses and issue quarantine orders, and it remains unclear how long such measures will remain in place regionally.
Broadcast segment
Advertising revenue was negatively impacted due to COVID-19 starting in the late first quarter and throughout the year due to lower local and national net times sales. During the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the prior year, we saw decreases in several advertising categories, primarily as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in political advertising revenue, primarily due to strong demand in the third and fourth quarters. Distribution revenue was negatively impacted by subscriber erosion experienced by certain Distributors resulting from the effects of COVID-19, among other factors. See Revenues under the Broadcast Segment section below for further discussion.
Local sports segment
In March 2020, the NBA and NHL each postponed their ongoing 2019-2020 seasons and the MLB postponed the start of its 2020 season. During various points in the third quarter, the NBA, NHL, and MLB all returned to operation under reduced game counts and were able to complete these modified seasons during the early part of the fourth quarter of 2020. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the NBA and NHL announced their plans for their 2020-2021 seasons, which included season start dates in December 2020 and January 2021, respectively, however both with reduced game counts. Due to these interruptions and modified seasons, advertising revenue was down in the second quarter of 2020 as compared to the first quarter of 2020. However, with the resumption of some events during the third quarter of 2020, advertising revenue increased to $124 million during the period as compared to $3 million in the second quarter of 2020. Distribution revenue was negatively impacted by subscriber erosion experienced by certain Distributors resulting from the effect of COVID-19, three Distributors dropping carriage of the RSNs and lower professional sports game counts due to COVID-19, which resulted in rebates to the Distributors, among other factors. The MLB has announced that they expect their 2021 season to begin on time in April 2021 and contain a full game schedule. The NBA and NHL have not announced their 2021-2022 season schedules yet. There can be no assurance that the MLB, NBA, or NHL will complete full or abbreviated seasons in the future. Any reduction in the actual number of games played by the leagues may have an adverse impact on our operations and the cash flows of our local sports segment. See Distribution Revenue in Revenue Recognition and Sports Programming Rights under Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on how COVID-19 has impacted distribution revenue and sports rights expense, respectively, including the need for us to provide rebates to our Distributors as well as seek rebate from or reduce future payments to certain of the sports teams.
Business continuity
Within the United States, our business has been designated an essential business, which allows us to continue to serve our customers, however, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our operations. Certain of our facilities have experienced temporary disruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we cannot predict whether our facilities will experience more significant disruptions in the future and how long these disruptions will last. The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the risk that a significant portion of our workforce will suffer illness or otherwise be unable to work. Furthermore, reductions in our workforce may become necessary as a result of declines in our business caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. If we take such actions, we cannot assure that we will be able to rehire our workforce once our business has recovered.
BROADCAST SEGMENT
The following table sets forth our revenue and expenses for our broadcast segment, previously referred to as our local news and marketing services segment, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 (in millions):
(a)Includes $100 million and $35 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, of intercompany revenue related to certain services provided to the local sports segment and other under management services agreements, which is eliminated in consolidation.
Revenues
Distribution revenue. Distribution revenue, which includes payments from Distributors for our broadcast signals, increased $73 million in 2020 and $155 million in 2019 when compared to the same periods in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase is primarily due to an increase in rates, partially offset by a decrease in subscribers.
Advertising revenue. Advertising revenue increased $96 million in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to an increase in political advertising revenue of $334 million, as 2020 was a political and presidential election year. The increase is partially offset by decreases in certain categories, most notably a $92 million decrease in automotive, a $24 million decrease in entertainment, a $21 million decrease in furniture, a $16 million decrease in retail, a $14 million decrease in medical, an $11 million decrease in media, and a $10 million decrease in services, primarily as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Advertising revenue decreased $216 million in 2019 compared to 2018. The decrease is primarily related to a decrease in political advertising revenue of $221 million, as 2018 was a political year. These decreases were partially offset by increases in certain categories, notably home products and services.
For the year ended December 31, 2021 we expect a significant decrease in advertising revenue, when compared to 2020, primarily related to a decrease in political revenue, as 2020 was a political and presidential election year.
The following table sets forth our primary types of programming and their approximate percentages of advertising revenue, excluding digital revenue, for the periods presented:
The following table sets forth our affiliate percentages of advertising revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018:
(a)We broadcast other programming from the following providers on our channels including: Antenna TV, Azteca, Bounce Network, CHARGE!, Comet, Dabl, Decades, Estrella TV, Get TV, Grit, Me TV, Stadium, TBD, Telemundo, This TV, UniMas, Univision, and Weather.
Other Media Revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, other media revenue increased $63 million and $36 million, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2019 and 2018. The increase is primarily due to $100 million and $35 million, respectively, in intercompany revenue from the local sports and other segments related to providing certain services under a management services agreement, which are eliminated in our consolidated results.
Expenses
Media programming and production expenses. Media programming and production expenses increased $84 million during 2020 compared to 2019, primarily related to an increase in fees pursuant to network affiliation agreements of $105 million. This increase was partially offset by a $16 million decrease in advertising costs, $3 million decrease in employee compensation costs and travel expenses, and a $2 million decrease in network and programming expenses due to COVID-19 broadcasting cancellations.
Media programming and production expenses increased $92 million during 2019 compared to 2018, which is primarily related to increases in fess pursuant to network affiliation agreements.
Media selling, general and administrative expenses. Media selling, general and administrative expenses remained flat during 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to a $12 million increase in national sales commissions, partially offset by a $6 million decrease in regulatory costs, a $4 million decrease in travel and entertainment expenses due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and a $2 million decrease in employee compensation costs and travel expenses.
Media selling, general and administrative expenses increased $23 million during 2019 compared to 2018. The increase is primarily due to a $13 million increase in third-party fulfillment costs from our digital business due to higher revenues and product mix, a $6 million increase related to a regulatory cost, and a $10 million increase related to employee compensation costs. These increases were partially offset by an $11 million decrease in national sales commissions.
Amortization of program contract costs. The amortization of program contract costs decreased $7 million during 2020 compared to 2019, and is primarily related to the timing of amortization on long-term contracts and reduced renewal costs, partially offset by amortization related to new programming.
The amortization of program contract costs decreased $11 million during 2019 compared to 2018. The decrease is primarily due to $11 million related to the timing of amortization on long term contracts and reduced renewal costs.
Corporate general and administrative expenses. See explanation under Corporate and Unallocated Expenses.
Depreciation and amortization expenses. Depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of definite-lived intangibles and other assets decreased $7 million during 2020 compared to 2019, primarily related to depreciation and amortization related to assets retired during 2020.
Depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of definite-lived intangibles and other assets decreased $6 million during 2019 compared to 2018, primarily related to $3 million of depreciation and amortization related to assets retired during 2019.
Gain on asset dispositions and other, net of impairments. During 2020 and 2019, we recorded a gain of $90 million and $62 million, respectively, related to reimbursements from the FCC's National Broadband Plan spectrum repack process. For the year ended 2020, we recorded a gain of $29 million related to the sale of KGBT-TV and WDKY-TV. For the year ended 2018, we recorded a gain of $83 million associated with the sale of broadcast spectrum in the FCC broadcast incentive auction. See Dispositions within Note 2. Acquisitions and Dispositions of Assets within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
LOCAL SPORTS SEGMENT
Our local sports segment, previously referred to as our sports segment, reflects the results of our RSNs and a minority equity interest in the YES Network. The RSNs and YES Network own the exclusive rights to air, among other sporting events, the games of professional sports teams.
The following table sets forth our revenue and expenses for our local sports segment for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in millions):
(a)Includes $98 million and $35 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, of intercompany expense related to certain services provided by the broadcast segment under a management services agreement, which is eliminated in consolidation.
(b)Represents the activity from the closing date of the acquisition of the Acquired RSNs of August 23, 2019 through December 31, 2019.
Media revenue. Media revenue was $2,686 million and $1,139 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and is primarily derived from distribution and advertising revenue. The increase was primarily due to the results of the Acquired RSNs being included for the whole period of the current year, versus a partial period in the prior year, as the acquisition of the Acquired RSNs closed on August 23, 2019. Distribution revenue is generated through fees received from Distributors for the right to distribute our RSNs. As discussed under Distribution Revenue in Revenue Recognition under Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the Consolidated Financial Statements, decisions made by the leagues during 2020 regarding the timing and format of their seasons have resulted, in some cases, in our inability to meet minimum requirements for delivery of live games and the need to reduce revenue based upon estimated rebates due to our Distributors. As a result, for the year ended December 31, 2020, we reduced revenue and accrued corresponding rebates to Distributors of $420 million. See Subsequent Events under Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect distribution revenue to increase during 2021 as compared to 2020, primarily due to $420 million in rebate accruals in 2020 and increases in contractual rates, offset in part by dropped carriage by three Distributors and continued elevated subscriber churn.
Advertising revenue is primarily generated from sales of advertising spots/impressions within the RSNs' programming. Due to the interruptions and modified seasons, advertising revenue decreased in the second quarter of 2020 as compared to the first quarter of 2020. However, with the resumption of some events during the third quarter of 2020, advertising revenue increased to $124 million for the third quarter of 2020, as compared to $3 million in the second quarter of 2020. Advertising revenue decreased in the fourth quarter of 2020 as compared to the third quarter of 2020 due to the postponement of the start of the NBA and NHL seasons. We expect advertising revenue to increase during 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to a higher number of games scheduled to be played in each of the seasons of the MLB, NBA, and NHL. The extent of this increase will depend on the actual number of games played and other macro-economic factors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. See discussion under The Impact of COVID-19 on our Results of Operations for further discussion.
Media programming and production expenses. Media programming and production expenses were $1,361 million and $769 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are primarily related to $1,078 million and $637 million, respectively, of amortization of our sports programming rights with MLB, NBA, and NHL teams and the costs of producing and distributing content for our brands including live games, pre-game and post-game shows, and backdrop programming. The increase was primarily due to the results of the Acquired RSNs being included for the whole period of the current year, versus a partial period in the prior year, as the acquisition of the Acquired RSNs closed on August 23, 2019. We expect media programming and production expenses to increase during 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to the expectation of a higher number of games scheduled to be played in each of the seasons of the MLB, NBA, and NHL. The extent of this increase will depend on the number of actual games played and other macro-economic factors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. See discussion under The Impact of COVID-19 on our Results of Operations for further discussion.
Media selling, general, and administrative expenses. Media selling, general, and administrative expenses were $243 million and $90 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are primarily related to $98 million and $35 million, respectively, of management services agreement fees paid to the broadcast segment and eliminated in consolidation, employee compensation cost, advertising expenses, and consulting fees.
Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense was $410 million and $157 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and is primarily related to the amortization of definite-lived intangible assets and other assets.
Impairment of goodwill and definite-lived intangible assets. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a total impairment loss of $4,264 million relating to goodwill and definite-lived intangible assets of $2,615 million and $1,649 million, respectively. See further discussion in Note 5. Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets, and Other Intangible Assets within the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Corporate general and administrative expenses. See explanation under Corporate and Unallocated Expenses.
Other income, net. See explanation under Corporate and Unallocated Expenses.
Income from equity method investments. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, we recognized income from equity method investments of $6 million and $18 million, respectively. The income is primarily related to our minority ownership interest in the YES Network.
OTHER
The following table sets forth our revenues and expenses for our owned networks and content, non-broadcast digital and internet solutions, technical services, and non-media investments (collectively, other) for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 (in millions):
n/m - not meaningful
(a)Non-media revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 include $14 million, $23 million, and $10 million, respectively, of intercompany revenues related to certain services and sale provided to the broadcast segment, which are eliminated in consolidation.
(b)Non-media expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 include $7 million, $12 million, and $6 million, respectively, of intercompany expenses related to certain services and sales provided by the broadcast segment, which are eliminated in consolidation.
(c)Media expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes $2 million of intercompany expense primarily related to certain services provided by the broadcast segment under a management services agreement, which is eliminated in consolidation.
Revenue. Media revenue increased $84 million and $49 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, when compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase for both periods is primarily related to an increase in distribution and advertising revenue related to our owned networks. Non-media revenue decreased $103 million during 2020 compared to 2019, and is primarily related to a decrease in broadcast equipment sales due to the winding down of the FCC's National Broadband Plan spectrum repack process. Non-media revenue increased $71 million during 2019 compared to 2018 and is primarily related to an increase in broadcast equipment sales and services related to the FCC's National Broadband Plan repack process, partially offset by decreased sales from our real estate development projects.
Expenses. Media expenses decreased $3 million during 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease is primarily related to our owned networks. Non-media expenses decreased $70 million during 2020 compared to 2019, and is primarily related to a decrease in the cost of goods related to broadcast equipment sales. Media expenses increased $47 million during 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to our owned networks and our non-broadcast digital initiatives. Non-media expenses increased $40 million during 2019 compared to 2018. The increase is primarily related to broadcast equipment business and services, primarily due to higher sales related to the FCC's National Broadband Plan repack process.
Corporate general and administrative expenses. See explanation under Corporate and Unallocated Expenses.
Loss (gain) on asset dispositions and other, net of impairments. During the year ended 2018, we recorded a non-cash impairment of $60 million related to a real estate development project.
CORPORATE AND UNALLOCATED EXPENSES
The following table presents our corporate and unallocated expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 (in millions):
n/m - not meaningful
Corporate general and administrative expenses. The table above and the explanation that follows cover total consolidated corporate general and administrative expenses. Corporate general and administrative expenses decreased in total by $239 million during 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease is primarily due to a $258 million decrease in legal, consulting, and regulatory costs, primarily related to the litigation discussed under Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies within the Consolidated Financial Statements and the acquisition of the Acquired RSNs, partially offset by a $20 million increase in employee compensation cost.
Corporate general and administrative expenses increased in total by $276 million during 2019 compared to 2018. The increase is primarily due to a $187 million increase in legal, litigation, and regulatory costs, primarily related to the acquisition of the Acquired RSNs, $73 million in consulting fees and transaction costs, primarily related to the financing of the acquisition of the Acquired RSNs, and a $14 million increase in employee compensation cost.
We expect corporate general and administrative expenses to remain flat in 2021 compared to 2020.
Interest expense. The table above and explanations that follows cover total consolidated interest expense. Interest expense increased by $234 million during 2020 compared to 2019. The increase is primarily due to an increase of $257 million of interest expense associated with acquisition related financing related to the Acquired RSNs which was outstanding for a partial period in 2019 versus the full year in 2020. The increase is partially offset by net decreases in STG interest expense due to refinancing of existing debt and decreases in LIBOR.
Interest expense increased by $130 million during 2019 compared to 2018. The increase is primarily related to $211 million of acquisition related financing related to the acquisition of the Acquired RSNs, of which $189 million related to the DSG Notes and DSG Bank Credit Agreement, and $22 million related to a new term loan facility at STG. See Note 7. Notes Payable and Commercial Bank Financing within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. The increase was partially offset by $79 million in financing ticking fees for the year ended December 31, 2018, associated with the proposed Tribune acquisition, which was subsequently abandoned in August 2018.
Prior to any refinancing activities that may occur in 2021, we expect interest expense in 2021 to decrease when compared to 2020 primarily as a result of refinancing activities discussed in Note 7. Notes Payable and Commercial Bank Financing within the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Other income, net. Other income, net increased by $319 million during 2020 when compared to 2019. The increase is primarily due to a $158 million increase in the value of investments recorded at fair value and a measurement adjustment gain of $159 million related to certain variable payment obligations assumed in connection with the RSN acquisition. See Note 6. Other Assets and Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information
Income tax benefit. The 2020 income tax benefit for our pre-tax loss of $3,149 million resulted in an effective tax rate of 22.9%. The 2019 income tax benefit for our pre-tax income of $9 million resulted in an effective tax rate of (1,103.4)%. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 2019 to 2020 is primarily due to substantially magnified impact of 2019 discrete items as a result of negligible 2019 pre-tax income.
The 2018 income tax benefit for our pre-tax income (including the effects of noncontrolling interest) of $306 million resulted in an effective tax rate of (11.7)%. The increase in the effective tax rate from 2018 to 2019 is primarily due to substantially magnified impact of 2019 discrete items as a result of negligible 2019 pre-tax income.
As of December 31, 2020, we had a net deferred tax asset of $197 million as compared to a net deferred tax liability of $407 million as of December 31, 2019. The change from a net deferred tax liability to a net deferred tax asset primarily relates to the 2020 impairment charge related to goodwill and certain definite-lived intangible assets of our RSNs. See Note 5. Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets, and Other Intangible Assets within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
As of December 31, 2020, we had $11 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits. Of this total, $11 million (net of federal effect on state tax issues) represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect our effective tax rate. As of December 31, 2019, we had $11 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits. Of this total, $10 million (net of federal effect on state tax issues) represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect our effective tax rate. We recognized $0.3 million and $1 million of income tax expense for interest related to uncertain tax positions for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. See Note 12. Income Taxes within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. See Note 12. Income Taxes within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests was $56 million and $48 million, respectively, and is primarily related to dividends accrued and distributed related to the Redeemable Subsidiary Preferred Equity
Net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, net loss and net income attributable to the noncontrolling interests was $71 million and $10 million, respectively. The net loss is primarily related to the portion of the non-cash impairment charge on customer relationships, other definite-lived intangible assets and goodwill that is attributable to the noncontrolling interests, partially offset by income attributable to the noncontrolling interest.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
As of December 31, 2020, we had net working capital of approximately $2,183 million, including $1,259 million in cash and cash equivalent balances. Cash on hand, cash generated by our operations, and borrowing capacity under the Bank Credit Agreements are used as our primary sources of liquidity.
On September 23, 2020, DSPV entered into the A/R Facility, which matures on September 23, 2023, in order to enable DSG to raise incremental funding for the ongoing business needs of the local sports segment. The maximum funding availability under the A/R Facility is the lesser of $250 million and the sum of the lowest aggregate loan balance since November 1, 2020 plus $50 million. The amount of actual availability under the A/R Facility is subject to change based on the level of eligible receivables sold by certain indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of DSG identified therein (Originators) to DSPV and certain reserves. Eligibility of the receivables is determined by a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, credit ratings of the Originators’ customers, customer concentration levels, and certain characteristics of the accounts receivable being transferred. As of December 31, 2020, the total commitment was $227 million and the balance of the loans under the A/R Facility was $177 million.
On March 17, 2020, we drew $648 million and $225 million under the revolving credit facility portion of the STG Bank Credit Agreement (the STG Revolving Credit Facility) and the revolving credit facility portion of the DSG Bank Credit Agreement (the DSG Revolving Credit Facility, and together with the STG Revolving Credit Facility, the Revolving Credit Facilities), respectively, as a precautionary measure given the COVID-19 pandemic. During the quarter ended June 30, 2020, we fully repaid the amounts outstanding under each of the Revolving Credit Facilities.
The Bank Credit Agreements each include a financial maintenance covenant, the first lien leverage ratio (as defined in the respective Bank Credit Agreements), which requires such applicable ratio not to exceed 4.5x and 6.25x, measured as of the end of each fiscal quarter, for STG and DSG, respectively. The respective financial maintenance covenant is only applicable if 35% or more of the capacity (as a percentage of total commitments) under the respective Revolving Credit Facility, measured as of the last day of each quarter, is utilized under such Revolving Credit Facility as of such date. Since there was no utilization under either of the Revolving Credit Facilities as of December 31, 2020, neither STG nor DSG was subject to the respective financial maintenance covenant under their applicable Bank Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, the STG first lien leverage ratio was below 4.5x and the DSG first lien leverage ratio exceeded 6.25x. We expect that DSG's first lien leverage ratio will remain above 6.25x for at least the next 12 months, which will restrict our ability to fully utilize the DSG Revolving Credit Facility. We do not currently expect to have more than the 35% of the capacity of the DSG Revolving Credit Facility outstanding as of any quarterly measurement date during the next 12 months, therefore we do not expect DSG will be subject to the financial maintenance covenant. The Bank Credit Agreements contain other restrictions and covenants which the respective entities were in compliance with as of December 31, 2020 and expect to be over the next 12 months.
In December 2020, STG issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% secured notes which mature on December 1, 2030. The net proceeds of the STG 4.125% secured notes were used, plus cash on hand, to redeem all of STG's $550 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% unsecured notes due 2024 for a redemption price including accrued and unpaid interest, and a call premium, of $571 million and to prepay $200 million outstanding under STG's term loan B with a January 2024 stated maturity date.
In June 2020, DSG exchanged $66.5 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.625% unsecured notes due 2027 for $31 million aggregate principal amount of its 12.750% secured notes due 2026 and cash payments totaling $10 million, including accrued but unpaid interest.
In May 2020, we purchased $2.5 million aggregate principal amount of the STG 5.875% unsecured notes in open market transactions for consideration of $2.3 million. In March 2020 and June 2020, we purchased a total of $15 million aggregate principal amount of the DSG 6.625% unsecured notes in open market transactions for consideration of $10 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we redeemed 550,000 units of the Redeemable Subsidiary Preferred Equity for an aggregate redemption price equal to $550 million plus accrued and unpaid dividends, representing 100% of the unreturned capital contribution with respect to the units redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid dividends with respect to the units redeemed up to, but not including, the redemption date, and after giving effect to any applicable rebates. The balance of the Redeemable Subsidiary Preferred Equity as of December 31, 2020 was $170 million, net of issuance costs.
In January 2020, a minority partner in one of our RSNs exercised its right to sell us the entirety of its non-controlling interest, which we purchased for $376 million.
We anticipate that existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from our operations, and borrowing capacity under the Bank Credit Agreements and A/R Facility will be sufficient to satisfy our debt service obligations, capital expenditure requirements, and working capital needs for the next 12 months. However, certain factors, including but not limited to, the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting effect on the economy, our advertisers, Distributors, and their subscribers, could affect our liquidity and our first lien leverage ratio which could affect our ability to access the full borrowing capacity under the Bank Credit Agreements. For our long-term liquidity needs, in addition to the sources described above, we may rely upon various sources, such as but not limited to, the issuance of long-term debt, the issuance of equity or other instruments convertible into or exchangeable for equity, or the sale of interests in the RSNs or non-core assets. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing or capital or buyers of our non-core assets will be available, or that the terms of any transactions will be acceptable or advantageous to us.
Sources and Uses of Cash
The following table sets forth our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 (in millions):
Operating Activities
Net cash flows from operating activities increased during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. The increase is primarily related to the results of the Acquired RSNs being included for the entire period in 2020 versus a partial period in the prior year, as the acquisition closed on August 23, 2019, partially offset by a corresponding increase in interest expense on debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of the Acquired RSNs.
Net cash flows from operating activities increased during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. The increase is primarily due to the acquisition of the Acquired RSNs in August 2019 and higher distribution revenues.
Investing Activities
Net cash flows used in investing activities decreased during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease is primarily related to the acquisition of the Acquired RSNs and equity interest in the YES Network during the third quarter of 2019, partially offset by the sale of WDKY-TV during the third quarter of 2020 and KGBT-TV during the first quarter of 2020 as well as higher spectrum repack reimbursements.
Net cash flows used in investing activities increased during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. The increase is primarily related to the acquisition of the Acquired RSNs in August 2019, and an increase in net cash invested in debt and equity investments, primarily related to our investment in the YES Network.
Financing Activities
Net cash flows from financing activities decreased during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease is primarily related to financing inflows during the prior year associated with the issuance of debt and Redeemable Subsidiary Preferred Equity for the acquisition of the Acquired RSNs. During the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash flows used in financing activities primarily related to the redemption of Redeemable Subsidiary Preferred Equity, payments on our term loans, the redemption of the STG 5.625% unsecured notes, and repurchases of Class A Common Stock, partially offset by the proceeds from loans under the A/R Facility and the issuance of the STG 4.125% senior secured notes. See Note 7. Notes Payable and Commercial Bank Financing and Note 10. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Net cash flows from financing activities increased during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. The increase is primarily related to the issuance of debt and the Redeemable Subsidiary Preferred Equity for the acquisition of the Acquired RSNs, offset by the redemption of the STG 5.375% unsecured notes in August 2019, the STG 6.625% unsecured notes in November 2019, and the Redeemable Subsidiary Preferred Equity in December 2019. See Note 7. Notes Payable and Commercial Bank Financing and Note 10. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Contractual Obligations
We have various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed. For example, we are contractually committed to acquire future programming.
The following table reflects a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2020 and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash (in millions):
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
(a)Includes interest on debt and finance leases, including finance leases payable to related parties. Estimated interest on our variable rate debt has been calculated at an effective weighted interest rate of 3.11% as of December 31, 2020. Variable rate debt represents $6 billion of our $13 billion total face value of debt as of December 31, 2020. See Note 7. Notes Payable and Commercial Bank Financing within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the changes to notes payable, finance leases, and commercial bank financing during 2020 and Note 15. Related Person Transactions within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of related parties.
(b)Our programming rights and content includes contractual amounts owed through the expiration date of the underlying agreement for the local sports segment's sports programming rights of $14.7 billion, active and future television program contracts, network programming, and additional advertising inventory in various dayparts. Active television program contracts are included in the balance sheet as an asset and liability while future television program contracts are excluded until the cost is known, the program is available for its first showing or telecast, and the licensee has accepted the program. Industry protocol typically enables us to make payments for television program contracts on a three-month lag, which differs from the contractual timing within the table. Network programming agreements may include variable fee components such as subscriber levels, which in certain circumstances have been estimated and reflected in the table above based on current subscriber amounts.
(c)Includes obligations related to rating service fees, music license fees, market research, weather, and news services.
(d)Other includes obligations related to post-retirement benefits, guaranteed payments under a deferred purchase price liability, maintenance and support, other corporate contracts, other long-term liabilities, commitments to contribute capital to various non-media private equity investments, and LMA and outsourcing agreements. Excluded from the table are estimated amounts due pursuant to LMAs and outsourcing agreements where we consolidate the counter-party. The fees that we are required to pay under these agreements total $3 million and $0.4 million for the periods 2021 and 2022-2023, respectively. Certain station related operating expenses are paid by the licensee and reimbursed by us under the LMA agreements. Certain of these expenses that are in connection with contracts are included in the table above.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
Off balance sheet arrangements as defined by the SEC means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with the registrant is a party, under which the registrant has: obligations under certain guarantees or contracts; retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangements; obligations under certain derivative arrangements; and obligations arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity. As of December 31, 2020, we do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements.
