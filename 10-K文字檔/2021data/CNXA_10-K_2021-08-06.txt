ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Overview
Lazex Inc. (“Lazex”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on July 12, 2015. On August 23, 2019, the majority owner of Lazex entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Slinger Bag Americas Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Slinger Bag Americas”), which was 100% owned by Slinger Bag Ltd. (“SBL”), an Israeli company. In connection with the Stock Purchase Agreement, Slinger Bag Americas acquired 20,000,000 shares of common stock of Lazex for $332,239. On September 16, 2019, SBL transferred its ownership of Slinger Bag Americas to Lazex in exchange for the 20,000,000 shares of Lazex acquired on August 23, 2019. As a result of these transactions, Lazex owned 100% of Slinger Bag Americas and the sole shareholder of SBL owned 20,000,000 shares of common stock (approximately 82%) of Lazex. Effective September 13, 2019, Lazex changed its name to Slinger Bag Inc.
On October 31, 2019, Slinger Bag Americas acquired control of Slinger Bag Canada, Inc., (“Slinger Bag Canada”) a Canadian company incorporated on November 3, 2017. There were no assets, liabilities or historical operational activity of Slinger Bag Canada.
On February 10, 2020, Slinger Bag Americas became the 100% owner of SBL, along with SBL’s wholly owned subsidiary Slinger Bag International (UK) Limited (“Slinger Bag UK”), which was formed on April 3, 2019. On February 10, 2021, Zehava Tepler, the owner of SBL, contributed Slinger Bag UK to Slinger Bag Americas for no consideration.
The operations of Slinger Bag Inc., Slinger Bag Americas, Slinger Bag Canada, Slinger Bag UK and SBL are collectively referred to as the “Company.”
The Company operates in the sporting and athletic goods business. The Company is the owner of the Slinger Launcher, which is a portable tennis ball launcher, as well as other associated tennis accessories.
Effective February 25, 2020, the Company increased the number of authorized shares of common stock from 75,000,000 to 300,000,000 via a four-to-one forward split of its outstanding shares of common stock. All share and per share information contained in this report have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the impact of the stock split.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements of the Company are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). As a result of the transactions described above, the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the combined results of Slinger Bag Inc., Slinger Bag Americas, Slinger Bag Canada, Slinger Bag UK and SBL for the years ended April 30, 2021 and 2020. The contribution of the net assets of SBL is reflected as an equity contribution at historical cost on May 1, 2019, the beginning of the earliest period in which the entities were under common control. There was no historical activity in Slinger Bag Americas or Slinger Bag Canada prior to May 1, 2019. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.
Valuation of Inventory
Inventory is valued at the lower of the cost (determined principally on a first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. The Company’s valuation of inventory includes inventory reserves for inventory that will be sold below cost and the impact of inventory shrink. Inventory reserves are based on historical information and assumptions about future demand and inventory shrink trends. It is possible that changes to inventory reserve estimates could be required in future periods due to changes in market conditions.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, the core principle of which is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company recognizes revenue for its performance obligation associated with its contracts with customers at a point in time once products are shipped. Amounts collected from customers in advance of shipping products ordered are reflected as deferred revenue on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s standard terms are non-cancelable and do not provide for the right-of-return, other than for defective merchandise covered under the Company’s standard warranty. The Company has not historically experienced any significant returns or warranty issues.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Fair value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The three-tier hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value, which prioritizes the inputs used in the methodologies of measuring fair value for assets and liabilities, is as follows:
Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities
Level 3 - Unobservable pricing inputs in the market
Financial assets and financial liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurements requires judgment and may affect the valuation of the assets and liabilities being measured and their categorization within the fair value hierarchy.
The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable. The carrying amount of these financial instruments approximates fair value due to their short-term maturity. The Company’s derivative liabilities were calculated using Level 2 assumptions.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized.
Long-Lived Assets
In accordance with ASC 360-10, the Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their net book value may not be recoverable. When such factors and circumstances exist, the Company compares the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amount. If those net undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying amount, impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value, based on market value or discounted expected cash flows of those assets and is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. There was no impairment of long-lived assets identified during the year ended April 30, 2021 or 2020.
Valuation of Warrants
The Company grants warrants to key employees and executives as compensation on a discretionary basis. The Company also grants warrants in connection with certain note payable agreements and other key arrangements. The Company is required to estimate the fair value of share-based awards on the measurement date and recognize as expense that value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest over the requisite service period.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2019, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU), 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, which amends ASC 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740). This update is intended to simplify accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in ASC 740 and amending existing guidance to improve consistent application of ASC 740. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. The guidance in this update has various elements, some of which are applied on a prospective basis and others on a retrospective basis with earlier application permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of this ASU on the Company’s financial statements and related disclosures.
Results of Operations for the Years Ended April 30, 2021 and 2020
The following are the results of our operations for the year ended April 30, 2021 as compared to April 30, 2020:
Net sales
Our net sales during the year ended April 30, 2021 were $10,804,214, which consisted partially of shipped orders related to our Kickstarter and Indiegogo crowdfunding campaigns initiated in fiscal year 2019, as well as new orders placed and fulfilled to consumers via our online marketplace and to our international distributors. Our net sales during the year ended April 30, 2020 were $686,179 and were entirely related to our crowdfunding campaigns. As of April 30, 2021 and April 30, 2020, we had deferred revenue of $99,531 and $179,366, respectively, representing units that have not been shipped at year end.
Cost of sales
Our cost of sales during the year ended April 30, 2021 were $7,680,290, which represents the costs of units shipped during the period, and resulted in a gross profit of $3,123,924, or 29%. During the first quarter of the current year, we experienced a gross loss as the bulk of our sales in that period related to the shipment of initial crowdfunding orders. The loss on these shipments was due to (1) discounted pricing on the initial crowdfunding orders, (2) as fulfillment was later than initially scheduled we fulfilled orders with the “deluxe” version of launcher (including all features), as well as tennis balls, both of which increased costs, and (3) due to sanctions by the U.S. against Chinese sourced products, the import duty was raised on all launchers brought into the U.S. increasing our cost of sales. As a result, our cost of sales exceeded initial sales values raised in our crowdfunding campaigns. As of the beginning of the third quarter, substantially all of the initial crowdfunding orders had been fulfilled. Sales generated during the last two fiscal quarters represented new orders placed and fulfilled during the current year by consumers and distributors, which resulted in a positive gross profit. Currently, our cost of sales is being negatively impacted by the large increase in container costs out of Asia. Our cost of sales during the year ended April 30, 2020 were $1,370,897, and resulted in a gross loss of $684,718 for the reasons stated above relating to our crowdfunding orders.
Selling and marketing expenses
During the year ended April 30, 2021, we incurred selling and marketing expenses of $1,761,154 compared with $563,003 during the year ended April 30, 2020. This increase is largely driven by an increase in social media advertising, sponsorships, and other investments in our public relations presence in order to drive sales and build brand awareness.
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation, including share-based compensation, and other employee-related costs, as well as legal fees and fees for professional services. During the year ended April 30, 2021, we incurred general and administrative expenses of $4,749,922 compared with $5,291,075 during the year ended April 30, 2020. The decrease in general and administrative expenses is largely due to a one-time warrant grant to key employees and officers of the Company in the prior year that resulted in an expense of $3,741,746, which was partially offset in the current year by an increase in compensation expense due to increased headcount as a result of the continued growth of the business.
Research and development costs
During the year ended April 30, 2021, we incurred research and development costs of $339,385 compared with $179,982 during the year ended April 30, 2020. This increase is mainly driven by our investment in a new platform and app that will integrate artificial intelligence (AI) technology to offer more value to our customers.
Transaction costs
During the year ended April 30, 2020, we incurred transaction costs associated with completing the Stock Purchase Agreement with Slinger Bag Americas, as well as additional professional fees associated with being a publicly traded company.
Other expenses
During the years ended April 30, 2021 and April 30, 2020, we had other expenses totaling $14,868,223 and $2,310,523, respectively. The increase in other expenses for the year ended April 30, 2021 as compared to April 30, 2020 was primarily due to increases in loss on extinguishment of debt of $3,030,495 and induced conversion loss of $51,412 due to debt extinguishment transactions during the year, increases in related party interest expense due to the increase in related party note payable balances during the year, and the increase in interest expense due to the $12,501,178 charge related to the warrants and make-whole provision that were issued in conjunction with a note payable that was entered into during the year. These increases were partially offset by decreases in amortization of debt discount of $1,188,668 and the gain on the change in fair value of derivatives for the year ended April 30, 2021 of $1,939,639.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes we will be able to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. We had an accumulated deficit of $28,823,273 as of April 30, 2021, and more losses are anticipated in the development of the business. Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.
The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our generating profitable operations in the future and/or being able to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand, loans from related parties, and/or private placement of debt and/or common stock.
The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended April 30, 2021 and 2020:
We had cash and cash equivalents of $928,796 as of April 30, 2021, as compared to $79,847 as of April 30, 2020.
Net cash used in operating activities was $4,517,457 during the year ended April 30, 2021, compared with $4,208,274 during the year ended April 30, 2020. Our cash used in operating activities during the year ended April 30, 2021 was primarily the result of our net loss of $18,594,760 for the year as well as increases in inventory and accounts receivable year over year, which was partially offset by non-cash expenses of $14,892,030 and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses, accrued payroll and bonuses and accrued interest - related party as well as a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets year over year. Our net cash used in operating activities during year ended April 30, 2020 was primarily the result of our net loss of $9,227,744 during the year as well as increases in inventory and prepaid expenses and other current assets, which was partially offset by non-cash expenses of $5,666,425 as well as increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses, accrued payroll and bonuses and accrued interest - related party.
Net cash used in investing activities was $30,000 for the year ended April 30, 2021, compared with net cash provided by investing activities of $73,400 for the for year ended April 30, 2020. Investing activities for the year ended April 30, 2021 related to the purchase of the Slinger trademark, while investing activities for the year ended April 30, 2020 were the result of $73,400 in cash we acquired from the contribution of the net assets of Slinger Bag Limited.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $5,420,000 for the year ended April 30, 2021, compared with $4,217,761 for the year ended April 30, 2020. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended April 30, 2021 consisted of proceeds of $3,300,000 from notes payable with a related party, proceeds of $3,120,000 from notes payable, and a repayment of notes payable with a related party of $1,000,000. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended April 30, 2020 consisted of proceeds of $2,100,000 from notes payable with a related party, $1,950,000 in proceeds from convertible notes payable, and proceeds of $500,000 from a note payable, which was partially offset by a distribution to the majority shareholder for $332,239.

Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined in the BLSA), the Lender may (i) at any time thereafter, in its discretion transfer any securities or other property constituting Collateral into its own name or that of its nominee and receive the income thereon and hold the same as security for all Obligations or apply it on any or all amounts due on the Obligations in such order as Lender may elect in its sole discretion, (ii) enter the Borrower’s premises and take control of its business and (iii) require each Borrower to establish, at Borrower’s expense, a lock box account with such bank acceptable to Lender, into which Borrower shall promptly deposit and direct their account debtors to directly remit all payments on receivables and which such payments or deposits shall be the property solely of the Lender.
IPSA
To secure the prompt payment to the Lender of the Obligations of the Borrower, the Borrower pledged and granted to the Lender a continuing security interest in and lien upon all of Borrower’s right, title and interest in, to and under the following, whether presently existing or hereafter created or acquired (collectively, the “IP Collateral”):
a. trademarks and trademark licenses to which the Borrower is a party;
b. patents and patent licenses to which Borrower is a party;
c. copyrights and copyright licenses to which Borrower is a party;
d. intellectual property not covered by the foregoing;
e. rights to sue third parties for past, present or future infringement, dilution, misappropriation, or other violation of rights in any intellectual property, including injury to the goodwill associated with any trademark, and all causes of action for the same; and
f. All proceeds of all or any of the foregoing, tort claims and all claims and other rights to payment including (i) insurance claims against third parties for loss of, damage to, or destruction of, the foregoing IP Collateral and (ii) payments due or to become due under copyright licenses, patent licenses or trademark licenses and proceeds payable under, or unearned premiums with respect to, policies of insurance in whatever form regarding the foregoing Collateral.
SPA
Pursuant to the SPA, SBI pledged, assigned and granted to the Lender and created a continuing first priority lien and security interest in favor of the Lender in and to all of its right, title, and interest in and to the following, property (collectively, the “Security Collateral”) to secure the due and prompt payment and performance of the Borrower’s Obligations:
(a) 100% of the shares in each of its subsidiaries SBA, SBC, SB UK and SBL; and
(b) all proceeds and products of the foregoing, all books and records relating to the foregoing, all supporting obligations related thereto, and all accessions to, substitutions, and replacements for, and profits and products of, each of the foregoing, and any and all proceeds of any insurance, indemnity, warranty, or guaranty payable to the Borrower from time to time with respect to any of the foregoing.
The Borrower also agreed, from time to time, as may be required by the Lender with respect to all Security Collateral, to take all actions as may be requested by the Lender to perfect the security interest of the Lender in the Security Collateral and so that control of such Security Collateral is obtained and at all times held by the Lender.
The Borrower further authorized the Lender at any time and from time to time to file in any relevant jurisdiction any financing statements and amendments thereto that contain the information required by Article 9 of the UCC of each applicable jurisdiction for the filing of any financing statement or amendment relating to the Security Collateral, without the signature of the Borrower where permitted by law.
ICA
Under the ICA, until the obligations, liabilities and indebtedness of every nature of the Borrower from time to time owed to the Lender under the Loan Agreements (the “First Lien Obligations”) have been paid in full, any other creditor’s security interest in and lien on the Collateral to secure the payment and performance of their obligations were subordinated to the Lender’s security interests in and liens on the Collateral to secure the First Lien Obligations, regardless of the order or time of attachment, or the order, time, or manner of perfection, or the order or time of filing or recordation of any document or instrument, or other method of perfecting a lien.
WPA
Pursuant to the WPA, SBI issued and sold to the Lender 2,000,000 warrants to purchase common stock of SBI and to Chessler Holdings, LLC 200,000 warrants to purchase common stock of SBI (together, the “Warrants”).
Warrants
Each Warrant permits its holder to purchase shares of SBI’s common stock at an exercise price of $0.025 per share, subject to the option to cashless exercise such warrants.
Each warrant has other customary terms found in like instruments, including, but not limited to, events of default.
Future amounts due as of April 30, 2021 are summarized as follows:
We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds, cash flows from operations and further issuances of debt and/or securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business.
Existing working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next twelve months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to (i) acquisition of inventory; (ii) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business; and (iii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
Effect of Inflation and Changes in Prices
We do not believe that inflation and changes in prices will have a material effect on our operations.
