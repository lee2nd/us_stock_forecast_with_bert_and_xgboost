ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Executive Overview
On August 31, 2016, PCT LTD entered into a Securities Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with Paradigm Convergence Technologies Corporation, a Nevada corporation (“Paradigm” or “PCT Corp.”). Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, PCT Corp. became the wholly owned subsidiary of PCT LTD after the exchange transaction. PCT LTD is a holding company, which through PCT Corp., is engaged in the business of marketing new products and technologies through licensing and joint ventures.
PCT LTD had not recorded revenues for the two fiscal years prior to its acquisition of PCT Corp. and was dependent upon financing to continue basic operations. PCT Corp. has recorded revenue since it initiated operations in 2012; however, those revenues have not been sufficient to finance operations, recording annual net losses of $8,138,287 and $16,578,564 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
PCT LTD remains dependent upon additional financing to continue operations. The Company intends to raise additional financing through private placements of its common/preferred stock and debt financing. We expect that we would issue such stock pursuant to exemptions to the registration requirements provided by federal and state securities laws. The purchasers and manner of issuance will be determined according to our financial needs, as discussed below, and the available exemptions to the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. We also note that if we issue more shares of our common stock, then our stockholders may experience dilution in the value per share of their common stock.
The expected costs for the next twelve months include:
• continuation of commercial launch of non-toxic sanitizing, disinfecting and sterilizing products and technologies with a strong emphasis on health care facilities, including hospitals, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, clinics and medical, dental and veterinarian offices;
• continued research and development on product generation units including those designed for on-site deployment at customers’ facilities;
• accelerated research and development and initial commercialization on applications of the products in the agricultural sector, most specifically with respect to abatement of a specific crop disease crisis caused by a bacterium in the U.S. and elsewhere and continued in-field testing within the oil and gas market;
• acquiring available complementary technology rights;
• payment of short-term debt;
• hiring of additional personnel in 2021; and
• general and administrative operating costs.
Management projects these costs to total approximately $3,500,000. To minimize these costs, the Company intends to maintain its practice of controlling operating overheads with efficient facilities commitments, generally below market salaries and consulting fees, and rigorous prioritization of expenditure requirements. Based on its understanding of the commercial readiness of its products and technologies, the capabilities of its personnel (current and being hired), established business relationships and the general market conditions, management believes that the Company expects to be covering its fixed operating expenses (“burn rate”) by the end of the second quarter of 2021.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company recorded a net loss of $8,138,287 and had a working capital deficit of $14,479,722 for the year ended December 31, 2020. We have recorded significant incremental increases in revenues from operations since inception and we are establishing ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover our operating costs. During 2020 and 2019 the Company relied on raising equity capital and borrowing from stockholders and third parties to fund its ongoing day-to-day operations and its corporate overhead. As December 31, 2020 we had $115,196 in cash compared to $67,613 in cash at December 31, 2019. We had total liabilities of $15,364,398 at December 31, 2020 compared to $14,290,486 at December 31, 2019.
Total assets increased by $259,835 to $4,634,610 at December 31, 2020 compared to $4,374,775 at December 31, 2019. This increase is primarily from increases in accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and right of use assets. This was offset by depreciation and amortization recorded on intangible assets and property and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Total liabilities increased by $1,073,912 to $15,364,398 at December 31, 2020 compared to $14,290,486 at December 31, 2019. This increase is primarily additions to convertible notes payable (net of discount) of approximately $420,370, derivative liabilities of $911,170.
Our current cash flow is not sufficient to meet our monthly expenses of approximately $280,000 and to fund future research and development. We intend to rely on additional debt financing, loans from existing shareholders and private placements of common/preferred stock for additional funding; however, there is no assurance that additional funding will be available. We do not have material commitments for future capital expenditures. However, we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain short-term financing, or that sources of such financing, if any, will continue to be available, and if available, that they will be on favorable terms.
During the next 12 months we anticipate incurring additional costs related to the filing of Exchange Act periodic reports. We believe we will be able to meet these costs through funds provided by management, significant stockholders and/or third parties. We may also rely on the issuance of our common stock in lieu of cash to convert debt or pay for expenses.
The table below presents information regarding cash flows:
Commitments and Obligations
At December 31, 2020 the Company recorded notes payable totaling approximately $2,781,597 (related, non-related and convertible, net of debt discount) compared to notes payable totaling $2,482,743 (related, non-related and convertible, net of debt discount) at December 31, 2019. These notes payable represent cash advances received and expenses paid from third parties and related parties. The notes carry an effective interest rate from 0% to 210% and are due ranging from on demand to March 21, 2022.
PCT Corp. was committed to one lease for office and production space during 2019, located in Little River, South Carolina. The South Carolina lease amount was $4,800 per month, through November 30, 2019, at which time a new owner purchased the building and the Company went on a month-to-month rental basis. The Company re-negotiated an annual lease on the Little River, SC facility for $7,500 per month, retroactive to July 1, 2020, which, at the option of the Company, is renewable for an additional four years (with a 2% increase annually) and added a three-year lease for 9,600 s.f. of warehouse space in Fort Wayne, Indiana on November 1, 2020, for $4,500 per month.
Results of Operations
Revenues increased to $2,519,914 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $708,405 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The revenue increases for 2020 were due to the increased volume of fluids sold during the COVID-19 pandemic, the sale of fluid producing equipment, licensing revenue from EPA sub registrations, and placing equipment under the Company’s 2- and 3-year Systems Service Agreements during the year.
Total operating expenses increased to $3,921,143 for the 2020 year compared to $2,390,341 for the 2019 year. The total operating expense increase for 2020 was due to an increase in general and administrative expenses and an increase in cost of sales. Cost of sales increased as a result of increased sales in 2020 over 2019.
General and administrative expenses increased to $2,485,379 for the 2020 year compared to $1,922,941 for the 2019 year. The increase in general and administrative expense for 2020 was mainly due to more personnel, leased facilities, and higher accounting and legal expense.
Research and development expenses increased to $40,429 for the 2020 year compared to $6,149 for the 2019 year. Research and development expenses were expected to be higher in 2020, as the Company continued to develop next generations model(s) of its Annihilyzer® and other equipment.
Depreciation and amortization expenses increased to $348,708 for the 2020 year compared to $338,028 for the 2019 year. Depreciation and amortization expenses were comparable for the two years.
Total other expenses decreased to $6,737,058 for the 2020 year compared to $14,896,628 for the 2019 year. The overall decrease was mainly from a decrease in loss on fair value of derivative liability of $7,487,509. Interest expense decreased by $656,745.
As a result of the changes described above, the net loss decreased to $8,138,287 for the 2020 year compared to $16,578,564 for the 2019 year.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources and would be considered material to investors.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in the notes to our financial statements. In general, management’s estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.
