Overview
Tego Cyber, Inc. (was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 6, 2019. We are an early-stage provider of advanced cyberthreat intelligence applications for larger business enterprises. The Company has developed a cyber threat intelligence application that integrates with top end security platforms to gather, analyze, then proactively identify threats to an enterprise network. The Tego Threat Intelligence Platform (TTIP) takes in vetted and curated threat data and after utilizing a proprietary process, the platform compiles, analyzes, and then delivers that data to an enterprise network in a format that is timely, informative, and relevant. The threat data provides additional context including specific details needed to identify and counteract threats so that security teams can spend less time searching for disparate information. The first version of the TTIP will integrate with the widely accepted SPLUNK platform to provide real-time threat intelligence to macro enterprises using the SPLUNK architecture. The Company plans on developing future versions of the TTIP for integration with other established SIEM systems and platforms including: Elastic, IBM QRadar, AT&T AlienVault, Exabeam, and LogRhythm.
Results of operations for fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 compared to period September 6, 2019 (inception) to June 30,
Revenues
We are in our development stage and only generated $8,100 of revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 compared to $2,325 for the period September 6, 2019 (inception) to June 30, 2020.
Operating Expenses
We incurred total operating expenses of $674,918 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 compared to $79,527 for the period September 6, 2019 (inception) to June 30, 2020. Of that was $168,077 in legal and accounting expenses relating to the listing of our common shares on the OTCQB compared to $26,429 for the period September 6, 2019 (inception) to June 30, 2020. We also incurred $167,250 in management fees compared to $34,700 for the period September 6, 2019 (inception) to June 30, 2020. We also incurred consulting and contracting fees in the amount of $95,938 relating to the development of the threat intelligence application compared to $263 for the period September 6, 2019 (inception) to June 30, 2020. We incurred $67,597 in investor relations and shareholder communications compared to $nil for the period September 6, 2019 (inception) to June 30, 2020.
Net Loss
We incurred a net loss of $923,180 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 compared to a net loss of $77,202 for the period September 6, 2019 (date of inception) to June 30, 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As at June 30, 2021, the Company has a working capital surplus of $652,296, a net loss of $923,180 and has earned limited revenue to cover its operating costs. We have $583,015 cash on hand and our burn rate is approximately $85,000 per month. Presently, our operations are being funded by funds previously raised and we believe our currently available capital resources are sufficient to sustain our operations for a minimum of six (6) months. The Company intends to fund future operations through equity financing arrangements. The ability of the Company to realize its business plan is dependent upon, among other things, obtaining additional financing to continue operations, and development of its business plan. In response to these problems, management intends to raise additional funds through public or private placement offerings. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Cash Flow from Operating Activities
For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, the cash flows used in the Company’s operating activities was $578,415 compared to $45,690 for the period September 6, 2019 (date of inception) to June 30, 2020.
Cash Flow from Investing Activities
For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, the net cash used in investing activities by the Company was $54,250 compared to $18,250 for the period September 6, 2019 (date of inception) to June 30, 2020.
Cash Flow from Financing Activities
For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, the net cash provided by financing activities by the Company was $1,133,808 compared to $145,812 for the period September 6, 2019 (date of inception) to June 30, 2020. The cash provided by financing activities is related to the proceeds received from sales of our common stock.
Going Concern
We have not attained profitable operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to pursue any extensive activities. For these reasons, our auditors stated in their report on our audited financial statements that they have substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern without further financing.
Contractual Obligations
We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.
Future Financings
We will continue to rely on equity sales of our common shares and debt proceeds in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of the equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our operations and other activities.
Expected Purchase or Sale of Significant Equipment
We do not anticipate the purchase or sale of any significant equipment, as such items are not required by us at this time or in the next twelve months.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.
Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
Other than the disclosure of uncertainty regarding the ability for us to continue as a going concern which was included in our accountant’s report on the financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021; Harbouside CPA’s (formerly known as Buckley Dodds) report on the financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles.
In connection with the audit and review of the financial statements of the Company from the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, there were no disagreements on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosures, or auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements if not resolved to their satisfaction would have caused them to make reference in connection with Harbouside CPA’s opinion to the subject matter of the disagreement.
In connection with the audited financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year June 30, 2021, there have been no reportable events with the Company as set forth in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
Critical Accounting Policies
This summary of significant accounting policies is presented to assist in understanding the financial statements. The financial statements and notes are representations of the Company’s management, who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to US GAAP and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the financial statements.
Basis of Preparation
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared to present the statements of financial position, the statements of operations and comprehensive loss, statements of changes in shareholders’ deficit and cash flows of the Company for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 and have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP.
Use of Estimates
In preparing financial statements in conformity with US GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management makes these estimates using the best information available at the time the estimates are made. However, actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and accounts receivable. During the fiscal period ended June 30, 2021, substantially all of the Company’s cash was held by major financial institutions located in the United States, which management believes are of high credit quality. With respect to accounts receivable, the Company extended credit based on an evaluation of the customer’s financial condition. The Company generally did not require collateral for accounts receivable and maintained an allowance for doubtful accounts of accounts receivable if necessary.
Cash
Cash consists of cash held at major financial institutions and is subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
Receivables and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Trade accounts receivable are recorded at net realizable value and do not bear interest. No allowance for doubtful accounts was made during the period ended June 30, 2021, based on management’s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in accounts receivable. The Company evaluates its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon knowledge of its customers and their compliance with credit terms. The evaluation process includes a review of customers’ accounts on a regular basis. The review process evaluates all account balances with amounts outstanding for more than 60 days and other specific amounts for which information obtained indicates that the balance may be uncollectible. As of June 30, 2021, there was no allowance for doubtful accounts and the Company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 820 “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”, adopted January 1, 2008, defines fair value, establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The Company’s financial instruments include cash, current receivables and payables. These financial instruments are measured at their respective fair values. The three levels are defined as follows:
Level 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
Level 2 - inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instruments.
Level 3 - inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value.
For cash, accounts receivables, subscription receivables, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities, it is management’s opinion that the carrying values are a reasonable estimate of fair value because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and if applicable, their stated interest rate approximates current rates available.
Management believes it is not practical to estimate the fair value of related party receivables and payables because the transactions cannot be assumed to have been consummated at arm’s length, the terms are not deemed to be market terms, there are no quoted values available for these instruments, and an independent valuation would not be practical due to the lack of data regarding similar instruments, if any, and the associated potential costs.
Revenue Recognition
Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“Topic 606”), was adopted by the Company as of September 6, 2019. The Company’s revenue recognition disclosure reflects its updated accounting policies that are affected by this new standard. The Company applied the “modified retrospective” transition method for open contracts for the implementation of Topic 606. As revenues are and have been primarily from consulting and management services, and the Company has no significant post-delivery obligations, this new standard did not result in a material recognition of revenue on the Company’s accompanying financial statements for the cumulative impact of applying this new standard. The Company made no adjustments to its previously reported total revenues, as those periods continue to be presented in accordance with its historical accounting practices under Topic 605, Revenue Recognition.
Revenue from providing consulting and management services under Topic 606 is recognized in a manner that reasonably reflects the delivery of services to customers in return for expected consideration and includes the following elements:
-
executed contracts with the Company’s customers that it believes are legally enforceable;
-
identification of performance obligations in the respective contract;
-
determination of the transaction price for each performance obligation in the respective contract;
-
allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation; and
-
recognition of revenue only when the Company satisfies each performance obligation.
These five elements as applied to the Company’s consulting and management services results in revenue recorded as services are provided.
Income Taxes
The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes pursuant to ASC 740 “Income Taxes”. ASC 740 requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes and allows recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets based upon the likelihood of realization of tax benefits in future years. Under the asset and liability approach, deferred taxes are provided for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Valuation allowances are provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not these items will either expire before the Company is able to realize their benefits, or that future deductibility is uncertain. The provision for income taxes represents current taxes payable net of the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Foreign Currency Translation
The Company’s functional and reporting currency is United States dollars (“USD”). The Company maintains its financial statements in the functional currency. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet dates. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Exchange gains or losses arising from foreign currency transactions are included in the determination of net income (loss) for the respective periods.
Earnings per Share
Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed similar to basic earnings per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. If applicable, diluted earnings per share assume the conversion, exercise or issuance of all common stock instruments unless the effect is to reduce a loss or increase earnings per share. The Company had no dilutive securities for the period ended June 30, 2021.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued ASU 2018-07, “Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting”, to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees. ASU 2018-07 simplifies the accounting for nonemployee share-based payments, aligning it more closely with the accounting for employee awards. At this time, the Company does not expect this standard to affect the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows and disclosures.
Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force) did not or are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's present or future financial statements.
