Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Overview
Established in 1891 in northern Idaho’s Silver Valley, we believe we are the oldest operating precious metals mining company in the United States and the largest silver producer in the United States. Our corporate offices are in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho and Vancouver, British Columbia. Our production profile includes:
•
concentrates containing silver, gold (in the case of Greens Creek), lead and zinc, which is shipped to various smelters or sold to metal traders;
•
unrefined doré containing gold and silver, which is sold to refiners or further refined before sale of the metals to traders; and
•
carbon material containing gold and silver, which is sold to third-party processors.
Our operating properties comprise our five business segments for financial reporting purposes: the Greens Creek operating unit on Admiralty Island in Alaska, the Lucky Friday operating unit in Idaho, the Casa Berardi operating unit in Quebec, Canada, the San Sebastian operating unit in Durango, Mexico, and the Nevada Operations unit in northern Nevada. Since our operating mines are located in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, we believe they have low or relatively moderate political risk, and less economic risk than mines located in other parts of the world. Our exploration interests are also in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, and are primarily located in historical mining districts.
Our operating and strategic framework is based on expanding our production and locating and developing new resource potential. In 2020, we:
•
Continued our trend of improved safety performance, as we reduced our All Injury Frequency Rate by 24% to 1.22, the lowest level in our history and 46% below the U.S. national average for MSHA's "metal and nonmetal" category.
•
Mitigated the impacts of COVID-19 through early response and implementation of operational plans and procedures to protect our workforce, operations and communities while maintaining liquidity.
•
Reported sales of products of $691.9 million, which was the highest in our history despite the Lucky Friday unit only reaching full production in the fourth quarter of 2020.
•
Generated $180.8 million in net cash flows from operating activities. See the Financial Liquidity and Capital Resources section below for further discussion.
•
Refinanced our previously outstanding 2021 Senior Notes with issuance of our Senior Notes for total principal of $475 million due in 2028 and Notes issue to Investissement Québec for total principal of CAD$48.2 million due in 2025. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for more information on our debt arrangements.
•
Produced the most silver at our Greens Creek unit since obtaining 100% ownership of it in 2008 due to high grades and consistent ore throughput.
•
Returned to full production levels at Lucky Friday following a strike which ended in early January 2020.
•
Made capital expenditures (including lease additions and other non-cash items) of approximately $99.9 million, including $40.9 million at Casa Berardi, $28.8 million at Greens Creek, $25.7 million at Lucky Friday, $4.0 million at Nevada Operations and $0.5 million at San Sebastian.
•
Performed exploration and pre-development activities at our land packages in Alaska, Idaho, Nevada, British Columbia, Quebec and Mexico.
•
Achieved the above while increasing our cash balance to $129.8 million, which was $67.4 million higher compared to December 31, 2019, with no amount drawn on our revolving credit facility, as of December 31, 2020.
Our average realized silver and gold prices increased, while lead and zinc prices decreased, in 2020 compared to 2019. Average realized prices for silver and gold were higher, with prices for lead and zinc lower, in 2019 compared to their annual averages in 2018. See the Results of Operations section below for information on our average realized metal prices for 2020, 2019 and 2018. Lead and zinc represent important by-products at our Greens Creek and Lucky Friday segments, and gold is also a significant by-product at Greens Creek and San Sebastian.
See the Results of Operations section below for a discussion of the factors impacting income applicable to common stockholders for the three years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Key Issues
We intend to achieve our long-term objective of generating financial returns, improving operating performance, and expanding our proven and probable reserves by operating, developing and acquiring long-lived, low-cost mines with large land positions in politically stable jurisdictions. Our strategic plan requires that we manage multiple challenges and risks inherent in conducting mining, development, exploration and metal sales at multiple locations.
One such risk involves metals prices, over which we have no control except, on a limited basis, through the use of derivative contracts. As discussed in the Critical Accounting Estimates section below, metals prices are influenced by a number of factors beyond our control. While we believe global economic and industrial trends could result in continued demand for the metals we produce, prices have been volatile and there can be no assurance that current prices will continue.
Volatility in global financial markets poses a significant challenge to our ability to access credit and equity markets, should we need to do so, and to predict sales prices for our products. We utilize forward contracts to manage exposure to declines in the prices of (i) silver, gold, zinc and lead contained in our concentrates that have been shipped but have not yet settled, and (ii) zinc and lead that we forecast for future concentrate shipments. We have also utilized put option contracts to manage exposure to declines in the prices of silver and gold in our forecasted future sales of those metals. In addition, we have $129.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and a $250 million revolving credit agreement, of which $20.3 million was used as of December 31, 2020 for letters of credit, leaving approximately $229.7 million available for borrowing.
The COVID-19 outbreak impacted our operations in 2020, including adversely impacting our expected production of gold at Casa Berardi and exploration drilling at Greens Creek. In addition, we incurred additional costs of approximately $2.3 million in 2020 related to quarantining employees at Greens Creek, which started in late March 2020. See each segment section below for information on how those operations have been impacted by COVID-19. To mitigate the impact of COVID-19, we have taken precautionary measures, including implementing operational plans and practices and increasing our cash reserves. As long as they are required, the operational practices implemented could continue to have an adverse impact on our operating results due to additional costs or deferred production and revenues. There is uncertainty related to the potential additional impacts COVID-19 and any subsequent variants could have on our operations and financial results for 2021. See Part II, Item IA. Risk Factors - Natural disasters, public health crises (including COVID-19), political crises, and other catastrophic events or other events outside of our control may materially and adversely affect our business or financial results and COVID-19 virus pandemic may heighten other risks for information on how restrictions related to COVID-19 have recently affected some of our operations.
We had total long-term debt as of December 31, 2020 of $507.2 million, comprised of (i) our Senior Notes having total principal of $475 million which are due in 2028 and bear interest at a rate of 7.25% per year and (ii) our Series 2020-A Senior Notes due July 9, 2025 (the “IQ Notes”) issued to Investissement Québec, a financing arm of the Québec government, which have total principal of CAD$48.2 million and bear interest at a rate of 6.515%. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our debt arrangements. As discussed in the Financial Liquidity and Capital Resources section below, we believe that we will be able to meet the obligations associated with the Senior Notes, IQ Notes and amounts drawn on our revolving credit facility in the future, if any; however, a number of factors could impact our ability to meet the debt obligations and fund our other projects. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - We have a substantial amount of debt that could impair our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our existing and future indebtedness.
We make our strategic plans in the context of significant uncertainty about future availability of ore to mine and process. To sustain operations, we must find new opportunities that require many years and substantial expenditures from discovery to production. We approach this challenge by investing in exploration and capital in districts with known mineralization. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the permits required to develop or otherwise move forward with exploration projects such as Rock Creek and Montanore. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Legal challenges could prevent the Rock Creek or Montanore projects from ever being developed.
We strive to achieve excellent mine safety and health performance. We seek to implement this goal by: training employees in safe work practices; establishing, following and improving safety standards; investigating accidents, incidents and losses to avoid recurrence; involving employees in the establishment of safety standards; and participating in the National Mining Association’s CORESafety program. We attempt to implement reasonable best practices with respect to mine safety and emergency preparedness. We work with the MSHA, the Commission of Labor Standards, Pay Equity and Occupational Health and Safety in Quebec, and the Mexico Ministry of Economy and Mining to address issues outlined in any investigations and inspections and continue to evaluate our safety practices. Achieving and maintaining compliance with regulations will be challenging and may increase our operating costs. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - We face substantial governmental regulation, including the Mine Safety and Health Act, various environmental laws and regulations and the 1872 Mining Law.
Another challenge for us is the risk associated with environmental litigation and ongoing reclamation activities. As described Item 1A. Risk Factors and in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, it is possible that our estimate of these liabilities (and our ability to estimate liabilities in general) may change in the future, affecting our strategic plans. We are involved in various environmental legal matters and the estimate of our environmental liabilities and liquidity needs, as well as our strategic plans, may be significantly impacted as a result of these matters or new matters that may arise. We strive to ensure that our activities are conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and attempt to resolve environmental litigation on terms as favorable to us as possible.
Reserve estimation is a major risk inherent in mining. Our reserve estimates, which underly (i) our mining and investment plans, (ii) the valuation of a significant portion of our long-term assets and (iii) depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, may change based on economic factors and actual production experience. Until ore is mined and processed, the volumes and grades of our reserves must be considered as estimates. Our reserves are depleted as we mine. Reserves can also change as a result of changes in economic and operating assumptions. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Our ore reserve estimates may be imprecise.
Consolidated Results of Operations
Sales of products by metal for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:
The fluctuations in sales for 2020 compared to 2019 and 2018 were primarily due to the following two factors:
•
Higher average realized silver and gold prices in 2020 were partially offset by lower average realized lead and zinc prices compared to 2019, and the same was true when comparing 2019 to 2018. These price variances are illustrated in the table below.
Average realized prices differ from average market prices primarily because concentrate sales are generally recorded as revenues at the time of shipment at forward prices for the estimated month of settlement, which differ from average market prices. Due to the time elapsed between shipment of concentrates and final settlement with customers, we must estimate the prices at which sales of our metals will be settled. Previously recorded sales are adjusted to estimated settlement metal prices each period through final settlement. For 2020, we recorded net positive price adjustments to provisional settlements of $8.0 million compared to net positive price adjustments to provisional settlements of $0.6 million in 2019 and net negative adjustments of $3.8 million in 2018. The price adjustments related to silver, gold, zinc and lead contained in our concentrate sales were largely offset by gains and losses on forward contracts for those metals for each year (see Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information). The gains and losses on these contracts are included in revenues and impact the realized prices for silver, gold, lead and zinc. Realized prices are calculated by dividing gross revenues for each metal (which include the price adjustments and gains and losses on the forward contracts discussed above) by the payable quantities of each metal included in products sold during the period.
•
Higher quantities of silver, lead and zinc sold, partially offset by lower gold quantities sold, in 2020 compared to 2019. Silver, gold. zinc and lead volumes were higher in 2019 compared to 2018. See The Greens Creek Segment, The Lucky Friday Segment, The Casa Berardi Segment, The San Sebastian Segment, and The Nevada Operations Segment sections below for more information on metals production and sales volumes at each of our operating segments. Total metals production and sales volumes for each period are shown in the following table:
The difference between what we report as "ounces/tons produced" and "payable ounces/tons sold" is attributable to the difference between the quantities of metals contained in our products versus the portion of those metals actually paid for by our customers according to the terms of our sales contracts. Differences can also arise from inventory changes incidental to shipping schedules, or variances in ore grades which impact the amount of metals contained in concentrates produced and sold.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we reported a loss applicable to common stockholders of $17.3 million compared to losses of $100.1 million and $27.1 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The following factors contributed to those differences:
•
Variances in gross profit (loss) at our operating units as follows (in millions):
See The Greens Creek Segment, The Lucky Friday Segment, The Casa Berardi Segment, The San Sebastian Segment, and The Nevada Operations Segment sections below.
•
Unrealized gains on investments of $10.3 million in 2020 compared to unrealized losses of $2.4 million in 2019 and $2.8 million in 2018 due to changes in the prices of shares in other publicly traded mining companies held by us.
•
Exploration and pre-development expense decreased to $18.3 million in 2020 from $19.1 million in 2019 and $40.6 million in 2018. Our activity in 2020 included a continuation of exploration work at our Greens Creek, San Sebastian, Casa Berardi and Nevada Operations units, but at lower spending levels. Pre-development expense was primarily related to advancement of our Montanore and Rock Creek projects.
•
Insignificant acquisition costs in 2020 and 2019 compared to $10.0 million in 2018 related to the acquisition of Klondex.
•
Research and development expense of $0.5 million in 2019 and $5.4 million in 2018 related to evaluation and development of technologies that would be new to our operations, with no research and development expense in 2020. The decrease in 2019 was due to capitalization and completion of fabrication of the remote vein miner.
•
Net foreign exchange loss of $4.6 million in 2020 compared to a loss of $8.2 million in 2019 and gain of $10.3 million in 2018 on translation of our monetary assets and liabilities at our Casa Berardi and San Sebastian units.
•
Loss on disposition of properties, plants, equipment, and mineral interests of $0.6 million and $4.6 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, compared to a gain of $2.8 million in 2018. The loss in 2019 was related to disposition of our interest in the Fayolle exploration project in Quebec.
•
In June 2020, we gifted 650,000 shares of our common stock valued at $2.0 million at the time of the gift to the Hecla Charitable Foundation (the "Foundation"), and recognized expense for that amount. The Foundation is a 501(c)(3) entity established in 2007 to provide grants and disburse funds for educational and charitable purposes to qualifying organizations in order to promote the social, environmental and economic sustainability and development of the communities where we have operations and activities.
•
Other operating expense of $8.9 million, $3.0 million and $1.6 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, with the increase in 2020 primarily due to costs for a project to identify and implement potential operational improvements at Casa Berardi.
•
Interest expense of $49.6 million, $48.4 million and $40.9 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The interest in 2020 was primarily related to our Senior Notes, and the interest in 2019 and 2018 was primarily related to our previously outstanding 2021 Notes (see Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Guarantor Subsidiaries below). The increase in 2020 was primarily due to (i) interest recognized on both the Senior Notes and 2021 Notes for an overlapping period of almost one month, as the Senior Notes were issued on February 19, 2020 and the 2021 Notes were redeemed on March 19, 2020, (ii) $1.7 million in unamortized initial purchaser discount on the 2021 Notes recognized as expense upon their redemption and (iii) higher interest related to amounts drawn on our revolving credit facility.
•
Ramp-up and suspension costs of $24.9 million in 2020 compared to $12.1 million in 2019 and $20.7 million in 2018, which included non-cash depreciation expense of $7.1 million, $4.3 million and $5.0 million, respectively. The increase in 2020 was due to (i) placement of the Midas and Hollister mines and Aurora mill in Nevada on care-and-maintenance and (ii) the temporary suspension of operations at Casa Berardi and San Sebastian in response to COVID-19, which lead to lower production at those operations, partially offset by (iii) lower ramp-up and suspension costs at Lucky Friday due to increased production there. The cost for 2018 included $1.1 million related to curtailment of production at the Midas mine, with the other costs for 2018 and all costs for 2019 related to suspension at the Lucky Friday mine resulting from the strike that ended in early January 2020. See The Lucky Friday Segment, The Nevada Operations Segment, The Casa Berardi Segment and The San Sebastian Segment sections below.
•
Net loss on metal derivative contracts of $22.1 million in 2020 compared to a net loss of $4.0 million in 2019 and gain of $40.3 million in 2018. During the third quarters of 2019 and 2018, we settled, prior to their maturity date, base metal forward contracts in a gain position for cash proceeds to us of approximately $6.7 million and $32.8 million, respectively, with no such settlements in 2020. These gains and losses are related to financially-settled forward contracts on forecasted production of zinc and lead (but not silver and gold) as part of a risk management program, and resulted from changes in zinc and lead prices during each period. From June 2019, we began utilizing put option contracts to provide a minimum price for our forecasted future gold and silver sales, resulting in net losses in 2020 and 2019of $9.3 million and $13.1 million. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
•
Income tax provision of $0.1 million in 2020 compared to a benefit of $24.1 million in 2019 and a benefit of $6.7 million in 2018. See Corporate Matters and Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
The Greens Creek Segment
(1)
A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization, the most comparable GAAP measure, can be found below in Reconciliation of Cost of Sales and Other Direct Production Costs and Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (GAAP) to Cash Cost, Before By-product Credits and Cash Cost, After By-product Credits (non-GAAP) and All-In Sustaining Cost, Before By-product Credits and All-In Sustaining Cost, After By-product Credits (non-GAAP). At Greens Creek, gold, zinc and lead are considered to be by-products of our silver production, and the values of those metals therefore offset operating costs within our calculations of Cash Cost and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce.
Restrictions imposed by the State of Alaska beginning in late March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the requirement for employees returning to Alaska to self-quarantine for 14 days (changed in June to 7 days), has caused us to revise the normal operating procedures and incur additional costs for staffing operations at Greens Creek. We incurred costs of approximately $2.3 million in 2020 related to quarantining employees at Greens Creek. These or other potential restrictions could have a material impact if they continue longer than anticipated or become broader.
The $22.7 million and $35.1 million increases in gross profit for 2020 compared to 2019 and 2018, respectively, were due to higher silver, zinc and lead sales volumes and higher average realized silver and gold prices, partially offset by lower gold volume and lower average realized zinc and lead prices. In addition, treatment charges expense for 2020 was 87% and 151% higher compared to 2019 and 2018, respectively, primarily due to unfavorable changes in smelter terms.
The increases in total production cost per ton in 2020 and 2019 compared to 2018 were due to higher costs for labor and equipment maintenance, with 2020 also impacted by COVID-19-related costs and lower mill throughput and 2019 impacted by higher costs for power and consumables. The lower mill throughput in 2020 was partially due to periods of mill downtime for (i) upgrades to mill components in November and (ii) an extreme rainfall event in early December which resulted in water handling issues and limited access caused by downed power lines and mudslides.
The chart below illustrates the factors contributing to the variances in Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, Per Silver Ounce for 2020 compared to 2019 and 2018:
The following table summarizes the components of Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce:
The following table summarizes the components of AISC, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce:
Both Cash Costs and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce were higher in 2020 compared to 2019 and 2018 primarily due to lower by-product credits, partially offset by higher silver production, and in the case of AISC, lower capital and exploration spending.
Mining, milling and other costs decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 and 2018 on a per-ounce basis due primarily to higher silver production resulting from increased silver grades.
Treatment costs per ounce for 2020 were higher compared to 2019 and 2018 due to unfavorable changes in smelter terms and higher silver prices and production. Treatment costs are impacted by silver production and price variances, as treatment costs include the value of silver not payable to us through the smelting and refining processes. The silver not payable to us is either recovered by the smelters through further processing or ultimately not recovered and included in the smelters' waste material. Treatment costs also include a price adjustment component that fluctuates with changes in base metal prices.
By-product credits per ounce were lower in 2020 compared to 2019 and 2018 due to lower zinc and lead prices, and higher silver production also reduced the credit per silver ounce.
The difference between what we report as "production" and "payable metal quantities sold" is attributable to the difference between the quantities of metals contained in our products versus the portion of those metals actually paid for by our customers according to the terms of our sales contracts. Differences can also arise from inventory changes incidental to shipping schedules, or variances in ore grades which impact the amount of metals contained in our products.
While revenue from zinc, lead and gold by-products is significant, we believe that identification of silver as the primary product of the Greens Creek unit is appropriate because:
•
silver has historically accounted for a higher proportion of revenue than any other metal and is expected to do so in the future;
•
we have historically presented Greens Creek as a producer primarily of silver, based on the original analysis that justified putting the project into production, and believe that consistency in disclosure is important to our investors regardless of the relationships of metals prices and production from year to year;
•
metallurgical treatment maximizes silver recovery;
•
the Greens Creek deposit is a massive sulfide deposit containing an unusually high proportion of silver; and
•
in most of its working areas, Greens Creek utilizes selective mining methods in which silver is the metal targeted for highest recovery.
Likewise, we believe the identification of gold, lead and zinc as by-product credits is appropriate because of their lower economic value compared to silver and due to the fact that silver is the primary product we intend to produce. In addition, we have not consistently received sufficient revenue from any single by-product metal to warrant classification of such as a co-product.
We periodically review our revenues to ensure that reporting of primary products and by-products is appropriate. Because we consider zinc, lead and gold to be by-products of our silver production, the values of these metals offset operating costs within our calculations of Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce.
The Lucky Friday Segment
(1)
A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization, the most comparable GAAP measure, can be found below in Reconciliation of Cost of Sales and Other Direct Production Costs and Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (GAAP) to Cash Cost, Before By-product Credits and Cash Cost, After By-product Credits (non-GAAP) and All-In Sustaining Cost, Before By-product Credits and All-In Sustaining Cost, After By-product Credits (non-GAAP). At Lucky Friday, lead and zinc are considered to be by-products of our silver production, and the values of those metals therefore offset operating costs within our calculations of Cash Cost and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce.
The increase in gross profit and production for 2020 compared to 2019 and 2018 was due to a ramp-up of operations leading up to a return to full production starting in the fourth quarter of 2020 following the strike by unionized employees that started in mid-March 2017 and ended in early January 2020, discussed further below.
The chart below illustrates the factors contributing to the variances in Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, Per Silver Ounce for the fourth quarter of 2020. Total production cost per ton, Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits per Silver Ounce are not presented for 2019 and 2018 and the first three quarters of 2020, as production was limited due to the strike and results are not comparable. The total production cost per ton, Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits per Silver Ounce amounts presented for 2020 are for activity for the fourth quarter only, and the results for that period may not be indicative of future operating results under full production.
The following table summarizes the components of Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce:
The following table summarizes the components of AISC, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce:
Similar to the Greens Creek segment, the difference between what we report as “production” and “payable metal quantities sold” is due essentially to the difference between the quantities of metals contained in the concentrates we produce versus the portion of those metals actually paid for by our customers according to the terms of our sales contracts. Differences can also arise from inventory changes incidental to the timing of concentrate shipments, or variances in ore grades which impact the amount of metals contained in concentrates produced and sold.
While value from lead and zinc is significant, we believe that identification of silver as the primary product of the Lucky Friday unit is appropriate because:
•
silver has historically accounted for a higher proportion of revenue than any other metal and is expected to do so in the future;
•
this mining district is long associated with silver production; and
•
selective mining methods target silver production.
Likewise, we believe the identification of lead and zinc as by-product credits is appropriate because of their low economic value compared to silver and due to the fact that silver is the primary product we intend to produce. In addition, we do not receive sufficient revenue from any single by-product metal to warrant classification of such as a co-product.
We periodically review our revenues to ensure that reporting of primary products and by-products is appropriate. Because we consider zinc and lead to be by-products of our silver production, the values of these metals offset operating costs within our calculations of Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce.
Many of the employees at our Lucky Friday unit are represented by a union, and the previous collective bargaining agreement with the union expired on April 30, 2016. The unionized employees were on strike from March 13, 2017 until January 7, 2020, when the union ratified a new collective bargaining agreement. Salaried personnel performed limited production and capital improvements from July 2017 until the end of the strike. Re-staffing of the mine commenced in the first quarter of 2020. We have substantially completed the re-staffing and ramp-up process, and the mine has returned to full production starting with the fourth quarter of 2020. Costs related to ramp-up activities totaled $8.0 million in 2020, and suspension-related costs during the strike in 2019 and 2018 totaled $12.1 million and $19.6 million, respectively, which include non-cash depreciation expense of $6.3 million, $4.3 million and $5.0 million, respectively, for those years, and are reported in a separate line item on our consolidated statements of operations. These ramp-up and suspension costs are excluded from the calculation of gross profit, total production cost per ton, Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce, when presented.
See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about a contingency related to ground water monitoring at the Lucky Friday mine in prior periods.
The Casa Berardi Segment
(1)
A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization, the most comparable GAAP measure, can be found below in Reconciliation of Cost of Sales and Other Direct Production Costs and Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (GAAP) to Cash Cost, Before By-product Credits and Cash Cost, After By-product Credits (non-GAAP) and All-In Sustaining Cost, Before By-product Credits and All-In Sustaining Cost, After By-product Credits (non-GAAP). At Casa Berardi, silver is considered to be a by-product of our gold production, and the value of silver therefore offsets operating costs within our calculations of Cash Cost and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce.
Gross profit increased in 2020 compared to 2019 due to higher average realized gold prices, partially offset by lower gold production and higher milling and administrative costs. Gross profit decreased in 2020 compared to 2018 primarily due to lower gold production, partially offset by higher gold prices. The decrease in gold volume in 2020 was primarily due to lower mill throughput, with lower ore grades also a factor when compared to 2018. The lower throughput was due to major mill maintenance activities that resulted in a longer period of mill down-time than anticipated and the impact of COVID-19 measures noted below. The higher milling costs resulted primarily from the maintenance activities and an increase in pre-crushing of open pit ore to aid in recovery, with the increase in administration costs resulting from COVID-19 mitigation. Gross profit (loss) for 2020 and 2019 was also impacted by stripping costs incurred on the EMCP pit extension, which was substantially complete in the fourth quarter of 2020. Gold production in 2020 was negatively impacted by approximately 11,700 ounces due to a government COVID-19-related order. In late March, the Government of Quebec ordered the mining industry to reduce to minimum operations as part of the fight against COVID-19, causing us to suspend our Casa Berardi operations from March 24 until April 15, 2020, when mining operations resumed. Production may continue to be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 mitigation practices in place until they are no longer required. Suspension-related costs totaling $1.6 million for the first half of 2020 are reported in a separate line item on our consolidated statements of operations and excluded from the calculations of cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization, total production cost per ton, and Cash Cost and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce.
The increases in total production cost per ton in 2020 and 2019 compared to 2018 were primarily due to inclusion of stripping costs for the EMCP pit extension in 2020 and 2019, with 2020 also impacted by lower mill throughput.
The chart below illustrates the factors contributing to Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, Per Gold Ounce for 2020, 2019 and 2018:
The following table summarizes the components of Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce:
The following table summarizes the components of AISC, After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce:
The increase in both Cash Cost and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce for 2020 compared to 2019 and 2018 was due to lower gold production, partially offset, in the case of AISC, by lower sustaining capital and exploration spending.
The difference between what we report as "production" and "payable metal quantities sold" is mainly attributable to inventory changes incidental to the timing of sales of refined metals and shipping schedules.
We believe the identification of silver as a by-product credit is appropriate at Casa Berardi because of its lower economic value compared to gold and due to the fact that gold is the primary product we intend to produce there. In addition, we do not receive sufficient revenue from silver at Casa Berardi to warrant classification of such as a co-product. Because we consider silver to be a by-product of our gold production at Casa Berardi, the value of silver offsets operating costs within our calculations of Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce.
The San Sebastian Segment

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization, the most comparable GAAP measure, can be found below in Reconciliation of Cost of Sales and Other Direct Production Costs and Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (GAAP) to Cash Cost, Before By-product Credits and Cash Cost, After By-product Credits (non-GAAP) and All-In Sustaining Cost, Before By-product Credits and All-In Sustaining Cost, After By-product Credits (non-GAAP). At San Sebastian, gold is considered to be a by-product of our silver production, and the value of gold therefore offsets operating costs within our calculations of Cash Cost and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce.
Mining at San Sebastian was completed in the third quarter, and milling was completed in the fourth quarter of 2020, with exploration and evaluation activities ongoing.
The increases in gross profit in 2020 compared to 2019 and 2018 were due to higher silver and gold prices and lower production costs, partially offset by lower silver and gold production due to lower ore throughput and grades.
The reduction in total production cost per ton in 2020 was due to lower contractor costs, partially offset by lower tonnage.
The chart below illustrates the factors contributing to Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, Per Silver Ounce for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:
The following table summarizes the components of Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce:
The following table summarizes the components of AISC, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce:
The decrease in Cash Cost and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce in 2020 compared to 2019 and 2018 was primarily due to lower mining costs and higher by-product credits on a per-ounce basis due to higher gold prices, partially offset by lower silver production. The decrease in AISC, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce, was also attributable to lower capital and exploration spending.
The difference between what we report as "production" and "payable metal quantities sold" is mainly attributable to inventory changes incidental to the timing of sales of refined metals and shipping schedules.
We believe the identification of gold as a by-product credit is appropriate at San Sebastian because of its anticipated lower economic value compared to silver over the life of the mine. In addition, we do not receive sufficient revenue from gold at San Sebastian to warrant classification of such as a co-product. We periodically review our revenues to ensure that reporting of primary products and by-products is appropriate. Because we consider gold to be a by-product of our silver production at San Sebastian, the value of gold offsets operating costs within our calculations of Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce.
In early April 2020, the Government of Mexico issued an order to the mining industry to reduce operations to a minimum level until April 30 in response to COVID-19, and the order was subsequently extended until May 30, 2020. Our operations at San Sebastian were suspended during that time. Suspension-related costs totaling $1.8 million for 2020 are reported in a separate line item on our consolidated statements of operations and excluded from the calculations of cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization, total production cost per ton, and Cash Cost and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce.
The Nevada Operations Segment
On July 20, 2018, we completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Klondex for total consideration of $413.9 million. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. The acquisition gives us 100% ownership of the Fire Creek, Midas and Hollister mines, where gold is the primary metal produced, the Midas and Aurora mills, and interests in various gold exploration properties, all located in Nevada. The tabular information below reflects our ownership of the Nevada Operations commencing on July 20, 2018.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization, the most comparable GAAP measure, can be found below in Reconciliation of Cost of Sales and Other Direct Production Costs and Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (GAAP) to Cash Cost, Before By-product Credits and Cash Cost, After By-product Credits (non-GAAP) and All-In Sustaining Cost, Before By-product Credits and All-In Sustaining Cost, After By-product Credits (non-GAAP). At Nevada Operations, silver is considered to be a by-product of our gold production, and the value of silver therefore offsets operating costs within our calculations of Cash Cost and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce.
The higher gross profit in 2020 compared to 2019 and 2018 is primarily the result of higher gold prices and reduced production costs. In addition, cost of sales and other direct production costs for 2020 included write-downs totaling approximately $1.5 million of the values of stockpile, in-process and finished goods inventory to their net realizable value, compared to write-downs of $37.1 million in 2019 and $8.2 million for the period from July 20 to December 31, 2018. The write-downs in 2019 and 2018 were primarily attributed to development costs incurred at the Fire Creek mine, which ceased in the second quarter of 2019 when the decision was made to limit near-term production to areas of the mine where development was already completed.
During the second half of 2020, all ore mined at Nevada Operations was stockpiled, with no ore milled and no production reported during the period. Mining of non-refractory ore at Fire Creek in areas where development has already been performed was completed in the fourth quarter of 2020. As discussed below, we have mined and stockpiled a bulk sample of refractory ore for processing at a third-party facility, and transporting of the stockpiled ore to the third-party facility started in the fourth quarter of 2020. The results from the bulk sample test are expected in the first quarter of 2021.
The increase in total production cost per ton in 2020 is primarily due to lower tonnage.
The chart below illustrates the factors contributing to Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, Per Gold Ounce for 2020, 2019 and 2018:
The following table summarizes the components of Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce:
The following table summarizes the components of AISC, After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce:
The decrease in Cash Cost and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce in 2020 compared to 2019 and 2018 was a result of higher ore grades, with the decrease in AISC After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce also attributed to lower exploration and capital spending.
We believe the identification of silver as a by-product credit is appropriate at the Nevada Operations because of its lower economic value compared to gold and due to the fact that gold is the primary product we intend to produce there. In addition, we do not receive sufficient revenue from silver at the Nevada Operations to warrant classification of such as a co-product. Because we consider silver to be a by-product of our gold production at the Nevada Operations, the value of silver offsets operating costs within our calculations of Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce.
Activities since our acquisition of the Nevada Operations have included underground development and rehabilitation at the Fire Creek mine, construction of a new tailings dam, installation of a carbon-in-leach circuit in order to improve recoveries at the Midas mill, where ore from each of the mines has been processed, and start of development of a new drift to the Hatter Graben area at Hollister.
A review of our Nevada operations, including the relevant carrying value of our long-term assets there, was conducted during the second quarter of 2019 to address poor operational performance since acquisition. The review led to a plan to limit near-term mining at Fire Creek and temporarily suspend production and development of the Hatter Graben project adjacent to Hollister and resulted in lower subsequent production and capitalized development costs. Production at the Midas mine and Aurora mill was also suspended in late 2019. Suspension-related costs totaling $13.5 million in 2020, including non-cash depreciation expense of $5.6 million, are reported in a separate line item on our consolidated statements of operations and excluded from the calculations of cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization, total production cost per ton, and Cash Cost and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce.
There were no subsequent events or changes in circumstances during the latter half of 2019 or 2020 that indicated the carrying value of our long-term assets in Nevada was not recoverable as of December 31, 2020. We have entered into a third-party ore processing arrangement for a bulk sample of refractory ore. Mining of the bulk sample material commenced in the second quarter of 2020, with costs for mining the material totaling $7.7 million, along with $11.5 million for costs related to mining non-refractory ore, included in stockpiled ore inventory as of December 31, 2020. The bulk test demonstrated that larger scale, more productive mining methods could be applied successfully to this material. The bulk test refractory ore is being processed by a third party through a tolling agreement. While the processing is not yet complete, the recovery information to date is following the grade-recovery curve established through bench testing. Metal prices increased significantly since the tolling agreement was signed, and it is no longer attractive for the third party to displace their own feed to toll. Discussions are underway with another processor. The carrying value of our properties, plants, equipment and mineral interests in Nevada as of December 31, 2020 was $474.3 million, of which $382.2 million related to value beyond proven and probable reserves.
Corporate Matters
Employee Benefit Plans
Our defined benefit pension plans provide a significant benefit to our employees, but represent a significant liability to us. During 2020, the underfunded status of our plans changed from a liability of $56.8 million at the first of the year to a liability of $44.9 million at the end of the year. The decreased liability was attributable to contributions to the plans and returns on plan assets that, combined, exceeded service costs and interest costs, collectively. During 2020, we contributed a total of approximately $16.0 million in shares of our common stock, and contributed $6.0 million in cash, to the plans. We do not expect to be required to contribute to our defined benefit plans in 2021, but we may choose to do so. In January 2021, we contributed $16.8 million in shares of our common stock to the supplemental executive retirement plan, and expect to contribute another $0.8 million in cash in 2021. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. While the economic variables which will determine future cash requirements are uncertain, we expect contributions to increase in future years under current plan provisions, and we periodically examine the plans for affordability and competitiveness.
Income Taxes
Each reporting period we assess our deferred tax balance based on a review of long-range forecasts and quarterly activity. In 2018, through the acquisition of Klondex Mines Ltd., we acquired the Nevada U.S. Group that did not join the Hecla U.S. tax group. We recognized a full valuation allowance on our separate Hecla U.S. net deferred tax assets at the end of 2017 based on results of tax law changes and maintain a full valuation allowance on Hecla U.S. net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2020.
Our net U.S. deferred tax liability for the Nevada U.S. Group at December 31, 2020 was $33.9 million compared to the $38.3 million net deferred tax liability at December 31, 2019. The $4.4 million decrease is for current period activity in Nevada. The deferred tax liability is primarily related to the excess of the carrying value of the mineral resource assets over the tax bases of those assets for U.S. tax reporting.
Our net Canadian deferred tax liability at December 31, 2020 was $98.6 million, a decrease of $1.3 million from the $99.9 million net deferred tax liability at December 31, 2019. The decrease was due to current period activity and the impact of weakening of the CAD relative to the USD on remeasurement of the deferred tax liability balance. The deferred tax liability is primarily related to the excess of the carrying value of the mineral resource assets over the tax bases of those assets for Canadian tax reporting.
Our Mexican net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2020 was $2.9 million, a decrease of $0.6 million from the net deferred tax asset of $3.5 million at December 31, 2019. A $2.1 million valuation allowance remains on deferred tax assets in Mexico.
As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("TCJ Act") enacted in December 2017, our remaining Alternative Minimum Tax ("AMT") credit carryforward of $11.4 million became partially refundable through 2020 and fully refundable in 2021. State and Federal AMT refunds of $0.8 million and $10.0 million were received in 2019 and 2020, respectively, leaving a net AMT state credit receivable of $0.6 million as of December 31, 2020. In March 2020, the U.S. government passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, which allowed companies to claim immediate refunds of AMT credits. As a result, the remaining $0.6 million AMT state credit is classified as a current receivable as of December 31, 2020.
As discussed in Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, our effective tax rate for 2020 was (1)% compared to 19% for 2019. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions. The overall effective tax rate will continue to be dependent upon the geographic distribution of our earnings in different jurisdictions, the U.S. deduction for percentage depletion, and fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates. As a result, the 2021 effective tax rate could vary significantly from that of 2020. The other relevant provisions of the TCJ Act that became effective in 2018 consist of global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) tax and base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT); however, these provisions have not materially impacted us.
Reconciliation of Cost of Sales and Other Direct Production Costs and Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (GAAP) to Cash Cost, Before By-product Credits and Cash Cost, After By-product Credits (non-GAAP) and All-In Sustaining Cost, Before By-product Credits and All-In Sustaining Cost, After By-product Credits (non-GAAP)
The tables below present reconciliations between the most comparable GAAP measure of cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization to the non-GAAP measures of (i) Cash Cost, Before By-product Credits, (ii) Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, (iii) AISC, Before By-product Credits and (iv) AISC, After By-product Credits for our operations at the Greens Creek, Lucky Friday, San Sebastian, Casa Berardi and Nevada Operations units and for the Company for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Ounce are measures developed by precious metals companies (including the Silver Institute and the World Gold Council) in an effort to provide a uniform standard for comparison purposes. There can be no assurance, however, that these non-GAAP measures as we report them are the same as those reported by other mining companies.
Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce is an important operating statistic that we utilize to measure each mine's operating performance. We use AISC, After By-product Credits, per Ounce as a measure of our mines' net cash flow after costs for exploration, pre-development, reclamation, and sustaining capital. This is similar to the Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce non-GAAP measure we report, but also includes on-site exploration, reclamation, and sustaining capital costs. Current GAAP measures used in the mining industry, such as cost of goods sold, do not capture all the expenditures incurred to discover, develop and sustain silver and gold production. Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Ounce also allow us to benchmark the performance of each of our mines versus those of our competitors. As a silver and gold mining company, we also use these statistics on an aggregate basis, aggregating the Greens Creek, Lucky Friday and San Sebastian mines, to compare our performance with that of other silver mining companies, and aggregating Casa Berardi and Nevada Operations for comparison with other gold mining companies. Similarly, these statistics are useful in identifying acquisition and investment opportunities as they provide a common tool for measuring the financial performance of other mines with varying geologic, metallurgical and operating characteristics.
Cash Cost, Before By-product Credits and AISC, Before By-product Credits include all direct and indirect operating cash costs related directly to the physical activities of producing metals, including mining, processing and other plant costs, third-party refining expense, on-site general and administrative costs, royalties and mining production taxes. AISC, Before By-product Credits for each mine also includes on-site exploration, reclamation, and sustaining capital costs. AISC, Before By-product Credits for our consolidated silver properties also includes corporate costs for general and administrative expense, exploration and sustaining capital projects. By-product credits include revenues earned from all metals other than the primary metal produced at each unit. As depicted in the tables below, by-product credits comprise an essential element of our silver unit cost structure, distinguishing our silver operations due to the polymetallic nature of their orebodies.
In addition to the uses described above, Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Ounce provide management and investors an indication of operating cash flow and net cash flow, respectively, after consideration of the average price received from production. We also use these measurements for the comparative monitoring of performance of our mining operations period-to-period from a cash flow perspective.
The Casa Berardi, Nevada Operations and combined gold properties information below reports Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Ounce for the production of gold, their primary product, and by-product revenues earned from silver, which is a by-product at Casa Berardi and the Nevada Operations. Only costs and ounces produced relating to units with the same primary product are combined to represent Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Ounce. Thus, the gold produced at our Casa Berardi and Nevada Operations units is not included as a by-product credit when calculating Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce for the total of Greens Creek, Lucky Friday and San Sebastian, our combined silver properties. Similarly, the silver produced at our other three units is not included as a by-product credit when calculating the gold metrics for Casa Berardi and the Nevada Operations. As depicted in the tables below, by-product credits from the silver production at our primary gold properties comprise an element of our gold unit cost structure.
(1)
Excludes the discretionary portion of general and administrative costs for Greens Creek, Casa Berardi, Lucky Friday and corporate of $0.6 million, $0.4 million, $0.1 million and $1.8 million, respectively, for 2020.
(2)
Includes all direct and indirect operating costs related to the physical activities of producing metals, including mining, processing and other plant costs, third-party refining and marketing expense, non-discretionary on-site general and administrative costs, royalties and mining production taxes, before by-product revenues earned from all metals other than the primary metal produced at each unit. AISC, Before By-product Credits also includes on-site exploration, reclamation, and sustaining capital costs.
(3)
The unionized employees at Lucky Friday were on strike from March 2017 until January 2020, and production at Lucky Friday had been limited from the start of the strike until the ramp-up was substantially completed in the fourth quarter of 2020. Costs related to ramp-up activities totaling approximately $8.0 million in 2020, and suspension-related costs totaling approximately $12.1 million and $19.6 million during the strike in 2019 and 2018, respectively, which include $6.3 million, $4.3 million and $5.0 million, respectively, in non-cash depreciation expense for those periods, have been excluded from the calculations of cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization, Cash Cost, Before By-product Credits, Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, AISC, Before By-product Credits, and AISC, After By-product Credits.
(4)
In early April 2020, the Government of Mexico issued an order to the mining industry to reduce operations to a minimum level until April 30 in response to COVID-19, and the order was subsequently extended until May 30. Our operations at San Sebastian were suspended during that time. Suspension-related costs totaling $1.8 million for 2020 are reported in a separate line item on our consolidated statements of operations and excluded from the calculations of cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization, mining and milling cost per ton, and Cash Cost and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce.
(5)
AISC, Before By-product Credits for our consolidated silver properties includes non-discretionary corporate costs for general and administrative expense, exploration and sustaining capital.
(6)
In late March 2020, the Government of Quebec ordered the mining industry to reduce to minimum operations as part of the fight against COVID-19, causing us to suspend our Casa Berardi operations from March 24 until April 15, when mining operations resumed, resulting in reduced mill throughput. Suspension-related costs totaling $1.6 million for 2020 are reported in a separate line item on our consolidated statements of operations and excluded from the calculations of cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization and Cash Cost and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce.
(7)
Production was suspended at the Hollister mine in the third quarter of 2019 and at the Midas mine and Aurora mill in late 2019. Suspension-related costs at Hollister, Midas and Aurora totaling $13.5 million for 2020 are reported in a separate line item on our consolidated statements of operations and excluded from the calculations of cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization and Cash Cost and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce. During the second half of 2020, all ore mined at Nevada Operations was stockpiled, with no ore milled and no production reported during the period. As a result, costs incurred at Nevada Operations during the second half of 2020 were excluded from the calculations of Cash Cost and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce.
(8)
The Nevada Operations were acquired on July 20, 2018 as a result of the acquisition of Klondex (see Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for more information).
Reconciliation of Net (Loss) Income (GAAP) to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (non-GAAP)
The non-GAAP measure of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("EBITDA") is calculated as net (loss) income before the following items: interest expense, income tax provision (benefit), and depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense. Management believes that, when presented in conjunction with net loss (income), the most comparable GAAP measure, EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance. The table below presents reconciliations between the non-GAAP measure of EBITDA and the GAAP measure of net (loss) income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, and 2016 (in thousands).
Financial Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity overview
We have a disciplined cash management strategy of maintaining financial flexibility to execute our capital priorities and provide long-term value to our shareholders. Consistent with that strategy, we aim to reduce our net debt and maintain sufficient liquidity to fund debt service costs, operations, capital development and exploration projects, while returning cash to stockholders through dividends and potential share repurchases.
At December 31, 2020, we had $129.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which $13.4 million was held in foreign subsidiaries' local currency denominated accounts readily convertible to U.S. dollars that, if repatriated, may be subject to withholding taxes. We expect that there would be no additional tax burden upon repatriation after considering the cash cost associated with the withholding taxes. We believe that our liquidity and capital resources from our U.S. operations are adequate to fund our U.S. operations and corporate activities.
On February 19, 2020, we completed an offering of Senior Notes in the total principal amount of US$475 million. The Senior Notes are due February 15, 2028 and bear interest at a rate of 7.25% per year from the most recent payment date to which interest has been paid or provided for. The net proceeds from the Senior Notes were used, along with cash on hand, to redeem, in March 2020, our previously-outstanding 2021 Notes having a principal balance of $506.5 million. Also, in July 2018 we entered into a new $250 million revolving credit facility. Interest is payable on amounts drawn from the revolving credit facility at a rate of between 2.25% and 4.00% over the London Interbank Offered Rate, or between 1.25% and 3.00% over an alternative base rate, with interest payable on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of each year. As a precaution due to uncertainties of the duration, severity and scope of the COVID-19 outbreak, we drew $210.0 million on the facility in the first quarter of 2020. We repaid the $210.0 million during the second and third quarters of 2020, with no amount outstanding as of December 31, 2020. In July 2020, we agreed to issue our IQ Notes for CAD$50 million (approximately USD$36.8 million at the time of the transaction) in aggregate principal, which mature in July 2025 and bear interest at a rate of 6.515% per year. The IQ Notes were issued at a premium of 103.65%, implying an effective annual yield of 5.74% and an aggregate principal amount to be repaid of CAD$48.2 million. The IQ Notes were issued in four equal installments of CAD$12.5 million in July, August, September and October 2020, with the first installment issued net of CAD$0.6 million in fees. The net proceeds from the IQ Notes are available for general corporate purposes, including for open market purchases of a portion of the Senior Notes and to pay for capital expenditures at our Casa Berardi unit. Under the note purchase agreement for the IQ Notes and subject to a force majeure event, we are required to invest, in the aggregate, CAD$100 million at the Casa Berardi unit and other exploration and development projects in Quebec over the four-year period commencing on July 9, 2020. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our debt arrangements.
On May 8, 2012, we announced that our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program. Under the program, we are authorized to repurchase up to 20 million shares of our outstanding common stock from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions, depending on prevailing market conditions and other factors. The repurchase program may be modified, suspended or discontinued by us at any time. Whether or not we engage in repurchases from time to time may depend on a variety of factors, including not only price and cash resources, but customary black-out restrictions, whether we are in possession of any material non-public information, limitations on share repurchases or cash usage that may be imposed by our credit agreement or in connection with issuances of securities, alternative uses for cash, applicable law, and other investment opportunities from time to time. As of December 31, 2020, 934,100 shares had been purchased in prior periods at an average price of $3.99 per share, leaving approximately 19.1 million shares that may yet be purchased under the program. The closing price of our common stock at February 16, 2021, was $6.13 per share.
Pursuant to our common stock dividend policy described in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, our board of directors declared and paid dividends on common stock totaling $8.6 million in 2020, $4.9 million in 2019, and $4.4 million in 2018. Our dividend policy has a silver-price-linked component which ties the amount of declared common stock dividends to our realized silver price for the preceding quarter. Another component of our common stock dividend policy anticipates paying an annual minimum dividend. In September 2020, we increased our minimum annual dividend from $0.01 per share to $0.015 per share and reduced the realized silver price threshold for the silver-price-linked component from $30 per ounce to $25 per ounce beginning with the third quarter of 2020, and declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.00875 per share of common stock. In the fourth quarter of 2020 the realized price of $25.16 exceeded the new threshold. As a result, on February 16, 2021, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.00875 per share of common stock, consisting of $0.005 per share for the silver price-linked component and $0.00375 for the minimum annual dividend component, payable in March 2021. The declaration and payment of dividends on common stock is at the sole discretion of our board of directors, and we cannot assure you that we will continue to declare and pay common stock dividends in the future.
We continue to address the COVID-19 outbreak and face uncertainty related to the potential additional impact it and any subsequent variants could have on our operations. It is possible that future restrictions at Casa Berardi, San Sebastian or Greens Creek (or at any other operation) could have an adverse impact on operations or financial results, including materially so, beyond 2020. We have taken precautionary measures to mitigate the impact of COVID-19, including implementing operational plans and practices and increasing our cash reserves through a temporary draw-down of our revolving credit facility, which has since been fully repaid. As long as they are required, the operational practices implemented could continue to have an adverse impact on our operating results due to deferred production and revenues or additional costs. If required, increasing or prolonged restrictions on our operations could require access to additional sources of liquidity, which may not be available to us. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Natural disasters, public health crises, political crises (including COVID-19), and other catastrophic events or other events outside of our control may materially and adversely affect our business or financial results and COVID-19 virus pandemic may heighten other risks for information on how restrictions related to COVID-19 have affected some of our operations.
We may defer some capital investment and/or exploration and pre-development activities, engage in asset sales or secure additional capital if necessary to maintain liquidity. We also may pursue additional acquisition opportunities, which could require additional equity issuances or other forms of financing. We cannot assure you that such financing will be available to us.
We believe as a result of our cash balances, the performance of our current and expected operations, current metals prices, proceeds from potential at-the-market sales of common stock, and availability of our revolving credit facility, we will be able to meet our obligations and other potential cash requirements during the next 12 months from the date of this report. Our obligations and other uses of cash may include, but are not limited to: debt service obligations related to the Senior Notes, IQ Notes and revolving credit facility (if amounts are drawn); care-and-maintenance and other costs related to addressing the impact of COVID-19 on our operations; capital expenditures at our operations; potential acquisitions of other mining companies or properties; regulatory matters; litigation; potential repurchases of our common stock under the program described above; and payment of dividends on common stock, if declared by our board of directors. We currently estimate that a total of approximately $110 million will be spent on capital expenditures, primarily for equipment, infrastructure, and development at our mines, in 2021. We also estimate that exploration and pre-development expenditures will total approximately $34.5 million in 2021. Our expenditures for these items and our related plans for 2021 may change based upon our financial position, metals prices, and other considerations. Our ability to fund the activities described above will depend on our operating performance, metals prices, our ability to estimate revenues and costs, sources of liquidity available to us, including the revolving credit facility, and other factors. A sustained downturn in metals prices, significant increase in operational or capital costs or other uses of cash, our inability to access the credit facility or the sources of liquidity discussed above, or other factors beyond our control could impact our plans. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - An extended decline in metals prices, an increase in operating or capital costs, mine accidents or closures, increasing regulatory obligations, or our inability to convert exploration potential to reserves may cause us to record write-downs, which could negatively impact our results of operations and We have a substantial amount of debt that could impair our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our existing and future indebtedness..
Our liquid assets include (in millions):
Cash and cash equivalents increased by $67.3 million in 2020, discussed below. Cash and cash equivalents held in foreign currencies represents balances in CAD and MXN, and increased by $1.2 million in 2020 resulting from an increase in CAD held. The value of current and non-current marketable equity securities increased by $13.1 million (see Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information).
Cash provided by operating activities increased by $59.9 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was due to higher income, adjusted for non-cash items, partially offset by the impact of working capital and other operating asset and liability changes. Income, adjusted for non-cash items, was higher by $47.6 million primarily due to higher gross profit, which was mainly a result of higher realized silver and gold prices and higher silver production, partially offset by lower realized lead and zinc prices and higher treatment charges. Working capital and other operating asset and liability changes resulted in a net cash increase of $22.4 million in 2020 compared to an increase in cash of $10.1 million in 2019. Significant variances in working capital changes between 2020 and 2019 resulted from lower accounts receivable, higher accounts payable, and higher accruals for incentive compensation and taxes, partially offset by higher product inventory.
Cash provided by operating activities increased by $26.7 million in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was due to working capital and other operating asset and liability changes that resulted in a net cash addition of $10.1 million in 2019 compared to a reduction in cash of $10.6 million in 2018. Significant variances in working capital changes between 2019 and 2018 resulted from lower product inventory and reduced payment of accrued incentive compensation in cash, partially offset by higher accounts receivable and lower accounts payable. In addition to the positive net working capital variance, income, adjusted for non-cash items, was higher by $6.0 million due to lower exploration spending and Lucky Friday suspension related costs, partially offset by lower gross profit (see The Greens Creek Segment, The Lucky Friday Segment, The Casa Berardi Segment, The San Sebastian Segment and The Nevada Operations Segment sections above) and lower cash proceeds from settlement of base metal derivative contracts prior to their maturity date.
Capital expenditures were $91.0 million in 2020, excluding non-cash lease additions of $9.1 million, which was $30.4 million lower than capital expenditures in 2019. The decrease was due to reduced spending at Nevada, Greens Creek and San Sebastian, partially offset by higher capital expenditures at Lucky Friday and Casa Berardi. We purchased marketable equity securities having a cost basis of $2.2 million and $0.4 million during 2020 and 2019, respectively, and sold marketable equity securities for proceeds of $1.8 million in 2019.
We had a cash outflow of $139.3 million for the acquisition of Klondex, net of the cash balance acquired, in July 2018, with no cash outflows for acquisitions in 2019. Capital expenditures were $121.4 million in 2019, excluding non-cash lease additions of $6.5 million, compared to $136.9 million, excluding $7.0 million in non-cash lease additions, in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to reduced spending at all of our operations with the exception of Nevada Operations. In 2018, we purchased bonds having maturities of greater than 90 days and less than 365 days with a cost basis of $31.2 million, and bonds valued at $64.9 million matured in 2018, with no such activity during 2019. We purchased marketable equity securities having a cost basis of $0.8 million in 2018. During 2018, we received $4.4 million in insurance proceeds related to the collapse of the mill building at the Troy mine in February 2017 due to snow.
During 2019 and 2018, we received $49.0 million and $6.7 million, respectively, in net proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock under our at-the-market common stock sales program, with no such sales of shares in 2020. In 2020, 2019 and 2018, we had aggregate draws of $210.0 million, $279.5 million and $71.0 million, respectively, on our revolving credit facility, with repayments of the same amounts in those years. In addition, in 2020 we received $469.5 million and $36.8 million in net proceeds from the issuance of our Senior Notes and IQ Notes, respectively, and had debt repayments of $506.5 million for redemption of our 2021 Notes. In 2018, we had additional borrowings of $30.8 million for the issuance of the RQ Notes in March 2018, which were repaid in 2019 through the issuance of shares of our common stock. In July 2018, we repaid the $35.0 million revolving credit facility balance assumed in the acquisition of Klondex. In 2020, 2019 and 2018, we paid cash dividends on our common stock of $8.6 million, $4.9 million and $4.4 million, respectively. We also paid cash dividends of $0.6 million on our Series B preferred stock during each of those years. We made payments on our finance leases of $6.0 million, $7.2 million, and $7.3 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. We also purchased shares of our common stock for $2.7 million, $2.2 million, and $2.7 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, as a result of our employees' election to utilize net share settlement to satisfy their tax withholding obligations related to incentive compensation paid in stock and vesting of restricted stock units. See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
Exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso resulted in a decrease in our cash balance of $1.1 million during 2020, an increase of $0.9 million during 2019 and a decrease of $1.5 million in 2018.
Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments
The table below presents our fixed, non-cancelable contractual obligations and commitments primarily related to our Senior Notes, IQ Notes, revolving credit facility, outstanding purchase orders, certain service contract commitments and lease arrangements as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands):
(1)
Consists of open purchase orders of approximately $2.0 million at the Greens Creek unit, $4.2 million at the Lucky Friday unit, $0.7 million at the Casa Berardi unit, and $0.5 million at the Nevada Operations unit.
(2)
As of December 31, 2020, we were committed to approximately $0.1 million in expenditures for various items.
(3)
We have a $250 million revolving credit agreement under which we are required to pay a standby fee of between 0.5625% and 1.00% per annum on undrawn amounts and interest of between 2.25% and 4.00% over the London Interbank Offered Rate or between 1.25% and 3.00% over an alternative base rate on drawn amounts under the revolving credit agreement. We had $20.3 million in letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2020. The amounts in the table above assume no additional amounts will be drawn in future periods, and include only the standby fee on the current undrawn balance. For more information on our credit facility, see Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
(4)
Includes scheduled finance lease payments of $15.6 million, $0.1 million, $0.7 million and $0.5 million (including interest), respectively, for equipment at our Greens Creek, Lucky Friday, Casa Berardi and Nevada Operations units. These leases have fixed payment terms and contain bargain purchase options at the end of the lease periods. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
(5)
We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business. Substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. Some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease arrangements.
(6)
We sponsor defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all U.S. employees and provide certain post-retirement benefits for qualifying retired employees, along with a supplemental executive retirement plan ("SERP"). These amounts represent our estimate of the future benefit payment requirements for the next 10 years for the SERP as of December 31, 2020. However, in January 2021, we contributed $16.8 million in shares of our common stock to the SERP in order to fund future benefit payments. We believe we will have future funding requirements related to our defined benefit plans and benefit payment obligations for the SERP beyond 10 years; however, such funding requirements are not fixed in nature and are difficult to estimate, as they involve significant assumptions. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
(7)
On February 19, 2020, we completed an offering of $475 million in aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes due February 15, 2028. The Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 7.25% per year from the original date of issuance or the most recent payment date to which interest has been paid or provided for. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing August 15, 2020. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
(8)
On July 9, 2020, we entered into a note purchase agreement pursuant to which we issued our IQ Notes for CAD$50 million (approximately USD$36.8 million at the time of the transaction) in aggregate principal. The IQ Notes were issued at a premium of 103.65%, or CAD$1.8 million, implying an effective annual yield of 5.74% and an aggregate principal amount to be repaid of CAD$48.2 million. The IQ Notes were issued in four equal installments of CAD$12.5 million on July 9, August 9, September 9 and October 9, 2020. The IQ Notes bear interest on amounts outstanding at a rate of 6.515% per year, payable on January 9 and July 9 of each year, commencing January 9, 2021. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
We record liabilities for costs associated with mine closure, reclamation of land and other environmental matters. At December 31, 2020, our liabilities for these matters totaled $116.0 million. Future expenditures related to closure, reclamation and environmental expenditures at our other sites are difficult to estimate, although we anticipate we will incur expenditures relating to these obligations over the next 30 years. For additional information relating to our environmental obligations, see Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors - Our environmental obligations may exceed the provisions we have made. As discussed in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we are involved in various other legal proceedings which may result in obligations in excess of provisions we have made.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
At December 31, 2020, we had no existing off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under SEC regulations, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As described in such Note 2, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Our estimates are based on our experience and our interpretation of economic, political, regulatory, and other factors that affect our business prospects. Actual results may differ significantly from our estimates.
We believe that our most critical accounting estimates are related to future metals prices; obligations for environmental, reclamation, and closure matters; mineral reserves; accounting for business combinations; and assumptions used in accounting for our pension plans, as they require us to make assumptions that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes in them are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our board of directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below. In addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed to be critical. However, changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements.
Future Metals Prices
Metals prices are key components in estimates that determine the valuation of some of our significant assets and liabilities, including properties, plants, equipment and mineral interests, deferred tax assets, and certain accounts receivable. Metals prices are also an important component in the estimation of reserves. As shown above in Item 1. - Business, metals prices have historically been volatile. Silver demand arises from investment demand, particularly in exchange-traded funds, industrial demand, and consumer demand. Gold demand arises primarily from investment and consumer demand. Investment demand for silver and gold can be influenced by several factors, including: the value of the U.S. dollar and other currencies, changing U.S. budget deficits, widening availability of exchange-traded funds, interest rate levels, the health of credit markets, and inflationary expectations. Uncertainty related to the political environment in the U.S., U.S. and global trading policies (including tariffs), a global economic recovery, recent uncertainty in China and from the current downturn and continued uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak and any subsequent variants, could result in continued investment demand for precious metals. Industrial demand for silver is closely linked to world Gross Domestic Product growth and industrial fabrication levels, as it is difficult to substitute for silver in industrial fabrication. Consumer demand is driven significantly by demand for jewelry and other retail products. We believe that long-term industrial and economic trends, including demand for metals to decarbonize the economy and urbanization and growth of the middle class in countries such as China and India, will result in continued consumer demand for silver and gold and industrial demand for silver. However, the global economy has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak, with the ultimate severity and duration of the downturn is unknown. There can be no assurance whether these trends will continue or how they will impact prices of the metals we produce. In the past, we have recorded impairments to our asset carrying value because of low prices, and we can offer no assurance that prices will either remain at their current levels or increase.
Processes supporting valuation of our assets and liabilities that are most significantly affected by prices include analysis of asset carrying values, depreciation, reserves, and deferred income taxes. On at least an annual basis - and more frequently if circumstances warrant - we examine our depreciation rates, reserve estimates, and the valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets. We examine the carrying values of our assets as changes in facts and circumstances warrant. In our evaluation of carrying values and deferred taxes, we apply several pricing views to our forecasting model, including current prices, analyst price estimates, forward-curve prices, and historical prices (see Mineral Reserves, below, regarding prices used for reserve estimates). Using applicable accounting guidance and our view of metals markets, we use the probability-weighted average of the various methods to determine whether the values of our assets are fairly stated, and to determine the level of valuation allowances, if any, on our deferred tax assets. In addition, estimates of future metals prices are used in the valuation of certain assets in the determination of the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions (see Business Combinations below).
Sales of concentrates sold directly to customers are recorded as revenues upon completion of the performance obligations and transfer of control of the product to the customer (generally at the time of shipment) using estimated forward metals prices for the estimated month of settlement. Due to the time elapsed between shipment of concentrates to the customer and final settlement with the customer, we must estimate the prices at which sales of our metals will be settled. Previously recorded sales and trade accounts receivable are adjusted to estimated settlement prices until final settlement by the customer. Changes in metals prices between shipment and final settlement result in changes to revenues and accounts receivable previously recorded upon shipment. As a result, our trade accounts receivable balances related to concentrate sales are subject to changes in metals prices until final settlement occurs. For more information, see Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
We utilize financially-settled forward and put option contracts to manage our exposure to changes in prices for silver, gold, zinc and lead. See
