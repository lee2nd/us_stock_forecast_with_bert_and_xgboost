Pending Acquisition of Kentucky Bancshares, Inc. and its subsidiary Kentucky Bank
Effective January 27, 2021, Bancorp executed a definitive Share Purchase Agreement (“agreement”), pursuant to which Bancorp will acquire all of the outstanding common stock of publicly traded Kentucky Bancshares, Inc. Kentucky Bancshares, Inc., headquartered in Paris, Kentucky, is the holding company for Kentucky Bank, which operates 19 branches throughout the following central Kentucky cities: Paris (Bourbon County), Cynthiana (Harrison County), Georgetown (Scott County), Lexington (Fayette County), Morehead (Rowan County), Nicholasville (Jessamine County), Richmond (Madison County), Sandy Hook (Elliott County), Versailles (Woodford County), Wilmore (Jessamine County) and Winchester (Clark County).
Under the terms of the Agreement, the Company will acquire all of outstanding common stock in a combined stock and cash transaction, resulting in a total consideration to Kentucky Bancshares existing shareholders of approximately $190 million. Bancorp will fund the cash payment portion of the acquisition through existing resources on-hand.
The acquisition is expected to close during second quarter of 2021, subject to customary regulatory approval and completion of customary closing conditions. As of December 31, 2020, Kentucky Bancshares, Inc. had approximately $1.2 billion in assets, $767 million in loans, $979 million in deposits and $114 million in tangible common equity. Kentucky Bancshares also maintains a Wealth Management and Trust Department with total assets under management of $258 million at December 31, 2020. The combined franchise will serve customers through 63 branches with total assets of approximately $5.8 billion, $4.3 billion in gross loans, $5.0 billion in deposits and over $4.1 billion in trust assets under management.
Acquisition of King Bancorp, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary King Southern Bank
In May 2019, Bancorp completed its acquisition of KSB for $28 million in cash. The acquisition expanded Bancorp’s market area into nearby Nelson County, Kentucky, and expanded the customer base in Louisville, Kentucky. At May 1, 2019, KSB reported approximately $192 million in total assets, approximately $164 million in loans, and approximately $126 million in deposits. As a result of the acquisition, goodwill totaling $12 million was recorded during the second quarter of 2019, with nominal recast adjustments posted during the third and fourth quarters of the same year.
As a result of the completion of the acquisition, Bancorp incurred pre-tax transaction charges totaling $1.3 million during the second quarter of 2019. Net income from the KSB acquisition was accretive to Bancorp’s overall operating results beginning with the third quarter of 2019. Effective March 31, 2020, management finalized the fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities in advance of the 12-month post acquisition date, as allowed by GAAP.
In connection with the acquisition, Bancorp became the 100% successor owner of KBST, an unconsolidated finance subsidiary. As permitted under the terms of KBST’s governing documents, Bancorp redeemed the TPS at the par amount of approximately $4 million in June 2019.
Issued but Not Yet Effective Accounting Standards Updates
For disclosure regarding the impact to Bancorp’s financial statements of issued-but-not-yet-effective ASUs, see the Footnote titled “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of Part II Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Bancorp’s consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods.
Management continually evaluates its accounting policies and estimates that it uses to prepare the consolidated financial statements. In general, management’s estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, accounting and regulatory guidance, and information obtained from independent third-party professionals. Actual results may differ from those estimates made by management.
Critical accounting policies are those that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of Bancorp’s financial condition and operating results and require management to make estimates that are difficult, subjective and complex. Most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies. Several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of the financial statements. These factors include, among other things, whether the estimates have a significant impact on the financial statements, the nature of the estimates, the ability to readily validate the estimates with other information including independent third parties or available pricing, sensitivity of the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether alternative methods of accounting may be utilized under GAAP. Management has discussed each critical accounting policy and the methodology for the identification and determination of critical accounting policies with Bancorp’s Audit Committee. Effective January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, the significant accounting policy considered the most critical in preparing Bancorp’s consolidated financial statements is the determination of the ACL on loans.
Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Provision for Credit Losses
On January 1, 2020, Bancorp adopted ASC 326 “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses,” which created material changes to Bancorp’s existing critical accounting policy that existed at December 31, 2019.
The ACL on loans is established through credit loss expense charged to current earnings. The amount maintained in the ACL reflects management’s estimate of the net amount not expected to be collected on the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date over the life of the loan. The ACL is comprised of specific reserves assigned to certain loans that do not share general risk characteristics and general reserves on pools of loans that do share general risk characteristics. Factors contributing to the determination of specific reserves include the creditworthiness of the borrower and more specifically, changes in the expected future receipt of principal and interest payments and/or in the value of pledged collateral. A reserve is recorded when the carrying amount of the loan exceeds the discounted estimated cash flows using the loan’s initial effective interest rate, an expected loss ratio based on historical losses adjusted as appropriate for qualitative factors, or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral-dependent loans.
For purposes of establishing the general reserve, Bancorp stratifies the loan portfolio into homogeneous groups of loans that possess similar loss potential characteristics and calculates the net amount expected to be collected over the life of the loans to estimate the credit losses in the loan portfolio. Bancorp’s methodologies for estimating the ACL on loans consider available relevant information about the collectability of cash flows, including information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts.
Business Segment Overview
Bancorp is divided into two reportable segments: Commercial Banking and WM&T:
Commercial Banking provides a full range of loan and deposit products to individual consumers and businesses in all its markets through retail lending, mortgage banking, deposit services, online banking, mobile banking, private banking, commercial lending, treasury management services, merchant services, international banking, correspondent banking and other banking services. The Bank also offers securities brokerage services via its banking center network through an arrangement with a third party broker-dealer in the Commercial Banking segment.
WM&T provides investment management, company retirement plan management, retirement planning, trust, estate and financial planning services in all markets in which Bancorp operates. The magnitude of WM&T revenue distinguishes Bancorp from other community banks of similar asset size.
Overview - Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. and efforts to contain it have had a complex and significant adverse impact on the economy, the banking industry and Bancorp. The impact on future fiscal periods is subject to a high degree of uncertainty.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a global pandemic, indicating that almost all public commerce and related business activities must be, to varying degrees, curtailed with the goal of decreasing the rate of new infections. The spread of the virus has caused significant disruptions in the U.S. economy and has impacted banking and other financial activity in the markets in which Bancorp operates. While some industries have been impacted more severely than others, all businesses have been impacted to some degree. This disruption resulted in the initial shuttering of non-essential businesses across most of the country, significant job loss, and aggressive measures by the federal government. While phased-in re-opening of commerce that began towards the end of the second quarter has led to the easing of many initial restrictions, unemployment levels remain elevated and uncertainty regarding the effects of the pandemic on general economic behavior remains.
In response to the above, Congress, the President and regulatory agencies took action designed to lessen the economic fallout. Most notably, the CARES Act was signed into law at the end of March. The goal of the CARES Act was to prevent a severe economic downturn through various measures, including direct financial aid to American families and economic stimulus to impacted industry sectors.
The CARES Act established the SBA PPP to provide loans for eligible businesses/not-for-profits with the focus on job retention and assistance with certain operating expenses. Portions of these loans qualify for forgiveness when used for payroll costs, mortgage interest, rent and utilities during the 24-week period beginning with the date of the loan. Loans funded through the PPP are fully guaranteed by the U.S. government.
The first round of the PPP expired on August 8, 2020 and as of December 31, 2020, Bancorp had submitted 520 forgiveness applications to the SBA totaling $170 million and has received payment from the SBA for 333 borrowers. The SBA has 90 days to review and decision applications for forgiveness. On October 8, 2020, the SBA announced it would streamline loan forgiveness for loans of $50,000 or less with one or more employee other than the owner (representing approximately 48% of the PPP loans Bancorp originated). Bancorp has approximately $10.5 million in net unrecognized fees related to the PPP that would be recognized in income immediately once the loans are paid off or forgiven by the SBA. The timing of such forgiveness is expected to have a major impact on 2021 operating results.
Additional legislative stimulus action was signed into law at the end of December 2020 through the CAA, providing $900 billion in new COVID-19 stimulus relief as part of a broader government spending bill, including $284 billion for a second round of the PPP and an extension of the program to March 31, 2021. To qualify, borrowers must show a 25% decline in revenue over certain periods.
The program offers “second draw” loans targeted at hard-hit businesses that employ 300 or fewer employees and that have used or will use the full amount of their initial PPP loan. The maximum loan under this program is $2 million, based on two and a half months of average annual payroll (three and a half months for hotels and restaurants). The measurement period for the payroll can either be calendar year 2019 or the one year period before the date the “second draw” originates. For any loan up to $150,000, the covered loan amount will be forgiven once the borrower submits a one page forgiveness application detailing the loan amount, the number of employees retained, and the amount of the loan spent on payroll. This will substantially reduce the burden on both borrowers and lenders. The lender review will be limited to whether the lender received a complete application with all fields completed, initialed, or signed as applicable. If the submission is complete, the lender is required to accept it and forward to the SBA. Bancorp is projecting to book approximately 1,300 of these “second draw” PPP loans totaling $220 million.
The CARES Act permits financial institutions to suspend requirements under GAAP for loan modifications to borrowers affected by COVID-19 and is intended to provide interpretive guidance as to conditions that would constitute a short-term modification that would not meet the definition of a TDR. This includes the following: (i) the loan modification is made between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of December 31, 2020 or 60 days after the end of the coronavirus emergency declaration, and (ii) the applicable loan was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019. Bancorp is applying this guidance to qualifying loan modifications and has implemented modifications meeting these conditions. Federal bank regulatory authorities also issued guidance to encourage banks to make loan modifications for borrowers affected by COVID-19 and to assure banks that they would not be criticized by examiners for doing so.
While the emergency-use approval and distribution of the COVID-19 vaccination is a promising development, the duration of the pandemic and its continued effects on local, national and global economic activity will continue to weigh on Bancorp’s financial condition and results of operations in 2021and possibly beyond.
The PPP directly impacted Bancorp’s financial condition and results of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 as follows:
●
Bancorp originated approximately 3,400 PPP loans totaling $657 million, with the PPP portfolio (net of unearned deferred fees and costs) representing 16% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2020.
●
While the PPP was primarily offered to Bancorp’s customer base to limit fraud risk, Bancorp added approximately 300 new relationship prospects that have migrated over their full commercial banking relationships.
●
Bancorp received in excess of $20 million in origination fees from the SBA that will be recognized over the term of the loans (predominantly 24 months), with the fees ranging between 1% and 5% based on the size of the loan.
●
Approximately $13.6 million in interest and net fee income on PPP loans was recognized during the twelve month period ended December 31, 2020. While this had a positive impact on interest income and net interest income, the 1% stated yield on the PPP portfolio negatively impacted the overall loan portfolio yield and NIM.
●
Based on the 100% SBA guarantee of PPP loans, Bancorp did not reserve for potential losses within the ACL on these loans.
●
Bancorp experienced a significant increase in deposit balances (both average and ending) directly related to customers who originated PPP loans. The funding of the PPP loans was deposited into accounts held at the Bank and many Commercial customers have utilized the funds to strengthen their balance sheets.
●
A portion of Bancorp’s customer base paid down existing operating C&I lines of credit in part with excess liquidity resulting from PPP loans - primarily during the second quarter.
●
Bancorp relied on deposit growth in addition to excess cash on hand to fund PPP loans with no reliance placed on external funding sources. Maintaining excess liquidity related to the PPP loan portfolio contributed to overall NIM compression.
●
With regard to Bancorp’s compensation expense, the origination of PPP loans led to elevated levels of deferred salary costs with the offset to deferred loan fees, the latter of which is amortized over the outstanding term of the related loans.
●
Consistent with the decline in credit utilization and adoption of ASC-326, Bancorp incurred a significant increase in reserves for off-balance sheet credit exposures, which are recorded as a component of non-interest expenses.
●
Bancorp’s leverage ratio, which consists of tier-1 capital divided by adjusted quarterly average assets, was negatively impacted by the outsized balance sheet growth attributed to PPP participation and led to increased FDIC insurance expense in the second half of 2020. This will likely normalize over time. Bancorp and the Bank maintained the “well-capitalized” designation for every capital ratio, as defined by regulators, at December 31, 2020.
Other pandemic-related impacts to Bancorp’s financial condition and results of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 were as follows:
●
On March 16, 2020, the FRB responded to the pandemic by lowering the FFTR to a range of 0% - 0.25% resulting in Prime dropping to 3.25%.
●
Loan loss provisioning in 2020 has been significantly impacted by the economic crisis and corresponding impact on unemployment forecast adjustments within the CECL model.
●
Bancorp has deferred either the full loan payment or the principal only portion of respective loan payments for 90 or 180 days for some borrowers directly impacted by the pandemic. Through December 31, 2020, Bancorp executed approximately 1,200 full payment deferrals. As of December 31, 2020, outstanding loan deferrals totaled $37 million, representing 1.24% of the loan portfolio (excluding PPP loans). Approximately 85% of the total deferrals processed (in terms of dollars) occurred in the month of April, with the subsequent pace slowing significantly. Pursuant to the CARES Act, these loan deferrals were not classified as TDRs and have not been included in non-performing loan statistics. While the modifications themselves did not trigger a loan risk rating downgrade, if the impact of COVID-19 continues, borrower operations do not improve or if other negative events occur, such modified loans could transition to potential problem loans or into problem loans. During the third quarter, a significant portion of the deferred loan portfolio returned to full paying status.
●
Deposit balances for both commercial customers who received PPP funding and those that did not were elevated at December 31, 2020, as higher levels of liquidity were held in response to economic uncertainty.
●
Consistent with the industry, deposit service charges and debit/credit card income have been impacted by pandemic-driven changes in customer behavior. This led to, among other things, lower transaction volumes and spending behaviors during the initial phase of mandated shutdowns, with debit/credit card activity improving noticeably through the end of the year. While Bancorp also experienced a notable increase in deposit service charge income in the latter half of the year, the industry-wide decline in the volume of fees earned on overdrawn checking accounts experienced over the last several years is a trend that was significantly exacerbated by the pandemic. As such, Management is not able to predict when, or if, this revenue stream will return to pre-pandemic levels.
●
Bancorp did not incur material non-interest expenses related to the execution of its pandemic plan or continued efforts associated with employee and customer health and safety.
In tandem with the declaration of the global pandemic, Bancorp invoked its Board of Director-approved pandemic plan, which included timely communication to employees, implementing remote work arrangements to the full extent possible, separating individual departments, operating select branch lobbies by appointment only, fully staffing all branch drive-thru lanes, communicating with and encouraging customers to use Bancorp’s free self-service tools such as ITMs/ATMs, online banking, mobile banking and bill pay and actively promoting social distancing in all aspects of business.
Bancorp has maintained social distancing precautions for all employees in the office and customers visiting branches, preventative cleaning at offices/branches and restrictions on non-essential business related travel to the fullest extent possible and pursuant to guidance issued by the Centers for Disease Control and state and local authorities. Bancorp has implemented business continuity measures as necessary throughout the pandemic, including monitoring potential business interruptions.
Bancorp has taken measures both to support customers affected by the pandemic and to maintain strong asset quality, including:
●
Assisting business customers through PPP and other government sponsored loan products
●
Monitoring portfolio risk and related mitigation strategies by industry segments and concentrations
●
Limiting originations to higher risk industries and customers including, but not limited to, transportation, travel, hospitality, entertainment, and retail
●
Proactively contacting customers in order to assess credit situations and needs to develop long-term contingency financial plans
●
Offering flexible repayment options to current customers and a streamlined loan modification process, when appropriate
Management continues to meet to anticipate and respond to ongoing pandemic related developments. Bancorp has not incurred any significant challenges to its ability to maintain its systems and controls in light of the measures taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and has not incurred significant resource constraints through the implementation of its business continuity plans and does not anticipate incurring such in the future. Bancorp has not made, and at this time does not expect to make, any material staffing or compensation changes as a result of the pandemic.
Overview - Operating Results
The following table presents an overview Bancorp’s financial performance for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:
Additional discussion follows under the section titled “Results of Operations.”
General highlights for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019:
●
In 2020, Bancorp set the following financial records:
o
Total revenue, comprising net interest income FTE and non-interest income, of $187.8 million, surpassing the previous record of $174.8 million in 2019
o
Record loan production in 2020 (excluding PPP)
o
Total deposit growth of $855 million, surpassing the previous record of $340 million in 2019
o
WM&T AUM of $3.85 billion at December 31, 2020
o
WM&T services income of $23.4 million boosted by record new business generation and record historic market performance at December 31, 2020
o
Debit and credit card income of $8.5 million, supported by both growth in transaction volume and customer base
o
Despite a significant decline in pandemic related transaction volume, new product sales and customer base expansion (partially attributable to the PPP) boosted Treasury Management fees to a record $5.4 million
o
Mortgage banking income of $6.2 million, with loan originations surpassing $258 million
●
Net income totaled $58.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, resulting in diluted EPS of $2.59, a 10% decline from the prior year. The year ended December 31, 2019 included $3.9 million in non-recurring tax adjustments related to two Kentucky tax law changes that equated to $0.18 per diluted share in addition to significant acquisition deal costs, which equated to $0.05 per diluted share for 2019. Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2020 were lower compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased loan loss provisioning and reserves for off-balance sheet credit exposures. Further, the uncertain economic conditions associated with the pandemic, a substantially lower interest rate environment and government stimulus actions have had a significant impact on Bancorp’s operating results in 2020.
●
NIM decreased 43 bps to 3.39% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 3.82% for the prior year consistent with the decline in the interest rate environment, the addition of the low-yielding PPP portfolio and excess balance sheet liquidity; offset by strong average year over prior year loan growth (excluding PPP loans) and the strategic lowering of stated deposit interest rates and CD offering rates in tandem with FRB interest rate actions. Despite the decrease in NIM, Bancorp’s deposit rate cuts and fee income associated with PPP loans resulted in a $10.6 million, or 8%, increase in net interest income compared to the prior year.
●
Effective January 1, 2020, Bancorp began accounting for credit losses under ASC 326, or CECL. The adoption of this standard increased the opening balance of the ACL and the reserve for off-balance sheet credit exposures as of January 1. Initial adoption reduced Bancorp’s retained earnings with no corresponding impact on the income statement.
●
Total loans (excluding PPP loans) increased $136 million, or 5%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, as record first and fourth quarter loan production book-ended the largest quarterly loan balance contraction in the Company’s history during the second quarter and flat net loan activity in the third quarter
●
Line of credit utilization has declined significantly in 2020, falling to 38% at December 31, 2020 compared to 47% at December 31, 2019. The decline was led by C&I line usage, which dropped from 43% at December 31, 2019 to 28% at December 31, 2020, with a low point of 26% reached at September 30, 2020.
●
Deposit balances ended at record levels at December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of PPP funding and higher levels of liquidity held by customers attributable to current economic uncertainty.
●
Despite overall strong credit metrics, significant provisioning occurred based on the on-going economic crisis, its corresponding impact on unemployment forecast adjustments within the CECL model, the addition of a large specific reserve, qualitative factor adjustments and loan growth. Significant non-interest expense related to credit exposure for unfunded off-balance sheet commitments was also recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020 consistent with declines in line utilization (mainly C&I).
●
Bancorp’s ACL on loans to total loans was 1.47% at December 31, 2020, compared to 0.94% at December 31, 2019.
●
Bancorp’s ACL on loans to total loans (excluding PPP loans) rose to 1.74% at December 31, 2020.
●
Non-interest income increased 5% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year on the heels of record mortgage banking income despite substantially lower deposit service charge income and the prior year period benefitting from $1.4 million of non-recurring income. Strong WM&T results, which included a large estate fee in the first quarter of 2020, and continued growth in treasury management fees and card income also contributed to the increase.
●
Non-interest expenses increased 5% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period of 2019. Elevated tax credit amortization stemming from a large tax credit investment, CECL-related credit loss expense recorded for off-balance sheet exposures and continued investment in technology drove the increase despite declines associated with one-time acquisition-related charges and non-recurring activity in the prior year and pandemic-driven decreases in marketing and business development activity.
●
Bancorp’s efficiency ratio (FTE) for the year ended December 31, 2020 improved to 54.86% from 56.07% for the prior year, the latter of which included $1.3 million in one-time deal costs associated with the 2019 KSB acquisition.
●
The ETR increased to 13.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 12.7% for the same period in 2019, the latter of which benefitted from $3.9 million in non-recurring tax adjustments related to two Kentucky tax law changes.
Total stockholder’s equity to total assets was 9.56% as of December 31, 2020 compared to 10.91% at December 31, 2019, the decline driven by the outsized balance sheet growth attributed to PPP participation. Total equity increased $34.4 million in 2020, as net income of $58.9 million was offset by dividends declared of $24.5 million, changes in AOCI and various stock based compensation.
TCE is a measure of a company's capital which is useful in evaluating the quality and adequacy of capital. Bancorp’s ratio of TCE to total tangible assets was 9.28% as of December 31, 2020, compared with 10.55% at December 31, 2019, the decline driven by the significant balance sheet growth associated with PPP participation as noted above. See the section titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for reconcilement of non-GAAP to GAAP measures.

Card processing expenses trended upward consistent with revenue growth.
o
Employee benefit expense was elevated in 2019 consistent with higher 401(k) match and increased FICA expense.
o
Additional community support expense was recorded in 2019, as the Company increased its contribution to the Bank’s foundation, established to support various community initiatives, due to outstanding 2019 operating results.
o
In contrast to the above increases, no FDIC insurance expense was recorded for the third and fourth quarters of 2019, as the national FDIC Reserve Ratio reached the FDIC’s targeted level, triggering the FDIC to release credits to small institutions.
●
Bancorp's efficiency ratio, calculated on a FTE basis, for 2019 was 56.07% compared with 55.89% for the same period in 2018.
●

Bancorp’s ratio of TCE to total tangible assets was 10.55% as of December 31, 2019, compared with 11.05% at December 31, 2018, with the decline attributable to the second quarter 2019 KSB acquisition. See the section titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for reconcilement of non-GAAP to GAAP measures.
Challenges for 2021:
Bancorp has identified the following challenges for fiscal year 2021:
●
Bancorp expects to complete the merger of Kentucky Bancshares, Inc. in the second quarter of 2021. Acquisitions require integration of different corporate cultures, loan and deposit products, pricing strategies, data processing systems and other technologies, accounting, internal audit and financial reporting systems, operating systems and internal controls, and marketing programs and personnel. Bancorp will need to manage the transition effectively to maximize retention of Kentucky Bank’s customers and employees, integrate personnel and systems efficiently, and maximize anticipated economic benefits.
●
Operating results for 2020 were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which will continue to pose numerous challenges in 2021, such as stress on Bancorp’s borrower base and the impact of future unemployment forecast projections on the Company’s CECL model. Regulatory and legislative actions taken in response to the pandemic may temporarily mask potential problems, which could have a significant impact on future operating results.
●
Goals for fiscal year 2021 include continued net loan growth, excluding the PPP portfolio. This will be impacted by developments surrounding the on-going pandemic, competition, prevailing interest rates, economic conditions, line of credit utilization and loan prepayments. Bancorp believes there is continued opportunity for loan growth in all three of its markets in addition to the new central Kentucky market and Bancorp’s ability to deliver attractive loan growth over the long-term is linked to Bancorp’s overall success.
●
NIM compression in 2021 remains a concern, as market expectations are for the absolute low level of rates to be maintained for the foreseeable future. Based on its December 16, 2020 policy meeting, the FRB is projecting no rate increases until 2023. The PPP loan portfolio will also continue to affect loan yields and NIM as both the timing of forgiveness and further participation in the program will have an on-going impact on loan yields in 2021.
●
Ongoing pricing pressure/competition continues to pose challenges regarding further NIM compression.
●
Bancorp derives significant non-interest income from WM&T services. Most of these fees are based upon the market value of AUM at respective period ends. To continue growth of this income source, Bancorp must attract new customers and retain existing customers. Bancorp believes there is opportunity for growth in its three markets and expansion into Central Kentucky. Growth in market values of AUM and fees is dependent upon positive returns in the overall capital markets. Bancorp has no control over market volatility.
●
Technological advances are consistently providing opportunities for Bancorp to consider potential new products and delivery channels. Bancorp’s customers’ demand for innovative and relevant products and services is expected to trend along with changing technology. Bancorp will need to continue to make prudent investments in technology while managing associated risks so as to remain competitive with other financial service providers.
●
Over the past several years, Bancorp’s asset quality metrics have trended within a narrow range, exceeding benchmarks and reaching historically strong levels. Bancorp realizes that present asset quality metrics are positive and, recognizing the cyclical nature of the lending business, Bancorp anticipates this trend will likely normalize over time.
Results of Operations
Net Interest Income
As is the case with most banks, Bancorp’s primary revenue sources are net interest income and fee income from various financial services provided to customers. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on loans, investment securities and other interest earning assets less interest expense on deposit accounts and other interest bearing liabilities. Loan volume and interest rates earned on those loans are critical to overall profitability. Similarly, deposit volume is crucial to funding loans and rates paid on deposits directly impact profitability. New business volume is influenced by economic factors including market interest rates, business spending, consumer confidence and competitive conditions within the marketplace. The discussion that follows is based on fully tax-equivalent interest data.
Comparative information regarding net interest income follows:
NIM and net interest spread calculations above exclude the sold portion of certain participation loans, which totaled $10 million, $8 million and $10 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These sold loans are on Bancorp’s balance sheet as required by GAAP because Bancorp retains some form of effective control; however, Bancorp receives no interest income on the sold portion. These participation loans sold are excluded, because Bancorp believes it provides a more accurate depiction of the performance of its loan portfolio.
Prime rate, the five year Treasury note rate and the one month LIBOR are included in the table above to provide a general indication of the interest rate environment in which Bancorp has operated during the past three years. Approximately $1 billion, or 31%, of Bancorp’s loans are variable rate (37% excluding the PPP portfolio), of which 99% are indexed to either Prime or one month LIBOR and generally reprice as those rates change. At inception, most of Bancorp’s fixed rate loans are priced in relation to the five year Treasury note.
The interest rate environment has declined drastically over the three year period as referenced in the table above. Rising rates in 2018 drove the FFTR to a range of 2.25-2.50%, resulting in Prime rising to 5.50% by the end of that year, representing the highest interest rates experienced post-Great Recession. Since hitting those marks, the FRB has lowered the FFTR five times, resulting in a combined 225 bps decrease in the FFTR through December 31, 2020. The most recent of these cuts came in mid-March 2020 when the FRB lowered the FFTR to a range of 0% - 0.25% in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the lowest level since late 2015.
Discussion of 2020 vs 2019:
Net interest spread and NIM were 3.22% and 3.39% for 2020 compared to 3.50% and 3.82% for 2019. NIM was significantly impacted in 2020 by the following:
●
The FFTR was lowered 225 bps between July 2019 and mid-March 2020, resulting in Prime dropping to 3.25%. Average Prime declined significantly to 3.53% for 2020 compared to 5.29% for 2019.
●
Treasury yields remained near historic lows for several months in 2020, eroding NIM and loan yields.
●
PPP loan originations, which boosted net interest income, had a negative impact on NIM and loan yields.
●
The strategic lowering of stated deposit interest rates and CD offering rates over the past twelve months in tandem with FRB interest rate actions.
●
Strong average loan growth (excluding PPP loans).
●
Excess balance sheet liquidity and elevated deposit balances.
As previously stated, Bancorp originated approximately 3,400 PPP loans, equating to $637 million (net of origination fees and costs) during the second quarter of 2020. Bancorp received $19.5 million in net origination fees from the SBA and recognized $9.1 million in net origination fee income associated with the PPP portfolio in 2020. While this had a positive impact on interest and fee income as well as net interest income, the 1% stated yield on the PPP portfolio negatively impacted the overall loan portfolio yield by 17 bps and NIM by 3 bps. With a heavy concentration of these loans originating in April, the average balance of the PPP portfolio ended at $443 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 with a yield of 3.08%, which was significantly below the 4.34% yield on the traditional loan portfolio (excluding PPP loans) for the same period.
Average FFS and interest bearing due from bank balances increased significantly for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with the same period in 2019. Excess liquidity contributed to approximately 15 bps of NIM compression for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 9 bps for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Net interest income (FTE) increased $10.6 million, or 8%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period of 2019, primarily attributed to the deposit rate cuts implemented by Bancorp in response to the changing interest rate environment and the additional fee income associated with the PPP portfolio.
Total average interest earning assets increased $729 million, or 22%, to $4.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, with the average rate earned on total interest earning assets contracting 82 bps to 3.68%.
●
Average loans increased $602 million, or 22%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period of 2019 with $443 million of the average growth attributed to the PPP portfolio. In addition to the 2019 KSB acquisition, Bancorp has experienced strong organic growth across all three markets leading to a $160 million increase in average non-PPP loan portfolio balances.
●
Average FFS and interest bearing due from bank balances increased $93 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared with the same period of 2019, consistent with the elevated level of deposits.
Total interest income (FTE) was flat, down $32,000 to $148.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared with the same period of 2019 despite the drastic decline in the interest rate environment.
●
Interest and fee income on loans (FTE) increased approximately $3.3 million, or 2%, to $137.9 million, attributed mainly to fee income associated with the PPP portfolio, as significant interest rate contraction led to a $10.4 million decrease in interest income on the traditional loan portfolio (excluding PPP loans).
●
With the exception of mortgage loans held for sale, interest income on the remaining interest earning asset portfolio was significantly negatively impacted by the changes in the interest rate environment in addition to substantial average balance growth.
Total average interest bearing liabilities increased $353 million, or 16%, to $2.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared with the same period of 2019, with the average cost decreasing 54 bps to 0.46%.
●
Average interest bearing deposits increased $364 million, or 17%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period of 2019, with interest-bearing demand deposits representing $257 million of the increase. Some customers who received PPP loans, the proceeds for which were deposited into accounts held at the Bank, have utilized the funds to strengthen their balance sheets. Further, the economic slow-down and uncertainty surrounding the pandemic has resulted in the customer base maintaining higher levels of liquidity in general, similar to customer behavior seen during the Great Recession.
●
Average FHLB advances declined $9 million, or 13%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period of 2019, as matured advances were not replaced or renewed.
Total interest expense decreased $10.6 million, or 47%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period of 2019, a direct result of strategic deposit rate reductions implemented in response to the changing interest rate environment.
●
Total interest bearing deposit expense decreased $10.1 million, or 49%, driving a 54 bps decrease in the cost of average total interest bearing liabilities to 0.42% as deposit rates were cut in tandem with FRB interest rate actions.
●
FHLB advance expense decreased $240,000 or 15%, as matured advances were not replaced or renewed, resulting in lower interest expense.
Discussion of 2019 vs 2018:
During the third quarter of 2019, the FRB lowered the FFTR 25 bps twice; effective on August 1st and later during the quarter, effective September 19th. Effective October 31st, the FRB lowered the FFTR 25 bps once again with Prime ending at 4.75% as of December 31, 2019 compared to 5.50% at December 31, 2018.
In response to the August FFTR reduction, Bancorp immediately lowered the stated rate of most interest-bearing deposit account types, in addition to lowering all CD offering rates. With regard to the September FFTR reduction, Bancorp immediately lowered stated rates on most personal money market and larger sweep customers in addition to CD offering rates. Bancorp was able to fully offset the loss in revenue, with the first and second FFTR movements not impacting overall NIM. With the October 31st rate drop, the Bank lowered the stated rate of most interest-bearing deposit account types in addition to subsequently lowering all CD offering rates in early November. Unlike the previous two rate cuts by the FRB, the decline in loan yields associated with this cut was not fully offset by the reduction in deposit rates.
In the first half of 2018, Bancorp raised stated rates paid on money market accounts in addition to launching a targeted CD marketing campaign within its Louisville market to support loan growth and increase liquidity. The campaign generated over $100 million in CD growth in 2018. In addition, the deposit portfolio assumed from KSB in the second quarter of 2019 was concentrated in higher costing time deposits. While Bancorp had not aggressively pursued deposits since mid-2018, falling interest rates in 2019 drove an increase in non-interest bearing deposits.
In general, net interest income and NIM were favorably impacted by elevated loan prepayment fees collected in 2019 with a much lighter impact experienced in the prior year. Offsetting the fee impact, the KSB portfolio mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities added during 2019 had a slight negative impact on NIM.
Net interest spread (FTE) and NIM (FTE) were 3.50% and 3.82%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 3.60% and 3.83% for the same period in 2018. Net interest income (FTE) of $125.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $10.7 million, or 9%, from $114.9 million for the same period in 2018, led by growth in average interest earning assets, primarily loans. Total average earning assets increased $292 million, or 10%, to $3.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with the same period in 2018, with the average rate earned on earnings assets increasing 16 bps to 4.50%. Average loans increased $198 million, or 8%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018, with the KSB acquisition contributing $102 million, or 52% of the total average increase. The remaining increase stemmed from record annual organic loan production experienced across all markets. Average balances of FFS, interest bearing due from banks and AFS securities increased $91 million, or 19%, in total for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with 2018, as excess balance sheet liquidity was deployed into short-term investments.
Total interest income (FTE) increased $17.9 million, or 14%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with the same period in 2018, to $148.1 million. Approximately $15.8 million of this total increase related to loans (FTE), with the majority of this increase attributed to average balance growth.
Bancorp was successful in growing loans in 2019 despite elevated levels of commercial loan payoffs, resulting largely from construction and land development borrowers moving elsewhere for permanent financing or CRE loans for which collateral was sold. Loan growth during 2019 reflected ongoing expansion in key lending categories such as C&I and CRE owner-occupied lending.
Total average interest bearing liabilities increased $202 million, or 10%, to $2.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with the same period in 2018, with the average cost increasing 26 bps to 1.00%. Average interest bearing liabilities assumed in the KSB acquisition (deposits and FHLB advances) represented $78 million, or 39%, of the total increase. Average interest bearing deposits increased $237 million, or 12%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018, with approximately $58 million attributable to the KSB acquisition and concentrated in the time deposits category.
Total interest expense increased $7.2 million, or 47%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 and was concentrated within interest bearing deposits. Approximately 62% of the total interest bearing deposit change was attributable to rate with fluctuations as follows:
●
The cost of time deposits increased from 1.29% to 2.02%, while the average balance increased $127 million, or 46%, largely attributable to the KSB acquisition.
●
The cost of money markets increased from 0.84% to 1.02%, while the average balance increased $35 million, or 5%.
●
The cost of interest bearing demand deposits increased from 0.49% to 0.57%, while the average balance increased $64 million, or 8%.
The average balance of SSUAR decreased $24 million, or 38%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018, as a significant number of commercial customers migrated from lower yielding collateralized products to higher yielding non-collateralized deposits.
With higher levels of excess balance sheet liquidity in 2019, Bancorp maintained less reliance on short-term borrowing, leading to a $34 million decline in average balance of FFP and a favorable interest expense variance of $618,000.
Average FHLB advances increased $22 million, or 45%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018 based on advances assumed from the KSB acquisition. These advances were retained by Bancorp based upon favorable rates and terms at the time of acquisition and in relation to the overall execution of Bancorp’s asset liability management strategy. Also, as a result of the KSB acquisition, Bancorp assumed a $4 million subordinated note that was redeemed at par prior to the end of the second quarter of 2019.
Average Balance Sheets and Interest Rates (FTE)
Supplemental Information - Total Company Average Balance Sheets and Interest Rates (FTE)
●
Average loan balances include the principal balance of non-accrual loans, as well as unearned income such as loan premiums, discounts, fees/costs and exclude participation loans accounted for as secured borrowings. Participation loans averaged $8 million, $9 million and $15 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
●
Interest income on a FTE basis includes additional amounts of interest income that would have been earned if investments in certain tax-exempt interest earning assets had been made in assets subject to federal taxes yielding the same after-tax income. Interest income on municipal securities and tax-exempt loans has been calculated on a FTE basis using a federal income tax rate of 21%. Approximate tax equivalent adjustments to interest income were $212,000, $224,000 and $307,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
●
Interest income includes loan fees of $10.6 million ($9.1 million associated with the PPP), $2.2 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Interest income on loans may be impacted by the level of prepayment fees collected and accretion related to loans purchased.
●
Net interest income, the most significant component of Bancorp's earnings, represents total interest income less total interest expense. The level of net interest income is determined by mix and volume of interest earning assets, interest bearing deposits and borrowed funds, and changes in interest rates.
●
NIM represents net interest income on a FTE basis as a percentage of average interest earning assets.
●
Net interest spread (FTE) is the difference between taxable equivalent rates earned on interest earning assets less the cost of interest bearing liabilities.
●
The fair market value adjustment on investment securities resulting from ASC 320, Investments - Debt and Equity Securities is included as a component of other assets.
The following table illustrates the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities impacted Bancorp’s interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated. Information is provided in each category with respect to (i) changes attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate), (ii) changes attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume) and (iii) net change. The changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate. Tax-equivalent adjustments are based on a federal income tax rate of 21%. The change in interest due to both rate and volume has been allocated to the change due to rate and the change due to volume in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each.
Rate/Volume Analysis (FTE)
Asset/Liability Management and Interest Rate Risk
Managing interest rate risk is fundamental for the financial services industry. The primary objective of interest rate risk management is to neutralize effects of interest rate changes on net income. By considering both on and off-balance sheet financial instruments, management evaluates interest rate sensitivity with the goal of optimizing net interest income within the constraints of prudent capital adequacy, liquidity needs, market opportunities and customer requirements.
Interest Rate Simulation Sensitivity Analysis
Bancorp uses an earnings simulation model to estimate and evaluate the impact of an immediate change in interest rates on earnings in a one-year forecast. The simulation model is designed to reflect dynamics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. By estimating effects of interest rate fluctuations, the model can approximate interest rate risk exposure. This simulation model is used by management to gauge approximate results given a specific change in interest rates at a given point in time. The model is therefore a tool to indicate earnings trends in given interest rate scenarios and may not indicate actual or expected results.
The December 31, 2020 simulation reflects the FRB’s mid-March 2020 action to lower the FFTR to near zero. Bancorp’s interest rate simulation sensitivity analysis details that increases in interest rates of 100 bps would have a slightly positive effect on interest income, while an increase in rates of 200 bps would have a more positive effect on net interest income. These results are attributed to over half of the variable rate loan portfolio being currently at or near floor rates, as these yields will not increase until short-term rates exceed these floor rates. For example, a significant portion of the variable rate loan portfolio is tied to Prime, with floor rates of 4.00%. Given Prime is at 3.25% as of December 31, 2020, short-term rates would have to increase over 75 bps for these loans to move above their floor rates.
The overall increase in net interest income in the rising rate scenarios is primarily due to variable rate loans and short-term investments repricing more quickly than deposits and short-term borrowings. Asset balances subject to immediate repricing cause an estimated decline in net interest income in the down 100 bps scenario, as rates on non-maturity deposits cannot be lowered sufficiently to offset declining interest income. These estimates are summarized below:
Bancorp’s loan portfolio is currently composed of approximately 69% fixed and 31% variable rate loans, with the fixed rate portion pricing (excluding PPP loans) generally based on a spread to the five-year treasury curve at the time of origination and the variable portion pricing based on an on-going spread to Prime (approximately 60%) or one month LIBOR (approximately 40%). Bancorp’s loan portfolio (excluding PPPP loans) at December 31, 2020 was composed of approximately 63% fixed and 37% variable rate loans.
Periodically, Bancorp enters into interest rate swap transactions with borrowers who desire to hedge exposure to rising interest rates, while at the same time entering into an offsetting interest rate swap, with substantially matching terms, with another approved independent counterparty. These are undesignated derivative instruments and are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in other non-interest income as interest rates fluctuate. Because of matching terms of offsetting contracts, in addition to collateral provisions which mitigate the impact of non-performance risk, changes in fair value subsequent to initial recognition have a minimal effect on earnings, and are therefore not included in the simulation analysis results above. For additional information see the Footnote titled “Assets and Liabilities Measured and Reported at Fair Value.”
In addition, Bancorp uses derivative financial instruments as part of its interest rate risk management, including interest rate swaps. These interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges as described in the Footnote titled “Derivative Financial Instruments.” For these derivatives, the effective portion of gains or losses is reported as a component of OCI, and is subsequently reclassified into earnings as an adjustment to interest expense in periods in which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
Provision for Credit Losses
Provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 represents the amount of expense that, based on Management’s judgment, is required to maintain the ACL on loans at an appropriate level under the CECL model. Previous years were calculated under the incurred loss model. The determination of the amount of the ACL on loans is complex and involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity. See the footnote titled “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for detailed discussion regarding Bancorp’s ACL methodology by loan segment.
An analysis of the changes in the ACL on loans, including provision, and selected ratios follow:
Discussion of 2020 vs 2019:
Upon adoption of ASC 326 on January 1, 2020, Bancorp recorded an increase of $8.2 million to the ACL on loans and a corresponding decrease to retained earnings, net of the DTA impact. In addition, non-accretable yield marks of $1.6 million related to formerly classified PCI loans were reclassed between the amortized cost basis of loans and corresponding ACL. The adjustment upon adoption of ASC 326 increased the ACL on loans balance to $37 million as of January 1, 2020.
The ACL on loans totaled $52 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $27 million at December 31, 2019, representing an ACL to total loans ratio of 1.47% and 0.94% for those periods, respectively. The ACL to total loans (excluding PPP loans) was 1.74% at December 31, 2020. Based on the 100% SBA guarantee of the PPP loan portfolio, which totaled $550 million (net of unamortized deferred fees) at December 31, 2020, Bancorp did not reserve for potential losses for this portfolio.
Despite overall strong credit metrics, Bancorp recorded provision for credit losses $16.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared with $1.0 million for the same period of 2019, the latter of which was determined under the incurred loan loss model. Provisioning in 2020 was significantly impacted by the economic crisis, its corresponding impact on unemployment forecast adjustments within the CECL model, loan growth, specific reserve additions and qualitative factor adjustments. The forecasted change in the unemployment rate coupled with the qualitative factor adjustments resulted in approximately $12.4 million of the total provision expense recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, Bancorp recorded $2.8 million in provision for credit losses in 2020 related to net loan growth which was heavily concentrated within the fourth quarter. During the second quarter of 2020, a large CRE relationship was placed on non-accrual status and allocated a $2 million specific reserve within the ACL on loans. An additional $1 million specific reserve was added to this relationship during the fourth quarter.
During the third quarter of 2020, the Company recorded charge-offs totaling $1.6 million related to loans that were acquired in the prior year acquisition and fully allocated for through purchase accounting adjustments at the time of acquisition. While these are reflected as charge-offs, there was no impact to the provision for credit losses, nor to the income statement, associated with these loans and charge-off activity for the year ended December 31, 2020 was otherwise minimal.
Bancorp’s loan portfolio is diversified with no significant concentrations of credit. Geographically, most loans are extended to borrowers in the MSAs of Louisville, Indianapolis and Cincinnati. The adequacy of the allowance is monitored on an ongoing basis and it is the opinion of management that the balance of the allowance at December 31, 2020 is adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the financial statement date.
Discussion of 2019 vs 2018:
Bancorp recorded provision of $1.0 million and $2.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, both years’ provision being determined under the incurred-loss methodology. Strong credit metrics and net recoveries of $257,000 in 2019 resulted in an allowance to total loans of 0.94% as of December 31, 2019, compared with 1.00% as December 31, 2018. The loans acquired in the 2019 KSB acquisition were marked to market on the acquisition date and as such, did not receive an allowance.
In 2019, key indicators of loan quality remained consistent, or compared to 2018 with the exception of increased classified balances, defined as OAEM, Substandard, and non-performing loans, which increased $4 million at December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018.
The historical look-back period within Bancorp’s historical loan loss methodology was extended from 32 to 36 quarters in the first quarter of 2019 to all classes and segments of the portfolio. The expansion of the look-back period more accurately represented the level of risk in the loan portfolio in management’s view at that time and attempted to capture the effects of a full economic cycle. Based on the look-back period extension, the allowance level increased approximately $2.0 million during the first quarter of 2019.
See the “Financial Condition - Allowance for Credit Losses” section of this discussion for further details regarding the ACL for loans.
Non-Interest Income
Discussion of 2020 vs 2019:
Total non-interest income increased $2.5 million, or 5%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period of 2019. Non-interest income comprised 28% of total revenues, defined as net interest income (FTE) and non-interest income, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. WM&T services comprised 45% of Bancorp’s total non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 46% for the same period in 2019.
WM&T Services:
The magnitude of WM&T revenue distinguishes Bancorp from other community banks of similar asset size. Trust AUM, stated at market value, ended 2020 at a record $3.85 billion, a 16% increase compared with $3.32 billion at December 31, 2019. WM&T revenue increased $763,000, or 3%, to $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared with the same period of 2019. While stock market volatility associated with the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the WM&T department, particularly in the second quarter of this year, strong market performance in the latter half of this year, record new business growth and a large non-recurring estate fee from the first quarter of 2020 led to record WM&T income of $23.4 million.
Recurring fees earned for managing accounts are based on a percentage of market value of AUM and are typically assessed on a monthly basis. Recurring fees, which generally comprise the vast majority of WM&T revenue, increased $660,000, or 3%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared with the same period of 2019. A portion of WM&T revenue, most notably executor, insurance and some employee benefit plan-related fees, are nonrecurring in nature and the timing of these revenues corresponds with the related administrative activities. For this reason, such fees are subject to more period over period fluctuation. Total nonrecurring fees increased $103,000 or 15%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared with the same period in 2019. Contracts between WM&T and their customers do not permit performance based fees and accordingly, none of the WM&T revenue is performance based. Management believes the WM&T department will continue to factor significantly in Bancorp’s financial results and provide strategic diversity to revenue streams.
Detail of WM&T Service Income by Account Type:
The preceding table demonstrates that WM&T fee revenue is concentrated within investment advisory and personal trust accounts. WM&T fees are predominantly based on AUM and tailored for individual/company accounts and/or relationships with fee structures customized based on account type and other factors with larger relationships paying a lower percentage of AUM in fees. For example, recurring AUM fee structures are in place for investment management, irrevocable trusts, revocable trusts, individual IRAs and accounts holding only fixed income securities. Company retirement plan services often consist of a one-time conversion fee with recurring AUM fees to follow. While there are also fee structures for estate settlements, income received is often non-recurring in nature. Fees are agreed upon at the time the account is opened and any subsequent revisions are communicated in writing to the customer. Fees earned are not performance-based nor are they based on investment strategy or transactions.
Assets Under Management by Account Type:
AUM (not included on balance sheet) grew from $3.32 billion at December 31, 2019 to $3.85 billion at December 31, 2020.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, approximately 80% and 81%, respectively, of AUM were actively managed. Company retirement plan accounts primarily consist of participant directed assets and the amount of custody and safekeeping accounts are insignificant.
Managed Trust Assets Under Management by Class of Investment:
(1)
Includes client directed instruments including rights, warrants, annuities, insurance policies, unit investment trusts, and oil and gas rights.
Managed assets are invested in instruments for which market values can be readily determined, the majority of which are sensitive to market fluctuations, and consist of approximately 64% in equities and 36% in fixed income securities at December 31, 2020. This composition is relatively consistent from period to period and WM&T has no proprietary mutual funds.
Additional Sources of Non-interest income:
Deposit service charges decreased $1.0 million, or 20%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared with the same period in 2019. Deposit service charge income is primarily driven by changes in customer behavior and transaction volume, which can fluctuate from period to period. Consistent with the industry, Bancorp has experienced a steady decline in the volume of fees earned on overdrawn checking accounts over the last several years, a trend that was significantly exacerbated by the pandemic with significant declines in transaction volume and paper check presentments beginning in April 2020. Stimulus checks, extensions of tax payment due dates, more lucrative unemployment compensation, diminished pandemic spend and PPP funding all impacted consumer behavior in 2020. While Bancorp experienced a notable increase in deposit service charge income in the latter half of the year, Management is not able to predict when, or if, this revenue stream will return to pre-pandemic levels.
Debit and credit card income consists of interchange income, ancillary fees and incentives received from card processors. Debit and credit card revenue increased $357,000 or 4%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared with the same period in 2019 despite pandemic-related hurdles, as Bancorp has seen continued growth in the customer bases. Total debit card income increased $85,000, or 1%, while total credit card income increased $272,000, or 11%. Similar to deposit service charges above, Bancorp saw significant improvement in transaction volume in the latter of half of 2020 as statewide activity restrictions due to the pandemic in Bancorp’s markets implemented earlier this year were eased and/or lifted.
Treasury management fees primarily consist of fees earned for cash management services provided to commercial customers. This revenue stream increased $415,000, or 8%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019 as Bancorp’s Treasury Management department was able to overcome the significant decline in pandemic related transaction volume with new product sales and expansion of its customer base (partially attributable to the PPP). The demand for Bancorp’s treasury products has increased during the pandemic, as these products allow customers to operate more efficiently in a decentralized environment. Bancorp anticipates this income category will continue to increase based on continued customer base growth and the expanding suite of services offered within Bancorp’s treasury management platform.
Mortgage banking income primarily includes gains on sales of mortgage loans and loan servicing income offset by MSR amortization. Bancorp’s mortgage banking department predominantly originates residential mortgage loans to be sold in the secondary market, primarily to FNMA. Interest rates on the mortgage loans sold are locked with the borrower and investor prior to closing the loans, thus Bancorp bears no interest rate risk related to loans sold. Bancorp offers conventional, VA and FHA financing for purchases and refinances, as well as programs for first-time homebuyers. Interest rates on mortgage loans directly influence the volume of business transacted by the mortgage-banking department. Mortgage banking revenue increased $3.2 million, or 110%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared with the same period of 2019, respectively, as sustained low long-term rates have incentivized refinancing activity and resulted in record mortgage banking income. The current pipeline of mortgage loans remains strong, however, volume could slow as underlying issues with the pandemic develop and the pool of potential customers who have yet to refinance shrinks.
In September 2020, the Bank elected to start retaining a portion of FNMA qualified secondary market single family residential real estate loan production from the mortgage banking department on balance sheet in an effort to deploy excess liquidity. Approximately $31 million in 15/30 year fixed rate loans yielding approximately 2.75% were retained through December 31, 2020, forgoing approximately $845,000 in gain on sales of loans that would typically have been recognized in mortgage banking income. The Bank aims to retain approximately $5 to $10 million per month of such production with a mix of 15/30 year maturities in the first part of 2021.
Net investment product sales commissions and fees are generated primarily on stock, bond and mutual fund sales, as well as wrap fees on brokerage accounts. Wrap fees represent charges for investment programs that bundle together a suite of services, such as brokerage, advisory, research and management and are based on a percentage of assets. Bancorp deploys its financial advisors primarily through its branch network via an arrangement with a third party broker-dealer, while larger managed accounts are serviced by Bancorp’s WM&T segment. Net investment product sales commissions and fees increased $277,000, or 18%, for the year December 31, 2020, as compared with the same period of 2019, as market volatility during 2020 led to increased customer trading activity.
BOLI assets represent the cash surrender value of life insurance policies on certain key employees who have provided consent for Bancorp to be the beneficiary for a portion of such policies. The related change in cash surrender value and any death benefits received under the policies are recorded as non-interest income. This income serves to offset the cost of various employee benefits. BOLI income decreased $338,000, for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of a $296,000 death benefit received in the third quarter of 2019.
Other non-interest income decreased $1.2 million, or 40%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared with the same period of 2019. This decrease was driven by a plethora of non-recurring activity that occurred in 2019 including swap fee income of $374,000, a $212,000 gain on the sale of VISA Class B stock originally acquired in a 2013 acquisition, proceeds of $142,000 associated with life insurance policies outside of the traditional BOLI program and a $126,000 banking center relocation incentive.
Discussion of 2019 vs 2018:
Total non-interest income increased $4.4 million, or 10%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. Non-interest income comprised 28% of total revenue for both the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. WM&T services comprised 46% of Bancorp’s total non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 48% for the same period in 2018.
Trust AUM, stated at market value, ended 2019 at a $3.32 billion, a 20% increase compared with $2.77 billion at December 31, 2018. AUM consisted of approximately 63% in equities and 37% in fixed income securities at December 31, 2019. WM&T revenue increased $1.1 million, or 5%, to a $22.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with the same period in 2018 consistent with increased new business generation, strong market returns and growth in company retirement plans. Recurring fees increased $973,000, or 5%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with the same period of 2018. Total non-recurring fees increased $134,000, or 23%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with the same period of 2018. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, approximately 81% and 79% of AUM were actively managed.
Deposit service charges decreased $238,000, or 4%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with the same period in 2018. Consistent with the industry, Bancorp has experienced a steady decline in volume and fees earned on overdrawn checking accounts.
Debit and credit card revenue increased $1.4 million, or 20%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with the same period in 2018 consistent with increased volume resulting from continued growth in the customer bases. Total debit card income increased $500,000, or 10%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, while credit card income increased $854,000, or 56%, for the same period. In 2019, credit card income included a $47,000 non-recurring fee from its card processor for reaching activity incentive thresholds. This was the first such payment received since the Bank launched this product in mid-2015. Also, 2019 debit card revenue included a similar non-recurring fee of $174,000. No similar non-recurring debit or credit card incentives were received in 2018.
Treasury management fees increased $421,000, or 9%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018, as a result of customer base growth and expansion in the portfolio of services offered.
Mortgage banking revenue increased $521,000, or 22%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. Mortgage transaction volume began to increase in the second quarter and to a larger extent into the third quarter of 2019, as mortgage rates declined, spurring an increase in refinancing activity. During the third quarter of 2019, the ten year treasury rate/ yield curve, which mortgage rates closely follow, began a steep decline leading to the lowest mortgage rates in recent years.
Net investment product sales commissions and fees decreased $179,000, or 11%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with the same period in 2018. Advisor turnover in addition to regulatory changes that resulted in lower commissions on several product offerings negatively impacted the brokerage department throughout 2019.
BOLI income decreased $98,000, 9%, in 2019 compared to 2018, as a result of life insurance proceeds received in both periods reducing the related earning assets in addition to lower crediting rates on those investments.
Other non-interest income increased $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with the same period in 2018 primarily due non-recurring items that included swap fee income of $788,000, a $212,000 gain on the sale of VISA Class B stock originally acquired in a 2013 acquisition, proceeds of $142,000 associated with life insurance policies outside of the traditional BOLI program, receipt of a $130,000 historic tax-credit investment distribution and a $126,000 banking center relocation incentive.
Non-interest expenses
Discussion of 2020 vs 2019:
Total non-interest expenses increased $5.0 million, or 5%, in 2020 compared to 2019. Compensation and employee benefits comprised 61% and 62% of Bancorp’s total non-interest expenses for 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Compensation, which includes salaries, incentives, bonuses, and stock based compensation, increased $1.1 million, or 2%, for 2020 compared to 2019. The increase is attributed to annual merit-based salary increases, higher incentive-related compensation and an increase in full time equivalent employees, which grew from 591 at the beginning of 2019 to 641 at December 31, 2020 boosted by the 2019 KSB acquisition and the addition of sales professionals. Non-recurring severance and employee retention expense of nearly $500,000 was recorded in 2019 as a result of the KSB acquisition.
Employee benefits consists of all personnel related expense not included in compensation, with the most significant items being health insurance, payroll taxes, and retirement plan contributions. Employee benefits increased $373,000, or 3%, in 2020 compared with 2019. Growth in full time equivalent employees led to higher 401(k) matching contributions and employer payroll tax expense in 2020.
Net occupancy and equipment expense primarily includes depreciation, rent, property taxes, utilities and maintenance. Costs of capital asset additions flow through the statement of income over the lives of the assets in the form of depreciation expense. Net occupancy increased $35,000 for 2020 compared with 2019. Three new locations were added in the second quarter of 2019 as part of the KSB acquisition and an additional branch location was added in the third quarter of 2019. In 2020, Bancorp opened an additional branch in the Cincinnati MSA, as well as another location in Louisville. As of December 31, 2020, Bancorp has 44 full service banking center locations; 33 in the Louisville MSA, 6 in the Cincinnati MSA and 5 in the Indianapolis MSA.
Technology and communications expense include ongoing computer software amortization, equipment depreciation and expenditures related to investments in technology needed to maintain and improve the quality of customer delivery channels, information security and internal resources. Technology expense increased $1.4 million, or 20%, in 2020 compared to 2019 consistent with expanding customer-facing software and system functionality, as well as increased licensing/maintenance expense, higher mortgage loan processing expenses, treasury management customer expansion and the migration to a hosted core environment during the third quarter of 2020. Non-recurring technology expenses associated with the 2019 acquisition totaled $104,000 for the prior year.
Bancorp outsources processing for debit and credit card operations, which generate significant revenue for the Company. These expenses fluctuate consistent with transaction volumes. Debit and credit card processing expense increased $113,000, or 5%, for 2020 as compared with 2019, consistent with the correlated increase experienced for debit and credit card income.
Marketing and business development expenses include all costs associated with promoting Bancorp, community support, retaining customers and acquiring new business. These expenses decreased $1.2 million, or 34%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period of 2019. The sharp decline corresponds with less physical customer interaction as a result of the pandemic, which has led to less travel and entertainment expense in addition to lower advertising expense. Bancorp committed to pay $116,000 to the Bank’s foundation, established to support various community initiatives, as of December 31, 2020 compared to $600,000 as of December 31, 2019.
Postage, printing and supply expenses increased $126,000, or 8%, in 2020 compared to 2019, as a result of banking center/customer expansion over the past year and a half coupled with replacing transaction-based forms throughout the Bank associated with the migration to a hosted core environment, which occurred in the third quarter of 2020.
Legal and professional fees decreased $622,000, or 21%, for 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease is attributed to one-time costs associated with the prior year acquisition, which totaled $867,000 in 2019.
FDIC insurance increased $972,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period of 2019. As a result of the national FDIC Reserve Ratio reaching 1.38% in 2019, the FDIC released credits to small institutions (less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets) in the prior year. For this reason, Bancorp recorded no FDIC insurance expense for the third and fourth quarters of 2019, and incurred only a portion of the assessed expense in the first quarter of 2020, as these credits were depleted. FDIC insurance expense normalized in the second quarter of 2020 and ultimately increased in the third and fourth quarters as a result of a higher leverage ratio attributed to a PPP-driven larger balance sheet.
Tax credit partnerships generate federal income tax credits, and for each of Bancorp’s investments in tax credit partnerships, the tax benefit, net of related expenses, results in a positive effect on net income. Amounts of credits and corresponding expenses can vary widely depending upon timing and magnitude of the investments. Amortization of investments in tax credit partnership increased $2.0 million from 2020 to 2019 as a result of a large tax credit deal completed in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Capital and deposit based taxes increased $516,000, or 13%, in 2020 compared to 2019 consistent with overall balance sheet growth.
In connection with the adoption of ASC 326, Bancorp analyzed its unused lines of credit and recorded credit loss expense for off-balance sheet credit exposures totaling $1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase related to changes in the mix of unused lines and underlying CECL model factors. No such expense was incurred in 2019.
Other non-interest expenses decreased $1.2 million, or 21%, for 2020 compared to 2019 driven by the sale of a bank-owned property recorded as an off-set to non-interest expense in the second quarter of 2020 along with elevated 2019 expense that included the write off of assets totaling $347,000 in connection with signing the contract to migrate to the hosted core processing solution and elevated fraud and robbery-related losses.
Bancorp’s efficiency ratio for 2020 of 54.86% improved from 56.07% in 2019. Excluding amortization of investments in tax credit partnerships, the adjusted efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP measure, would have been 53.22% and 55.45% for 2020 and 2019. See the section titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for reconcilement of non-GAAP to GAAP measures.
Discussion of 2019 vs 2018:
Total non-interest expenses increased $8.8 million, or 10%, in 2019 compared to 2018. Compensation and employee benefits comprised 62% and 63% of Bancorp’s total non-interest expenses for 2019 and 2018.
Compensation expense increased $4.2 million, or 9%, for 2019 compared to 2018. Consistent with 2019 results, bonus expense of $5.8 million was recorded during 2019 compared to $4.5 million during 2018. Net full time equivalent employees increased from 591 at December 31, 2018 to 615 at December 31, 2019. While 25 employees were added in connection with the KSB acquisition, 2019 reflects a higher concentration of non-KSB related loan production personnel added. In addition, non-recurring severance and employee retention expense of nearly $500,000 was recorded in 2019 as a result of the KSB acquisition.
Employee benefits increased $816,000, or 8%, in 2019 compared with 2018. Growth in full time equivalent employees led to higher 401(k) matching contributions and employer payroll tax expense in 2019. Effective January 1, 2019, as a recruitment strategy, Bancorp amended its 401(k) plan to allow employer matching contribution eligibility following 30 days of employment.
Net occupancy increased $769,000, or 10%, for 2019 compared with 2018. Bancorp opened one branch location during the third quarter of 2019 in Mt. Washington, Kentucky and added five branch locations associated with the KSB acquisition during the second quarter. Bancorp closed three of the acquired branch locations in Louisville during the third quarter of 2019 due to their proximity to existing Bancorp branches. All three buildings and were sold in 2019 resulting in positive re-cast adjustments to goodwill. The KSB locations added $238,000 of additional occupancy and equipment expense for 2019.
Technology expense increased $529,000, or 8%, in 2019 compared to 2018 due largely to increases in computer infrastructure upgrades and maintenance costs. KSB related one-time non-recurring expenses totaled $104,000 for 2019.
Debit and credit card processing expense increased $165,000, or 7%, for 2019 as compared with 2018, as a result of a growing customer base and increased transaction volume.
Marketing and business development expenses increased $528,000, or 17%, for 2019 as compared with 2018 largely due to increased community support expenses. In connection with record operating results, Bancorp committed to pay $600,000 to the Bank’s foundation, established to support various community initiatives, as of December 31, 2019 compared to $125,000 as of December 31, 2018.
Postage, printing and supplies expenses increased $94,000, or 6%, in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the KSB acquisition.
Legal and professional fees increased $400,000, or 15%, for 2019 compared to 2018. One-time costs associated with the KSB acquisition totaled nearly $867,000 in 2019 compared to $337,000 incurred in late 2018 in anticipation of the acquisition. Additional costs associated with consulting engagements also contributed to the period over period increase.
No FDIC insurance expense was recorded for the second half of 2019, as the FDIC released credits to small institutions. This change was announced in 2016 and it took approximately three years for the reserve threshold to be met and the corresponding credits issued.
Amortization of investments in tax credit partnership decreased $159,000, or 13%, from 2018 to 2019.
Capital and deposit based taxes increased $545,000, or 16%, in 2019 compared to 2018 in connection with general balance sheet growth and the KSB acquisition.
Other non-interest expenses increased $1.5 million, or 38%, for 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to growth in Bancorp’s credit card rebates/rewards program, increased amortization associated with the core deposit intangible resulting from the KBS acquisition, elevated fraud/robbery related losses, increased Director compensation and the write off of assets in relation to signing a contract to move to a hosted core processing solution.
Bancorp’s efficiency ratio for 2019 of 56.07% increased from 55.89% in 2018. Excluding amortization of investments in tax credit partnerships, the adjusted efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP measure, would have been 55.45% and 55.11% for 2019 and 2018. See the section titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for reconcilement of non-GAAP to GAAP measures.
Income Taxes
A comparison of income tax expense and ETR follows:
Discussion of 2020 vs 2019:
Fluctuations in the ETR are primarily attributed to the following:
●
The ETR for 2020 benefitted from the impact of a large historic tax credit project that was completed during the fourth quarter of 2020.
●
In March 2019, the Kentucky Legislature passed HB354 requiring financial institutions to transition from a capital based franchise tax to the Kentucky corporate income tax beginning in 2021. Historically, the franchise tax, a component of non-interest expenses, was assessed at 1.1% of net capital and has averaged $2.5 million annually over the prior two year-end periods. The Kentucky corporate income tax will be assessed at 5% of Kentucky taxable income and will be included as a component of current and deferred state income tax expense. Associated with this change, predominantly during the first quarter of 2019, Bancorp established a Kentucky state DTA related to existing temporary differences estimated to reverse after the effective date of the law change. Bancorp recorded a corresponding state tax benefit, net of federal tax impact of $1.2 million, or approximately $0.06 per diluted share for 2019.
●
In April 2019, the Kentucky Legislature passed HB458 allowing entities filing a combined Kentucky income return to share certain tax attributed, including net operating loss carryforwards. The combined filing, beginning in 2021, will allow Bancorp’s Holding Company net operating loss carryforwards to offset against net revenue generated by the Bank up to 50% of the Bank’s Kentucky taxable income and reduce Bancorp’s tax liability. Bancorp recorded a state tax benefit, net of federal tax impact of $2.7 million, predominantly in the second quarter of 2019, or approximately $0.12 per diluted share for 2019.
The CARES Act includes several significant provisions for corporations including increasing the amount of deductible interest under section 163(j), allowing companies to carryback certain net operating losses, and increasing the amount of net operating loss that corporations can use to offset income. These changes did not have a significant impact on Bancorp’s income taxes.
Bancorp invests in certain partnerships that yield federal income tax credits. Taken as a whole, the tax benefit of these investments exceeds amortization expense, resulting in a positive impact on net income. The timing and magnitude of these transactions may vary widely from period to period.
Discussion of 2019 vs 2018:
The decline in the ETR from 2018 to 2019 related primarily to the two Kentucky state tax law changes noted in the discussion above.
Financial Condition - December 31, 2020 Compared to December 31, 2019
Overview
Total assets increased $884 million, or 24%, to $4.6 billion at December 31, 2020, from $3.7 billion at December 31, 2019. Average assets increased $737 million, or 21%, to $4.2 billion at December 31, 2020. The significant 2020 balance sheet expansion was directly attributable to the PPP, which drove $550 million of the $687 million increase in loans, the remaining growth being the result of record production in the traditional loan portfolio. In addition, virtually all interest-earning asset categories experienced year over prior year increases. The Company ended 2020 with significantly higher ACL on loans resulting from the adoption of ASC 326 and elevated pandemic-related provisioning during the year.
Total liabilities increased $850 million, or 26%, with record deposit growth of $855 million driven by the PPP. Partially off-setting the deposit growth and increases in SSUAR and other liabilities was a $48 million decline in FHLB borrowings, as advances matured without renewal or replacement.
Cash and Cash Equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents increased $68 million, or 27%, to $318 million as of December 31, 2020. Bancorp maintained higher levels of liquidity in 2020 attributable to the PPP and growth in deposits.
AFS Debt Securities
The primary purpose of the securities portfolio is to provide another source of interest income, as well as liquidity management. In managing the composition of the balance sheet, Bancorp seeks a balance between earnings sources and credit and liquidity considerations.
AFS debt securities include securities that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, resultant prepayment risk and other factors related to interest rate and prepayment risk changes and are carried at fair value with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax effect, included in stockholders’ equity.
All of Bancorp’s debt securities are classified as AFS. Carrying value is summarized as follows:
AFS debt securities increased $116 million, or 25%, for December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019. Bancorp began strategically growing the AFS securities portfolio in the latter half of the year in an effort to invest excess balance sheet liquidity. In addition, the AFS securities portfolio also experienced market appreciation of $12 million in 2020 stemming from declines in the interest rate environment between December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Bancorp expects the AFS debt securities portfolio to grow in 2021, as strategies associated with the investment of excess balance sheet liquidity continue to be implemented.
Maturity distribution and weighted average interest rates of debt securities AFS follows:
Actual maturities for mortgage-backed securities may differ from contractual maturities due to prepayments on underlying collateral.
Loans
Composition of loans, net of deferred fees and costs, by primary loan class as reported under ASC 326 follows:
(1) Total loans are presented inclusive of premiums, discounts, and net loan origination fees and costs.
For historical comparative purposes, the composition of loans by class pre-ASC 326 adoption follows:
(1) Consists of land acquired for development by the borrower, but for which no development has yet taken place.
(2) Total loans are presented inclusive of premiums, discounts, and net loan origination fees and costs.
Total loans increased $687 million, or 24%, however, excluding the PPP loan portfolio, total loans grew $136 million, or 5%, as growth in the CRE portfolio offset contraction in the C&I lines of credit portfolio. Line of credit usage declined significantly after the first quarter of 2020 as a result of the pandemic, falling to 38% at December 31, 2020 compared to 47% at December 31, 2019. Further, the previously mentioned retention of a portion of FNMA qualified secondary market single family residential real estate loan production from the mortgage banking department predominantly drove the growth in the residential real estate portfolio.
As of December 31, 2020, PPP loans of $561 million ($550 million net of unamortized deferred fees and costs), were outstanding. PPP borrowers are eligible for forgiveness from the SBA for the portion of funding received utilized for job retention and certain other expenses, such as payroll costs, mortgage interest, rent and utilities during the 24-week period beginning with the date of the loan. With a significant portion of these loans potentially eligible for full forgiveness, there is high likelihood of early pay off prior to maturity (predominantly 24 months). On October 8, 2020, the SBA announced it would streamline loan forgiveness for loans of $50,000 or less with one or more employee other than the owner (representing approximately 48% of the PPP loans Bancorp originated). The Bank has approximately $10.5 million in net unrecognized fees related to the PPP that would be recognized in income immediately once the loans are paid off or forgiven by the SBA. The timing of such forgiveness is expected to have a major impact on operating results in 2021.
The initial round of the PPP expired on August 8, 2020 and as of December 31, 2020, the Bank has submitted 520 forgiveness applications to the SBA totaling $170 million and has received payment from the SBA for 333 borrowers. The SBA has 90 days to review and decision applications for forgiveness.
An additional round of the PPP was included in the CAA, which was signed into law on December 27, 2020 and extended the program to March 31, 2021. To qualify for the program, borrowers must show a 25% decline in revenue in the first, second, or third quarters in 2020, as compared to the same periods in 2019 (if the loan application is after December 31, 2020, then a fourth quarter comparison may be used as well). The bill allows borrowers to select the end date of their covered period, however, it must be greater than eight weeks from the date of disbursement of the PPP loan and cannot exceed 24 weeks.
The program offers “second draw” loans targeted at hard-hit businesses that employ 300 or fewer employees and that have used or will use the full amount of their initial PPP loan. The maximum loan under this program is $2 million, based on two and a half months of average annual payroll (three and a half months for hotels and restaurants). The measurement period for the payroll can either be calendar year 2019 or the one year period before the date the “second draw” originates. For any loan up to $150,000, the covered loan amount will be forgiven once the borrower submits a one page form listing the loan amount, the number of employees retained, and the amount of the loan spent on payroll. This will substantially reduce the burden on both borrowers and lenders. The lender review will be limited to whether the lender received a complete application with all fields completed, initialed, or signed as applicable. If the submission is complete, the lender is required to accept it and forward to the SBA. Bancorp is projecting to book approximately 1,300 of these “second draw” PPP loans totaling $220 million.
During 2020 and as a result of the pandemic, Bancorp added a pass-rating category for loans that demonstrated significant exposure to industries impacted by the pandemic. This category was added to allow for the capture of a more detailed review of these loans if any broad economic trends or developments occurred related to the pandemic or the underlying performance of the borrowers. The vast majority of these loans are not in deferral as of December 31, 2020 and are performing according to their original terms. As a result of Bancorp’s review of these loans during the year, loans totaling $41 million were downgraded below a pass-rating as a result of pandemic-related business interruptions, $38 million of which were downgraded to OAEM and $3 million were downgraded to Substandard for the year ended December 31, 2020.
In accordance with Section 4013 of the CARES Act and in response to requests from borrowers who experienced business interruptions related to the pandemic, Bancorp extended payment deferrals for those affected borrowers. Depending on the demonstrated need of the customer, Bancorp deferred either the full loan payment or the principal-only portion of respective loan payments for 90 or 180 days for some borrowers directly impacted by the pandemic.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, Bancorp executed nearly 1,200 full payment deferrals. As of December 31, 2020 outstanding full payment loan deferrals totaled $37 million - representing 1.24% of the loan portfolio (excluding PPP loans). Pursuant to the CARES Act, these loan deferrals were not classified as TDRs and not included in non-performing loan statistics. While the modifications themselves did not trigger a loan risk rating downgrade beyond the “pass” rating, if the impact of COVID-19 continues and borrower’s operations do not improve or if other negative events occur, such modified loans could transition to potential problem loans or into problem loans. The CAA extended relief from TDR accounting to the earlier of 1) 60 days after the national emergency termination date or (2) January 1, 2022.
During the third and fourth quarters of 2020, a significant portion of the deferred loan portfolio returned to full or original paying status. Management continues to analyze the evolving economic conditions in its markets while closely monitoring credit metrics, particularly related to the following segments comprising deferrals in the Bank’s loan portfolio:
Bancorp anticipates that a portion of the Bank’s borrowers in the above industry segments will continue to endure economic challenges, as long as the current COVID-19 related economic conditions persist. Among other things, this could cause them to draw on their existing lines of credit and/or affect their ability to repay existing indebtedness. These developments are also expected to partially impact the CRE portfolio, particularly with respect to real estate with exposure to these industries, and the value of certain collateral.
Bancorp’s credit exposure is diversified with secured and unsecured loans to individuals and businesses. No specific industry concentration exceeds 10% of loans outstanding. While Bancorp has a diversified loan portfolio, a customer’s ability to honor contracts is somewhat dependent upon the economic stability and/or industry in which that customer does business. Loans outstanding and related unfunded commitments are primarily concentrated within Bancorp’s current market areas, which encompass the Louisville, Indianapolis and Cincinnati MSAs.
Bancorp occasionally enters into loan participation agreements with other banks to diversify credit risk. For certain participation loans sold, Bancorp has retained effective control of the loans, typically by restricting the participating institutions from pledging or selling their ownership share of the loan without permission from Bancorp. GAAP requires the participated portion of these loans to be recorded as secured borrowings. These participated loans are included in the C&I and CRE loan portfolio segments with a corresponding liability recorded in other liabilities. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the total participated portion of loans of this nature totaled $10 million and $8 million, respectively.
LIBOR will cease to exist as a published rate after 2021. As of December 31, 2020, Bancorp had approximately $443 million in variable rate loans with interest rates tied to LIBOR, of which approximately $330 million have maturity dates beyond December 31, 2021. Bancorp’s derivative activities based upon LIBOR include interest rate swap transactions with maturities beyond 2021 with notional amounts totaling approximately $120 million. Bancorp has established a working group, consisting of key stakeholders from throughout the company, to monitor developments relating to LIBOR uncertainty and changes and to guide Bancorp’s response. This team is currently working to gain an understanding of the specific products, systems, borrowing arrangements and legal agreements that will be impacted by the change.
The following table details amounts of loans at December 31, 2020 which, based on remaining scheduled repayments of principal, are due in the periods indicated.
The table below details C&I and C&D loans maturing after one year categorized by fixed and variable interest rate structures:
In the event where Bancorp structures a loan with a maturity exceeding five years (typically CRE loans), an automatic rate adjustment will typically be set in place at five years from origination date to limit interest rate sensitivity.
Non-performing Loans and Assets
Information summarizing non-performing loans and assets follows:
Non-performing loans to total loans were 0.37% at December 31, 2020 compared to 0.42% at December 31, 2019. Non-performing loans to total loans (excluding PPP loans) were 0.44% at December 31, 2020.
Non-performing loans increased $1.1 million to $13.2 million at December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019. During the first quarter of 2020 a large non-accrual C&I relationship totaling $8 million paid off due to sale of the business. During the second quarter of 2020, a large CRE relationship was placed on non-accrual status and allocated a $2 million specific reserve within the ACL on loans. An additional $1 million specific reserve was added for this relationship during the fourth quarter of 2020.
In total, non-performing assets as of December 31, 2020 were comprised of 35 loans ranging in individual amounts up to $10 million, one nominal accruing TDR loan and foreclosed real estate held for sale. Foreclosed real estate held at December 31, 2020 included a residential real estate properties and a CRE property.
The following table presents the major classifications of non-accrual loans by portfolio:
Loans are placed in a non-accrual income status when prospects for recovering both principal and accrued interest are considered doubtful or when a default of principal or interest has existed for 90 days or more, unless such a loan is well- secured and in the process of collection or renewal. Interest income recorded on non-accrual loans as principal payments was $350,000, $552,000, and $93,000 for 2020, 2019, and 2018. Interest income that would have been recorded if non-accrual loans were on a current basis in accordance with their original terms was $457,000, $491,000, and $391,000 for 2020, 2019, and 2018.
In addition to non-performing loans discussed above, there were loans, which are accruing interest, for which payments were current or less than 90 days past due where borrowers are experiencing elevated financial difficulties. These potential problem loans totaled approximately $26 million and $37 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019. These relationships are monitored closely for possible future inclusion in non-performing loans. Management believes it has adequately reflected credit exposure in these loans in its determination of the allowance.
Loans accounted for as TDRs include modifications from original terms such as those due to bankruptcy proceedings, certain changes to amortization periods or extended suspension of principal payments due to customer financial difficulties. To the extent that Bancorp chooses to work with borrowers by providing reasonable concessions rather than initiating collection, this would result in an increase in loans accounted for as TDRs. TDRs that are in non-accrual status are reported as non-accrual loans. Loans accounted for as TDRs are individually evaluated for impairment and are reported as non-performing loans.
On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law. Section 4013 of the CARES Act, “Temporary Relief from Troubled Debt Restructurings,” provides banks the option to temporarily suspend certain requirements under GAAP related to TDRs for a limited period of time to account for the effects of COVID-19. To qualify for Section 4013 of the CARES Act, borrowers must have been current at December 31, 2019. All modifications are eligible so long as they are executed between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of (i) December 31, 2020, or (ii) the 60th day after the end of the COVID-19 national emergency declared by the President of the United States. Multiple modifications of the same credits are allowed and there is no cap on the duration of the modification. On December 21, 2020, certain provisions of the CARES Act, including the temporary suspension of certain requirements related to TDRs, were extended through December 31, 2021.
In March 2020, various regulatory agencies, including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, issued an interagency statement on loan modifications and reporting for financial institutions working with customers affected by the pandemic. The interagency statement was effective immediately and impacted accounting for loan modifications. Under Accounting Standards Codification 310-40, “Receivables - Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors,” (“ASC 310-40”), a restructuring of debt constitutes a TDR if the creditor, for economic or legal reasons related to the debtor’s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider. The agencies confirmed with the staff of the FASB that short-term modifications made on a good faith basis in response to COVID-19 to borrowers who were current prior to any relief, are not to be considered TDRs. This includes short-term modifications such as payment deferrals, fee waivers, extensions of repayment terms, or other delays in payment that are insignificant. Borrowers considered current are those that are less than 30 days past due on their contractual payments at the time a modification program is implemented.
As of December 31, 2020, TDRs consisted of one loan totaling $16,000 compared to two loans totaling $34,000 at December 31, 2019.
The following table presents the amortized cost basis of non-performing loans and the amortized cost basis of loans on non-accrual status for which there were no related ACL losses:
Delinquent Loans
Delinquent loans (consisting of all loans 30 days or more past due) totaled $17 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $15 million at December 31, 2019. Delinquent loans total loans were 0.48% and 0.53% at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Delinquent loans to total loans (excluding PPP loans) were 0.57% at December 31, 2020.
Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans
The ACL is a valuation allowance for loans estimated at each balance sheet date in accordance with GAAP. When Bancorp deems all or a portion of a loan to be uncollectible, the appropriate amount is written off and the ACL is reduced by the same amount. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the ACL when received. See the footnote titled “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for discussion of Bancorp’s ACL methodology on loans. Allocations of the ACL may be made for specific loans, but the entire ACL on loans is available for any loan that, in Bancorp’s judgment, should be charged-off.
The following table sets forth the ACL by category of loan as reported under ASC 326:
(1)
Excludes the PPP loan portfolio at December 31, 2020, which was not reserved for based on the 100% SBA guarantee.
For historical comparative purposes, the ACL by category of loan as reported pre-ASC 326 adoption follows:
Upon adoption of ASC 326 on January 1, 2020, Bancorp recorded an increase of $8.2 million to the ACL on loans and a corresponding decrease to retained earnings, net of the DTA impact. In addition, non-accretable yield marks of $1.6 million related to formerly classified PCI loans were reclassed between the amortized cost basis of loans and corresponding ACL. The adjustment upon adoption of ASC 326 raised the ACL on loans balance to $37 million on January 1, 2020. In addition to the CECL adoption, the ACL for 2020 was significantly impacted by unemployment rate forecast adjustments within the CECL model, loan growth and the addition of a large specific reserve for one relationship and qualitative factor adjustments. During the third quarter of 2020, the aforementioned $1.6 million included in the ACL as specific reserves were charged-off with no resulting impact to provision expense.
Bancorp measures expected credit losses of financial assets on a collective (pool) basis, when the financial assets share similar risk characteristics. Depending on the nature of the pool of financial assets with similar risk characteristics, Bancorp has measured its portfolio classes as follows:
The static pool methodology is utilized for the loan portfolio segments that typically have shorter durations. For each of these loan segments, Bancorp applies an expected loss ratio based on historical losses adjusted as appropriate for qualitative factors. Qualitative loss factors are based on management's judgment of company, market, industry or business specific data, changes in underlying loan composition of specific portfolios, trends relating to credit quality, delinquency, non-performing and adversely rated loans, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions.
When developing the ACL CECL model for loan pools utilizing the DCF method, Bancorp utilized regression analysis of historical internal and peer data to identify a suitable loss driver to utilize when modeling lifetime probability of default and loss given default. Such regression analysis was used to measure how the expected probability of default and loss given default would react to changes in forecasted levels of the loss driver. Based on this regression analysis, management determined that the forecasted Seasonally Adjusted National Civilian Unemployment Rate best correlated to Bancorp’s historical losses and elected to use this rate as the primary loss driver to be consistently applied across all applicable loan segments over a reasonable and supportable forecast period.
Upon adoption of ASC 326 on January 1, 2020, management determined that four quarters represented a reasonable and supportable national unemployment forecast period with reversion back to Bancorp’s historical loss rate over eight quarters on a straight-line basis. This resulted in an $8.2 million initial increase in the ACL on loans with the offset to retained earnings.
Subsequent to January 1, 2020, based on the economic crisis caused by COVID-19 and measures taken to protect public health such as stay-at-home orders and mandatory closures of businesses, economic activity halted significantly and job losses surged. As such, national unemployment has fluctuated widely in 2020 as follows:
As of March 31, 2020, based on the evolving pandemic, Bancorp elected to forecast for only one quarter of national unemployment (versus the four quarters used as of January 1, 2020) and modified its forecast to reflect a significant increase in unemployment (utilizing the highest unemployment rate in Bancorp’s observed history) reverting back to Bancorp’s long-term average in the third quarter of 2020, with the loss driver remaining significantly worse compared to recent trends. The impact of the increased unemployment rate forecast was muted by an adjustment in qualitative factors attributed to the massive federal stimulus programs enacted at the end of the first quarter in response to the pandemic. The forecasted increase in the unemployment rate coupled with the qualitative factor adjustments resulted in approximately $5.4 million of the total $5.5 million provision expense recorded for the first quarter of 2020.
During the second quarter, for the first time during 2020, the FRB released a forecasted Seasonally Adjusted National Civilian Unemployment Rate for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022. Based on this and the continuation of the economic crisis, as of June 30, 2020, Bancorp elected to forecast for four quarters of national unemployment utilizing actual June unemployment then stepping down to the FRB median forecast before reverting back to Bancorp’s long-term average in the fourth quarter of 2020. Similar to the first quarter of 2020, the impact of the increased unemployment forecast was muted by an adjustment in qualitative factors attributed to the massive federal stimulus programs that have been enacted. The forecasted increase in unemployment coupled with the qualitative factor adjustments resulted in approximately $4.8 million of the total $5.5 million provision expense recorded for the second quarter of 2020.
As of September 30, 2020, Bancorp elected to forecast for one quarter of the Seasonally Adjusted National Civilian Unemployment Rate utilizing the FRB’s 2020 median unemployment forecast released in September then stepping down to the FRB’s 2021 median unemployment forecast over the next three quarters before reverting back to Bancorp’s long-term average. In addition, Bancorp fully reversed the qualitative factor adjustment established in the first and second quarters of 2020 attributed to the massive federal stimulus programs. The forecasted changes in unemployment, coupled with the qualitative factor adjustments resulted in approximately $4.4 million in provision expense for the third quarter of 2020
During the fourth quarter of 2020, the FRB released its forecasted Seasonally Adjusted National Civilian Unemployment Rate for the 12 months ended December 31, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 as follows:
As of December 31, 2020, Bancorp elected to forecast four quarters of the Seasonally Adjusted National Civilian Unemployment Rate utilizing the FRB’s 2020 median unemployment forecast released in December then stepping down to the FRB’s 2021 median unemployment forecast over the next three quarters before reverting back to Bancorp’s long-term average. The improvement within the unemployment forecast, coupled with minor qualitative factor adjustments, resulted in a credit of approximately $2.2 million in provision expense for the third quarter of 2020.
Outstanding loans (excluding PPP loans) increased $92 million during the first three months of 2020 and contracted $103 million during the second quarter of 2020, as outstanding C&I lines of credit were reduced by $94 million. The overall net change in the loan mix contributed to $1.4 million of additional provision expense for the three months ended March 31, 2020. During the second quarter of 2020, loan contraction (mainly C&I lines of credit) led to a $1.5 million reduction in the required ACL on loans. In the third quarter, loan growth was essentially flat, as an increase the in CRE portfolio was offset by further contraction in the C&I portfolio, resulting in $133,000 of additional provision expense. In addition, the third quarter change in specific reserves offset net charge-offs by $116,000. Loan growth in the fourth quarter totaled $151 million, contributing to approximately $2.6 million in additional provision expense.
The pandemic has had a material impact on Bancorp’s quarterly ACL on loans calculations for 2020. While Bancorp has not yet experienced credit quality issues resulting in charge-offs related to the pandemic, the ACL calculation for loans and resulting provision were significantly impacted by changes in forecasted economic conditions. Should the forecast for economic conditions worsen, Bancorp could experience further increases in its required ACL and record additional provision expense. While the execution of payment deferrals under the CARES ACT has assisted credit quality ratios, it is possible that asset quality could worsen at future measurement periods if the effects of the pandemic are prolonged.
In connection with the adoption of ASC 326, Bancorp analyzed its unused lines of credit and recorded credit loss expense for off-balance sheet credit exposures (non-interest expense) totaling $375,000 and $1.5 million during the first and second quarters of 2020. The second quarter increase directly correlated to the increased availability due to C&I line of credit pay downs. Further declines in line of credit utilization resulted in an additional $550,000 of such expense in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the reserve was reduced by $900,000 to a balance of $5.4 million, with the majority of the decline attributed to an increase in C&I line of utilization.
During the second quarter of 2020, a large CRE relationship was placed on non-accrual status and received a $2 million specific reserve allocation within the ACL on loans. The borrower did not receive PPP funds, the loan was current at the time of non-accrual classification and each subsequent quarter end, and no payments related to the loan have been deferred. During the fourth quarter, an additional $1 million in specific reserve allocation was attributed to this relationship.
Summary of Loan and Lease Loss Experience
The table below reflects activity in the ACL related to loans for the year ended December 31, 2020, presented in accordance with ASC 326:
The table below reflects activity in the ACL related to loans for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, presented in accordance with ASC 310 prior to the adoption of ASC 326:
Selected ratios relating to the allowance follow:
Premises and Equipment
Premises and equipment experienced minimal fluctuation between December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 as new locations were added in both periods. Three new locations were added in the second quarter of 2019 as part of the KSB acquisition and an additional branch location was added in the third quarter of 2019. In 2020, Bancorp opened an additional branch in the Cincinnati MSA, as well as another location in Louisville. As of December 31, 2020, Bancorp has 44 full service banking center locations; 33 in the Louisville MSA, 6 in the Cincinnati MSA and 5 in the Indianapolis MSA.
Goodwill
At December 31, 2020, Bancorp had $13 million in goodwill recorded on its balance sheet. Events that may trigger goodwill impairment include deterioration in economic conditions, a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics, negative trends in overall financial performance and regulatory action. More specifically, a sustained decline in stock price could be considered a triggering event. Similar to other financial institutions, the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic crisis has caused volatility to Bancorp’s stock price. Management compared the fair value of the commercial banking segment to the carrying value recorded on the balance sheet and other factors, and concluded its goodwill was not impaired based on testing performed as of December 31, 2020. Additionally, Bancorp’s stock has traded above book value for the entirety of 2020.
Other Assets and Other Liabilities
Other assets increased $20 million, or 40%, as of December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 while other liabilities increased $27 million, or 45%, for the same respective periods.
Market value changes on interest rate swap transactions maintained for certain loan customers played a large role in the increases for both other asset and other liabilities. Bancorp enters into these interest rate swap transactions with borrowers who desire to hedge exposure to rising interest rates, while at the same time entering into an offsetting interest rate swap, with substantially matching terms, with another approved independent counterparty. These are undesignated derivative instruments and are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value via both an asset and a related liability as Bancorp has an agreement with the borrower (the asset) and the counterparty (the liability). Because of matching terms of offsetting contracts and collateral provisions mitigating any non-performance risk, changes in fair value have an offsetting effect on the related asset and liability. For this reason, the market value changes over the past 12 months stemming from the declining interest rate environment have resulted in increases to both the asset and liability associated with these transactions. For additional information, see the footnote titled “Derivative Financial Instruments.”
Further, other assets and other liabilities each experienced increases associated with tax credit investments, as Bancorp recorded obligations on such investments by increasing the related asset and recording a liability for the related future contributions. An increase in Bancorp’s DTAs associated with growth in the ACL for loans and deferred PPP loan fees also contributed to the year over prior year increase in other assets, while other liabilities experienced a substantial increase in 2020 relating to the accrual for losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures stemming from a rise in unused commitments and qualitative loss factor adjustments within the CECL model.
Deposits
Average deposit balances and average rates paid on such deposits for the years indicated are summarized as follows:
Maturities of time deposits of $250,000 or more at December 31, 2020 are summarized as follows:
Total deposits increased $855 million, or 27%, from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 with non-interest bearing deposits representing $377 million of the increase. Both ending and average deposit balances finished at record levels as of December 31, 2020, largely as a result of the PPP, as well as customers holding higher levels of liquidity in general due to economic uncertainty. Some commercial customers who were awarded PPP funding have utilized the funding held on deposit at the Bank to strengthen their balance sheets. Bancorp relied on deposit growth in addition to excess cash on hand to fund PPP loans with no reliance placed on external funding sources. In addition, some maturing certificates of deposit are not being renewed in the current low interest rate environment.
Securities Sold Under Agreement to Repurchase
Information regarding SSUAR follows:
SSUARs are collateralized by securities and are treated as financings; accordingly, the securities involved with the agreements are recorded as assets and are held by a safekeeping agent and the obligations to repurchase the securities are reflected as liabilities. All securities underlying the agreements are under the Bank’s control.
SSUARs totaled $48 million and $32 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The majority of SSUARs are subject to immediate repricing. The increase in SSUAR is attributed to the trend of customers maintaining higher balances in general during 2020.
FHLB Advances
FHLB advances decreased $48 million, or 60%, to $32 million at December 31, 2020 as the result of maturing advances not being renewed or replaced and the elective penalty-free pay down of $10 million in advances during the second quarter. Included in 2020 maturities was a $20 million three-month rolling advance related to a five-year rate swap (cash flow hedge) that was entered into in 2015. Both the advance and the interest rate swap matured without renewal during the fourth quarter of 2020. See the Footnote titled “Derivative Financial Instruments,” for additional detail regarding interest rate swaps.
In connection with the 2019 KSB acquisition, Bancorp assumed $43 million FHLB term advances and chose to retain them on balance sheet based upon the then-favorable rate and terms in the overall execution of Bancorp’s asset liability management strategy. These advances have not been replaced as they have matured.
Liquidity
The role of liquidity management is to ensure funds are available to meet depositors’ withdrawal and borrowers’ credit demands while at the same time maximizing profitability. This is accomplished by balancing changes in demand for funds with changes in supply of those funds. Liquidity is provided by short-term assets that can be converted to cash, AFS debt securities, various lines of credit available to Bancorp, and the ability to attract funds from external sources, principally deposits. Management believes it has the ability to increase deposits at any time by offering rates slightly higher than market rate.
Bancorp’s Asset/Liability Committee is comprised of senior management and has direct oversight responsibility for Bancorp’s liquidity position and profile. A combination of reports provided to management details internal liquidity metrics, composition and level of the liquid asset portfolio, timing differences in short-term cash flow obligations, and exposure to contingent draws on Bancorp’s liquidity.
As of December 31, 2020, Bancorp had not experienced any significant funding issues related to the PPP or the pandemic in general. A significant portion of the funds borrowed have remained in the form of commercial deposits and have generally been slow to outflow, as customers have utilized the funds to strengthen their balance sheets similar to the Great Recession. In addition, federal stimulus checks and more lucrative unemployment benefits have also contributed to higher than normal deposit balances. If a liquidity issue arose, Bancorp would utilize overnight funds from the FHLB (the lowest costing source), in which Bancorp has available credit of $804 million as of December 31, 2020.
Bancorp’s most liquid assets are comprised of cash and due from banks, FFS and AFS debt securities. FFS and interest bearing deposits totaled $275 million and $203 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. FFS normally have overnight maturities while interest-bearing deposits in banks are accessible on demand. These investments are used for general daily liquidity purposes. The fair value of the AFS debt security portfolio was $587 million and $471 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The investment portfolio includes scheduled maturities of $27 million and expected cash flows on amortizing AFS debt securities of approximately $167 million (based on scheduled payments and assumed pre-payment speeds as of December 31, 2020) over the next 12 months. Combined with FFS and interest bearing deposits from banks, AFS debt securities offer substantial resources to meet either loan growth or reductions in Bancorp’s deposit funding base. Bancorp pledges portions of its investment securities portfolio to secure public funds, cash balances of certain WM&T accounts and SSUAR. At December 31, 2020, total investment securities pledged for these purposes comprised 86% of the AFS debt securities portfolio, leaving approximately $82 million of unpledged AFS debt securities.
Bancorp has a large base of core customer deposits, defined as time deposits less than or equal to $250,000, demand, savings, money market deposit accounts and excludes brokered deposits. At December 31, 2020, such deposits totaled $3.9 billion and represented 98% of Bancorp’s total deposits, as compared with $3.0 billion, or 96% of total deposits at December 31, 2019. Because these core deposits are less volatile and are often tied to other products of Bancorp through long lasting relationships, they do not place undue pressure on liquidity. However, many of Bancorp’s individual depositors are currently maintaining historically high balances. These excess balances may be more sensitive to market rates, with potential decreases possibly straining Bancorp’s liquidity position.
As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, Bancorp held brokered deposits totaling $25 million and $30 million, respectively. These deposits are scheduled to mature over the first three quarters of 2021.
Included in total deposit balances at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $355 million and $217 million, respectively, of public funds generally comprised of accounts from local government agencies and public school districts in the markets in which Bancorp operates. Bancorp has historically considered these to be long-term relationships.
Bancorp is a member of the FHLB of Cincinnati. As a member of the FHLB, Bancorp has access to credit products of the FHLB. Bancorp views these borrowings as a potential low cost alternative to brokered deposits. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, available credit from the FHLB totaled $804 million and $599 million, respectively. The increase in available credit during 2020 is due to pledging a portion of the PPP portfolio, which increased our collateral-based borrowing capacity. See the footnote titled “FHLB Advances” for additional detail. Additionally, Bancorp had unsecured available FFP lines with correspondent banks totaling $80 million at December 31, 2020 and $105 million December 31, 2019. The decrease is the result of closing of an inactive correspondent relationship during the second quarter of this year.
During the normal course of business, Bancorp enters into certain forms of off-balance sheet transactions, including unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. These transactions are managed through Bancorp’s various risk management processes. Management considers both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet transactions in its evaluation of Bancorp’s liquidity.
Bancorp’s principal source of cash revenue is dividends paid to it as the sole shareholder of the Bank. As discussed in the footnote titled “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” as of January 1st of any year, the Bank may pay dividends in an amount equal to the Bank’s net income of the prior two years less any dividends paid for the same two years. At December 31, 2020, the Bank may pay an amount equal to $74 million in dividends to Bancorp without regulatory approval subject to ongoing capital requirements of the Bank.
Sources and Uses of Cash
Cash flow is provided primarily through financing activities of Bancorp, which include raising deposits and borrowing funds from institutional sources such as advances from FHLB and FFP, as well as scheduled loan repayments and cash flows from AFS debt securities. These funds are primarily used to facilitate investment activities of Bancorp, which include making loans and purchasing securities for the investment portfolio. Another important source of cash is net income of the Bank from operating activities. For further detail regarding the sources and uses of cash, see the “Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows” in Bancorp’s consolidated financial statements.
Commitments
In the normal course of business, Bancorp is party to activities that contain credit, market and operational risk that are not reflected in whole or in part in Bancorp’s consolidated financial statements. Such activities include traditional off-balance sheet credit-related financial instruments, commitments under operating leases and long-term debt.
Bancorp provides customers with off-balance sheet credit support through loan commitments and standby letters of credit. Unused loan commitments increased $218 million as of December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 consistent with the pay down activity seen for C&I lines of credit and significantly lower line utilization rates stemming from customer use of PPP funding. The C&I line utilization rate fell from 43% at December 31, 2019 to 28% at December 31, 2020.
Commitments to extend credit are an agreement to lend to a customer as long as collateral is available as agreed upon and there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Bancorp uses the same credit and collateral policies in making commitments and conditional guarantees as for on-balance sheet instruments. Bancorp evaluates each customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained is based on management’s credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, securities, equipment and real estate. However, should the commitments be drawn upon and should our customers default on their resulting obligation to us, our maximum exposure to credit loss, without consideration of collateral, is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments.
Additional detail regarding credit-related financial instruments, including both commitments to extend credit and letters of credit at December 31, 2020 are as follows:
At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, Bancorp had accrued $5.4 million and $350,000, respectively, in other liabilities for its estimate of inherent risks related to unfunded credit commitments. In accordance with the adoption of ASC 326 on January 1, 2020, Bancorp’s ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures was increased from $350,000 at December 31, 2019 to $3.9 million ($2.6 million net of the DTA) with the offset recorded to retained earnings on a tax-effected basis, with no impact on earnings. Also, based on periodic analysis of its unused lines of credit, Bancorp recorded $1.5 million in additional off-balance sheet credit exposure expense for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is related to underlying CECL model factors and a significant decline in line of credit usage related to the pandemic.
Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by Bancorp to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party beneficiary. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support commercial transactions. Standby letters of credit generally have maturities of one to two years.
In addition to owned banking facilities, Bancorp has entered into long-term leasing arrangements for certain branch facilities. Bancorp also has required future payments for a non-qualified defined benefit retirement plan, FHLB advances, time deposit maturities and other obligations.
Required payments under such commitments at December 31, 2020 are as follows:
(1) Includes assumed renewals
(2) Consists primarily of contractual requirements relating to tax credit investments and community sponsorships
See the footnote titled “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” for additional detail.
Capital
Information pertaining to Bancorp’s capital balances and ratios follows:
Bancorp increased its cash dividends declared to stockholders during 2020 to an annual dividend of $1.08, up from $1.04 per share in 2019 and $0.96 in 2018. This represents a payout ratio of 41.38% based on basic EPS and an annual dividend yield of 2.67% based upon an annualized fourth quarter dividend rate and year-end closing stock price.
At December 31, 2020, stockholders’ equity totaled $441 million, an increase of $34 million, or 8%, since December 31, 2019, as 2020 net income of $58.9 million and the positive change in AOCI were offset by CECL related adjustments and dividends declared. AOCI consists of net unrealized gains or losses on AFS debt securities and hedging instruments, as well as a minimum pension liability, each net of income taxes. AOCI was $8.7 million at December 31, 2020 compared with $677,000 at December 31, 2019 with the fluctuation stemming from the changing interest rate environment and corresponding valuation of the AFS debt securities portfolio. See the “Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders’ Equity” for further detail of changes in equity.
In May 2019, Bancorp’s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to 1 million shares, or approximately 4% of Bancorp’s total common shares outstanding at the time. The plan, which will expire in May 2021 unless otherwise extended or completed at an earlier date, does not obligate Bancorp to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of shares prior to the plan’s expiration. During 2019, Bancorp repurchased 259,000 shares at a weighted average price per share of $35.46. In addition to a $28 million dividend to Bancorp during the second quarter of 2019 to consummate the 2019 acquisition, the Bank paid up an $18.5 million dividend during the third quarter of 2019 to support the share repurchase program. Based on recent economic developments and the increased importance of capital preservation, no shares have been repurchased in 2020 and Management does not intend to resume repurchasing in the near-term. Approximately 741,000 shares remain eligible for repurchase under the current repurchase plan.
Bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks are required by regulators to meet risk-based capital standards. These standards, or ratios, measure the relationship of capital to a combination of balance sheet and off-balance sheet risks. The value of both balance sheet and off-balance sheet items are adjusted to reflect credit risks. See the footnote titled “Regulatory Matters” for additional detail regarding regulatory capital requirements, as well as capital ratios of Bancorp and the Bank. The Bank exceeds regulatory capital ratios required to be well-capitalized. Regulatory framework does not define well-capitalized for holding companies. Management considers the effects of growth on capital ratios as it contemplates plans for expansion.
The following table sets forth consolidated Bancorp’s and the Bank’s risk based capital ratios:
(1) Under banking agencies’ risk-based capital guidelines, assets and credit-equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance sheet credit exposures are assigned to broad risk categories. The aggregate dollar amount in each risk category is multiplied by the associated risk weight of the category. Weighted values are added together, resulting in Bancorp's total risk-weighted assets. These ratios are computed in relation to average assets.
(2) Ratio is computed in relation to average assets.
As noted in the table above, Bancorp and the Bank experienced a decline in leverage ratio from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. The leverage ratio, which consists of tier-1 capital divided by adjusted quarterly average assets, was negatively impacted due to the larger balance sheet growth attributed to participation in the initial round of PPP during the second quarter of 2020. Bancorp is projecting to book approximately 1,300 of “second draw” PPP loans totaling $220 million relating to the second round of PPP. This will normalize over time, as PPP loans pay-off early or ultimately mature.
Banking regulators have categorized the Bank as well-capitalized. The regulations in accordance with Basel III define “well-capitalized” as a 6.5% Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio, an 8.0% Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio, a 10.0% Total Risk-Based Capital ratio and a 5.0% Tier 1 Leverage ratio.
Additionally, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, Bancorp and Bank must hold a capital conservation buffer composed of Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital above minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer set forth by the Basel III regulatory capital framework was 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above the minimum risk based capital ratio requirements at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress and requires increased capital levels for the purpose of capital distributions and other payments. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, Bancorp’s and SYB’s risk based capital exceeded the required capital conservation buffer.
Bancorp continues to exceed the regulatory requirements for Total Risk Based Capital, Common Equity Tier I Risk Based Capital, Tier I Risk Based Capital and Tier I Leverage. Bancorp and the Bank intend to maintain a capital position that meets or exceeds the “well-capitalized” requirements as defined by the FRB and the FDIC, in addition to the capital conservation buffer. There are no conditions or events since December 31, 2020 that management believes have changed Bancorp’s well-capitalized status.
As permitted by the interim final rule issued on March 27, 2020 by the federal banking regulatory agencies, Bancorp elected the option to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital related to the adoption of ASC 326 “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses,” or CECL, which was effective January 1, 2020. The initial impact of adoption of ASC 326, as well as 25% of the quarterly increases in the ACL subsequent to adoption of ASC 326 (collectively the “transition adjustments”) were declared to be delayed for two years. After two years, the cumulative amount of the transition adjustments will become fixed and will be phased out of the regulatory capital calculations evenly over a three-year period, with 75% recognized in year three, 50% recognized in year four and 25% recognized in year five. After five years, the temporary regulatory capital benefits will be fully reversed. Had Bancorp not elected to defer the regulatory capital impact of CECL, the post ASC 326 adoption capital ratios of Bancorp and the Bank would still have exceeded the well-capitalized level.
Fair Value Measurements
Bancorp follows the provisions of authoritative guidance for fair value measurements. This guidance is definitional and disclosure oriented and addresses how companies should approach measuring fair value when required by GAAP. It prescribes various disclosures about financial statement categories and amounts which are measured at fair value, if such disclosures are not already specified elsewhere in GAAP.
Authoritative guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between participants at the measurement date. The guidance requires fair value measurements to be classified as Level 1 (quoted prices), Level 2 (based on observable inputs) or Level 3 (based on significant unobservable, internally-derived inputs).
Bancorp’s AFS debt securities and interest rate swaps are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Other accounts including mortgage loans held for sale, MSRs, impaired loans and OREO may be recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis, generally in the application of lower of cost or market adjustments or write-downs of specific assets.
The AFS debt securities portfolio is comprised of U.S. Treasury and other U.S. government obligations, debt securities of U.S. government-sponsored corporations (including mortgage-backed securities), and obligations of state and political subdivisions. U.S. Treasury securities are priced using quoted prices of identical securities in an active market. These measurements are classified as Level 1 in the hierarchy above. All other securities are priced using standard industry models or matrices with various assumptions such as yield curves, volatility, prepayment speeds, default rates, time value, credit rating and market prices for similar instruments. These assumptions are generally observable in the market place and can be derived from or supported by observable data. These measurements are classified as Level 2 in the hierarchy above.
Interest rate swaps are valued using primarily Level 2 inputs. Fair value measurements generally based on benchmark forward yield curves and other relevant observable market data. For purposes of potential valuation adjustments to derivative positions, Bancorp evaluates the credit risk of its counterparties as well as its own credit risk. To date, Bancorp has not realized any losses due to a counterparty’s inability to perform and the change in value of derivative assets and liabilities attributable to credit risk was not significant during 2018, 2019 and 2020.
MSRs, carried in other assets and recorded at fair value upon capitalization, are amortized to correspond with estimated servicing income and are periodically assessed for impairment based on fair value at the reporting date. Fair value is based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated net servicing income. The model incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income. These measurements are classified as Level 3. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, there was no valuation allowance for MSRs, as fair value exceeded carrying value.
Loans considered to be collateral dependent are measured for impairment and, if indicated, a specific allocation is established based on the value of underlying collateral. Collateral dependent loans include non-accrual loans and loans accounted for as TDRs. For collateral dependent loans, fair value amounts represent only those loans with specific valuation allowances and loans charged down to their carrying value. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the carrying value of collateral dependent loans measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis was $7.5 million and $7.3 million. These measurements are classified as Level 3.
OREO, which is carried in other assets at the lower of cost or fair value, is periodically assessed for impairment based on fair value at the reporting date. Fair value is commonly based on recent real estate appraisals or valuations performed by internal or external parties which use judgments and assumptions that are property-specific and sensitive to changes in the overall economic environment. Appraisals may be further discounted based on management’s historical knowledge and/or changes in market conditions from the date of the most recent appraisal. Many of these inputs are not observable and, accordingly, these measurements are classified as Level 3. OREO is equal to the carrying value of only parcels of OREO for which carrying value equals appraised value. If a parcel of OREO has a carrying value below its appraised value, it is not considered to be carried at fair value. The losses represent write-downs which occurred during the period indicated. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the carrying value of OREO was $281,000 and $493,000.
See the Footnote titled “Assets and Liabilities Measured and Reported at Fair Value,” for additional detail regarding fair value measurements.
