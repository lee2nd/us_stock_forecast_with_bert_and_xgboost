Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
Our cash balance was $20,058 as of June 30, 2020. We believe our cash balance is not sufficient to fund our limited levels of operations for any period of time. We have been utilizing funds borrowed from our Chairman. The Chairman has no commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. The borrowing is non-interest-bearing, unsecured, and due on demand.
Our independent registered public accountants have issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company continues as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has accumulated deficit of $ 2,669,774 and negative working capital of $178,985 as of June 30, 2020, and net loss of $1,894,320 and no cash flows in operating activities for the year ended June 30, 2020. Due to these conditions, it raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.
We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to: not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; exemptions from the requirements of holding an annual non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and nonbinding stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are choosing to “opt out” of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.
Results of Operations for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019
Operating expenses
General and administrative expenses were $75,110 for the year ended June 30, 2020, compared to $27,617 for the year ended June 30, 2019, an increase of $47,493. The increase is due to an increase in filing fees and consulting expenses.
Professional fees were $144,980 for the year ended June 30, 2020, compared to $63,534 for the year ended June 30, 2019, an increase of $81,446. Professional fees consist mainly of legal, accounting and audit expense. The increase is due to an increase in legal and audit fees.
Other income (expense)
For the year ended June 30, 2020, we had interest expense of $4,590 and a loss on conversion of debt of $6,000, compared to interest expense of $2,732 for the year ended June 30, 2019. In addition, there was a loss on conversion of accrued salaries of $148,000 for the year ended June 30, 2020 and $448,000 for the year ended June 30, 2019. Interest expense has increased as a result of the two notes payable that were added to the Company’s liabilities.
Net Loss
Net loss for the year ended June 30, 2020 was $1,894,320 compared to $141,882 for the year ended June 30, 2019.
Plan of Operations
We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through borrowing from related parties. Subsequent to the year end the Company acquired the mining claims and equipment assets of Troy Mining Corporation. We continue to search for other new business opportunities in the mining arena.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Material Commitments
As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any material commitments.
Purchase of Significant Equipment
We do not intend to purchase any significant equipment during the next twelve months.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $2,669,774 and negative working capital of $178,985 as of June 30, 2020. For the year ended June 30, 2020 the Company had a net loss of $1,894,320 with $135,591 of cash used in operating activities. Due to these conditions, it raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Net cash used in operating activities was $135,591 for the year ended June 30, 2020 as compared to the net cash used in operating activities of $44,910 for the year ended June 30, 2019. The increase in net cash used in operating activities from 2019 to 2020 is because expenses increases during the year ended June 30, 2020.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $155,178 and $45,081 for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Over the next twelve months, we expect our principle source of liquidity may be dependent on borrowings from related parties.
Going Concern Consideration
Our auditors have issued a “going concern” opinion, meaning that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital. The Company’s cash position may not be sufficient to support its daily operations.
Limited operating history and need for additional capital
There is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in start-up stage operations and have not generated any significant revenues. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products.
