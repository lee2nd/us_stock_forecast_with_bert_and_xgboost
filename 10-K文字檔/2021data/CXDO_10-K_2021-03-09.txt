OVERVIEW
Crexendo, Inc. is an award-winning premier provider of cloud communications, UCaaS (Unified Communications as a Service), call center, collaboration services, and other cloud business services that are designed to provide enterprise-class cloud services to any size business at affordable monthly rates. The Company has two operating segments, which consist of Cloud Telecommunications and Web Services.
Cloud Telecommunications - Our cloud telecommunications services transmit calls using IP or cloud technology, which converts voice signals into digital data packets for transmission over the Internet or cloud. Each of our calling plans provides a number of basic features typically offered by traditional telephone service providers, plus a wide range of enhanced features that we believe offer an attractive value proposition to our customers. This platform enables a user, via a single “identity” or telephone number, to access and utilize services and features regardless of how the user is connected to the Internet or cloud, whether it’s from a desktop device, computer, or an application on a mobile device.
We generate recurring revenue from our cloud telecommunications and broadband Internet services. Our cloud telecommunications contracts typically have a thirty-six to sixty month term. We generate product revenue and equipment financing revenue from the sale and lease of our cloud telecommunications equipment. Revenues from the sale of equipment, including those from sales-type leases, are recognized at the time of sale or at the inception of the lease, as appropriate.
Our Cloud Telecommunications service revenue increased 16% or $1,913,000 to $14,002,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $12,089,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our Cloud Telecommunications product revenue increased 9% or $152,000 to $1,843,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $1,691,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our backlog was $28,551,000 and $26,110,000, respectively.
Web Services - We generate recurring revenue from website hosting and other professional services.
Our Web Services revenue decreased 17% or $114,000 to $542,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $656,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Results of Consolidated Operations
The following discussion of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto and other financial information included herein this Annual Report.
Results of Consolidated Operations (in thousands, except for per share amounts)
-------
(1)
Earnings per common share is computed independently for each of the quarters presented. Therefore, the sums of quarterly earnings per common share amounts do not necessarily equal the total for the twelve month periods presented.
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31,
Service Revenue
Service revenue consists primarily of fees collected for cloud telecommunications services, professional services, interest from sales-type leases, reselling broadband Internet services, administrative fees, website hosting, and web management services. Service revenue increased 14% or $1,799,000, to $14,544,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $12,745,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Cloud Telecommunications service revenue increased 16% or $1,913,000, to $14,002,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $12,089,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Web service revenue decreased 17% or $114,000, to $542,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $656,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Product Revenue
Product revenue consists primarily of fees collected for the sale of desktop phone devices and third-party equipment. Product revenue increased by 9% or $152,000, to $1,843,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $1,691,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Product revenue fluctuates from one period to the next based on timing of installations. Our typical customer installation is complete within 30-60 days. However, larger enterprise customers can take multiple months, depending on size and the number of locations. Product revenue is recognized when products have been installed and services commence.
Income Before Income Taxes
Income before income tax increased 66% or $754,000 to $1,899,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to Income before income tax of $1,145,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in income before income tax is primarily due to an increase in revenue of $1,951,000 and from the extinguishment of PPP debt of $1,007,000, offset by an increase in total operating expenses of $2,095,000 and an increase in other expense of $109,000.
Income Tax Benefit/(Provision)
We had an income tax benefit of $6,041,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to an income tax provision of ($6,000) for the year ended December 31, 2019. We had pre-tax income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 of $1,899,000 and $1,145,000, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded a valuation allowance release of $7,487,000 and $972,000, respectively, on the basis of management’s reassessment of the amount of its deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To evaluate our business, we consider and use non-generally accepted accounting principles (“Non-GAAP”) net income and Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of operating performance. These measures include the same adjustments that management takes into account when it reviews and assesses operating performance on a period-to-period basis. We consider Non-GAAP net income to be an important indicator of overall business performance because it allows us to evaluate results without the effects of share-based compensation and amortization of intangibles. We define EBITDA as U.S. GAAP net income before interest income, interest expense, other income and expense, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. We believe EBITDA provides a useful metric to investors to compare us with other companies within our industry and across industries. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for share-based compensation. We use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to review and assess operating performance. We also believe use of Adjusted EBITDA facilitates investors’ use of operating performance comparisons from period to period, as well as across companies.
In our March 9, 2021 earnings press release, as furnished on Form 8-K, we included Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. The terms Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA are not defined under U.S. GAAP, and are not measures of operating income, operating performance or liquidity presented in analytical tools, and when assessing our operating performance, Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for net income or other consolidated income statement data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations include, but are not limited to:
●
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;
●
they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;
●
they do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt that we may incur;
●
they do not reflect income taxes or the cash requirements for any tax payments;
●
although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will be replaced sometime in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements;
●
while share-based compensation is a component of operating expense, the impact on our financial statements compared to other companies can vary significantly due to such factors as the assumed life of the options and the assumed volatility of our common stock; and
●
other companies may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.
We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA only as supplemental support for management’s analysis of business performance. Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are calculated as follows for the periods presented.
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In accordance with the requirements of Regulation G issued by the SEC, we are presenting the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures and reconciling the unaudited Non-GAAP financial metrics to the comparable U.S. GAAP measures.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The following accounting policies are the most critical in understanding our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, and that may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services and excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. We recognize revenue for delivered elements only when we determine there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance. Changes in the allocation of the sales price between delivered and undelivered elements can impact the timing of revenue recognized but does not change the total revenue recognized on any agreement.
The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their relative stand-alone selling prices. The stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the prices at which the Company separately sells the products and services. For items that are not sold separately (e.g. additional features) the Company estimates stand-alone selling prices using the adjusted market assessment approach. Professional services revenue includes activation fees and any professional installation services. Installation services are recognized as revenue when the services are completed. The Company generally allocates a portion of the activation fees to the desktop devices, which is recognized at the time of the installation or customer acceptance, and a portion to the service, which is recognized over the contract term using the straight-line method. Our telecommunications services contracts typically have a term of thirty-six to sixty months. When we provide a free trial period, we do not begin to recognize recurring revenue until the trial period has ended and the customer has been billed for the services.
Goodwill
We have recorded goodwill as a result of past business acquisitions. Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired. In each of our acquisitions, the objective of the acquisition was to expand our product offerings and customer base and to achieve synergies related to cross selling opportunities, all of which contributed to the recognition of goodwill. We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit is determined using our market capitalization as of our annual impairment assessment date or more frequently if circumstances indicate the goodwill might be impaired. Items that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect key assumptions used in estimating fair value include but are not limited to: sustained decline in our stock price due to a decline in our financial performance due to the loss of key customers, loss of key personnel, emergence of new technologies or new competitors; and decline in overall market or economic conditions leading to a decline in our stock price.
Intangible Assets
Our intangible assets consist of customer relationships. The intangible assets are amortized following the patterns in which the economic benefits are consumed. We periodically review the estimated useful lives of our intangible assets and review these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. The determination of impairment is based on estimates of future undiscounted cash flows. If an intangible asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of the impairment will be equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset.
Deferred Taxes
Our provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion. The current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. The deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards using expected tax rates in effect during the years in which the differences are expected to reverse or the carryforwards are expected to be realized.
We currently have net deferred tax assets consisting of net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences. Management periodically weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. As a result of our recent three years of cumulative pretax income and the weight of all other positive and negative evidence, management determined that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize $6,054,000 of our deferred tax assets and we have released $7,487,000 of our valuation allowance as of December 31, 2020. Forecasts and projections of future pretax income are inherently subjective and require management to make assumption or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain.
Product Warranty
We provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time we recognize revenue. We evaluate our warranty obligations on a product group basis. Our standard product warranty terms generally include post-sales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period of time. We base our estimated warranty obligation upon warranty terms, ongoing product failure rates, and current period product shipments. If actual product failure rates, repair rates or any other post-sales support costs were to differ from our estimates, we would be required to make revisions to the estimated warranty liability. Warranty terms generally last for the duration that the customer has service.
Contingent Liabilities
Contingent liabilities require significant judgment in estimating potential payouts. Contingent considerations arising from business combinations and asset acquisitions require management to estimate future payouts based on forecasted results, which are highly sensitive to the estimates of discount rates and future revenues. These estimates can change significantly from period to period and are reviewed each reporting period to establish the fair value of the contingent liability.
Share-Based Compensation
We account for our share-based compensation awards using the fair-value method. The grant date fair value was determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model. The Black-Scholes-Merton valuation calculation requires us to make key assumptions such as future stock price volatility, expected terms, risk-free rates, and dividend yield. Our expected volatility is derived from our volatility rate as a publicly traded company. The expected term is based on our historical experience. The risk-free interest factor is based on the United States Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant for zero coupon United States Treasury notes with maturities of approximately equal to each grant’s expected term. We have not paid cash dividends in the last three years and do not currently intend to pay cash dividends, and therefore, we have assumed a 0% dividend yield.
We develop an estimate of the number of share-based awards that will be forfeited due to employee turnover. We will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected term, volatility, and forfeiture rate related to our own share-based awards on a prospective basis, and in incorporating these factors into the model. If our actual experience differs significantly from the assumptions used to compute our share-based compensation cost, or if different assumptions had been used, we may have recorded too much or too little share-based compensation cost.
For additional information on use of estimates, see summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Segment Operating Results
The Company has two operating segments, which consist of Cloud Telecommunications and Web Services. The information below is organized in accordance with our two reportable segments. Segment operating income is equal to segment net revenue less segment cost of service revenue, cost of product revenue, sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses.
Operating Results of our Cloud Telecommunications Segment (in thousands):
Quarterly Financial Information
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31,
Service Revenue
Cloud Telecommunications service revenue consists primarily of fees collected for cloud telecommunications services, professional services, interest from sales-type leases, administrative fees, and reselling broadband Internet services. Service revenue increased 16% or $1,913,000, to $14,002,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $12,089,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is due to an increase in contracted service revenue and usage charges of $1,785,000, an increase in fees, commissions, and other, recognized over time of $137,000, and an increase in sales-type lease interest of $106,000, offset by a decrease in one time fees, commissions and other of $115,000 due to less professional installation fees. A substantial portion of Cloud Telecommunications segment revenue is generated through thirty-six to sixty month service contracts.
Product Revenue
Product revenue consists primarily of fees collected for the sale of desktop phone devices and third party equipment. Product revenue increased 9% or $152,000, to $1,843,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $1,691,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Product revenue fluctuates from one period to the next based on timing of installations, as we recognize revenue when the installation is complete. Our typical customer installation is complete within 30-60 days. However, larger enterprise customers can take multiple months, depending on size and the number of locations. Product revenue is recognized when products have been installed and services commence.
Backlog
Backlog represents the total contract value of all contracts signed, less revenue recognized from those contracts as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Backlog increased 9% or $2,441,000 to $28,551,000 as of December 31, 2020 as compared to $26,110,000 as of December 31, 2019. Below is a table which displays the Cloud Telecommunications segment revenue backlog as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, which we expect to recognize as revenue within the next thirty-six to sixty months (in thousands):
Cost of Service Revenue
Cost of service revenue consists primarily of fees we pay to third-party telecommunications carriers, broadband Internet providers, software providers, costs related to installations, credit card processing fees, shipping charges, customer support salaries and benefits, and share-based compensation. Cost of service revenue increased 12% or $391,000, to $3,745,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $3,354,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in cost of service revenue was due to an increase in salaries, benefits, and temporary labor costs of $224,000, an increase in third-party telecommunications carrier costs of $168,000, an increase in credit card processing fees of $43,000, an increase in profit sharing expense of $33,000, an increase in share-based compensation of $25,000, an increase in freight of $15,000, and an increase in other cost of revenue of $2,000, offset by a decrease in costs related to installations of $108,000 and a decrease in bonuses of $11,000. These increases are directly related to the growth in monthly recurring revenue.
Cost of Product Revenue
Cost of product revenue consists of the costs associated with desktop phone devices and third-party equipment. Cost of product revenue increased 24% or $215,000, to $1,110,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $895,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is primarily related to the increase in product revenue and an increase in device product costs, offset by a decrease in product warranty costs.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses primarily consist of salaries and benefits, share-based compensation, and outsourced engineering services related to the development of new cloud telecommunications features and products. Research and development expenses increased 41% or $336,000, to $1,157,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $821,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. There was an increase in salaries and benefits of $197,000 as a result of an increase in headcount as we continue to invest in our solution and an increase in share-based compensation of $22,000, offset by a decrease in bonuses of $9,000. We also increased additional development costs for maintenance on our customer user interface, our Android and iPhone mobile phone applications, product testing, and Java development $126,000.
Selling and Marketing
Selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of direct and channel sales representative salaries and benefits, share-based compensation, partner channel commissions, amortization of costs to acquire contracts, travel expenses, lead generation services, trade shows, third-party marketing services, the production of marketing materials, and sales support software. Selling and marketing expenses increased 8% or $291,000, to $4,153,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $3,862,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in selling and marketing expense was due to an increase in commission expenses of $204,000 directly related to an increase in revenue, an increase in salaries and benefits of $162,000 primarily related to the addition of a new director of marketing and the development of our customer success department, an increase in recruitment expenses of $18,000, and an increase in share-based compensation of $16,000, offset by a decrease in travel expenses of $74,000, a decrease in sales lead generation cost of $26,000, and a decrease in other sales and marketing expenses of $9,000, primarily related to consulting fees, web developer fees, and advertising expenses.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and benefits for executives, administrative personnel, legal, rent, equipment, accounting and other professional services, investor relations, and other administrative corporate expenses. General and administrative expenses increased 21% or $847,000, to $4,831,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $3,984,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Consolidated general and administrative expenses increased 21%, or $872,000 to $5,107,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $4,235,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. As Web Services segment revenue has decreased and Cloud Telecommunications segment revenue has increased, a higher percentage of general and administrative costs are being allocated to the Cloud Telecommunications segment. Therefore, we will discuss changes in our consolidated general and administrative expenses. The increase in consolidated general and administrative expenses is primarily due to an increase in administrative salaries, benefits, and bonuses of $238,000 due to the hiring of our Chief Revenue Officer, the conversion of our general counsel and corporate secretary to full-time, salary increases and related employer payroll taxes, an increase in share-based compensation of $160,000, an increase in depreciation expense of $124,000 from an acceleration of leasehold improvements amortization and depreciation of the corporate office building directly related to the purchase of the corporate office building and from depreciation of additional data center related licenses, an increase in stock exchange uplisting and annual fees of $103,000 related to our uplisting from the OTCQX marketplace to the Nasdaq Capital Markets, an increase in recruiting fees of $88,000, an increase in contractor costs of $84,000, an increase in legal fees of $83,000, an increase in telecommunication regulatory fees of $70,000, an increase in software expense of $69,000, an increase in computer, office equipment, and data center maintenance costs of $42,000, an increase in intangible amortization expense of $39,000 related to the DoubleHorn asset acquisition, an increase in repairs and maintenance expense of $30,000, an increase in corporate insurance costs of $12,000, and an increase in other administrative corporate expenses of $5,000, offset by a decrease in rent expense of $275,000 related to the purchase of our corporate office building.
Other Income/(Expense)
Other income/(expense) primarily relates to gain on extinguishment of debt, the allocated portions of interest expense, offset by credit card cash back rewards. Net other income increased 47,050% or $941,000 to $939,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared net other expense of ($2,000) for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is due to $1,007,000 for the extinguishment of the PPP loan, including accrued interest, offset by an increase in allocated interest expense of $63,000 for interest paid on finance agreements and a decrease in credit card cash back rewards of $3,000.
Operating Results of our Web Services Segment (in thousands):
Quarterly Financial Information
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31,
Service Revenue
Service revenue is generated primarily through website hosting and professional web management services. Web services revenue decreased 17% or $114,000, to $542,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $656,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in service revenue is primarily due to a decrease in hosting revenue of $109,000 and a $5,000 decrease in professional web management services.
Cost of Service Revenue
Cost of service revenue consists primarily of bandwidth, web domain registration fees, customer service salaries and benefits, temporary labor cost, and credit card processing fees. Cost of service revenue decreased 10% or $10,000, to $92,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $102,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in cost of revenue is primarily related to a decrease in web domain costs of $5,000, a decrease in credit card fees of $3,000, and a decrease in customer service salaries, benefits, and temporary labor of $2,000, directly related to decrease in revenue.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses primarily consist of salaries and benefits, and related expenses which are attributable to the development of our website development software products. Research and development expenses were $32,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $32,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and benefits for executives, administrative personnel, legal, rent, equipment, accounting and other professional services, investor relations, and other administrative corporate expenses. General and administrative expenses increased 10% or $25,000, to $276,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $251,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Consolidated general and administrative expenses increased 21%, or $872,000 to $5,107,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $4,235,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. As Web Services segment revenue has decreased and Cloud Telecommunications segment revenue has increased, a higher percentage of general and administrative costs are being allocated to the Cloud Telecommunications segment. Therefore, we will discuss changes in our consolidated general and administrative expenses. The increase in consolidated general and administrative expenses is primarily due to an increase in administrative salaries, benefits, and bonuses of $238,000 due to the hiring of our Chief Revenue Officer, the conversion of our general counsel and corporate secretary to full-time, salary increases and related employer payroll taxes, an increase in share-based compensation of $160,000, an increase in depreciation expense of $124,000 from an acceleration of leasehold improvements amortization and depreciation of the corporate office building directly related to the purchase of the corporate office building and from depreciation of additional data center related licenses, an increase in stock exchange uplisting and annual fees of $103,000 related to our uplisting from the OTCQX marketplace to the Nasdaq Capital Markets, an increase in recruiting fees of $88,000, an increase in contractor costs of $84,000, an increase in legal fees of $83,000, an increase in telecommunication regulatory fees of $70,000, an increase in software expense of $69,000, an increase in computer, office equipment, and data center maintenance costs of $42,000, an increase in intangible amortization expense of $39,000 related to the DoubleHorn asset acquisition, an increase in repairs and maintenance expense of $30,000, an increase in corporate insurance costs of $12,000, and an increase in other administrative corporate expenses of $5,000, offset by a decrease in rent expense of $275,000 related to the purchase of our corporate office building.
Other Income/(Expense)
Other income/(expense) primarily relates to interest income, foreign exchange gains or losses, the allocated portions of interest expense, and credit card cash back rewards. Net other income decreased 358% or $43,000, to ($31,000) of net other expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to net other income of $12,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in net other income is due to an increase in net foreign exchange losses of $39,000, a $2,000 decrease in interest income, and a $2,000 increase in allocated interest expense for interest on finance agreements.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $17,579,000 and $4,180,000 respectively. Changes in cash and cash equivalents are dependent upon changes in, among other things, working capital items such as contract liabilities, contract costs, accounts payable, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, and various accrued expenses, as well as purchases of property and equipment and changes in our capital and financial structure due to debt repayments and issuances, stock option exercises, sales of equity investments and similar events. We believe that our operations along with existing liquidity sources will satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months.
