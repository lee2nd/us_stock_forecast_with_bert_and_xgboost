ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
The following discussion and analysis should be read together with the sections entitled “Risk Factors,” “Selected Financial Data,” and the financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. In addition, the statements in this discussion and analysis regarding industry outlook, our expectations regarding the performance of our business, anticipated financial results, liquidity and the other non-historical statements are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described in “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and in “Risk Factors” above. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements.
This section generally discusses 2021 and 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. Discussions of 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and can be found in Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2020, which was filed with the SEC on September 11, 2020.
Key Performance Measures
From time to time we use certain key performance measures in evaluating our business and results of operations and we may refer to one or more of these key performance measures in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” These key performance measures include:
•
Unit sales volume - We define unit sales volume as the number of our boats sold to our dealers during a period.
•
Net sales per unit - We define net sales per unit as net sales divided by unit sales volume.
•
Gross margin - We define gross margin as gross profit divided by net sales, expressed as a percentage.
•
Net income margin - We define net income (loss) margin as net income divided by net sales, expressed as a percentage.
•
Adjusted EBITDA - We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”), as further adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges and unusual items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core/ongoing operations. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), see “Non-GAAP Measures” below.
•
Adjusted EBITDA margin - We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales, expressed as a percentage. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA margin to net income margin, see “Non-GAAP Measures” below.
•
Adjusted Net Income - We define Adjusted Net Income as net income (loss) adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges and other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core/ongoing operations and adjusted for the impact to income tax expense (benefit) related to non-GAAP adjustments. For a reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income to net income (loss), see “Non-GAAP Measures” below.
COVID-19 Pandemic
Though the Company has been impacted by supply chain disruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for our products has been strong and, as a result of our employees’ committed efforts, our facilities are now running at production rates above their pre-COVID-19 levels. However, we continue to be subject to risks and uncertainties as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business remains uncertain and difficult to predict, as the response to the COVID-19 pandemic is still evolving in many countries, including the United States and other markets where we and our suppliers operate.
Impact to Operations
To balance wholesale production with the then anticipated impacts to retail demand caused by the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we reduced production in February 2020, and, in late March 2020, temporarily suspended manufacturing operations at all of our facilities to protect the health of our employees and comply with governmental mandates. We resumed operations at reduced production levels at our manufacturing facilities by mid-May 2020. As governmental restrictions were lifted and as a result of social distancing abilities, demand in the U.S. retail marine market accelerated in May 2020, and has remained elevated, driving dealer inventory levels to historic lows, which remain at depressed levels despite our increased production rates being above pre-COVID-19 levels. Additionally, the Company’s operations have been impacted by supply chain disruptions. To reduce the impact of supply chain disruptions on production, the Company has increased its safety stock.
Impact to Liquidity and Capital Resources
On March 19, 2020, we drew $35.0 million on our revolving credit agreement as a precautionary measure in order to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of uncertainty in the global markets resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, on May 7, 2020, we entered into Amendment No. 3 (the “Amendment”) to the Fourth Amended & Restated Credit and Guarantee Agreement to strengthen our financial flexibility. Among other things, the changes effected by the Amendment provided temporary relief under our financial covenants. See Note 8 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding these changes, including sunsetting of the temporary relief provisions. The performance of the business and our cash management activities provided the flexibility to repay the entire $35.0 million revolving credit facility during the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Since that time, our strong operating performance has continued which has allowed us to refinance our debt and build our cash balance to $39.3 million as of June 30, 2021. The refinancing allowed us to reduce our borrowing under our term loan by $33.7 million by drawing that same amount on our revolving credit agreement, which leaves us with $66.3 million of availability under the revolving credit agreement as of June 30, 2021. These actions provide us with the flexibility to expedite principal payments on total debt. We were in compliance with our financial covenants as of June 30, 2021.
Outlook
We believe strong marine retail demand coupled with abnormally low dealer inventory levels for all our brands has created a growth opportunity, and as a result, we plan to further increase production rates, which are already above their pre-COVID-19 levels. However, as we navigate the unprecedented confluence of demand and disruption precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, our production rates going forward will depend, in large part, on our suppliers’ capacity and ability to remain open if infection rates increase. Additionally, demand for raw materials and components used in the production of our products has surged. As a result, some of the materials and components that we use, including certain resins, fiberglass, aluminum, lumber and steel, are in short supply. Our ability to grow also requires our Company to retain a high-performing workforce which will be critical to meeting our production objectives.
We will continue to actively monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and may take further actions to alter business operations as may be required by government authorities, or that are determined to be in the best interest of our employees, dealers, suppliers, and stakeholders. The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations, and financial results will depend on evolving factors that we cannot predict. See Item 1A “Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Our Business - Actual or potential public health emergencies, epidemics, or pandemics, such as the current coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.”
Overview of Results of Operations
Net sales were $525.8 million for fiscal 2021, an increase of 44.8 percent from fiscal 2020, which was impacted by, among other things, the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase was primarily the result of higher sales volumes, higher prices, and lower dealer incentives, partially offset by the impact of model mix.
Gross margin increased 390 basis points to 24.7 percent from fiscal 2020, primarily due to higher prices, higher sales volume, and lower dealer incentives. The increase was partially offset by costs associated with the transition of production of our Aviara brand to the Merritt Island, Florida facility and increased labor and material costs.
Net income was $56.2 million for fiscal 2021, compared to Net loss of $24.0 million for fiscal 2020. Diluted net income per share was $2.96, compared to Diluted net loss per share of $1.28 for fiscal 2020. Net loss for fiscal 2020 included Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of $56.4 million, or $(3.01) per diluted share.
Merritt Island Facility and Aviara Transition
On October 26, 2020, we completed the purchase of certain real property located in Merritt Island, Florida, including an approximately 140,000-square-foot boat manufacturing facility, (the “Merritt Island Facility”) for a purchase price of $14.2 million. We expanded our overall boat building capacity by moving all Aviara production to the Merritt Island Facility. While we believe this additional capacity will help facilitate Aviara’s long-term growth, importantly, relocating Aviara production from our Vonore, Tennessee facility provided for an immediate increase in capacity and productivity for our MasterCraft brand. We began producing Aviara in the Merritt Island Facility in December and shipments from the new facility commenced in the third quarter of fiscal 2021.
Results of Operations
The consolidated statements of operations presented below should be read together with “Selected Consolidated Financial Data,” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
We derived the consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 from our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in the future.
Fiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020
Net Sales. Net Sales for fiscal 2021 were $525.8 million, an increase of $162.7 million, or 44.8 percent, compared to $363.1 million for fiscal 2020. The increase was primarily due to:
•
A $116.8 million increase for the MasterCraft segment driven by a 47.4 percent increase in sales volumes, a favorable mix of higher priced and higher contented models, lower dealer incentives, and higher part sales volume,
•
a $41.0 million increase for the Crest segment resulting from a 66.5 percent increase in sales volume, lower dealer incentives, higher prices, and option favorability, and
•
a $4.9 million increase for the NauticStar segment, primarily due to higher sales volumes and higher prices, partially offset by unfavorable product mix.
Gross Profit and Gross Margin. Gross profit increased $54.6 million, or 72.5 percent, to $130.0 million compared to $75.4 million for the prior year. Gross margin increased 390 basis points to 24.7 percent in fiscal 2021 from 20.8 percent in fiscal 2020. The
increase was primarily due to higher prices, higher sales volume and lower dealer incentives. The increase was partially offset by costs to transition production of our Aviara brand to the Merritt Island, Florida facility and increased labor and material costs.
Operating Expenses. Operating expenses decreased $47.9 million, or 47.0 percent, to $54.0 million for fiscal 2021 compared to $101.9 million for fiscal 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by $56.4 million of goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges related to our NauticStar and Crest segments recorded in fiscal 2020. There were no impairment charges in fiscal 2021. See Note 6 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the impairment charges. In addition, the Company had lower selling and marketing costs in fiscal 2021 primarily due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease was partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses resulting from higher incentive compensation costs and additional investments related to product development and information technology.
Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased $1.7 million, or 14.5 percent, primarily driven by lower effective interest rates and lower average outstanding debt balances during fiscal 2021.
Loss on Extinguishment of Debt. Loss on extinguishment of debt totaling $0.7 million was recognized upon refinancing the Company’s debt in fiscal 2021. The loss is comprised of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the previously existing credit facility. See Note 8 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the Company’s debt refinancing.
Income Tax Expense (Benefit). Our consolidated effective income tax rate decreased to 21.8 percent for fiscal 2021 from 23.9 percent for fiscal 2020. See Note 9 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
Non-GAAP Measures
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin
We define EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA further adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges or other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core and/or ongoing operations. For the periods presented herein, these adjustments include Aviara transition costs, debt refinancing charges, goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges, Aviara (new brand) startup costs, COVID-19 shutdown costs, transaction expenses associated with an acquisition and certain non-cash items including share-based compensation and acquisition-related inventory step-up adjustments. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA expressed as a percentage of Net sales.
Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share
We define Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share as net income (loss) adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges or other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core and/or ongoing operations and adjusted for the impact to income tax expense (benefit) related to non-GAAP adjustments. For the periods presented herein, these adjustments include Aviara transition costs, debt refinancing charges, goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges, Aviara (new brand) startup costs, COVID-19 shutdown costs, transaction expenses associated with an acquisition, and certain non-cash items including other intangible asset amortization, share-based compensation, and an acquisition-related inventory step-up adjustment.
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Net Income per share, which we refer to collectively as the Non-GAAP Measures, are not measures of net income (loss) or operating income (loss) as determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The Non-GAAP Measures are not measures of performance in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), net income (loss) per share, or operating cash flows determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of cash flow. We believe that the inclusion of the Non-GAAP Measures is appropriate to provide additional information to investors because securities analysts and investors use the Non-GAAP Measures to assess our operating performance across periods on a consistent basis and to evaluate the relative risk of an investment in our securities. We use Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period that, when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than does U.S. GAAP measures alone. We believe Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share assists our board of directors, management, investors, and other users of the financial statements in comparing our net income (loss) on a consistent basis from period to period because it removes certain non-cash items and other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core and/or ongoing operations and adjusts for the impact to income tax expense (benefit) related to non-GAAP adjustments. The Non-GAAP Measures have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are:
•
Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements;
•
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;
•
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;
•
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our tax expense or any cash requirements to pay income taxes;
•
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest payments on our indebtedness; and
•
Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income per share, and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we do not consider to be indicative of our core and/or ongoing operations, but may nonetheless have a material impact on our results of operations.
In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of the Non-GAAP Measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including companies in our industry.
The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, and net income margin (expressed as a percentage of net sales) to Adjusted EBITDA margin (expressed as a percentage of net sales) for the periods indicated:

Change in Non-GAAP Financial Measure
Prior to fiscal year 2020, the Company’s calculation of a diluted per share amount of Adjusted Net Income included an adjustment to fully dilute this non-GAAP measure for all outstanding share-based compensation grants. This additional dilution was incorporated by adjusting the GAAP measure, Weighted Average Shares Used for the Computation of Basic earnings (loss) per share, as presented on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, to include a dilutive effect for all outstanding restricted stock awards, performance stock units, and stock options. Beginning with the fiscal year 2020 presentation, the Company no longer includes this additional dilution impact in its calculation of Adjusted Net Income per diluted share. The Company has instead utilized the Weighted Average Shares Used for the Computation of Basic and Diluted earnings (loss) per share as presented on the Consolidated Statements of Operations to calculate Adjusted Net Income per diluted share for all periods presented herein.
The Company believes that, because its outstanding share-based compensation grants no longer result in a material amount of dilution of its earnings as was the case nearer to the date of our IPO, the adjustment methodology previously used no longer provides meaningful information to management or other users of its financial statements. This change resulted in an increase of $0.02 in the year ended June 30, 2020 in the amount of Adjusted Net Income per diluted share from what would have been reported using the previous methodology. The change also resulted in an increase of $0.01 for the year ended June 30, 2019 in the amount of Adjusted Net Income per diluted share from what was previously reported. In addition, the fiscal 2019 amount for Transaction expense, in the reconciliation of net income (loss) per diluted share to Adjusted net income per diluted share, decreased by $0.01 from what was previously reported as a result of a change in the presentation of the impact of rounding.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary liquidity and capital resource needs are to finance working capital, fund capital expenditures, service our debt, and fund our stock repurchase program. Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash balance, cash generated from operating activities, our revolving credit agreement and the refinancing and/or new issuance of long-term debt.
Cash and cash equivalents totaled $39.3 million as of June 30, 2021, an increase of $23.0 million from $16.3 million as of June 30, 2020. Total debt as of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020 was $93.1 million and $108.6 million, respectively.
On June 28, 2021, we refinanced our debt and entered into a new credit agreement increasing the capacity under our revolving credit facility from $35.0 million to $100.0 million. As of June 30, 2021, we had $33.7 million outstanding under the facility, leaving $66.3 million of available borrowing capacity. Refer to Note 8 - Long-term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.
We believe our cash balance, cash from operations, and our ability to borrow, will be sufficient to provide for our liquidity and capital resource needs, including authorized stock repurchases.
The following table summarizes the cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities:
Fiscal 2021 Cash Flow
Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2021 totaled $68.5 million versus $30.2 million in fiscal 2020. The increase is primarily due to higher net earnings, net of non-cash items, partially offset by changes in working capital that were affected by production ramp-up activities as we experienced an increase in retail demand. Working capital is defined as Accounts receivable, Income tax receivable, Inventories, and Prepaid expenses and other current assets net of Accounts payable, Income tax payable, and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities as presented in the consolidated balance sheets, excluding the impact of acquisitions and non-cash adjustments. Accounts receivable increased $5.9 million primarily due to increased sales across all segments. Inventory increased $28.6 million, driven by increases to support higher production volumes and to increase safety stock to manage supply chain risk. Accounts payable increased $13.4 million primarily due to timing of payments and higher production activities. Accrued expenses and other current liabilities increased $12.2 million primarily driven by share-based compensation related to higher net earnings and higher warranty reserves for the increased sales volumes.
Net cash used for investing activities was $27.8 million, which primarily included capital expenditures. Our capital spending was focused on expanding our capacity by purchasing the Merritt Island Facility for $14.2 million, capital related to the Aviara transition to the Merritt Island Facility, and maintenance capital.
Net cash used for financing activities was $17.8 million and primarily related to net payments of long-term debt.
Fiscal 2020 Cash Flow
In fiscal 2020, net cash provided by operating activities totaled $30.2 million versus $55.9 million in fiscal 2019. This comparison reflects the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic where production was reduced, and temporarily suspended from late March to mid-May 2020. Accounts receivable decreased $6.3 million primarily due to reduced sales. Inventory decreased $4.8 million driven by lower production activities. Accounts payable decreased $6.9 million due to timing of payments and lower production activities. Accrued expenses and other current liabilities decreased $5.6 million driven by reduced dealer incentives and share-based compensation related to lower sales and financial results.
Net cash used for investing activities was $14.2 million, which primarily included capital expenditures. Our capital spending was focused on maintenance capital and purchasing the previously leased Crest Facility. Refer to Note 11 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.
Net cash used for financing activities was $5.5 million and primarily related to net payments of long-term debt.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company did not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements as of June 30, 2021.
Contractual Obligations
As of June 30, 2021, the Company’s contractual cash obligations were as follows:
(1)
See Note 8 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company's debt. “Long-Term Debt Obligations” refers to future cash principal payments.
(2)
Interest payments on variable rate debt instruments were calculated using June 30, 2021 interest rates and holding them constant for the life of the instruments.
(3)
Purchase obligations represent agreements with suppliers and vendors entered into as part of the normal course of business, including engine purchase commitments.
(4)
Unrecognized tax benefits of $3.8 million are not reflected in this table because the Company cannot predict when open income tax years will close with completed examinations. See Note 9 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Repurchase Obligations - The Company has reserves to cover potential losses associated with repurchase obligations based on historical experience and current facts and circumstances. We incurred no material impact from repurchase events during fiscal 2021, 2020, or 2019. An adverse change in retail sales, however, could require us to repurchase boats repossessed by floor plan financing companies upon an event of default by any of our dealers, subject in some cases to an annual limitation. See Note 11 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for more information related to our obligations under floor plan financing agreements.
Critical Accounting Policies
A “critical accounting policy” is one which is both important to the understanding of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management’s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ from those estimates and cause our reported net income (loss) to vary significantly from period to period.
We believe that the policies listed below involve the greatest degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, we believe these are the most critical to understand in order to evaluate fully our financial condition and results of operations. For additional information regarding these policies, see Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets - The Company does not amortize goodwill and other purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives. The Company’s intangible assets with finite lives consist primarily of dealer networks and are carried at their estimated fair values at the time of acquisition, less accumulated amortization.
Goodwill
The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at its annual impairment testing date, which is June 30, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying value. As part of the annual test, the Company may perform a qualitative, rather than quantitative, assessment to determine whether the fair values of its reporting units are “more likely than not” to be greater than their carrying values. In performing this qualitative analysis, the Company considers various factors, including the effect of market or industry changes and the reporting units' actual results compared to projected results.
If the fair value of a reporting unit does not meet the "more likely than not" criteria discussed above, the impairment test for goodwill is a quantitative test. This test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value then the goodwill is considered impaired and an impairment loss is recognized in an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
The Company calculates the fair value of its reporting units considering both the income approach and market approach. The income approach calculates the fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow approach. Internally forecasted future cash flows, which the Company believes reasonably approximate market participant assumptions, are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital (“Discount Rate”) developed for each reporting unit. The Discount Rate is developed using market observable inputs, as well as considering whether or not there is a measure of risk related to the specific reporting unit’s forecasted performance. Fair value under the market approach is determined for each unit by applying market multiples for comparable public companies to the unit’s financial results. The key judgements in these calculations are the assumptions used in determining the reporting unit’s forecasted future performance, including revenue growth and operating margins, as well as the perceived risk associated with those forecasts in determining the Discount Rate, along with selecting representative market multiples.
As of June 30, 2021, only the Mastercraft reporting unit has a goodwill balance. The fair value of this reporting unit substantially exceeds its carrying value. However, it is possible that the Company’s assumptions regarding the key judgements in this fair value calculation could change in the future. If actual results differ from the Company’s assumptions, it is possible that the MasterCraft reporting unit could incur goodwill impairment charges in future periods.
Other Intangible Assets
The Company's primary intangible assets other than goodwill are dealer networks and trade names acquired in business combinations. These intangible assets are initially valued using a methodology commensurate with the intended use of the asset. The dealer networks were valued using an income approach, which requires an estimate or forecast of the expected future cash flows from the dealer network through the application of the multi-period excess earnings approach. The fair value of trade names is measured using a relief-from-royalty approach, a variation of the income approach, which requires an estimate or forecast of the expected future cash flows. This method assumes the value of the trade name is the discounted cash flows of the amount that would be paid to third parties had the Company not owned the trade name and instead licensed the trade name from another company. The basis for future sales projections for these methods are based on internal revenue forecasts by reporting unit, which the Company believes represent reasonable market participant assumptions. The future cash flows are discounted using an applicable Discount Rate as well as any potential risk premium to reflect the inherent risk of holding a standalone intangible asset.
The key judgements in these fair value calculations, as applicable, are: assumptions used in developing internal revenue growth and dealer expense forecasts, assumed dealer attrition rates, the selection of an appropriate royalty rate, as well as the perceived risk associated with those forecasts in determining the Discount Rate.
The costs of amortizable intangible assets, including dealer networks, are recognized over their expected useful lives, approximately ten years for the dealer networks, using the straight-line method. Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate long-lived assets. Intangible assets not subject to amortization are assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an asset may be impaired. As part of the annual test, the Company may perform a qualitative, rather than quantitative, assessment to determine whether each trade name intangible asset is “more likely than not” impaired. In performing this qualitative analysis, the Company considers various factors, including macroeconomic events, industry and market events and cost related events. If the “more likely than not” criteria is not met, the impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset.
During fiscal 2020, impairment charges were incurred for the NauticStar and Crest trade name-related intangible asset, as well as during fiscal 2019 for the NauticStar trade name-related intangible asset. As of fiscal year-end 2021, which is our annual impairment testing date under ASC 350, there were favorable changes in circumstances as compared to those existing in fiscal 2020, such as strong marine retail demand coupled with record low retail inventory levels that have created a growth opportunity, which we believe indicates that it is not more likely than not that the current carrying values of these assets are higher than the fair values. Changes in assumptions and estimates such as declines in projected results, however, may affect the fair value of these intangible assets and could result in additional impairment charges in future periods.
Product Warranties - The Company offers warranties on the sale of certain products for periods of between one and five years. These warranties require us or our dealers to repair or replace defective products during the warranty period at no cost to the
consumer. We estimate the costs that may be incurred under our basic limited warranty and record as a liability the amount of such costs at the time the product revenue is recognized. The key judgements that affect our estimate for warranty liability include the number of units sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim. We periodically assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as actual claims are determined or as changes in the obligations become reasonably estimable. We also adjust our liability for specific warranty matters when they become known and exposure can be estimated. Future warranty claims may differ from our estimate of the warranty liability, which could lead to changes in the Company’s warranty liability in future periods.
Income Taxes-We are subject to income taxes in the United States of America and the United Kingdom. Our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rates, primarily due to changes in the valuation allowance and non-deductible expenses, as further described in Note 9 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, we cannot provide assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest.
Significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.
Realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in future periods. If future events cause us to conclude that it is not more likely than not that we will be able to recover the value of our deferred tax assets, we are required to establish a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets at that time.
Revenue Recognition - The Company’s revenue is derived primarily from the sale of boats and trailers, marine parts, and accessories to its independent dealers. The Company recognizes revenue when obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied and control over promised goods is transferred to a customer. For the majority of sales, this occurs when the product is released to the carrier responsible for transporting it to a customer. The Company typically receives payment within 5 business days of shipment. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration it expects to receive in exchange for a product. The Company offers dealer incentives that include wholesale rebates, retail rebates and promotions, floor plan reimbursement or cash discounts, and other allowances that are recorded as reductions of revenues in Net sales in the consolidated statements of operations. The consideration recognized represents the amount specified in a contract with a customer, net of estimated incentives the Company reasonably expects to pay. The estimated liability and reduction in revenue for dealer incentives is recorded at the time of sale. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible because actual results may differ from these estimates if conditions dictate the need to enhance or reduce sales promotion and incentive programs or if dealer achievement or other items vary from historical trends. Accrued dealer incentives are included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Rebates and Discounts
Dealers earn wholesale rebates based on purchase volume commitments and achievement of certain performance metrics. The Company estimates the amount of wholesale rebates based on historical achievement, forecasted volume, and assumptions regarding dealer behavior. Rebates that apply to boats already in dealer inventory are referred to as retail rebates. The Company estimates the amount of retail rebates based on historical data for specific boat models adjusted for forecasted sales volume, product mix, dealer and consumer behavior, and assumptions concerning market conditions. The Company also utilizes various programs whereby it offers cash discounts or agrees to reimburse its dealers for certain floor plan interest costs incurred by dealers for limited periods of time, generally ranging up to nine months.
Other Revenue Recognition Matters
Dealers generally have no right to return unsold boats. Occasionally, the Company may accept returns in limited circumstances and at the Company’s discretion under its warranty policy. The Company may be obligated, in the event of default by a dealer, to accept returns of unsold boats under its repurchase commitment to floor financing providers, who are able to obtain such boats through foreclosure. The repurchase commitment is on an individual unit basis with a term from the date it is financed by the lending
institution through the payment date by the dealer, generally not exceeding 30 months. The Company accounts for these arrangements as guarantees and recognizes a liability based on the estimated fair value of the repurchase obligation. The estimated fair value takes into account our estimate of the loss we will incur upon resale of any repurchases. The Company accrues the estimated fair value of this obligation based on the age of inventory currently under floor plan financing and estimated credit quality of dealers holding the inventory. Inputs used to estimate this fair value include significant unobservable inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use and, therefore, this liability is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. We incurred no material impact from repurchase events during fiscal 2021, 2020, or 2019. See Note 11 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on repurchase obligations.
