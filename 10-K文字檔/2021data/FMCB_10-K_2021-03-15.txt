Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Overview
Although the Company has initiated efforts to expand its geographic footprint into the East Bay area of San Francisco and Napa, California (see “Item 1. Business - Service Area”), the Company’s primary service area remains the mid Central Valley of California, a region that can be significantly impacted by the seasonal needs of the agricultural industry. Accordingly, discussion of the Company’s Financial Condition and Results of Operations is influenced by the seasonal banking needs of its agricultural customers (e.g., during the spring and summer customers draw down their deposit balances and increase loan borrowing to fund the purchase of equipment and planting of crops. Correspondingly, deposit balances are replenished and loans repaid in late fall and winter as crops are harvested and sold).
The Five-Year Period: 2016 through 2020
By early 2020 the Company’s primary service area had significantly recovered from the recession that began in late 2007. Then, late in the first quarter of 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic began, an event that would impact economies everywhere. Importantly, agriculture has been designated as an “essential” industry during the pandemic, helping to mitigate economic stress in the Company’s primary service area.
Despite this challenging economic environment, in management’s opinion, the Company’s operating performance over the past five years has been exceptionally strong.
We used certain non-GAAP financial measures to provide supplemental information regarding our performance in 2017. Income Tax Expense for the year ended 2017 included a one-time, non-cash $6.3 million charge related to the re-measurement of the Company’s Deferred Tax Asset (“DTA”) as a result of the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017. We believed that presenting Adjusted Net Income, excluding the impact of the DTA re-measurement charge, provides additional clarity to the users of financial statements regarding core financial performance and allows for a better year-over-year comparison of trends in core profitability.
(in thousands, except per share data)
Note 1 - On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law by the President. Among other things, this legislation reduced the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning January 1, 2018. Although the Company believes that this reduction in the corporate tax rate will continue to have a significant positive impact on future financial performance, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require that all companies re-measure their DTA’s using the new lower tax rate as of the date of enactment of the legislation. As a result the Company’s net income for 2017 included a $6.3 million re-measurement reflected as a one-time, non-cash increase to income tax expense in the 4th quarter. Our situation is not unique in that the majority of all financial institutions reported significant DTA re-measurements in the 4th quarter of 2017. Excluding the impact of the $6.3 million DTA re-measurement, non-GAAP adjusted net income for the year totaled $34.6 million, an increase of $5.0 million or 16.8% over the prior year, which would have resulted in an adjusted return on average assets of 1.15% and adjusted return on average equity of 11.79%.
Management believes that the Company’s performance compared very favorably to its peer banks during the five-year period ended December 31, 2020:
• Net income over the five-year period totaled $218 million.
• Return on Average Assets averaged 1.31% over the five-year period.
• Total assets increased 74% from $2.6 billion at December 31, 2015 to $4.6 billion at December 31, 2020.
• Total loans & leases increased 55.3% from $2.0 billion at December 31, 2015 to $3.1 billion at December 31, 2020.
• Total deposits increased 78.3% from $2.3 billion at December 31, 2015 to $4.1 billion at December 31, 2020.
More recently:
• In 2020, the Company earned $58.7 million for a return on average assets of 1.43%.
• In 2020, the Company increased its cash dividend per share by 3.9% over 2019 levels, and our strong financial performance has allowed us to increase dividends every year during this five-year period.
• The Company’s total risk based capital ratio was 12.60% at December 31, 2020, and the Bank achieved the highest regulatory classification of “well capitalized” in each of the previous five years. See “Financial Condition - Capital.”
• The Company’s asset quality remains very strong at the present time, when measured by: (1) net charge-offs at 0.02% of average loans & leases during 2020; (2) non-accrual loans of $495,000 at December 31, 2020; and (3) substandard loans & leases totaling 0.60% of total loans & leases at December 31, 2020. See “Results of Operations - Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses” and “Financial Condition - Classified Loans & Leases and Non-Performing Assets.”
Because of our strong earnings performance, capital position, and asset quality, stockholders have benefited from the fact that cash dividends per share have increased 14.34% since 2015, and totaled $69.50 per share over the five-year period. The 2020 dividend of $14.75 per share represents a 1.94% yield based upon the December 31, 2020 closing stock price of $760 per share (See “Part II, Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities”).
Looking Forward: 2021 and Beyond
In management’s opinion, the following key issues will continue to influence the financial results of the Company in 2021 and future years:
• The continuing impact of COVID-19.
• The Company’s earnings are heavily dependent on its net interest margin, which is sensitive to such factors as: (1) market interest rates; (2) the mix of our earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities; and (3) competitor pricing strategies. Since early 2020 market interest rates have declined and remain at very low levels. This has adversely impacted the Company’s NIM, and will, in all probability, continue to place pressure on NIM in 2021.
• The Company’s results are impacted by changes in the credit quality of its borrowers. Substandard loans & leases totaled $18.6 million or 0.60% of total loans & leases at December 31, 2020 vs. $16.2 million or 0.61% of total loans & leases at December 31, 2019. Management believes, based on information currently available, that these levels are adequately covered by the Company’s $58.9 million allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2020. See “Results of Operations - Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses” and “Financial Condition - Classified Loans & Leases and Non-Performing Assets.” The Company’s provision for credit losses was $4.5 million in 2020, compared to $200,000 in 2019 and $5.5 million in 2018. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
• Since the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010, Congress has implemented broad changes to the regulation of consumer financial products and the financial services industry as a whole. These changes have, and will continue to have, a significant effect on the Company’s product offerings, pricing and profitability in areas such as debit and credit cards, home mortgages and deposit service charges.
• The Company has: (i) expanded its geographic footprint through de novo branch expansion in Walnut Creek, Napa, Lockeford and Concord, CA and through acquisition in Manteca, Riverbank, Rio Vista, and Walnut Grove, CA; and (ii) established equipment leasing as a new line of business. Although Management believes that these initiatives will result in increased asset growth and earnings, along with reduced concentration risks, the start-up costs related to staff and facilities are significant and will take time to recoup.
• The Company benefited significantly in 2018 and 2019, and should continue to benefit in future years, from the reduction of the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% pursuant to the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. However, if the new Biden administration increases federal corporate tax rates it will negatively impact the Company’s future financial results.
Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis is intended to provide a better understanding of Farmers & Merchants Bancorp and its subsidiaries’ performance during each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020 and the material changes in financial condition, operating income, and expense of the Company and its subsidiaries as shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Impact of Bank of Rio Vista Acquisition on Results of Operations
On October 10, 2018, Farmers & Merchants Bancorp completed the acquisition of Bank of Rio Vista. Since the acquisition took place late in the year, and Bank of Rio Vista had only $217.5 million in assets (less than 6% of Farmers & Merchants Bancorp’s total assets), the impact on the Company’s 2018 Results of Operations was limited with the exception of legal fees, contract termination costs and systems conversion costs that were booked as non-interest expense by the Company in 2018. The gross amount of such expenses were $2.93 million.
Net Interest Income/Net Interest Margin
The tables on the following pages reflect the Company's average balance sheets and volume and rate analysis for the years ended 2020, 2019 and 2018. Average balance amounts for assets and liabilities are the computed average of daily balances.
Net interest income is the amount by which the interest and fees on loans & leases and other interest-earning assets exceed the interest paid on interest-bearing sources of funds. For the purpose of analysis, the interest earned on tax-exempt investments and municipal loans is adjusted to an amount comparable to interest subject to normal income taxes. This adjustment is referred to as “tax equivalent” adjustment and is noted wherever applicable. The presentation of net interest income and net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis is a common practice within the banking industry.
The Volume and Rate Analysis of Net Interest Income summarizes the changes in interest income and interest expense based on changes in average asset and liability balances (volume) and changes in average rates (rate). For each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided with respect to changes attributable to: (1) changes in volume (change in volume multiplied by initial rate); (2) changes in rate (change in rate multiplied by initial volume); and (3) changes in rate/volume, also called “changes in mix” (allocated in proportion to the respective volume and rate components).
The Company’s earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are subject to repricing at different times, which exposes the Company to income fluctuations when interest rates change. In order to minimize income fluctuations, the Company attempts to match asset and liability maturities. However, some maturity mismatch is inherent in the asset and liability mix. See “
