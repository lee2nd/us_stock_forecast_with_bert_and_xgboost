The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.
COVID-19 Response
The Company continues to deliver high service levels to customers, even in hard-hit areas around the world, and received positive feedback from customers, including critical infrastructure providers, such as supermarkets and financial institutions, as to how effectively it has responded to the pandemic. The Company has taken steps to ensure its global manufacturing and production facilities remain operational and continue to ship products in a timely manner. In addition, the Company is maintaining the execution pace of the DN Now transformation program and is leveraging its operational rigor to further reduce costs, manage net working capital and reduce risks. The Company has taken multiple measures to protect its employees, and it continues to evolve those measures based on input from various health authorities. The Company continues to focus on the stability of its suppliers and supply chain to prepare for any potential challenges stemming from additional government responses to the pandemic.
The Company has been designated as providing “critical infrastructure” services by the majority of government entities around the world, including the United States Department of Homeland Security in order to promote public health and safety, as well as economic and national security during the COVID-19 pandemic. These designations recognize the vital role Diebold Nixdorf plays in allowing consumers to reliably and safely access financial services and essential retailers across more than 60 countries.
The Company continues to carefully manage its overall liquidity and net working capital by leveraging governance improvements from 2019. In response to the pandemic, the Company fully borrowed its revolving credit facility during March of 2020, consistent with the practices of many large companies. This action was done out of an abundance of caution to ensure the Company had adequate financial flexibility during what was expected to be a more challenging near-term environment. As business conditions improved, the Company repaid a portion of the revolving credit facility borrowings as part of a $1.1 billion debt refinancing completed in July 2020, as discussed below in "-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Financing Activities". We believe this action provides us with ample time and liquidity to complete its DN Now transformation and begin to pragmatically pursue growth opportunities.
Although business conditions for us, our customers and suppliers improved during the third quarter of 2020 relative to the first half of the year, of course there is some measure of uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and the impacts it may

have on our business and the businesses of our customers and suppliers. The possible resurgence of COVID-19 infection rates and government actions in response thereto could disrupt our operations and our supply chain and materially adversely affect our business. Because the situation continues to evolve, we cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate impact to our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position that the COVID-19 pandemic may have, but such impact could be material.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
2020 comparison with 2019
Net Sales
The following table represents information regarding our net sales for the years ended December 31:
(1) The Company calculates constant currency (CC) by translating the prior-year period results at the current year exchange rate.
Net sales decreased $506.4 or 11.5 percent, including a net unfavorable currency impact of $38.8 primarily related to the euro and Brazil real, resulting in a constant currency decrease of $467.6.
Segments
•Eurasia Banking net sales decreased $218.7, including a net favorable currency impact of $9.8 related primarily to the euro and divestitures of $109.0. Excluding the impact of currency and the impact of divestitures, net sales decreased $119.5 driven by unplanned reductions in installation activity, including delays resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, non-recurring prior-year refresh projects as well as the Company's initiative to reduce lower margin services business.
•Americas Banking net sales decreased $184.7, including a net unfavorable currency impact of $54.5 primarily related to the Brazilian real. Excluding currency, net sales decreased $130.2 mostly from large non-recurring product refresh projects in Canada, Mexico and U.S. national accounts as well as the Company's initiative to reduce lower margin services business. This decrease was partially offset by increased activity in U.S. regional banks and software growth.
•Retail net sales decreased $103.0, including a net favorable currency impact of $5.9 mostly related to the euro. Excluding currency, net sales decreased $109.0 primarily from prior-year non-recurring POS roll-outs, unfavorable revenue impacts due to unplanned reductions in installation activity and delays resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Gross Profit
The following table represents information regarding our gross profit for the years ended December 31:
Services gross margin increased 3.2 percent, including higher non-routine charges of $8.7 consisting primarily of charges related to a loss-making contract related to a discontinued offering, spare parts inventory provision, and incremental payments to essential service technicians for their contributions during the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by subsidies received for certain wages related to the COVID-19 pandemic and a 2019 non-recurring inventory valuation charge. Restructuring charges increased $6.1. Excluding the impact of non-routine and restructuring expense, services gross margin increased 3.9 percent due in part to sustainable savings brought about by the Company’s service modernization plan as well as exiting low margin maintenance contracts, and efficiency improvements from Software Excellence initiatives across all three segments. Interim cost measures taken to mitigate impacts of revenue delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic also contributed to the increased service gross margin.
Product gross margin increased 0.8 percent, including higher non-routine charges of $0.9, which primarily consisted of a $4.6 charge for certain benefits related to a previously divested business and $4.3 charge for a contract provision. Restructuring charges increased $6.5. Excluding the impact of non-routine and restructuring expense, product gross margin increased 1.4 percent due primarily to a favorable solution and geography mix in the Americas and Eurasia Banking segments, interim cost measures, as well as lower Americas Banking and Retail amortization of certain capitalized software that was impaired in December 2019.
Operating Expenses
The following table represents information regarding our operating expenses for the years ended December 31:
Selling and administrative expense decreased $50.2, or $79.0 excluding a $1.2 favorable currency impact, $14.4 of incremental non-routine expense, and $15.5 of incremental restructuring expense. Excluding currency and the impact of non-routine and restructuring expense, lower selling and administrative expense was due primarily to the Company's planned DN Now actions, including lower costs resulting from finance transformation.
Non-routine expense in selling and administrative expenses were $188.4 and $174.0 in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The higher non-routine expense is related to increased DN Now transformation expense, partially offset by lower legal and deal expenses and lower amortization of purchase accounting adjustments. Restructuring expense related to the Company's DN Now actions in selling and administrative expenses were $52.9 and $37.4 in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Research, development and engineering expense decreased $13.7. Excluding higher restructuring expense of $3.4, research, development and engineering expense decreased primarily from interim cost measures, lower product development cost and software cost management actions.
The Company recorded impairment charges of $7.5 in 2020 primarily related to assets from non-core businesses transferred to assets held for sale and certain assets from the Company's headquarters which will not be transferred to the new facility. In

2019, the Company recorded $30.2 of impairment charges primarily related to capitalized software development and assets from a non-core business transferred to assets held for sale.
In 2020, the Company recorded a net loss on sale of assets of $11.5, primarily related to the divestitures of certain of the Company's operations in China, Brazil and Denmark, partially offset by a gain on sale of assets related primarily to the sale of Portavis GmbH, a retail business in Italy, and the Company's headquarters building. The net loss on sales of assets in 2019 included the divestiture of the Venezuela business and losses from the divestitures and liquidation of non-core businesses in Eurasia, which were partially offset by the gain from the Kony transaction.
Operating Profit (Loss)
The following table represents information regarding our operating profit (loss) for the years ended December 31:
Operating profit increased compared to the prior year primarily due to savings from DN Now initiatives, which improved gross margin and lowered selling and administrative expense despite lower revenues. Also contributing to the improvement in operating profit were decreased research, development and engineering expenses.
Other Income (Expense)
The following table represents information regarding our other income (expense) for the years ended December 31:
Interest income decreased $2.5 mostly from lower interest rates and market returns. Interest expense increased $89.8 primarily due to the payment of a make-whole premium and write-off of deferred debt issuance costs as a result of the repayment of a portion of the amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement, partially offset by the pay down of debt and reduced interest rates. Foreign exchange loss, net, increased $9.3 and was unfavorably impacted by transactions related to international operations. Miscellaneous, net includes a gain of $7.2 from the close and surrender of company-owned life insurance (COLI) plans.
Net Loss
The following table represents information regarding our income (loss), net of tax, for the years ended December 31:
Net loss decreased primarily due to the reasons described above and by the reduction in income tax expense.
The effective tax rate for 2020 was 0.4 percent. Tax expense items contributing to the difference from the U.S. federal income tax rate included U.S. tax on foreign income, valuation allowances related to certain foreign and U.S. tax attributes for which realization does not meet the more likely than not criteria, non-deductible expenses and the tax effects of terminating certain company-owned life insurance policies. These items were partially offset by tax credits, benefits related to settling certain open tax years in Germany and the U.S., changes to uncertain tax position accruals and benefit related to regulations issued in 2020 related to US tax reform.

The US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21%, required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries and created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. The Company accounted for the estimated impacts of the Tax Act in the year of enactment and finalized its accounting, as required under SAB 118, during 2018. During 2020, further regulation was issued in connection with certain provisions of the Tax Act related to taxes on foreign sourced earnings, with retroactive effect to 2018 and 2019. The Company calculated and recorded a benefit related to these regulatory changes of $9.1 and will amend its 2018 and 2019 returns accordingly.
The effective tax rate on the loss for 2019 was (51.0) percent and was primarily due to the U.S. taxed foreign income, including global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI), valuation allowances recorded on certain foreign and state jurisdictions, U.S. foreign tax credits that management concluded do not meet the more likely than not criteria for realization and the tax effects related to the Barbados structure collapse. The Company’s collapse of its Barbados structure to meet the covenant requirements under the Credit Agreement resulted in a net tax expense of $46.3 inclusive of the offsetting valuation allowance release relating to the Company’s nondeductible interest expense that was carried forward from December 31, 2018.
Segment Operating Profit Summary
The following tables represent information regarding the Company's operating profit by reporting segment:
Segment operating profit increased $8.5 compared to the prior year, due primarily to lower operating expense resulting from the execution of DN Now initiatives.
Segment operating profit margin increased 2.1 percent mostly from lower operating expense as noted above.
Segment operating profit increased $71.3 due primarily to the Company's DN Now initiatives, which include Services Modernization and Software Excellence, as well as a favorable product mix in the U.S.
Segment operating profit margin increased 6.0 percent primarily as a result of higher products and services gross margin, in addition to lower costs resulting from the execution of DN Now initiatives and lower bonus expense.
Segment operating profit increased $19.3 due primarily to higher gross margin mostly from the Company's DN Now initiatives which include Software Excellence and Services Modernization, as well as a favorable services solution and country mix in EMEA, and lower bonus and software cost.
Segment operating profit margin increased 2.4 percent primarily from higher gross margin on favorable mix as well as lower operating expenses resulting from the Company's DN Now initiatives.

Net Sales
The following table represents information regarding our net sales for the years ended December 31:
(1) The Company calculates constant currency by translating the prior-year period results at the current year exchange rate.
Net sales decreased $169.9 or 3.7 percent, including a net unfavorable currency impact of $151.0 primarily related to the euro and Brazil real.
The following results include the impact of foreign currency and purchase accounting adjustments:
Segments
•Eurasia Banking net sales decreased $150.4, including a net unfavorable currency impact of $79.3 related primarily to the euro and divestitures of $30.4. Excluding currency and the impact of divestitures, net sales decreased $40.7 primarily due to declining low-margin services solutions, including a low margin maintenance contract roll-off in India, combined with the fewer product roll outs in various countries and under-performance of a non-core business, partially offset by higher product volume in Germany, the Middle East and South Africa related to unit replacements from Windows 10 upgrades.
•Americas Banking net sales increased $88.4, including a net unfavorable currency impact of $12.3 primarily related to the Brazil real. Excluding currency and a small divestiture, net sales increased $105.6 driven primarily by product and installation sales in Canada, Brazil, Mexico and the U.S. regional customers related to unit replacements from Windows 10 upgrades, in addition to increased software license volume in the U.S. Partially offsetting these increases, services revenue declined from lower maintenance contract volume and billed work activity in the U.S.
•Retail net sales decreased $107.9, including a net unfavorable currency impact of $59.4 mostly related to the euro and divestitures of $18.5. Excluding currency and the impact of divestitures, net sales decreased $30.0 primarily from lower POS installations and reduced low-margin non-core business, partially offset by incremental SCO volume and new service contracts in the U.K.

Gross Profit
The following table represents information regarding our gross profit for the years ended December 31:
Services gross margin increased 3.6 percent and was favorably impacted by lower restructuring charges of $9.8 and lower non-routine charges of $13.8. Excluding restructuring and non-routine charges, services gross margin increased 2.9 percent as services margin increased in the Eurasia banking segment related to the favorable impact of the services modernization initiatives and favorable mix of higher margin installation activity. The prior year was unfavorably impacted by one-time banking services cost in Brazil.
Product gross margin increased 6.2 percent and was favorably impacted by lower restructuring charges of $9.1 and lower non-routine charges of $51.2, primarily related to lower purchase accounting amortization and inventory charges. Excluding the impact of restructuring and non-routine charges, products gross margin increased 2.8 percent. Increased margin was primarily due to improved mix and higher volume from Canada, Brazil and U.S. regional customers as well as higher margin Windows 10 upgrades in certain areas of Europe. These improvements are aligned with the Company's focus on higher margin product mix throughout the geographies as well as improved supply chain management and lower expedited freight costs in the Americas.
Operating Expenses
The following table represents information regarding our operating expenses for the years ended December 31:
N/M = Not Meaningful
Selling and administrative expense increased $15.3. Excluding incremental restructuring of $4.0, increased non-routine charges of $20.6 and a favorable currency impact of $20.3, selling and administrative expense increased $11.0 primarily attributable to an increase in annual incentive plan cost and an unfavorable impact of the mark-to-market adjustment of the legacy Wincor Nixdorf stock option program partially offset by the cost reduction initiatives tied to the DN Now program.
Non-routine cost in selling and administrative expenses were $174.1 and $153.5 in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The components of the non-routine expenses consisted of increased DN Now transformation expense, a one-time non-cash item in Brazil and $5.6 from the German real estate tax incurred related to the squeeze out. These increases were partially offset by lower integration expense and purchase accounting adjustments. Selling and administrative expense included restructuring charges of $37.4 and $33.4 in 2019 and 2018, respectively, primarily due to the workforce alignment actions under the DN Now plan.
Research, development and engineering expense in 2019 decreased $10.3 including a net favorable currency impact of $5.5. Excluding the impact of currency, research, development and engineering expense decreased $4.8 due primarily to lower headcount tied to the Company’s DN Now restructuring program and prior year investment in the DN Series product line, partially offset by increased software development cost.

The loss on sales of assets, net in 2019 included the divestiture of the Venezuela business and losses from the divestiture and liquidation of non-core businesses in Eurasia offset by a gain on sale of assets related to the Kony transaction.

Operating Loss
The following table represents information regarding our operating profit (loss) for the years ended December 31:
N/M = Not Meaningful
The operating loss decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to product and services gross margin improvements as well as higher impairment charges in 2018, partially offset by higher selling and administrative costs and loss on sale of assets.
Other Income (Expense)
The following table represents information regarding our other income (expense) for the years ended December 31:
N/M = Not Meaningful
Interest expense increased $48.0 due to an additional $650.0 Term Loan A-1 Facility debt with higher incremental interest rates and related fee amortization. Foreign exchange loss, net, increased $2.6 and was unfavorably impacted by transactions related to Eurasia in addition to incremental loss associated with the collapse of the Barbados financing structure related to the Acquisition.
Net Loss
The following table represents information regarding our income (loss), net of tax, for the years ended December 31:
N/M = Not Meaningful
The loss before taxes and net loss increased primarily due to the reasons described above. Net loss was also impacted by the change in the income tax expense.
The effective tax rate for 2019 was (51.0) percent and was primarily due to the U.S. taxed foreign income, including global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI), valuation allowances recorded on certain foreign and state jurisdictions, U.S. foreign tax credits that management concluded do not meet the more likely than not criteria for realization and the tax effects related to the Barbados structure collapse. The Company’s collapse of its Barbados structure to meet the covenant requirements under its credit agreement resulted in a net tax expense of $46.3 inclusive of the offsetting valuation allowance release relating to the Company’s nondeductible interest expense that was carried forward from December 31, 2018.

The effective tax rate on the loss for 2018 was (7.8) percent on the overall loss from operations and was primarily due to a goodwill impairment charge, the impact of the Tax Act, valuation allowances on interest expense carryforward attributes and certain foreign and state credits. 2018 tax expense reflects the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 percent, refinement of the impacts of the TCJA estimated under SAB 118, goodwill impairment charge, which for tax purposes is primarily nondeductible and the business interest deduction limitation. In addition, the overall effective tax rate is impacted by the jurisdictional income (loss) and varying respective statutory rates which is reflected in the foreign tax rate differential caption of the rate reconciliation.
Segment Operating Profit Summary
The following tables represent information regarding our revenue and operating profit by reporting segment for the years ended December 31:
Segment operating profit increased $19.2, compared to the prior year, including a net unfavorable currency impact of $10.4 due in part to higher gross margins on services and products. The increase in services margin was primarily attributable to the services modernization program which benefited numerous countries in Europe and Asia in addition to a favorable solutions mix, while products margin also increased from DN Now initiatives as well as favorable country and product mix. Additionally, segment operating profit benefited from lower operating expenses tied to DN Now initiatives, restructuring programs and the phase out of non-profitable service contracts.
Segment operating profit margin increased 2.0 percent despite lower net sales, as a result of higher services and products gross margin and lower operating expense primarily attributable to DN Now initiatives.
Segment operating profit increased $102.5 mostly from increased DN Now initiatives favorably impacting both cost of sales and operating expense. Gross profit was favorably impacted by large product refresh projects in Canada and favorable mix in the U.S., Brazil and Latin America. Additionally, the Company made improvements to supply chain management resulting in lower expedited freight costs. Segment operating profit in 2018 was unfavorably impacted by one-time banking services cost in Brazil.
Segment operating profit margin increased 6.4 percent primarily as a result of higher product gross margin, in addition to lower cost related to the DN Now initiatives.
Segment operating profit increased $11.2 compared to the prior year including a net unfavorable currency impact of $3.0. Excluding the impact of currency, segment operating profit increased $14.2 primarily from lower services cost and operating expenses tied to DN Now initiatives as well as a favorable service mix related to maintenance and support activities in Europe.
Segment operating profit margin increased 1.3 percent in 2019 primarily from lower costs and expenses tied to DN Now initiatives as well as a favorable service mix.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Capital resources are obtained from income retained in the business, borrowings under the Company’s senior notes, committed and uncommitted credit facilities and operating and capital leasing arrangements. Management expects that the Company’s capital resources will be sufficient to finance planned working capital needs, R&D activities, investments in facilities or equipment, required pension contributions, and any repurchases of the Company’s common shares for at least the next 12 months. The Company had no restricted cash at December 31, 2020 and $3.6 of restricted cash at December 31, 2019. The Company has made acquisitions in the past and may make acquisitions in the future. Part of the Company's strategy is to optimize the business portfolio through divestitures and complementary acquisitions. The Company intends to finance any future acquisitions with cash and short-term investments, cash provided from operations, borrowings under available credit facilities, proceeds from debt or equity offerings and/or the issuance of common shares. Subject to certain limitations in its debt agreements, as market conditions warrant, the Company may from time to time repay, repurchase or otherwise refinance loans that it has borrowed or debt securities that it has issued, including with funds borrowed under existing or new credit facilities or proceeds from the issuance of new securities.
The Company's total cash and cash availability as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was as follows:
The following table summarizes the results, excluding the impact of cash in businesses held for sale, of our consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended December 31:
Operating Activities. Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for income taxes, restructuring activities, pension funding and other items impact reported cash flows. Net cash provided by operating activities was $18.0 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $135.8 net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019.
•Cash flows from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 were impacted by a $76.8 decrease in net loss. Refer to "Results of Operations" discussed above for further discussion of the Company's net loss.
•The net aggregate of inventories and accounts payable was a reduction in operating cash flow of $4.2 during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to an increase in operating cash flow of $71.8 during the year ended December 31, 2019. The $76.0 change is primarily a result of increased finished goods due to pandemic-related revenue delays until the first quarter of 2021 in Eurasia Banking and Retail.
•The net aggregate of trade receivables and deferred revenue was an increase in operating cash flow of $0.5 during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to an increase in operating cash flow of $56.6 in the year ended December 31, 2019. The $56.1 net change is primarily due to increased days sales outstanding as a result of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic impact and improvement in 2019 collections as a result of the Company's working capital improvement initiatives.

•The net aggregate of income taxes and deferred income taxes was a reduction in operating cash flow of $50.2 of during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to an increase in operating cash flow of $55.1 during the year ended December 31, 2019. Refer to Note 4: Income Taxes for additional discussion on income taxes.
The most significant changes in adjustments to net income include decreases in the non-recurring effects from impairment and lower non-routine inventory charges. The impairment of assets non-cash adjustment decreased to $7.5 in 2020 compared to $30.2 in 2019, primarily due to an impairment of capitalized software development in the prior year. There was also lower share-based compensation expense due to fewer granted awards.
Investing Activities. Net cash used by investing activities was $82.6 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to net cash used by investing activities of $6.8 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $75.8 unfavorable change was primarily impacted by a $66.9 decrease in proceeds from divestitures, net of cash divested. Additionally, the maturities and purchases of investments primarily relate to short-term investment activity, which resulted in a $46.2 decrease in net cash proceeds due to an increase in investments purchases and a decrease in the maturities of investments. The Company also reduced its capital expenditures and capitalized software development due to temporary decreases in activity caused by the pandemic.
The Company anticipates total capital expenditures, capitalized software development and cloud-based software implementation costs of approximately $85 in 2021 to be utilized for improvements to the Company's product line and investments in its infrastructure. Currently, the Company finances these investments primarily with funds provided by income retained in the business, borrowings under the Company's committed and uncommitted credit facilities, and operating and capital leasing arrangements.
Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $16.9 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to net cash used by financing activities of $215.5 for the year ended 2019, a change of $232.4. The change was primarily a result of the Company issuing new debt and paying down certain existing debt obligations and related fees, along with drawing down on its Revolving Facility. The cumulative effect of these activities resulted in the extension of the Company's debt maturities. Refer to Note 11: Debt for details of the Company's cash flows related to debt borrowings and repayments.
On July 20, 2020, the Company issued approximately $1,100.0 aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes consisting of $700 aggregate principal amount of Diebold Nixdorf, Incorporated’s 9.375% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 and €350.0 aggregate principal amount of 9.000% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 issued by its wholly-owned subsidiary, Diebold Nixdorf, Dutch Holding B.V. (collectively, the 2025 Senior Secured Notes) in private offerings exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act). The net proceeds from the offerings, along with cash on hand, was used to repay a portion of the amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement, including all amounts outstanding under the Term Loan A Facility and Term Loan A-1 Facility and $193.8 of revolving credit loans, including all of the revolving credit loans due in December 2020, as well as all related fees and expenses. On July 20, 2020, the Company also amended the Credit Agreement to, among other things, extend the maturity of $330.0 of its revolving credit commitments and revolving credit loans from April 30, 2022 to July 20, 2023 (and, effective as of July 20, 2020, the Company terminated its other revolving credit commitments under the Revolving Facility other than approximately $39.0 of revolving credit commitments that still mature April 30, 2022). The Company’s current capital structure includes no significant maturities until 2023.
Refer to Note 11: Debt for additional information regarding the Company's debt obligations. The Company paid cash for interest related to its debt of $138.1 and $189.7 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As defined by the Company's credit agreement, the ratio of net debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA was 4.1 times as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with the financial and other covenants in its debt agreements.

The principal off-balance sheet arrangements that the Company enters into are guarantees and sales of finance receivables. The Company provides its global operations guarantees and standby letters of credit through various financial institutions to suppliers, customers, regulatory agencies and insurance providers. If the Company is not able to comply with its contractual obligations, the suppliers, regulatory agencies and insurance providers may draw on the pertinent bank. The Company has sold finance receivables to financial institutions while continuing to service the receivables. The Company records these sales by removing finance receivables from the consolidated balance sheets and recording gains and losses in the consolidated statement of operations (refer to Note 7: Investments).
Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information. Diebold Nixdorf, Incorporated initially issued its 8.5% Senior Notes due 2024 (the 2024 Senior Notes) in an offering exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, which were later exchanged in an exchange offer registered under the Securities Act.

As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Parent Company and the guarantor subsidiaries on a combined basis had the following balances with non-guarantor subsidiaries:
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
Management’s discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements of the Company are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Such estimates include revenue recognition, the valuation of trade and financing receivables, inventories, goodwill, intangible assets, other long-lived assets, legal contingencies, guarantee obligations, and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes, pension and post-retirement benefits and customer incentives, among others. These estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best estimates and judgment. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors. Management monitors the economic conditions and other factors and will adjust such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.
The Company’s significant accounting policies are described in Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements, which is contained in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K. Management believes that, of its significant accounting policies, its policies concerning revenue recognition, allowances for credit losses, inventory reserves, goodwill, long-lived assets, taxes on income, contingencies and pensions and post-retirement benefits are the most critical because they are affected significantly by judgments, assumptions and estimates. Additional information regarding these policies is included below.
Revenue Recognition. Revenue is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The amount of consideration can vary depending on discounts, rebates, refunds,

credits, price concessions, incentives, performance bonuses, penalties, or other similar items contained in the contract with the customer of which generally these variable consideration components represents minimal amount of net sales. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer.
The Company's payment terms vary depending on the individual contracts and are generally fixed fee. The Company recognizes advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized as deferred revenue. In certain contracts where services are provided prior to billing, the Company recognizes a contract asset within trade receivables and other current assets.
Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and that are collected by the Company from a customer are excluded from revenue.
The Company recognizes shipping and handling fees billed when products are shipped or delivered to a customer and includes such amounts in net sales. Although infrequent, shipping and handling associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer is not a separate performance obligation, rather is accounted for as a fulfillment cost. Third-party freight payments are recorded in cost of sales.
The Company includes a warranty in connection with certain contracts with customers, which are not considered to be separate performance obligations. The Company provides its customers a manufacturer’s warranty and records, at the time of the sale, a corresponding estimated liability for potential warranty costs. For additional information on product warranty refer to Note 9: Guarantees and Product Warranties. The Company also has extended warranty and service contracts available for its customers, which are recognized as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized on these contracts ratably as the Company has a stand-ready obligation to provide services when or as needed by the customer. This input method is the most accurate assessment of progress toward completion the Company can apply.
Product revenue is recognized at the point in time that the customer obtains control of the product, which could be upon delivery or upon completion of installation services, depending on contract terms. The Company’s software licenses are functional in nature (the IP has significant stand-alone functionality); as such, the revenue recognition of distinct software license sales is at the point in time that the customer obtains control of the rights granted by the license.
Professional services integrate the commercial solution with the customer's existing infrastructure and helps define the optimal user experience, improve business processes, refine existing staffing models and deploy technology to meet branch and store automation objectives. Revenue from professional services are recognized over time, because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the Company’s performance as the services are performed or when the Company’s performance creates an asset with no alternative use and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. Generally revenue will be recognized using an input measure, typically costs incurred. The typical contract length for service is generally one year and is billed and paid in advance except for installations, among others.
Services may be sold separately or in bundled packages. For bundled packages, the Company accounts for individual services separately if they are distinct. A distinct service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate services or distinct obligations in a bundle based on their stand-alone selling prices. The stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the prices at which the Company separately sells the products or services. For items that are not sold separately, the Company estimates stand-alone selling prices using the cost plus expected margin approach. Revenue on service contracts is recognized ratably over time, generally using an input measure, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the Company’s performance as the services are performed. In some circumstances, when global service supply chain services are not included in a term contract and rather billed as they occur, revenue on these billed work services are recognized at a point in time as transfer of control occurs.
The following is a description of principal solutions offered within the Company's two main customer segments that generate the Company's revenue.
Banking
Products. Products for banking customers consist of cash recyclers and dispensers, intelligent deposit terminals, teller automation tools and kiosk technologies, as well as physical security solutions. The Company provides its banking customers front-end applications for consumer connection points and back-end platforms that manage channel transactions, operations and integration and facilitate omnichannel transactions, endpoint monitoring, remote asset management, customer marketing, merchandise management and analytics. These offerings include highly configurable, API enabled software that automates legacy banking transactions across channels.

Services. The Company provides its banking customers product-related services which include proactive monitoring and rapid resolution of incidents through remote service capabilities or an on-site visit. First and second line maintenance, preventive maintenance and on-demand services keep the distributed assets of the Company's customers up and running through a standardized incident management process. Managed services and outsourcing consists of the end-to-end business processes, solution management, upgrades and transaction processing. The Company also provides a full array of cash management services, which optimizes the availability and cost of physical currency across the enterprise through efficient forecasting, inventory and replenishment processes.
Retail
Products. The retail product portfolio includes modular, integrated and mobile POS and SCO terminals that meet evolving automation and omnichannel requirements of consumers. Supplementing the POS system is a broad range of peripherals, including printers, scales and mobile scanners, as well as the cash management portfolio which offers a wide range of banknote and coin processing systems. Also in the portfolio, the Company provides SCO terminals and ordering kiosks which facilitate an efficient and user-friendly purchasing experience. The Company’s hybrid product line can alternate from an attended operator to self-checkout with the press of a button as traffic conditions warrant throughout the business day.
The Company's platform software is installed within retail data centers to facilitate omnichannel transactions, endpoint monitoring, remote asset management, customer marketing, merchandise management and analytics.
Services. The Company provides its retail customers product-related services which include on-demand services and professional services. Diebold Nixdorf AllConnect Services for retailers include maintenance and availability services to continuously improve retail self-service fleet availability and performance. These include: total implementation services to support both current and new store concepts; managed mobility services to centralize asset management and ensure effective, tailored mobile capability; monitoring and advanced analytics providing operational insights to support new growth opportunities; and store life-cycle management to proactively monitors store IT endpoints and enable improved management of internal and external suppliers and delivery organizations.
Inventory Reserves. At each reporting period, the Company identifies and writes down its excess and obsolete inventories to net realizable value based on usage forecasts, order volume and inventory aging. With the development of new products, the Company also rationalizes its product offerings and will write-down discontinued product to the lower of cost or net realizable value.
Goodwill. Goodwill is the cost in excess of the net assets of acquired businesses (refer to Note 8: Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the consolidated financial statements). The Company tests all existing goodwill at least annually as of October 31 for impairment on a reporting unit basis. The fair value of the reporting units is determined based upon a combination of the income and market approaches, which are standard valuation methodologies. The income approach uses discounted estimated future cash flows, whereas the market approach or guideline public company method utilizes market data of similar publicly traded companies. The fair value of the reporting unit is defined as the price that would be received in a sale of the net assets in an orderly transaction between market participants at the assessment date. The Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value and would recognize an impairment charge if the amount carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value.
The techniques used in the Company's annual assessment incorporate a number of assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable and to reflect market conditions at the assessment date. Assumptions in estimating future cash flows are subject to a high degree of judgment. The Company makes all efforts to forecast future cash flows as accurately as possible with the information available at the time the forecast is made. To this end, the Company evaluates the appropriateness of its assumptions as well as its overall forecasts by comparing projected results of upcoming years with actual results of preceding years and validating that differences therein are reasonable. Key assumptions, which typically are Level 3 inputs, include discount rates, terminal growth rates, market multiple data from selected guideline public companies, management's internal forecasts which include numerous assumptions such as projected net sales, gross profit, sales mix, operating and capital expenditures, among others. A number of benchmarks from independent industry and other economic publications were also used. Changes in assumptions and estimates after the assessment date may lead to an outcome where impairment charges would be required in future periods. Specifically, actual results may vary from the Company’s forecasts and such variations may be material and unfavorable, thereby triggering the need for future impairment tests where the conclusions may differ in reflection of prevailing market conditions.
The Company tests for interim impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the carrying value of a reporting unit below its reported amount. In evaluating whether it is more likely than not the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company considers the following events and circumstances, among others, if applicable: (a) macroeconomic conditions such as general economic conditions, limitations on

accessing capital or other developments in equity and credit markets; (b) industry and market considerations such as competition, multiples or metrics and changes in the market for the Company's products and services or regulatory and political environments; (c) cost factors such as raw materials, labor or other costs; (d) overall financial performance such as cash flows, actual and planned revenue and earnings compared with actual and projected results of relevant prior periods; (e) other relevant events such as changes in key personnel, strategy or customers; (f) changes in the composition of a reporting unit's assets or expected sales of all or a portion of a reporting unit; and (g) any sustained decrease in share price. If the Company's qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative impairment test is used to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of any impairment loss to be recognized.
Taxes on Income. Deferred taxes are provided on an asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, operating loss carry-forwards and tax credits. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences and undistributed earnings in certain jurisdictions. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Determination of a valuation allowance involves estimates regarding the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, expected future taxable income and the impact of tax planning strategies. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.
The Company operates in numerous taxing jurisdictions and is subject to examination by various federal, state and foreign jurisdictions for various tax periods. Additionally, the Company has retained tax liabilities and the rights to tax refunds in connection with various acquisitions and divestitures of businesses. The Company’s income tax positions are based on research and interpretations of the income tax laws and rulings in each of the jurisdictions in which the Company does business. Due to the subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction, the differences and interplay in tax laws between those jurisdictions, as well as the inherent uncertainty in estimating the final resolution of complex tax audit matters, the Company’s estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments.
The Company assesses its position with regard to tax exposures and records liabilities for these uncertain tax positions and any related interest and penalties, when the tax benefit is not more likely than not realizable. The Company has recorded an accrual that reflects the recognition and measurement process for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Additional future income tax expense or benefit may be recognized once the positions are effectively settled.
At the end of each interim reporting period, the Company estimates the effective tax rate expected to apply to the full fiscal year. The estimated effective tax rate contemplates the expected jurisdiction where income is earned, as well as tax planning alternatives. Current and projected growth in income in higher tax jurisdictions may result in an increasing effective tax rate over time. If the actual results differ from estimates, the Company may adjust the effective tax rate in the interim period if such determination is made.
Contingencies. Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred. There is no liability recorded for matters in which the liability is not probable and reasonably estimable. Attorneys in the Company's legal department monitor and manage all claims filed against the Company and review all pending investigations. Generally, the estimate of probable loss related to these matters is developed in consultation with internal and outside legal counsel representing the Company. These estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. The Company attempts to resolve these matters through settlements, mediation and arbitration proceedings when possible. If the actual settlement costs, final judgments, or fines, after appeals, differ from the estimates, the future results may be materially impacted. Adjustments to the initial estimates are recorded when a change in the estimate is identified.
Pensions and Other Post-retirement Benefits. Annual net periodic expense and benefit liabilities under the Company’s defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis. Assumptions used in the actuarial calculations have a significant impact on plan obligations and expense. The Company periodically reviews the actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to the assumptions, if warranted. The discount rate is determined by analyzing the average return of high-quality (i.e., AA-rated), fixed-income investments and the year-over-year comparison of certain widely used benchmark indices as of the measurement date. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined using the plans’ current asset allocation and their expected long term rates of return. The rate of compensation increase assumptions reflects the Company’s long-term actual experience and future and near-term outlook. Pension benefits are funded through deposits with trustees. Other post-retirement benefits are not funded and the Company’s policy is to pay these benefits as they become due.
