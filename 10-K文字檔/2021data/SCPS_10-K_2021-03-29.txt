Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results Of Operations.
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.
Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company developing transformational therapeutics targeting serious diseases with significant unmet medical needs. Our mission is to improve patient outcomes and save lives. To achieve our mission, we are capitalizing on groundbreaking scientific and medical discoveries at some of the world’s foremost research and academic institutions.
Our lead development program is a novel, targeted immuno-oncology gene therapy for the treatment of multiple cancers. We have partnered with the City of Hope for CO-sTiRNA, which is a STAT3 inhibitor gene therapy. Pre-clinical testing at City of Hope was designed to determine whether CO-sTiRNA would reduce growth and metastasis of various pre-clinical tumor models, including melanoma, and colon and bladder cancers, as well as leukemia and lymphoma. Based upon such testing, an IND for CO-sTiRNA for B-cell lymphoma is currently anticipated to be filed with the FDA in H1 2021. We currently anticipate that a first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial for B-cell lymphoma will commence in H2 2021.
In conjunction with City of Hope, Phase 1 clinical trials for additional cancer indications are being contemplated for CO-sTiRNA in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors and CAR-Ts.
Our second lead development program is MRI-1867, a peripherally-restricted, dual-action CB1 receptor inverse agonist and inhibitor of iNOS. We have partnered with the NIH for MRI-1867 and are initially targeting SSc. Over-activation of CB1 and iNOS has been implicated in the pathophysiology of SSc, which includes fibrosis of the skin, lung, kidney, heart, and the gastrointestinal tract. We are currently continuing to conduct pre-clinical work for MRI-1867 to support an IND filing with the FDA.
We are also partnered with Hebrew University on several additional research and development programs. These programs relate to a proprietary opioid-sparing anesthetic and synthesis of novel compounds and NCEs.
We have devoted substantially all of our resources to our development efforts relating to our drug candidates, including sponsoring research with world-renowned academic and medical research institutions, designing future pre-clinical studies, providing general and administrative support for these operations, and securing and protecting our licensed intellectual property. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. From inception (April 18, 2017) until December 31, 2020, we have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of convertible notes, common stock, and warrants.
We have incurred net losses in each year since our inception. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $14,501,739. Substantially all of our net losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations.
We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years. We anticipate that all our expenses will increase substantially as we:
• continue our research and development efforts;
• contract with third-party research organizations to management our clinical and pre-clinical trials for our drug candidates;
• outsource the manufacturing of our drug candidates for clinical testing and pre-clinical trials;
• seek to obtain regulatory approvals for our drug candidates;
• maintain, expand, and protect our intellectual property portfolio;
• add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel to support our research and development and regulatory efforts; and
• operate as a public company.
We do not expect to generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain marketing approval for one or more of our drug candidates, which we expect will take a number of years and is subject to significant uncertainty. Accordingly, we will need to raise additional capital prior to the commercialization any of our current or future drug candidates. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial revenue from product sales, we expect to finance our operating activities through equity and debt offerings. We may also raise capital through government or other third-party funding and grants, collaborations and development agreements, strategic alliances, and licensing arrangements. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to develop our drug candidates.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report. We believe that the accounting policies are critical for fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.
Net Loss Per Share
Basic net loss per common share attributable to common shareholders is calculated by dividing net loss attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Since the company was in a loss position for all periods presented, basic net loss per share is the same as dilutive net loss per share as the inclusion of all potential dilutive common shares which consist of stock options and warrants, would be anti-dilutive.
JOBS Act
On April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, was enacted. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued after the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards, and, therefore, will not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as public companies that are not emerging growth companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that are not emerging growth companies.
We are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as an “emerging growth company,” we intend to rely on certain of these exemptions, including without limitation, (i) providing an auditor’s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) complying with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis. We will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of an initial public offering; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC.
Results of Operations
Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2020 Versus Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2019
The following table summarizes our results of operation for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019:
Our net losses were $10,862,292 and $2,689,949 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, an increase of $8,172,343 or 304%. We anticipate our fiscal year net losses will increase as we continue to advance our research and drug development activities and incur additional general and administrative expenses to meet the needs of our business.
Revenue
We did not have any revenue during our fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 or 2019. Our ability to generate product revenues in the future will depend almost entirely on our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and then successfully commercialize a drug candidate in the United States. In the event we choose to pursue a partnering arrangement to commercialize a drug candidate or other products outside the United States, we would expect to initiate additional research and development in the future.
Operating Expenses
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits to our personnel, including the costs related to our MSAs. Other significant general and administrative expenses including accounting and legal services, expenses related to obtaining and protecting our intellectual property and costs associated with our board of directors and scientific and senior advisors. We incurred general and administrative expenses in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 of $2,732,060 and $2,226,837, respectively, an increase of $505,223 or 23%. We attribute this growth in our general and administrative expenses to a greater level of our business activities (managing our clinical and research programs at City of Hope, NIH and Hebrew University, negotiating and executing our license agreements, pursuing patent protection for our intellectual property, investigating additional business opportunities and preparing for our IPO, including increased costs for investor relations, directors and officers insurance and to comply with corporate governance, internal controls and similar requirements applicable to public companies), all of which have increased amounts payable (i) as compensation and benefits, including stock-based compensation; (ii) for professional fees and services; and (iii) to certain of our directors and scientific advisors. In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, approximately an additional $430,000, $75,000 and $40,000 were attributable to increased costs for (i) compensation and benefits; (ii) professional fees and services; and (iii) certain of our directors and scientific advisors, respectively, offset primarily by a reduction of approximately $48,000 in travel and entertainment expenses due to COVID-19. The increase in compensation and benefits is primarily attributable to the fact that our president was hired in August of 2019 resulting in compensation and benefits expenses for only five months in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 12 months in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.
Research and Development and Expenses
We recognize research and development expenses as they are incurred. Our research and development expenses consist of fees incurred under our agreements with City of Hope, the NIH and Hebrew University, including the expenses associated with warrants issued in connection with the agreements with Hebrew University. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we incurred research and development expenses of $7,423,786 and $463,112, respectively, an increase of $6,960,674 or 1,503%. These expenses increased primarily as a result of us entering into the COH License Agreement and SRA relating to CO-sTiRNA, including our related transactions with Bioscience Oncology. The aggregate upfront expenses relating to the COH License Agreement and Bioscience Oncology, which totaled nearly $7.2 million, were recognized in “Research and Development” expenses during the year ended December 31, 2020. We plan to increase our research and development expenses, net of the costs relating to our transactions with Bioscience Oncology, for the foreseeable future as we continue the clinical and pre-clinical development of our two lead drug candidates, CO-sTiRNA and MRI-1867, and to further advance the development of our other research and development programs, subject to the availability of additional funding.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We have incurred losses since our inception and, as of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $14,501,739. We anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for at least the next several years. We expect that our research and development costs and general and administrative expenses will continue to increase as we advance our drug candidates through the pre-clinical and clinical development processes and hire additional personnel and/or consultants to support such activities. As a result, we will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations. We expect to finance our cash needs primarily through equity and debt issuances. We may also raise capital through government or other third-party funding and grants, collaborations and development agreements, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. To enhance our liquidity and capital resources, we have, from time to time, issued convertible notes and warrants to various parties, including to related parties, to satisfy certain fees and other payables.
Since April 18, 2017 (inception) through December 31, 2020, we have funded our operations principally with approximately $9.0 million in gross proceeds from the sale of convertible notes, common stock, warrants and units comprised of common stock and warrants, and the exercise of a portion of such warrants, including aggregate gross proceeds of $3,162,500 from the sale of 575,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $5.50 per share in our IPO on December 18, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash of $1,832,100. Subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, on February 10, 2021, we completed a follow-on public offering of 1,150,000 shares of common stock, including the underwriters’ exercise, in full, of their over-allotment option, at a public offering price of $9.00 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of $10,350,000.
Future Funding Requirements
We have not generated any revenue. We do not know when, or if, we will generate any revenue from product sales. We do not expect to generate significant revenue from product sales unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize any of our drug candidates. At the same time, we expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing development activities, particularly as we continue to research, develop, and seek regulatory approval for, our drug candidates. We expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. In addition, subject to obtaining regulatory approval of any of our drug candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses for product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. We anticipate that we will need substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations.
Based on our current financial resources and our expected level of operating expenditures, we believe that we will be able to fund our projected operating requirements for at least the next 12 months. This period could be shortened if there are any significant increases in planned spending on development programs or more rapid progress on our development programs than anticipated. Thereafter, we will need to obtain additional financing to fund future clinical trials for our drug candidates and other expenses. We expect to finance our cash needs primarily through debt and equity offerings. We may also raise capital through government or other third-party funding and grants, collaborations and development agreements, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our drug candidates, we are unable to estimate the amounts of additional capital outlays and operating expenditures necessary to complete the development of our drug candidates. Thereafter, we will need to obtain additional financing to fund future clinical trials for our drug candidates. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our drug candidates, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures necessary to complete the development of our drug candidates.
Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:
• the progress, costs, results and timing of our drug candidates’ future clinical studies and future pre-clinical trials, and the clinical development of our drug candidates for other potential indications beyond their initial target indications;
• the willingness of the FDA and the EMA to accept our future drug candidate clinical trials, as well as our other completed and planned clinical and pre-clinical studies and other work, as the basis for review and approval of our drug candidates;
• the outcome, costs and timing of seeking and obtaining FDA, EMA and any other regulatory approvals;
• the number and characteristics of drug candidates that we pursue, including our drug candidates in future pre-clinical development;
• the ability of our drug candidates to progress through clinical development successfully;
• our need to expand our research and development activities;
• the costs associated with securing and establishing commercialization and manufacturing capabilities;
• the costs of acquiring, licensing or investing in businesses, products, drug candidates and technologies;
• our ability to maintain, expand and defend the scope of our licensed intellectual property portfolio, including the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make, or that we may receive, in connection with the licensing, filing, prosecution, defense and enforcement of any patents or other intellectual property rights;
• our need and ability to hire additional management and scientific and medical personnel;
• the effect of competing technological and market developments;
• our need to implement additional internal systems and infrastructure, including financial and reporting systems;
• the duration and spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, and associated operational delays and disruptions and increased costs and expenses; and
• the economic and other terms, timing and success of any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter in the future.
Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial revenue from product sales, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of debt financings and equity offerings, government or other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of debt and equity securities, the ownership interests of our common stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through government or other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or drug candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.
We have considered the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak, which the World Health Organization has declared a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern.” The COVID-19 outbreak is disrupting supply chains and affecting production and sales across a range of industries. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the pandemic and its impact on our employees and vendors, and our ability to raise capital, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. At this point, the extent to which COVID-19 may impact our financial condition or results of operations is uncertain.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined under SEC rules.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The FASB issued this update to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The guidance of ASU 2016-02 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period, and for all other entities, the amendments arc effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within that reporting period. We do not currently hold any leases and therefore adoption of ASU 2016-02 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In July 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-11, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): I. Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features; II. Replacement of the Indefinite Deferral for Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instruments of Certain Nonpublic Entities and Certain Mandatorily Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests with a Scope Exception (“ASU 2017-11”). Part I of this update addresses the complexity of accounting for certain financial instruments with down round features. Down round features are features of certain equity-linked instruments (or embedded features) that result in the strike price being reduced on the basis of the pricing of future equity offerings. Current accounting guidance creates cost and complexity for entities that issue financial instruments (such as warrants and convertible instruments) with down round features that require fair value measurement of the entire instrument or conversion option. Part II of this update addresses the difficulty of navigating Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, because of the existence of extensive pending content in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. This pending content is the result of the indefinite deferral of accounting requirements about mandatorily redeemable financial instruments of certain nonpublic entities and certain mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests. The amendments in Part II of this update do not have an accounting effect. The amendments in Part I of this ASU are effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. For all other entities, including EGCs, the amendments in Part I of this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted. The company’s early adoption of ASU 2017-11 on January 1, 2019 did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
As previously noted, we, as an emerging growth company, have elected to take advantage of the benefits of the extended transition period provided for in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards, which allows us to defer adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies unless otherwise noted.
We have reviewed other recent accounting pronouncements and concluded they are either not applicable to the business or no material effect is expected on the consolidated financial statements as a result of future adoption.
Effect of Inflation and Changes in Prices
We do not believe that inflation and changes in prices will have a material effect on our operations.
