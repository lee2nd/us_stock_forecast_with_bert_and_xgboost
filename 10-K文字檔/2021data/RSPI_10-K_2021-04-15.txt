Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes related thereto appearing elsewhere in this document.
Overview
The mission of the Company is to develop innovative and revolutionary treatments to combat disorders caused by disruption of neuronal signaling. We are developing treatment options that address conditions that affect millions of people, but for which there are limited or poor treatment options, including OSA, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (“ADHD”) epilepsy, chronic pain, including inflammatory and neuropathic pain, recovery from spinal cord injury (“SCI”), as well as other areas of interest based on results of animal studies to date.
RespireRx is developing a pipeline of new drug products based on our broad patent portfolios across two distinct drug platforms:
(i) our pharmaceutical cannabinoids platform (which we refer to as ResolutionRx), including dronabinol (a synthetic form of ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol (“Δ9-THC”)), which acts upon the nervous system’s endogenous cannabinoid receptors, and
(ii) our neuromodulators platform (which we refer to as EndeavourRx) is made up of two programs: (a) our AMPAkines program, including proprietary compounds that are positive allosteric modulators (“PAMs”) of AMPA-type glutamate receptors to promote neuronal function and (b) our GABAkines program, including proprietary compounds that are PAMs of GABAA receptors, which was established pursuant to our entry with the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Research Foundation, Inc., an affiliate of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (“UWMRF”), into a patent license agreement (the UWMRF Patent License Agreement”).
Financing our Platforms
We anticipate filing a Form 1-A with the SEC, which if qualified would enable the Company to engage in a Regulation A offering (Reg A Offering). We provide no assurance that we will file a Form 1-A, or if filed that the Reg A Offering would be qualified, or if qualified, would result in a financing on terms as to price per share or other securities offered, amount of funds raised or other terms acceptable to the Company or at all. Our major challenge has been to raise substantial equity or equity-linked financing to support research and development plans for our cannabinoid and neuromodulator platforms, while minimizing the dilutive effect to pre-existing stockholders. At present, we believe that we are hindered primarily by our public corporate structure, our OTCQB listing, and low market capitalization as a result of our low stock price. For this reason, the Company has effected an internal restructuring plan through which our two drug platforms have been reorganized into separate businesses units, and may, in the future, be spun out into subsidiaries.
We believe that by creating one or more subsidiaries to further the aims of Project ResolutionRx and Project EndeavourRx, it may be possible, through separate finance channels, to optimize the asset values of each.
For a more detailed discussion of our Cannabinoid and Neuromodulator programs, see subsections I and II under Item 1 - Business above.
Recent Developments
UIC Extension
UIC has granted the Company an extension of the due date for the payment of the minimum annual royal obligation of $100,000 that was originally due on December 31, 2020 until April 19, 2021. The amount due to UIC was paid in full on April 1, 2021.
UWM Research Foundation Option Agreement
On August 1, 2020, RespireRx exercised its option pursuant to its option agreement dated March 2, 2020, between RespireRx and UWM Research Foundation, an affiliate of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (“UWMRF”). Upon exercise RespireRx and UWMRF executed the UWMRF Patent License Agreement effective August 1, 2020 pursuant to which RespireRx licensed the identified intellectual property.
Under the UWMRF Patent License Agreement, the Company has an exclusive license to commercialize GABAkine products based on UWMRF’s rights in certain patents and patent applications, and a non-exclusive license to commercialize products based on UWMRF’s rights in certain technology that is not the subject of the patents or patent applications. UWMRF maintains the right to use, and, upon the approval of the Company, to license, these patent and technology rights for any non-commercial purpose, including research and education. The UWMRF Patent License Agreement expires upon the later of the expiration of the Company’s payment obligations to UWMRF or the expiration of the last remaining licensed patent granted thereunder, subject to early termination upon the occurrence of certain events. The License Agreement also contains a standard indemnification provision in favor of UWMRF and confidentiality provisions obligating both parties.
Conversions of Convertible Notes
See Note 4. Notes Payable - Convertible Notes Payable in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, included with this report for a detailed description of the terms of, and accounting for, the above-referenced convertible notes.
Forgiveness of Accrued Compensation and Related Costs
On March 22, 2020, two executive officers forgave an aggregate of $306,000 ($153,000 each) of accrued compensation and related costs and received 900,000 (450,000 each) shares of common stock.
On July 13, 2020, two executive officers forgave an aggregate of $1,100,000 of accrued unpaid compensation in exchange for 1,100 shares of Series H 2% Voting, Non-Participating Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series H Preferred Stock”).

On September 30, 2020, a portion of accounts payable due to two vendors totaling $241,109 for 241.10948 shares of Series H Preferred Stock. On September 30, 2020, all holders of Series H Preferred Stock converted 100% of the Series H Preferred Stock inclusive of accrued unpaid dividends, converted all of their Series H Preferred Stock into 25,377,426 shares of Common Stock and 25,377,426 common stock purchase warrants, both reflected on a post-reverse stock split basis, which reverse stock split occurred on January 5, 2021. As of December 31, 2020, there is no Series H preferred Stock outstanding.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
For a description of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 3-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Recent Accounting Pronouncements to the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, included with this report.
Concentration of Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. The Company limits its exposure to credit risk by investing its cash with high credit quality financial institutions.
The Company’s research and development efforts and potential products rely on licenses from research institutions and if the Company loses access to these technologies or applications, its business could be substantially impaired.
Through the merger with Pier, the Company gained access to the 2007 License Agreement that Pier had entered into with the University of Illinois on October 10, 2007. The 2007 License Agreement covered certain patents and patent applications in the United States and other countries claiming the use of certain compounds referred to as cannabinoids for the treatment of sleep related breathing disorders (including sleep apnea), of which dronabinol is a specific example of one type of cannabinoid. The 2007 License Agreement was terminated effective March 21, 2013 and on June 27, 2014, the Company entered into the 2014 License Agreement with the University of Illinois, the material terms of which were similar to the 2007 License Agreement that had been terminated and also included the assignment of rights to the University of Illinois, to certain patent applications filed by RespireRx.
The Company received an extension of time to make a $100,000 payment that would have been due on December 31, 2020. The payment date has been extended to April 19, 2021 and was paid in full by the Company on April 1, 2021 (See Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies - Significant Agreements and Contracts - University of Illinois 2014 Exclusive License Agreement in notes to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, included with this report).
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
SEC guidance defines Critical Accounting Estimates as those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operation of the registrant. These items require the application of management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. In preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, management has made estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
In preparing these financial statements, management has utilized available information, including our past history, industry standards and the current and projected economic environment, among other factors, in forming its estimates, assumptions and judgments, giving due consideration to materiality. Because the use of estimates is inherent in GAAP, actual results could differ from those estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. A summary of the accounting estimates that management believes are critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is set forth below. See Note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020 for additional disclosures regarding our significant accounting policies.
Stock-Based Compensation and Awards
The Company periodically issues common stock and stock options to officers, directors and consultants for services rendered. Such issuances vest and expire according to terms established at the issuance date of each grant.
The Company accounts for stock-based payments to officers, directors, outside consultants and vendors by measuring the cost of services received in exchange for equity awards based on the grant date fair value of the awards, with the cost recognized as compensation expense on the straight-line basis in the Company’s consolidated financial statements over the vesting period of the awards.
The fair value of stock options granted as stock-based payments is determined utilizing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, and is affected by several variables, the most significant of which are the life of the equity award, the exercise price of the stock option as compared to the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date, and the estimated volatility of the common stock over the term of the equity award. Estimated volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock. The risk- free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The fair market value of common stock is determined by reference to the quoted market price of the Company’s common stock.
Stock grants, which are sometimes subject to time-based vesting, are measured at the grant date fair value and charged to operations ratably over the vesting period.
Stock options and warrants issued to non-employees as compensation for services to be provided to the Company or in settlement of debt are accounted for based upon the fair value of the services provided or the estimated fair value of the stock option or warrant, whichever can be more clearly determined. Management uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of the stock options and warrants issued by the Company. The Company recognizes this expense over the period in which the services are provided.
Research and Development Costs
Research and development costs consist primarily of fees paid to consultants and outside service providers and organizations (including research institutes at universities) and other expenses relating to the acquisition, design, development and testing of the Company’s treatments and product candidates. Research and development costs include salaries of our officers who also perform administrative duties for the Company. Management makes an allocation of those salaries to research and development based on estimates of time spent on those activities.
Research and development costs incurred by the Company under research grants are expensed as incurred over the life of the underlying contracts, unless the terms of the contract indicate that a different expensing schedule is more appropriate.
The Company reviews the status of its research and development contracts on a quarterly basis.
License Agreements
Obligations incurred with respect to mandatory payments provided for in license agreements are recognized ratably over the appropriate period, as specified in the underlying license agreement, and are recorded as liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, with a corresponding charge to research and development costs in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. Obligations incurred with respect to milestone payments provided for in license agreements are recognized when it is probable that such milestone will be reached and are recorded as liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, with a corresponding charge to research and development costs in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. Payments of such liabilities are made in the ordinary course of business.
Patent Costs
Due to the significant uncertainty associated with the successful development of one or more commercially viable products based on the Company’s research efforts and any related patent applications, all patent costs, including patent-related legal and filing fees, are expensed as incurred and, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, are charged to general and administrative expenses.
Results of Operations
The Company’s consolidated statements of operations as discussed herein are presented below.
Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had no revenues.
General and Administrative. For the year ended December 31, 2020, general and administrative expenses were $2,676,860, an increase of $1,539,685, as compared to $1,137,175 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Stock-based compensation costs and fees included in general and administrative expenses were $345,500 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $0 for the year ended December 31, 2019, reflecting an increase of $345,500. The increase is the result stock option grants to general and administrative employees and consultants and service providers of the Company during the year ended December 31, 2020. Salaries included in general and administrative expenses were $693,676 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $300,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $393,676. The increase is primarily due to engagement of Timothy Jones as CEO and President commencing on May 6, 2020 and the accrual of salary and a scheduled bonus. Legal fees for general corporate purposes were $859,258 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $213,289 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $645,969 related to periodic filings with the SEC in the ordinary course of business, advise and research with respect to our planned securities offering pursuant to Regulation A, settlement negotiations with certain vendors, fees associated with our entering into first the option agreement and then the license agreement with UWMRF (as herein defined) and other general corporate matters. Legal fees associated with our filing of a Form S-1 registration statement and its becoming effective resulting in financings associated with our equity line have been charged against Additional paid-in capital as a cost of the financing to the extent such completed financings occurred in 2020 and have been recorded as a deferred financing cost, a current asset, on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. Legal fees for patents and other patent expenses included in general and administrative expenses were $213,916 for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $66,194 as compared to $147,722 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in legal fees associated with patents and other patent costs is a result of an increase in patent related activities with respect to the UWMRF licensed assets as well as foreign fees, patent maintenance fees and other patent related activities.
Research and Development. For the year ended December 31, 2020, research and development expenses were $638,275, an increase of $38,946 as compared to $599,329 for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the addition of several consultants offset by the decrease in the utilization of one consultant.
Loss on Extinguishment of Debt and other Liabilities in Exchange for Equity. The loss on extinguishment of debt or other liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $389,902 as compared to $0 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The loss is attributable to the exchange of certain notes for Common Stock and the payment of certain liabilities to vendors with Common Stock in 2020 as compared to no such transactions occurring in 2019.
Interest Expense. During the year ended December 31, 2020, interest expense was $545,675 (including $11,3429 to related parties), an increase of $141,014, as compared to $404,661 (including $60,135 to related parties) for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in interest expense resulted primarily from interest on five new convertible notes issued from April, June and July 2020 totaling $348,500 of principal amount in 2020, plus partial year interest on convertible notes from 2019 until paid in full and additional interest with respect to the Salamandra legal settlement. Also included in interest expense is the amortization of note discounts.
Foreign Currency Transaction Loss or Gain. The foreign currency transaction loss was $50,499 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to a foreign currency transaction gain of $26,132 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The foreign currency transaction loss or gain relates to the $399,774 loan from SY Corporation Co., Ltd., formerly known as Samyang Optics Co. Ltd. (“SY Corporation”), made in June 2012, which is denominated in the South Korean Won.
Net Loss. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company incurred a net loss of $4,301,211, as compared to a net loss of $2,115,033 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Working Capital and Cash
The Company’s consolidated financial statements have been presented on the basis that it is a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred net losses of $4,301,210 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 and $2,115,033 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, and negative operating cash flows of $513,001 and $487,745 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 respectively.

As a result, management has concluded that there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, has expressed substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern (see “Going Concern” below).
At December 31, 2020, the Company had a working capital deficit of $8,063,320, as compared to a working capital deficit of $7,444,819 at December 31, 2019, reflecting an increase in the working capital deficit of $618,501 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. This increase is comprised of an increase in total current liabilities of $658,260, offset by an increase in current assets of $39,759. The increase in total current liabilities consists of a net increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $1,211,417, decrease in accrued compensation and related expenses of $543,032, a decrease in convertible notes payable of $107,090, an increase in the note payable to SY Corporation of $98,315 and an increase in notes payable to officers and former officers of $28,317.

Financing Activities
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, financing activities consisted of five convertible note financings and an equity line.
The Company and PowerUp Lending Group Ltd. (“PowerUp”) entered into Securities Purchase Agreements, dated as of April 15, 2020 and June 7, 2020 (each, a “PowerUp Agreement”), by which PowerUp loaned $53,000 and $43,000, respectively, to the Company in return for two convertible promissory notes (the “April 2020 Note” and the “June 2020 Note” respectively). The proceeds of the loans, which equal $90,000 after payment of $5,000 in legal fees and $1,000 in due diligence fees, were used for general corporate purposes.
The April 2020 Note and the June 2020 Note were repaid in full inclusive of principal or interest at 12% per year by conversion of the Notes into Common Stock on October 22, 2020, October 23, 2020, October 26, 2020, December 14, 2020 and December 15, 2020. The conversions resulted in the issuance by the Company of 5,586,895 shares of Common Stock (post-reverse stock split basis).
On July 2, 2020, the Company and FirstFire Global Opportunities Fund LLC (“FirstFire”) entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “FirstFire SPA”) pursuant to which FirstFire provided a sum of $125,000 (the “FirstFire Consideration”) to the Company, in return for a convertible promissory note (the “FirstFire Note”) with a face amount of $137,500 (which difference in value as compared to the FirstFire Consideration is due to an original issue discount of $12,500), a common stock purchase warrant for 687,500 shares of Common Stock (post-reverse stock split basis (the “FirstFire Warrant”), and a confession of judgment, among other agreements and obligations. The net proceeds of the First Fire Consideration, which were received by the Company on July 6, 2020, equal $121,000 after payment of $4,000 in FirstFire’s legal fees.
The FirstFire Note was paid in full inclusive of principal and interest at 10% per annum by conversion into the Company’s Common Stock on January 19, 2021, February 4, 2021, February 16, 2021 and March 3, 2021. The conversions resulted in the issuance by the Company of 7,218,750 shares of Common Stock (post-reverse stock split basis). See Note 10 - Subsequent Events in the notes to our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020.
On July 28, 2020, the Company issued a convertible note, as amended (“Commitment Note”) to White Lion Capital, LLC (“White Lion”) pursuant to, and to induce White Lion to enter into an equity purchase agreement dated July 28, 2020 (“White Lion EPA”). See Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies - Entry into Equity Purchase Agreement to our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020 for a description of the White Lion EPA and the other agreements entered into pursuant to the White Lion EPA. The Commitment Note had an initial face amount of $25,000 which was subsequently amended effective July 28, 2020 to $40,000 in consideration for an amendment to the White Lion EPA extending the date by which the Company was to file a registration statement on Form S-1 listing White Lion as the selling stockholder on Form S-1. The Commitment Note was accounted for as equity issuance costs in Additional paid-in capital.
The Commitment Note obligates the Company to pay by July 28, 2021 a principal amount of $40,000, together with a guaranteed interest payment of $3,200 representing an 8% per annum interest rate applied regardless of any payments or prepayments other than payments made by conversion of the Commitment Note. Unless an event of default has occurred, White Lion may convert at a per share conversion price equal to $0.02.
$25,000 of the principal amount of the Commitment Note was paid in part, by conversion into the Company’s Common Stock on March 15, 2021. The conversion resulted in the issuance by the Company of 1,250,000 shares of Common Stock (post-reverse stock split basis). See Note 10 - Subsequent Events in the notes to our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, there remains $15,000 of principal amount plus accrued interest outstanding.
On July 28, 2020, the Company and White Lion entered into the White Lion EPA and a registration rights agreement (the “White Lion Registration Rights Agreement”). Pursuant to the White Lion EPA, White Lion agreed to invest up to $2,000,000 to purchase Common Stock at a purchase price of 85% of the lowest daily volume weighted average price of Common Stock for the five trading days prior to a given closing date.
Additionally, the Commitment Note described above was issued pursuant to the White Lion EPA and to induce White Lion to execute the White Lion EPA. See Note 4. Notes Payable-Convertible Notes Payable-Q3 2020 Convertible Notes-Convertible Note and Equity Purchase Agreement with White Lion Capital, LLC.
Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, RespireRx is obligated to register for resale under the Securities Act the shares of Common Stock to be issued and sold to White Lion pursuant to the White Lion EPA. On October 14, 2020, Respire Rx filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with respect to the resale of up to 11,500,000 of the shares of Common Stock (post-reverse stock split basis) to be issued and sold to White Lion pursuant to the White Lion EPA, and on October 29, 2020, the registration statement became effective. The registration statement does not necessarily represent all shares that may be sold to White Lion in order to fulfill its purchase commitment of $2,000,000 under the White Lion EPA.
On October 28, 2020, November 13, 2020, December 1, 2020 and February 19, 2021, the Company sent purchases notices to White Lion. The three purchase notices pursuant to which White Lion was required to purchase shares of Common Stock, in the fourth quarter of 2020, were for an aggregate 7,900,000 shares and resulted in net proceeds after closing costs of 8,235, of an aggregate of $162,886. The one purchase notice on February 19, 2021 was for 3,600,000 shares of Common Stock resulting in net proceeds after closing costs of $2,070 aggregating $115,229. The total of all shares sold pursuant to purchase notices is 11,500,000 which is all of the shares registered and offered for sale is the registration statement on Form S-1 that became effective on October 29, 2020. There are no shares available for sale under that registration statement. In order for the Company to issue additional purchase notices to White Lion, the Company would either have to file a new registration statement or amend the current registration statement covering shares representing any remaining amounts available under the White Lion EPA, or up to $1,711,581. See Note 10. Subsequent Events - Issuances of Common Stock - White Lion Capital LLC.
The White Lion EPA terminates on the earlier of (i) June 30, 2021, (ii) the date on which White Lion has purchased $2,000,000 of Common Stock, (iii) the date on which the White Lion Registration Rights Agreement is no longer in effect, (iv) upon White Lion’s material breach of the White Lion EPA, (v) in the event a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed with respect to the Company, or (vi) if a custodian is appointed for the Company for all or substantially all of its property or the Company makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors.
On July 30, 2020, the Company and EMA Financial, LLC (“EMA”) entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “EMA SPA”) by which EMA provided a sum of $68,250 (the “EMA Consideration”) to RespireRx, in return for a fixed rate convertible note (the “EMA Note”) with a face amount of $75,000, and a common stock purchase warrant (the “EMA Warrant”) for 375,000 shares of Common Stock (post-reverse stock split basis). The net proceeds received by RespireRx on August 4, 2020 were $63,750 after payment of $3,500 in EMA’s legal fees and the withholding by EMA of $1,000 in diligence fees.
The EMA Note obligates RespireRx to pay by October 30, 2021 (the “EMA Maturity Date”) a principal amount of $75,000 together with interest at a rate equal to 10% per annum, which principal exceeds the EMA Consideration by the amount of an original issue discount of $6,750.
The EMA Warrant is a common stock purchase warrant to purchase 375,000 shares of Common Stock, for value received in connection with the issuance of the EMA Note, from the date of issuance of the EMA Warrant until September 30, 2023, at an exercise price of $0.07 (post-reverse stock split basis and subject to adjustment as provided therein) per share of Common Stock.
The EMA Note was paid in full inclusive of principal and interest at 10% per annum by conversion into the Company’s Common Stock on February 4, 2021, February 10, 2021, February 12, 2021 and March 3, 2021. The conversions resulted in the issuance by the Company of 4,156,807 shares of Common Stock (post-reverse stock split basis). See Note 10. Subsequent Events in the notes to our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020.
The Company has engaged in additional convertible note financings in 2021 and may continue to do so. The Company is planning an equity securities offering pursuant to Regulation A in 2021 as well and will continue to consider additional forms of debt, equity and strategic partner financing throughout 2021.
Going Concern
The Company’s consolidated financial statements have been presented on the basis that it is a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred net losses of $4,301,210 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 and $2,115,033 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, and negative operating cash flows of $513,001 and $487,745 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company had a stockholders’ deficiency of $8,063,320 at December 31, 2020 and expects to continue to incur net losses and negative operating cash flows for at least the next few years. As a result, management has concluded that there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, and the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, expressed substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Company is currently, and has for some time, been in significant financial distress. It has limited cash resources and current assets and has no ongoing source of sustainable revenue. Management is continuing to address various aspects of the Company’s operations and obligations, including, without limitation, debt obligations, financing requirements, intellectual property, licensing agreements, legal and patent matters and regulatory compliance, and has continued to raise new debt and equity capital to fund the Company’s business activities from both related and unrelated parties.
The Company is continuing its efforts to raise additional capital in order to be able to pay its liabilities and fund its business activities on a going forward basis, including the pursuit of the Company’s planned research and development activities. We anticipate filing a Form 1-A with the SEC, which if qualified would enable the Company to engage in a Regulation A Offering. We provide no assurance that we will file a Form 1-A, or if filed that the Reg A Offering would be qualified, or if qualified, would result in a financing on terms as to price per share or other securities offered, amount of funds raised or other terms acceptable to the Company or at all. The Company regularly evaluates various other measures to satisfy the Company’s liquidity needs, including development and other agreements with collaborative partners and, when necessary, seeking to exchange or restructure the Company’s outstanding securities. The Company is evaluating certain changes to its operations and structure to facilitating raising capital from sources that may be interested in financing only discrete aspects of the Company’s development programs. Such changes could include a significant reorganization, which may include the formation of one or more subsidiaries into which one or more programs may be contributed. As a result of the Company’s current financial situation, the Company has limited access to external sources of debt and equity financing. Accordingly, there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to secure additional financing in the amounts necessary to fully fund its operating and debt service requirements. If the Company is unable to access sufficient cash resources, the Company may be forced to discontinue its operations entirely and liquidate.
