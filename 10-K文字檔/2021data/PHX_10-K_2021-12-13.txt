ITEM 7.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our accompanying financial statements and the notes to those financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion includes forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion and analysis generally discuss fiscal year 2021 and 2020 items and fiscal year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. Discussions of 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020.
Business Overview
We are focused on perpetual natural gas and oil mineral ownership in resource plays in the United States. Prior to a strategy change in 2019, we participated with a working interest on some of our mineral and leasehold acreage and as a result, we still have legacy interests in leasehold acreage and non-operated interests in natural gas and oil properties. Effective October 8, 2020, our corporate name was changed to PHX Minerals Inc. to more accurately reflect our business strategy.
Our results of operations are dependent primarily upon the Company’s: existing reserve quantities; costs associated with acquiring, exploring for and developing new reserves; production quantities and related production costs; and natural gas, oil and NGL sales prices. Although a significant amount of our revenues is currently derived from the production and sale of natural gas, oil and NGL on our working interests, a growing portion of our revenues is derived from royalties granted from the production and sale of natural gas, oil and NGL.
Strategic Focus on Mineral Ownership
During fiscal year 2019, we made the strategic decision to focus on perpetual natural gas and oil mineral ownership and growth through mineral acquisitions and the development of our significant mineral acreage inventory in our core areas of focus. In accordance with this decision, we ceased taking working interest positions on our mineral and leasehold acreage going forward. In fiscal years 2020 and 2021, we did not participate with a working interest in the drilling of any new wells. We believe that our strategy to focus on mineral ownership is the best path to giving our shareholders the greatest risk-weighted returns on their investments.
Market Conditions and Commodity Prices
Commodity prices are affected by many factors outside of our control, including changes in market supply and demand, which are impacted by weather conditions, pipeline capacity constraints, inventory storage levels, basis differentials and other factors. As a result, we cannot accurately predict future commodity prices and, therefore, we cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases in these prices will have on our production volumes or revenues.
Our working interest and royalty revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes in commodity prices, production mix and volumes of production sold by our operators.
Production and Operational Update
Our natural gas and NGL production for the fiscal year 2021 increased 12% and 2%, respectively, while oil production decreased 17% from that of 2020. The 2021 fiscal year’s higher natural gas, oil and NGL prices (as discussed below) and the overall production changes noted above resulted in a 62% increase in revenues from the sale of natural gas, oil and NGL in 2021.
Our proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves increased to 83.0 Bcfe in 2021, compared to 57.7 Bcfe in 2020, an increase of approximately 25.3 Bcfe, or 44%. The increase was primarily due to improved gas and oil prices and acquisitions, slightly offset by production and performance revisions. The revisions were primarily related to natural gas and oil wells extending their economic limits later than was projected in 2020 due to higher gas and oil prices and other reserve parameters, such as differentials and lease operating costs. This was coupled with acquisitions predominately located in the active drilling programs of the Haynesville Shale play in east Texas and western Louisiana and the Mississippi and Woodford Shale intervals in the SCOOP and STACK plays in the Ardmore and Anadarko basins of Oklahoma.
As of September 30, 2021, we owned an average 0.5% net revenue interest, consisting of all royalty interest, in 277 wells that were being drilled or awaiting completion.
Results of Operations
The following table reflects certain operating data for the periods presented:
Production by quarter for 2021 and 2020 was as follows (Mcfe):
Fiscal Year 2021 Compared to Fiscal Year 2020
Overview
Revenues decreased in 2021 primarily due to an increase in losses on derivative contracts, partially offset by higher natural gas, oil and NGL sales. We recorded a net loss of $6,217,237, or $0.24 per share, in 2021, compared to net loss of $23,952,037, or $1.41 per share, in 2020. Expenses decreased in 2021, primarily the result of decreases in provision for impairment (non-cash), DD&A, LOE and interest expense, partially offset by an increase in transportation, gathering and marketing expenses, production taxes and loss on debt extinguishment.
Natural Gas, Oil and NGL Sales
The increase was due to increased natural gas, oil and NGL prices of 82%, 36% and 108%, respectively, combined with higher natural gas and NGL volumes of 12% and 2%, respectively, partially offset by lower oil volumes of 17%.
The increase in natural gas production was primarily due to acquisitions in the Haynesville Shale play of Texas and Louisiana, and slightly offset by naturally declining production in the SCOOP and Arkoma STACK. The decrease in oil production was a result of naturally declining production in high interest wells in the Eagle Ford and Bakken plays, our strategy of no longer participating with working interest in new drilling in the Eagle Ford, and reduced drilling activity in the Bakken. These decreases were slightly offset by acquisitions and new drilling in the STACK. The increase in NGL production is primarily attributable to high interest wells coming back online after being shut-in for part of fiscal year 2020, as well as new wells being brought online in the STACK. This was slightly offset by naturally declining production in the SCOOP.
Given our strategic decision to cease participating with working interests, we plan to offset the natural decline of our existing production base by the development of our current inventory of mineral acreage and through acquisitions of additional mineral interests going forward.
Gains (Losses) on Derivative Contracts
The change in net loss on derivative contracts was due to the natural gas and oil collars and fixed price swaps being less beneficial in 2021 in relation to their respective contracted volumes and prices. The change from a net liability position of $707,647 at September 30, 2020, to a net liability position of $13,784,467 at September 30, 2021, resulted from non-cash loss on derivative contracts in the 2021 period of $4,276,820 and entry into off-market hedges with BP Energy Company (“BP”) for $8.8 million in cash. See Note 12 to the financial statements in Item 8 - “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further explanation.
Our natural gas and oil fixed price swaps in place at September 30, 2021, had expiration dates of through March 2023. We utilize derivative contracts for the purpose of protecting our cash flow and return on investments.
Lease Operating Expenses (LOE)
We are responsible for a portion of LOE relating to a well as a working interest owner. LOE includes normal recurring and nonrecurring expenses associated with our working interests necessary to produce hydrocarbons from our natural gas and oil wells, including maintenance, repairs, salt water disposal, insurance and workover expenses. Total LOE related to field operating costs
decreased $610,573 or 13% in 2021, compared to 2020. The decrease in LOE rate was principally the result of our strategic decision to cease participating with a working interest in new wells and the increase in royalty interest production as a percentage of total production.
Transportation, Gathering and Marketing
Transportation, gathering and marketing increased $954,418, or 20%, in 2021, compared to 2020. This increase in costs was primarily due to increased production in 2021. The increase in rate per Mcfe was primarily due to the increase in natural gas sales in relation to other products. Natural gas sales bear the large majority of our transportation, gathering and marketing fees.
Production Taxes
Production taxes are paid on produced natural gas and oil based on a percentage of revenues from products sold at both fixed and variable rates established by federal, state or local taxing authorities. Production taxes increased $915,392, or 89%, in 2021, compared to 2020. The increase in amount was primarily the result of increased natural gas, oil and NGL sales of $14,379,041 during 2021.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A)
DD&A is the amount of cost basis of natural gas and oil properties attributable to the volume of hydrocarbons extracted during such period, calculated on a units-of-production basis for working interest, and on a straight-line basis for producing and non-producing minerals. Estimates of proved developed producing reserves are a major component of the calculation of depletion. DD&A decreased $3,567,979, or 32%, in 2021 compared to 2020, of which $4,204,702 of the decrease resulted from a $0.47 decrease in the DD&A rate per Mcfe, partially offset by an increase of $636,723 resulting from production increasing 6% in 2021. The rate decrease was partially due to higher natural gas, oil and NGL prices utilized in the reserve calculations during the 2021 period, as compared to 2020 period, lengthening the economic life of wells. This resulted in higher projected remaining reserves on a significant number of wells causing decreased units of production DD&A, despite the increase in projection.
Provision for Impairment
Provision for impairment was $50,475 in 2021, as compared to $29,904,528 provision for impairment in 2020. During 2021, impairment of $37,879 was related to one field. These assets were written down to their fair market value as required by GAAP. During 2020, impairment of $29,315,806 was recorded on seven different fields including the Fayetteville and Eagle Ford shales, which represented 89% of our total impairment. The impairment in these seven fields was caused by lower future prices reducing future net cash flows associated with these fields, which caused these assets to fail the step one test for impairment as their undiscounted cash flows were not high enough to cover the book basis of the assets. These assets were written down to their fair market value as required by GAAP. The remaining $12,596 and $588,721 of impairment in the 2021 and 2020 periods, respectively, were recorded on other assets.
Interest Expense
The decrease was due to a lower outstanding debt balance in 2021 compared to 2020.
General and Administrative Costs (G&A)
G&A are costs not directly associated with the production of natural gas and oil and include the cost of employee salaries and related benefits, office expenses and fees for professional services. G&A for 2021 increased $182,981 as compared to 2020. The slight increase was primarily due to increased activity during the year, partially offset by our cost reduction efforts.
Loss on Debt Extinguishment
When we terminated our credit facility led by Bank of Oklahoma, we wrote-off all associated costs that had been previously capitalized.
Loss (Gain) on Asset Sales and Other
In 2021, we recorded a net gain on asset sales of $312,838 as compared to a net gain of $3,973,256 in 2020. During 2021, we sold 2,857 net mineral acres in Central Basin Platform in Texas for $285,714, resulting in a gain of $236,907. The remaining gain on asset sales in 2021 was due to various immaterial asset sales less adjustments.
During the first quarter of 2020, we sold producing mineral acreage in Eddy County, New Mexico, for a gain of $3,272,499. We utilized a like-kind exchange under Internal Revenue Code Section 1031 to defer income tax on all of the gain by offsetting it with the STACK/SCOOP mineral acreage acquisition that was purchased during the quarter using qualified exchange accommodation agreements. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we sold 5,925 non-producing mineral acres in northwestern Oklahoma for a gain of $717,640. The remaining gain on asset sales in 2020 was due to various asset sales less adjustments.
Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes
Income taxes changed $7,637,949, from a $8,289,000 benefit in 2020 to a $651,051 benefit in 2021. The income tax benefit change resulted primarily from the reduction in net loss.
When a provision for income taxes is expected for the year, federal and Oklahoma excess percentage depletion decreases the effective tax rate, while the effect is to increase the effective tax rate when a benefit for income taxes is recorded.
Fiscal Year 2020 Compared to Fiscal Year 2019
Overview
Revenues decreased in 2020 primarily due to lower natural gas, oil and NGL sales, lower gains on asset sales and lower gains on derivative contracts. The Company recorded a net loss of $23,952,037, or $1.41 per share, in 2020, compared to net loss of
$40,744,938, or $2.43 per share, in 2019. Expenses decreased in 2020, primarily the result of decreases in provision for impairment (non-cash), DD&A, LOE and transportation, gathering and marketing expenses.
Natural Gas, Oil and NGL Sales
The decrease was due to decreased natural gas, oil and NGL prices of 31%, 25% and 33%, respectively, combined with lower natural gas, oil and NGL volumes of 16%, 18% and 22%, respectively.
The decrease in oil production was a result of postponement of workovers due to prevailing economic conditions as well as naturally declining production in high interest wells in the Eagle Ford, and asset sales in 2019 and 2020 in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico. These decreases were slightly offset by a ten-well drilling program in the Bakken that came online in November 2019 and mineral acquisitions of Bakken and STACK producing properties in late 2019. Decreased natural gas and NGL production was primarily due to naturally declining production in the Arkoma Stack and STACK and, to a lesser extent, the Fayetteville, as well as production downtime in high-interest wells in the Arkoma Stack.
Gains (Losses) on Derivative Contracts
The change in net gain on derivative contracts was principally due to natural gas and oil collars and fixed price swaps being more beneficial in 2019 in relation to their respective contracted volumes and prices. During fiscal year 2020, we received $4,109,210 on settled derivative contracts as compared to $196,985 received in fiscal year 2019. The change from a net asset position at September 30, 2019, to a net liability position at September 30, 2020 resulted in an unrealized loss on derivative contracts in fiscal year 2020 of $3,201,791.
The Company’s natural gas and oil costless collar contracts and fixed price swaps in place at September 30, 2020, had expiration dates of October 2020 through February 2022. The Company utilizes derivative contracts for the purpose of protecting its cash flow and return on investments.
Gains on Asset Sales
In 2020, the Company recorded gain on asset sales of $3,997,436, as compared to $18,973,426 in 2019. During the first quarter of 2020, the Company sold producing mineral acreage in Eddy County, New Mexico, for a gain of $3,272,499. The Company utilized a like-kind exchange under Internal Revenue Code Section 1031 to defer income tax on all of the gain by offsetting it with the STACK/SCOOP mineral acreage acquisition that was purchased during the quarter using qualified exchange accommodation agreements. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company sold 5,925 non-producing mineral acres in northwestern Oklahoma for a gain of $717,640. The remaining gain on asset sales in 2020 was due to various asset sales less adjustments.
In 2019, the Company sold mineral acreage in Lea and Eddy Counties, New Mexico, for a gain of $9,096,938; Martin County, Texas, (mineral and leasehold) for a gain of $4,921,656; Loving, Reeves and Ward Counties, Texas, for a gain of $2,704,323; and Reagan and Upton Counties, Texas, for a gain of $2,250,509.
Lease Operating Expenses (LOE)
LOE related to field operating costs decreased $1,556,981 or 24% in 2020, compared to 2019. The decrease in LOE rate was principally the result of the Company’s strategic decision to not participate with a working interest in new wells, selling some non-core marginal properties, which had higher operating costs and operators negotiating lower well service pricing resulting in lower LOE charges.
Transportation, Gathering and Marketing
Transportation, gathering and marketing decreased $1,277,034 or 21% in 2020, compared to 2019, primarily due to decreased production in 2020. The decrease in transportation, gathering and marketing rate was primarily due to decreased natural gas production coupled with decreased natural gas prices. Natural gas sales cause the majority of the handling. Handling fees are charged either as a percent of sales or based on production volumes.
Production Taxes
The decrease in amount was primarily the result of decreased natural gas, oil and NGL sales of $16,040,033 during 2020.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A)
DD&A decreased $3,108,787 due to natural gas, oil and NGL production volumes decreasing 17% collectively in 2020, compared to 2019. An additional decrease of $3,774,013 was the result of a $0.44 decrease in the DD&A rate per Mcfe. The rate
decrease was principally due to large impairments taken during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 and the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, which lowered the basis of the assets. The rate decrease was partially offset by lower natural gas, oil and NGL prices utilized in the reserve calculations during fiscal year 2020, as compared to fiscal year 2019, shortening the economic life of wells. This resulted in lower projected remaining reserves on a significant number of wells causing increased units of production DD&A.
Provision for Impairment
Provision for impairment was $29,904,528 in 2020, as compared to $76,824,337 provision for impairment in 2019. During fiscal year 2020, impairment of $29,315,806 was recorded on seven different fields including the Fayetteville and Eagle Ford shales, which represent 89% of our total impairment. The impairment on assets in these seven fields was caused by lower futures prices associated with our products. Futures prices experienced downward pressure resulting in low pricing as of the end of the fiscal year 2020 second quarter. The reduced future net value associated with these fields caused the assets to fail the step one test for impairment as their undiscounted cash flows were not high enough to cover the book basis of the assets. These assets were written down to their fair market value as required by GAAP. The Fayetteville assets are dry-gas assets, of which the Company acquired a portion in 2011. Low natural gas prices at March 31, 2020, were the primary reason for impairment in this field. The Company recognized an impairment related to the Eagle Ford at September 30, 2019, of $76,560,376, primarily due to the removal of working interest PUDs from the Company’s reserve report. The further impairment of the Eagle Ford assets at March 31, 2020, was due to the decline in commodity prices over fiscal year 2020 at that time. The remaining $588,721 and $263,961 of impairment was recorded on other assets in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Interest Expense
The decrease was due to lower interest rates, on average, and a lower outstanding debt balance during 2020.
General and Administrative Costs (G&A)
The decrease was primarily the result of lower personnel expenses and lower Board expenses. The decrease in personnel expenses was primarily due to the severance of approximately $670,000 upon the resignation of our former CEO toward the end of fiscal year 2019, reductions in work force and lower performance-related compensation. Lower Board expenses are due to fewer Board members in 2020, as compared to 2019. Personnel and Board expenses were partially offset by increased technical consulting and legal expenses. The increase in technical consulting was due to increased cost for our then interim (now current) CEO, geologic and engineering fees. The increase in legal expenses was primarily due to additional work provided pertaining to the Company’s proxy statement, equity offering and general business advisement.
Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes
In both 2020 and 2019, the tax benefits were the result of a large pretax loss from the impairments in the second quarter of 2020 and the fourth quarter of 2019.
When a provision for income taxes is expected for the year, federal and Oklahoma excess percentage depletion decreases the effective tax rate, while the effect is to increase the effective tax rate when a benefit for income taxes is recorded.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At September 30, 2021, we had negative working capital of $2,912,862 which is inclusive of $12,087,988 of current derivative contract liabilities, as compared to positive working capital of $13,335,880 at September 30, 2020, which included $7.3 million of cash used for fiscal year 2021 first quarter acquisitions.
Liquidity
Cash and cash equivalents were $2,438,511 as of September 30, 2021, compared to $10,690,395 at September 30, 2020, a decrease of $8,251,884. Cash flows for the year ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, are summarized as follows:
Operating activities:
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $7,164,208 during 2021, as compared to 2020, primarily the result of the following:
•
Increased net payments on derivative contracts of $16,034,880;
•
Decreased lease bonus receipts of $260,295;
•
Decreased payments for interest expense of $285,825;
•
Decreased payments for G&A and other expense of $844,387;
•
Decreased field operating expenses of $1,067,442;
•
Increased income tax receipts of $48,950; and
•
Receipts of natural gas, oil and NGL sales (net of production taxes and gathering, transportation and marketing costs) and other increased $6,884,363.
Investing activities:
Net cash used in investing activities increased $13,906,401 during 2021, as compared to 2020, primarily as the result of the following:
•
Higher workover activity during 2021 increased our capital expenditures by $330,036;
•
Higher acquisition activity increased our expenditures by $10,336,097; and
•
Lower proceeds received from the sale of assets of $3,240,268.
Financing activities:
Net cash provided by financing activities increased $8,289,021 during 2021, as compared to 2020, primarily as a result of the following:
•
Increased cash receipts from off-market derivative contracts of $8,800,000 during 2021;
•
Increased net proceeds from equity issuance of $3,467,411 during 2021;
•
Decreased dividend payments by $591,716 during 2021;
•
Increased net payments on debt of $4,575,000.
Capital Resources
We had no capital expenditures to drill and complete wells in 2021, as a result of our strategy to cease participating in new wells with a working interest at the end of fiscal year 2019. We currently have no remaining commitments that would require significant capital to drill and complete wells.
Since we have decided to cease further participation in wells with a working interest on our mineral and leasehold acreage, we anticipate that capital expenditures for working interest properties will be minimal going forward, as the expenditures will be limited to capital workovers to enhance existing wells.
On October 8, 2020, we closed on the purchase of 297 net royalty acres in Grady County, Oklahoma, and 386 net royalty acres in Harrison, Panola and Nacogdoches Counties, Texas, for a purchase price of $5.5 million and 153,375 shares of our Common Stock, subject to customary closing adjustments. This purchase was mostly funded with cash from an underwritten public offering of 5,750,000 shares of our Common Stock that closed on September 1, 2020.
On November 12, 2020, we closed on the purchase of 184 net mineral acres in San Augustine County, Texas for a purchase price of $750,000.
On December 17, 2020, we closed on the purchase of an additional 142 net royalty acres in San Augustine County, Texas, for a purchase price of $1 million.
On April 20, 2021, we completed an underwritten public offering of 6,175,000 common shares (inclusive of overallotment option which closed on April 23, 2021) with net proceeds of approximately $11.1 million.
On April 30, 2021, we closed on the acquisition of certain mineral and royalty assets located in Stephens, Carter, Canadian, McClain, Murray and Garvin Counties, Oklahoma, with the consideration consisting of approximately $8.5 million in cash and 1,200,000 shares of our Common Stock. This acquisition included mineral and royalty assets totaling approximately 2,514 net royalty acres in the SCOOP. The acquisition had an effective date of November 1, 2020.
On June 23, 2021, we closed on the purchase of 131 net royalty acres in the Haynesville for a purchase price of $1 million.
On June 30, 2021, we closed on the purchase of 262 net royalty acres in the Haynesville for a purchase price of $1.3 million.
On September 24, 2021, pursuant to two separate Purchase and Sale Agreements (the “Purchase Agreements”), we closed on the purchase of mineral and royalty assets totaling approximately 817 net royalty acres in the Haynesville, with the consideration comprised of $728,214 in cash and 2,349,207 shares of our Common Stock. A portion of the Common Stock consideration is being held in escrow to satisfy potential indemnity claims arising under the Purchase Agreements. To the extent not returned to us in connection with indemnity claims or to the extent not held in connection with any unresolved indemnity claims, the shares held in escrow will be released to the sellers approximately six months after the closing date. One of the Purchase Agreements included registration rights relating to the Common Stock consideration and, pursuant to such registration rights, we registered the shares with the SEC.
We received lease bonus payments during fiscal year 2021 totaling approximately $0.4 million. Looking forward, the cash flow from bonus payments associated with the leasing of drilling rights on our mineral acreage is difficult to project as the current
economic downturn has decreased demand for new leasing by operators. However, management plans to continue to actively pursue leasing opportunities.
With continued natural gas and oil price volatility, management continues to evaluate opportunities for product price protection through additional hedging of our future natural gas and oil production. See Note 12 to the financial statements included in Item 8 - “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for a complete list of our outstanding derivative contracts.
The use of cash provided by operating activities and resultant change to cash is summarized in the table below:
Outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility at September 30, 2021, were $17,500,000. As of December 1, 2021, outstanding borrowings were $17,500,000.
Looking forward, we expect to fund overhead costs, mineral and royalty acquisitions, and dividend payments from cash provided by operating activities, cash on hand and borrowings from our Credit Facility. We had availability of $10,000,000 at September 30, 2021, under our Credit Facility and were in compliance with our debt covenants (current ratio, debt to trailing 12-month EBITDAX, as defined in the Credit Agreement, and restricted payments limited by leverage ratio). The debt covenants in the Credit Agreement limit the maximum ratio of our debt to EBITDAX to no more than 3.5:1.
On September 1, 2021, we entered into the Credit Agreement, which has an initial borrowing base of $27,500,00. The Credit Agreement provides for up to $100 million in borrowings from time to time by the Company and will mature on September 1, 2025. The Credit Agreement replaced our prior revolving credit facility, which was with a lending syndicate led by Bank of Oklahoma. Interest on the Credit Agreement will be calculated based on either (a) LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.750% to 3.750% per annum based on our Borrowing Base Utilization or (b) the greater of (1) the Prime Rate in effect for such day, or (2) the overnight cost of federal funds as announced by the US Federal Reserve System in effect on such day plus one-half of one percent (0.50%), plus, in each case, an applicable margin ranging from 1.750% to 2.750% per annum based on our Borrowing Base Utilization. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, a 5% interest penalty may apply to any outstanding amount not paid when due or that remains outstanding while an event of default exists. The Credit Agreement contains financial and various other covenants that are common in such agreements, including a (a) maximum ratio of consolidated Funded Indebtedness to consolidated pro forma EBITDAX of 3.50 to 1.00, calculated on a rolling four-quarter basis, and (b) minimum ratio of consolidated Current Assets to consolidated Current Liabilities (excluding the Loan Balance) of 1.00 to 1.00. Other negative covenants include restrictions on our ability to incur debt, grant liens, make fundamental changes and engage in certain transactions with affiliates. The Credit Agreement also restricts our ability to make certain restricted payments if both before and after the Restricted Payment (i) the Available Commitment is less than or equal to ten percent (10%) of the Borrowing Base or (ii) the Leverage Ratio on a pro forma basis is greater than 2.50 to 1.00. All capitalized terms in this description of the Credit Facility that are not otherwise defined in this Annual Report shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Credit Agreement.
Based on our expected capital expenditure levels, anticipated cash provided by operating activities for 2022, combined with availability under our Credit Facility and potential future sales of Common Stock under our currently effective shelf registration statement, including pursuant to the ATM Agreement described below, we have sufficient liquidity to fund our ongoing operations.
On August 25, 2021, we entered into an At-The-Market Equity Offering Sales Agreement (the “ATM Agreement”) with Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, as sales agent and/or principal (“Stifel”), pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time through or to Stifel, up to 3,000,000 shares of our Common Stock. As of September 30, 2021, we have sold 221,000 shares of Common Stock pursuant to the ATM Agreement for proceeds of approximately $0.7 million, net of commissions paid.
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS
We have our Credit Facility with certain lenders and Independent Bank, as Administrative Agent and Letter of Credit Issuer, which provides for up to $100 million in borrowings from time to time and is subject to an at least semi-annual borrowing base determination. The borrowing base at September 30, 2021, was $27,500,000 and all obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured, subject to permitted liens and other exceptions, by a first-priority security interest on substantially all of our personal property and at least 80% of the total value of our proved, developed and producing Oil and Gas Properties. The revolving loan matures on September 1, 2025. Borrowings under the revolving loan are due at maturity. Interest on the Credit Agreement is calculated based on either (a) LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.750% to 3.750% per annum based on our Borrowing Base Utilization or (b) the greater of (1) the Prime Rate in effect for such day, or (2) the overnight cost of federal funds as announced by the US Federal Reserve System in effect on such day plus one-half of one percent (0.50%), plus, in each case, an applicable margin ranging from 1.750% to 2.750% per annum based on our Borrowing Base Utilization. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, a 5% interest penalty may apply to any outstanding amount not paid when due or that remains outstanding while an event of default exists. At September 30, 2021, the effective rate was 3.75%. All capitalized terms in this description of the Credit Facility that are not otherwise defined in this Annual Report shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Credit Agreement.
Determinations of the borrowing base are made at least semi-annually (on December 1 and June 1) or whenever the banks, in their discretion, believe that there has been a material change in the value of the natural gas and oil properties. The Credit Agreement contains financial and various other covenants that are common in such agreements, including a (a) maximum ratio of consolidated Funded Indebtedness to consolidated pro forma EBITDAX of 3.50 to 1.00, calculated on a rolling four-quarter basis, and (b) minimum ratio of consolidated Current Assets to consolidated Current Liabilities (excluding the Loan Balance) of 1.00 to 1.00. Other negative covenants include restrictions on our ability to incur debt, grant liens, make fundamental changes, and engage in certain transactions with affiliates. The Credit Agreement also restricts our ability to make certain restricted payments if before or after the Restricted Payment (i) the Available Commitment is less than or equal to ten percent (10%) of the Borrowing Base or (ii) the Leverage Ratio on a pro forma basis is greater than 2.50 to 1.00. At September 30, 2021, we were in compliance with the covenants of the Credit Facility, had $17,500,000 outstanding and had $10,000,000 of borrowing base availability under the Credit Facility.
