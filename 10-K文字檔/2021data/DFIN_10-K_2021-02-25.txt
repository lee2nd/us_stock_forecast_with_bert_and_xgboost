ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) should be read together with the Company’s audited Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto, as well as “Item 1. Business” and “Item 6. Selected Financial Data,” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
MD&A contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on the Company’s current expectations and could be affected by the risks and uncertainties, as well as other factors, described throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
Business
For a description of the Company’s business and services and products offerings, refer to Item 1. Business, of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Company separately reports its net sales and related cost of sales for its software solutions, tech-enabled services and print and distribution offerings. The Company’s software solutions consist of Venue, ActiveDisclosure, eBrevia, Arc Suite and others. The Company’s tech-enabled services offerings consist of document composition, compliance-related SEC EDGAR filing services and transaction solutions. The Company’s print and distribution offerings primarily consist of conventional and digital printed products and related shipping costs.
Segments
In the first quarter of 2020, management realigned the Company’s operating segments to reflect changes in the manner in which the chief operating decision maker assesses information for decision-making purposes. The Company’s four operating and reportable segments are: Capital Markets - Software Solutions, Capital Markets - Compliance and Communications Management, Investment Companies - Software Solutions and Investment Companies - Compliance and Communications Management. Corporate is not an operating segment and consists primarily of unallocated selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) activities and associated expenses, as further described below. Prior to its sale in 2018, the Language Solutions business, which helped companies adapt their business content into different languages for specific countries, markets and regions, was an operating segment. For a description of the Company’s segments, refer to Item 1. Business, of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
All prior year amounts related to segments have been reclassified to conform to the Company’s current reporting structure. There was no impact on the Company’s previously reported consolidated statements of operations, consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income, consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of cash flows or consolidated statements of equity as a result of the new segmentation. For the Company’s financial results and the presentation of certain other financial information by segment, refer to Note 15, Segment Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Executive Overview
2020 Overview
Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $19.8 million, or 2.3%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Net sales increased primarily due to higher capital markets transactional volumes, higher software solutions volume in Arc Suite, ActiveDisclosure and Venue and sales increases in other compliance software solutions, partially offset by lower print volumes in mutual fund compliance and commercial. Of the $19.8 million net sales increase, tech-enabled services net sales increased $44.5 million, software solutions net sales increased $10.9 million whereas print and distribution net sales decreased $35.6 million.
Income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $74.9 million, or 95.4%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Income from operations decreased primarily due to $65.6 million of higher restructuring, impairment and other charges, net, higher incentive compensation expense, the $19.2 million net gain from the sale of a building recorded in the year ended December 31, 2019, the predominantly non-cash charges of $19.0 million for the LSC multiemployer pension plan obligations and higher healthcare expense, partially offset by cost control initiatives and higher sales volumes. Restructuring, impairment and other charges, net for the year ended December 31, 2020 included $60.6 million of non-cash impairment charges and $15.6 million of restructuring charges, primarily related to efficiency efforts to prepare the Company for the upcoming implementation of SEC Rule 30e-3 and amendments to SEC rule 498A, as described below, and the reorganization of certain capital markets operations and selling and administration functions.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased $99.7 million to $154.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $54.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to improved operating performance, working capital changes as well as lower payments for interest and income taxes, as further described in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.
Outlook
In 2021, the Company expects a decrease in net sales, as compared to 2020, primarily due to the regulatory impact from the implementation of SEC Rule 30e-3, Rule 498A and the Company’s exiting of certain printing and distribution relationships. Both regulations reduce or eliminate printed shareholder and investor information. Capital markets traditional transactional and compliance volumes within CM-CCM are also expected to decline, partially offset by expected continued growth from the Company’s software solutions portfolio. The Company anticipates modest margin improvement in 2021 from an improved business mix and the continued impact of cost control actions. The Company does not expect foreign exchange rates to have a significant impact on results.
Cash flows from operations in 2021 are expected to decline, due primarily to the anticipated lower net sales, partially offset by the benefit from cost control actions and lower cash interest expense. The Company expects capital expenditures to be approximately $45.0 million in 2021, as compared to $31.1 million in 2020. The increase in capital expenditures is primarily related to investments in the Company’s software portfolio.
COVID-19
As further described in Part 1 - Item 1. Business-COVID-19, in December 2019, COVID-19 was identified in China and has since extensively impacted the global health and economic environment. On March 11, 2020, WHO characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. Although COVID-19 has adversely impacted the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and overall financial performance, the extent of that impact is currently uncertain and depends on factors including the impact on the Company’s customers, employees and vendors.
The Company has taken numerous steps, and will continue to take further actions as needed, in its response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company has implemented business continuity plans and has instructed all employees that can work from home to do so, has implemented travel restrictions and has conducted virtual customer and employee meetings. These decisions may delay or reduce sales and harm productivity and collaboration. The Company incurred $0.5 million of incremental expenses, net of sales surcharges and government subsidies, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic during the year ended December 31, 2020. Incremental expenses incurred included incremental vendor costs and premium wages paid to certain employees as well as costs to clean and disinfect the Company’s facilities more frequently. The Company also received certain government subsidies in connection with COVID-19, primarily related to employee wages at certain international locations. As a result of the incremental expenses, the Company invoiced certain customers COVID-19-related sales surcharges to recoup some of the expenses. The Company could continue to incur such costs in future periods, however, the impact of such costs on the Company’s business, results of operations, liquidity and overall financial performance cannot be predicted at this time. The Company is also working closely with its clients to support them as they implement their own contingency plans, helping them access the Company’s services and products and continue to meet their regulatory requirements.
The Company believes that implementing cost reduction efforts helped mitigate the impact that reduced revenues in the first half of 2020 had on income from operations. The Company has reduced expenses and may take further actions that alter its business operations as the situation evolves. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects on the Company’s business, results of operations, liquidity and overall financial performance cannot be predicted at this time.
Multiemployer Pension Plans Obligation
On April 13, 2020, LSC announced that it, along with most of its U.S. subsidiaries, voluntarily filed for business reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (“LSC Chapter 11 Filing”). LSC and the Company separated from RRD in a tax-free distribution to shareholders effective October 1, 2016. In the second quarter of 2020, the Company became aware that, subsequent to the LSC Chapter 11 Filing, LSC failed to make certain required monthly and quarterly withdrawal liability payments to multiemployer pension plans from which RRD had withdrawn prior to the Separation. Responsibility for the LSC MEPP Liabilities, had been assigned to LSC pursuant to the September 14, 2016 Separation and Distribution Agreement among the Company, RRD and LSC (the “Separation Agreement”), however, the Company and RRD remained jointly and severally liable for the LSC MEPP Liabilities pursuant to laws and regulations governing multiemployer pension plans. The Company believes the total undiscounted LSC MEPP Liabilities for which LSC was responsible at the time of the LSC Chapter 11 Filing were approximately $103 million (or approximately $57 million on a discounted basis, assuming a blended discount rate of approximately 10%) and are payable over approximately a 14-year period (through 2034), with annual payments ranging from $1.6 million to $8.2 million.
On July 24, 2020, the Company and RRD signed an agreement agreeing to submit to mediation and, if required, arbitration to determine the final liability allocation between the Company and RRD with respect to the LSC MEPP Liabilities. DFIN and RRD also agreed to share all required monthly and quarterly withdrawal liability payment obligations that become due during the mediation/arbitration period, with an adjustment and repayment to be made for any such payments according to the final allocation. The Company and RRD were unable to agree on the final liability allocation in mediation and anticipate submitting the matter to arbitration pursuant to the terms of the Separation Agreement.
The Company is required to record a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. As of June 30, 2020, the Company recorded a contingent liability of $10.2 million for its potential payments in respect of the LSC MEPP Liabilities, representing the Company’s low end of the range of potential outcomes. The Company also recorded an additional accrual of $2.1 million in the second quarter of 2020 for the Company’s estimated share of the obligation until a final allocation is determined. Subsequently, the Company increased its estimated low end of the range of potential outcomes and the estimated duration of the Company’s shared payments until a final allocation is determined. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has $15.2 million accrued related to the contingent liability as well as the Company’s estimated share of required payments until a final allocation is determined. The Company is not able to reasonably estimate the maximum potential loss due to the uncertainty related to the outcome of the final allocation of the LSC MEPP Liabilities between the Company and RRD. The expense associated with this liability has been recorded in SG&A expense within the Corporate segment in the Company’s audited Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020.
There can be no assurance that the Company’s actual future liabilities relating to the LSC MEPP Liabilities will not differ materially from the contingency amount recorded in the Company’s audited Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company’s LSC MEPP Liabilities could also be affected by the financial stability of other employers participating in such plans and decisions by those employers to withdraw from such plans in the future, including the financial stability of RRD.

The following table summarizes unallocated operating expenses and certain items impacting comparability within the activities presented as Corporate:
Year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the Year ended December 31, 2019
Corporate operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $41.7 million versus the same period in 2019, primarily due to the $19.0 million charge related to the LSC multiemployer pension plans obligation, higher incentive compensation, healthcare and share-based compensation expense and higher restructuring, impairment, and other charges, net, partially offset by the loss on the sale of the Language Solutions business recorded in 2019 and lower investor-related expenses.
Year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the Year ended December 31, 2018
Corporate operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $7.6 million versus the same period in 2018, primarily due to lower disposition-related expenses and spin-off related transaction expenses, partially offset by the net loss recognized in 2019 for the sale of the Language Solutions business and an increase in restructuring, impairment, and other charges, net.
Non-GAAP Measures
The Company believes that certain Non-GAAP measures, such as Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA (“Adjusted EBITDA”), provide useful information about the Company’s operating results and enhance the overall ability to assess the Company’s financial performance. The Company uses these measures, together with other measures of performance under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), to compare the relative performance of operations in planning, budgeting and reviewing the performance of its business. Adjusted EBITDA allows investors to make a more meaningful comparison between the Company’s core business operating results over different periods of time. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company’s results under GAAP and the accompanying reconciliations, provides useful information about the Company’s business without regard to potential distortions. By eliminating potential differences in results of operations between periods caused by factors such as historic cost and age of assets, restructuring, impairment and other charges, acquisition-related expenses, and gain or loss on certain equity investments and asset sales as well as other items, as described below, the Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful additional basis for comparing the current performance of the underlying operations being evaluated.
Adjusted EBITDA is not presented in accordance with GAAP and has important limitations as an analytical tool. These measures should not be considered as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s results as reported under GAAP. In addition, these measures are defined differently by different companies and, accordingly, such measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies.
In addition to the factors listed above, the following items are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA:
•
Share-based compensation expense. Although share-based compensation is a key incentive offered to certain of the Company’s employees, business performance is evaluated excluding share-based compensation expenses. Depending upon the size, timing and the terms of grants, non-cash compensation expense may vary but will recur in future periods.
•
COVID-19 related sales surcharges and expenses, net. Incremental expenses incurred, sales surcharges and government subsidies recognized as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Incremental expense included incremental vendor costs and premium wages paid to certain employees as well as costs to clean and disinfect the Company’s facilities more frequently. As a result, of these incremental expenses, the Company invoiced certain customers COVID-19 related surcharges. The Company also received certain government subsidies, primarily related to employee wages at certain international locations.
•
Investor-related expenses. Expenses incurred related to non-routine investor matters, which include third-party advisory and consulting fees and legal fees.
•
Spin-off related transaction expenses. The Company incurred expenses related to the Separation to operate as a standalone publicly traded company. These expenses include third-party consulting fees, information technology expenses, employee retention payments, legal fees and other costs related to the Separation, including system implementation expenses related to transitioning from transition service agreements with RRD and LSC. Management does not believe that these expenses are reflective of ongoing operating results.
•
Disposition-related expenses. Expenses incurred related to the disposition of the Language Solutions business. These expenses primarily include legal fees, third-party advisory and consulting fees and other costs related to the disposition.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity to support its ongoing operations and to invest in future growth to create value for its shareholders. Cash on hand, operating cash flows and the Company’s Revolving Facility are the primary sources of liquidity and are expected to be used for, among other things, payment of interest and principal on the Company’s debt obligations, capital expenditures necessary to support productivity improvement and growth, acquisitions and completion of restructuring programs.
The Company maintains cash pooling structures that enable participating international locations to draw on the pools’ cash resources to meet local liquidity needs. Foreign cash balances may be loaned from certain cash pools to U.S. operating entities on a temporary basis in order to reduce the Company’s short-term borrowing costs or for other purposes. The Company has the ability to repatriate any previously taxed foreign cash associated with the foreign earnings subject to the U.S. parent with minimal tax consequences. The Company maintains its assertion of indefinite reinvestment on all foreign earnings and other outside basis differences to indicate that the Company remains indefinitely reinvested in operations outside of the U.S., with the exception of the previously taxed foreign cash already subject to U.S. tax. The Company repatriated excess cash at its foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. during the year ended December 31, 2019 and did not make additional cash repatriations during 2020. The Company does not plan to make additional cash repatriations during 2021.
Cash and cash equivalents were $73.6 million as of December 31, 2020, an increase of $56.4 million as compared to December 31, 2019. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020 included $62.0 million in the U.S. and $11.6 million at international locations.
The following describes the Company’s cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Cash Flows Provided By Operating Activities
Operating cash inflows are largely attributable to sales of the Company’s services and products as well as recurring expenditures for labor, rent, raw materials and other operating activities.
2020 compared to 2019
Net cash provided by operating activities was $154.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $54.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in cash provided by operating activities of $99.7 million was primarily due to improved operating performance, an increase in accrued liabilities and other, primarily related to incentive compensation and other benefits as well as LSC MEPP Liabilities, the timing of supplier payments and a decrease in interest and income taxes paid, partially offset by a decrease in collections due to the timing of customer payments. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and other increased operating cash flows by $74.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to a $27.1 million decrease in operating cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019. Accounts receivable decreased operating cash flow by $14.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to an $8.7 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2019. The Company’s interest payments decreased by $7.4 million to $24.5 million in 2020, from $31.9 million in 2019, due primarily to the repayment of the Company’s Term Loan Credit Facility and lower Revolving Facility borrowings. Cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds, decreased by $3.3 million to $21.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $25.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 due primarily to deferrals of 2020 tax payments provided under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and increased 2019 tax payments on the gain from the 2018 sale of the Language Solution business.
2019 compared to 2018
Net cash provided by operating activities was $54.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $66.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease of $11.8 million was primarily due to unfavorable operating results and higher cash paid for income taxes, offset by a reduction in interest payments. Cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds, increased by $14.9 million to $25.0 million in 2019, from $10.1 million in 2018, due primarily to the payment of taxes in 2019 on the gain from the 2018 sale of the Language Solutions business as well as the net gain from the sale of a building in 2019. The Company’s interest payments decreased by $2.7 million to $31.9 million in 2019, from $34.6 million in 2018, due primarily to the repayment of the Company’s Term Loan Credit Facility. Accounts receivable increased operating cash flows by $8.7 million in 2019, as compared to an outflow of $25.3 million in 2018, due to increased collections efforts and the timing of customer payments in 2019. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and other decreased operating cash flows by $27.1 million in 2019, as compared to an inflow of $9.0 million in 2018, primarily due to the timing of supplier payments.

_________
(a)
Excludes unamortized debt issuance costs of $2.5 million, which do not represent contractual commitments with a fixed amount or maturity date.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company paid in full the remaining balance of the Term Loan Credit Facility of $72.5 million. As a result, the Company recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, related to unamortized debt issuance costs and the original issuance discount, which is included in interest expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations.
8.25% Senior Notes Due 2024- On September 30, 2016, DFIN (the “Parent”) issued $300.0 million of 8.25% senior unsecured notes due October 15, 2024 (the “Notes”). The Company’s Notes, with interest payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15, were issued pursuant to an indenture (the “Indenture”) where certain wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries of the Company guarantee the Notes (the “Guarantors”). In the first quarter of 2020, the Company purchased and retired $66.5 million (notional amount) of the Notes at an average price of 95.25 and recognized a pre-tax gain on the extinguishment of debt of $2.3 million, which was net of unamortized debt issuance costs, and is recorded within interest expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In the third quarter of 2020, the Company purchased and retired $0.5 million (notional amount) of the Notes at an average price of 98.75.
The Notes are fully and unconditionally as well as jointly and severally guaranteed, on an unsecured basis, by the Guarantors, which are comprised of each of the Company’s existing and future direct and indirect wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries that guarantee the Company’s obligations under the Credit Facilities, including Donnelley Financial, LLC and DFS International Holding, Inc. The Notes are not guaranteed by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries or unrestricted subsidiaries (“Nonguarantors”). The Indenture governing the Notes contains certain covenants applicable to the Company and its restricted subsidiaries, including limitations on: (1) liens; (2) indebtedness; (3) mergers, consolidations and acquisitions; (4) sales, transfers and other dispositions of assets; (5) loans and other investments; (6) dividends and other distributions, stock repurchases and redemptions and other restricted payments; (7) restrictions affecting subsidiaries; (8) transactions with affiliates; and (9) designations of unrestricted subsidiaries. Each of these covenants is subject to important exceptions and qualifications.
The Notes and the related guarantees are the Company and the Guarantors’, respective, senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment to all present and future senior debt, including the obligations under the Company’s Credit Facilities, senior in right of payment to all present and future subordinated debt, and effectively subordinated in right of payment to any of the Company and the Guarantors’ secured debt, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt.
The guarantee of the Notes by a subsidiary guarantor will be automatically released under certain situations, including upon the sale or disposition of such subsidiary guarantor to a person that is not DFIN or a subsidiary guarantor of the notes, the liquidation or dissolution of such subsidiary guarantor, and if such subsidiary guarantor is released from its guarantee obligations under the Company’s Credit Facilities.
The following summarized financial information of both the Parent and the Guarantors is presented on a combined basis; intercompany balances and transactions between the Parent and the Guarantors have been eliminated and the summarized financial information does not reflect investments of the Parent or the Guarantors in Nonguarantors. The Parent’s or Guarantor’s amounts due from, amounts due to, and transactions with Nonguarantor are disclosed below:
During 2020, Nonguarantors intercompany revenue and cost of sales totaled $2.6 million each. As of December 31, 2020, an intercompany short-term note receivable due to Nonguarantors from the Parent totaled $27.5 million and an intercompany accounts receivable due to Parent from Nonguarantors totaled $3.6 million.
Credit Agreement-The Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants, including, but not limited to, a minimum Interest Coverage Ratio and the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, as defined in and calculated pursuant to the Credit Agreement, that, in part, restrict the Company’s ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, engage in mergers and consolidations, make restricted payments and dispose of certain assets. The Credit Agreement generally allows annual dividend payments of up to $20.0 million in aggregate, though additional dividends may be allowed subject to certain conditions. Each of these covenants is subject to important exceptions and qualifications.
As of December 31, 2020, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Facility. Based on the Company’s results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 and existing debt, the Company would have had the ability to utilize all of the $300.0 million Revolving Facility and not have been in violation of the terms of the agreement. The Revolving Facility has a maturity date of December 18, 2023.
The current availability under the Revolving Facility and net available liquidity as of December 31, 2020 is shown in the table below:
The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants as of December 31, 2020, and expects to remain in compliance based on management’s estimates of operating and financial results for 2021 and the foreseeable future. However, declines in market and economic conditions or demand for certain of the Company’s services and products could impact the Company’s ability to remain in compliance with its debt covenants in future periods.
The failure of a financial institution supporting the Revolving Facility would reduce the size of the Company’s committed facility unless a replacement institution was added. As of December 31, 2020, the Revolving Facility is supported by sixteen U.S. and international financial institutions. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $3.7 million in outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees, of which none reduced the availability under the Revolving Facility.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company met all the conditions required to borrow under the Revolving Facility and management expects the Company to continue to meet the applicable borrowing conditions.

OTHER INFORMATION
Litigation and Contingent Liabilities
For a discussion of certain litigation and contingent liabilities involving the Company, see Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the extensive use of management’s estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Estimates are used when accounting for items and matters including, but not limited to, allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, pension, goodwill, asset valuations and useful lives, income taxes and other provisions and contingencies.
Revenue Recognition
The Company manages highly-customized data and materials, such as the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the Investment Company Act filings with the SEC on behalf of the Company’s customers, manages virtual data rooms and performs XBRL and related services. Clients are provided with EDGAR filing services, XBRL compliance services and translation, editing, interpreting, proof-reading and multilingual typesetting services, among other services. The Company’s software solutions include Venue, the Arc Suite software platform, ActiveDisclosure, data and analytics and others.
Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised services or products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services or products. The Company’s arrangements with customers often include promises to transfer multiple services or products to a customer. Determining whether services and products are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately requires significant judgment. Certain customer arrangements have multiple performance obligations as certain promises are both capable of being distinct and are distinct within the context of the contract. Other customer arrangements have a single performance obligation as the promise to transfer the individual goods or services is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts, and therefore are not distinct. Billings for shipping and handling costs as well as certain postage costs and out-of-pocket expenses are recorded gross. The Company expenses the costs to obtain the contract, primarily commissions, as incurred. For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations. As the Company provides customer specific solutions, observable standalone selling price is rarely available. As such, standalone selling price is more frequently determined using an estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct service or product, taking into consideration the historical selling price by customer for each distinct service or product, if available. These estimates may vary from the final amounts invoiced to the customer and are adjusted upon completion of all performance obligations.
The timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers and these timing differences result in unbilled receivables, contract assets or contract liabilities. Contract assets represent revenue recognized for performance obligations completed before an unconditional right to payment exists and therefore invoicing has not yet occurred. The Company estimates contract assets based on the historical selling price of the completed performance obligation. Unbilled receivables are recorded when there is an unconditional right to payment and invoicing has not yet occurred. The Company estimates the value of unbilled receivables based on a combination of historical customer selling price by service or product and management’s assessment of realizable selling price. Unbilled revenues can vary significantly from period to period as a result of seasonality, volume and market conditions. Unbilled receivables and contract assets are included in accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and progress billings which are included in accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Because substantially all of the Company’s products are customized, product returns are not significant; however, the Company accrues for the estimated amount of customer credits at the time of sale. Refer to Note 1, Overview, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Goodwill
The Company’s methodology for allocating the purchase price of acquisitions is based on established valuation techniques that reflect the consideration of several factors, including valuations performed by third-party appraisers when appropriate. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value assigned to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is either assigned to a specific reporting unit or allocated between reporting units based on the relative fair value of each reporting unit. Based on its current organization structure, the Company has identified four reporting units for which cash flows are determinable and to which goodwill may be allocated.
The Company performs its goodwill impairment tests annually as of October 31, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. As a result of the new segmentation in Q1 2020, a goodwill impairment analysis was completed as of March 31, 2020 under the Company’s previous reporting structure as well as the Company’s current reporting structure. A goodwill impairment was not recognized as the estimated fair value of all reporting units, under both the previous and current reporting structures, exceeded their respective carrying amounts. The Company also performs an interim review for indicators of impairment each quarter to assess whether an interim impairment review is required for any reporting unit. As part of its interim reviews, management analyzes potential changes in the value of individual reporting units based on each reporting unit’s operating results for the period compared to expected results as of the prior year’s annual impairment test. In addition, management considers how other key assumptions, including discount rates and expected long-term growth rates, used in the last annual impairment test, could be impacted by changes in market conditions and economic events. Based on these interim assessments, management concluded that as of the interim periods, no events or changes in circumstances indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value for any reporting unit had declined below its carrying amount.
As of October 31, 2020, the CM-SS, CM-CCM, IC-SS and IC-CCM reporting units each had goodwill. Each of the reporting units was reviewed for impairment using a quantitative assessment.
For each of the reporting units, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit was compared to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the estimated fair value, an impairment loss is generally recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
Quantitative Assessment for Impairment-The analysis performed included estimating the fair value of each reporting unit using both the income and market approaches. The income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, discount rates and the allocation of shared or corporate items. The market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping. The Company weighted both the income and market approach equally to estimate the concluded fair value of each reporting unit.
The determination of fair value in the quantitative assessment requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies and an appropriate market multiple, the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, restructuring charges and capital expenditures.
As a result of the 2020 annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $40.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 for the impairment of goodwill in the IC-CCM reporting unit. The goodwill impairment charge resulted from a reduction in the estimated fair value of the IC-CCM reporting unit due to lower expectations for future sales and profitability, primarily driven by an increase in the estimated shift of future revenues from IC-CCM to software solutions. The goodwill impairment was determined using Level 3 inputs, including a discounted cash flow analysis, comparable marketplace fair value data and management’s assumptions. As of December 31, 2020, the IC-CCM reporting unit had no remaining goodwill. No other goodwill impairment charges were recorded as the estimated fair values of the remaining reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts.
Goodwill Impairment Assumptions-Although the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units, the amount of the goodwill impairment charge, or both.
One measure of the sensitivity of the amount of goodwill impairment charges to key assumptions is the amount by which each reporting unit “passed” (fair value exceeds carrying amount, a “cushion”) or “failed” (the carrying amount exceeds fair value) the quantitative assessment. As of October 31, 2020, the CM-CCM and IC-SS reporting units had fair values far in excess of carrying value; however, the CM-SS reporting unit’s fair value exceeded its book value by 19.5%. As of December 31, 2020, goodwill allocated to the CM-SS reporting unit was $103.7 million.
Generally, changes in estimates of expected future cash flows would have a similar effect on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. That is, a 1.0% decrease in estimated annual future cash flows would decrease the estimated fair value of the reporting unit by approximately 1.0%. The estimated long-term net sales growth rate can have a significant impact on the estimated future cash flows, and therefore, the fair value of each reporting unit. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 1.0% decrease in the long-term net sales growth rate would not have resulted in an impairment loss for any of the Company’s reporting units. Of the other key assumptions that impact the estimated fair values, most reporting units have the greatest sensitivity to changes in the estimated discount rate. The discount rate for the CM-SS reporting unit was 11.0% as of October 31, 2020. Assuming the income and market approach are averaged to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit, a 1.0% increase in the estimated discount rate for the CM-SS reporting unit would result in a cushion of approximately 11%. A 1.0% increase in estimated discount rate would not have resulted in an impairment loss for any of the reporting units. The Company believes that its estimates of future cash flows and discount rates are reasonable, but future changes in the underlying assumptions could differ due to the inherent uncertainty in making such estimates. Additionally, lower volumes, additional unfavorable regulatory developments or lower than expected growth or profitability of software solutions could have a significant impact on the fair values of the reporting units.
Other Long-Lived Assets
The Company evaluates the recoverability of other long-lived assets, including right-of-use assets (“ROU”), property, plant and equipment, software and definite-lived intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The Company assesses its asset groups for indicators of impairment on a recurring basis. Factors which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business, a significant decrease in the market value of the assets or significant negative industry or economic trends. When the Company determines that the carrying value of one of its asset groups may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the indicators, the assets are assessed for impairment based on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group and its eventual disposition. If the carrying value of an asset group exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset group’s carrying value over its fair value.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company abandoned certain operating leases, with an intent to sublease the properties. As the fair value of the ROU assets was less than the carrying value, the Company recognized impairments of ROU assets of $18.2 million. The fair value of these assets was estimated utilizing inputs from market comparables in order to estimate future cash flows expected from sublease income over the remaining lease terms. Future changes in the estimated amount or timing of sublease arrangements could result in further impairment charges. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company also recognized impairment charges of $1.8 million and $0.4 million, respectively, related to software assets. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized impairment charges of $1.0 million related to customer relationship intangible assets in the Company’s CM-CCM and IC-SS segments.
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Plans
Subsequent to the Separation, certain pension plan liabilities and assets were transferred from RRD to the Company upon the legal split of those plans.
The Company’s primary defined benefit plan was frozen effective December 31, 2011. No new employees are permitted to enter the Company’s frozen plan and participants will earn no additional benefits. Benefits are generally based upon years of service and compensation. These defined benefit retirement income plans are funded in conformity with the applicable government regulations. The Company funds at least the minimum amount required for all funded plans using actuarial cost methods and assumptions acceptable under government regulations.
The annual income and expense amounts relating to the pension plan are based on calculations which include various actuarial assumptions including mortality expectations, discount rates and expected long-term rates of return. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis as of December 31 (or more frequently if a significant event requiring remeasurement occurs) and modifies the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is appropriate to do so. The effects of modifications are recognized immediately on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, but are amortized into operating earnings over future periods, with the deferred amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The Company believes that the assumptions utilized in recording its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on its experience, market conditions and input from its actuaries and investment advisors. The weighted-average discount rate for pension benefits at December 31, 2020 was 2.6%.
In September 2019, the Company communicated to certain pension plan participants the option to receive a lump-sum pension payment. Payments to certain participants who elected to receive a lump-sum pension payment were funded from existing pension plan assets and constituted a complete settlement of pension liabilities with respect to these participants. As a result, pension assets and plan liabilities were remeasured during the fourth quarter of 2019, resulting in an actuarial loss of $6.4 million recorded within accumulated other comprehensive loss and a $3.9 million non-cash pension settlement charge recorded within investment and other income, net during the fourth quarter of 2019.
A one-percentage point change in the discount rates at December 31, 2020 would have the following effects on the accumulated benefit obligation and projected benefit obligation:
The Company’s defined benefit plan has a risk management approach for its pension plan assets. The overall investment objective of this approach is to further reduce the risk of significant decreases in the plan’s funded status by allocating a larger portion of the plan’s assets to investments expected to hedge the impact of interest rate risks on the plan’s obligation.
The expected long-term rate of return for the plan assets is based upon many factors including expected asset allocations, historical asset returns, current and expected future market conditions and risk. In addition, the Company considered the impact of the current interest rate environment on the expected long-term rate of return for certain asset classes, particularly fixed income. The target asset allocation percentage for the pension plan was approximately 55.0% for return seeking investments and approximately 45.0% for fixed income investments. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption used to calculate net pension plan income in 2020 was 6.0% for the Company’s pension plans. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption that will be used to calculate net pension plan income in 2021 is 6.0%.
A 0.25% change in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets at December 31, 2020 would have the following effects on 2020 and 2021 pension plan (income)/expense:
Accounting for Income Taxes
In the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, income tax expense and deferred tax balances have been calculated on a separate income tax return basis.
Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, the Company’s tax returns are subject to audit by various U.S. and foreign tax authorities. The Company recognizes a tax position in its financial statements when it is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. This recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Although management believes that its estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of uncertain tax positions may be materially different from that which is reflected in the Company’s historical financial statements.
The Company has recorded deferred tax assets related to future deductible items, including domestic and foreign tax loss and credit carryforwards. The Company evaluates these deferred tax assets by tax jurisdiction. The utilization of these tax assets is limited by the amount of taxable income expected to be generated within the allowable carryforward period and other factors. Accordingly, management has provided a valuation allowance to reduce certain of these deferred tax assets when management has concluded that, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be fully realized. If actual results differ from these estimates, or the estimates are adjusted in future periods, adjustments to the valuation allowance might need to be recorded. As of December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, valuation allowances of $7.5 million and $5.2 million, respectively, were recorded in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Refer to Note 9, Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail on the accounting for income taxes.
Commitments and Contingencies
The Company is subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims and can be involved in various legal, regulatory and arbitration proceedings concerning matters arising in the ordinary course of business, including those noted in Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company routinely reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses potential financial exposure. A liability is recorded when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When there is a range of possible losses with equal likelihood, a liability is recorded based on the low end of such range. Because of uncertainties related to these and other matters, accruals are based on the best information available at the time. The amount of such reserves may change in the future due to new developments or changes in approach, such as a change in settlement strategy. The inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of these matters can result in amounts materially different from the amounts accrued in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
Accounts Receivable
Receivables are stated net of expected losses and primarily include trade receivables. On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted an Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), see Note 1, Overview, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The Company’s credit loss reserves primarily relate to trade receivables, unbilled receivables and contract assets. The Company established provision at differing rates, which are region or country-specific, and are based upon the age of the trade receivable, the Company’s historical collection experience in each region or country and lines of business, where appropriate. Provisions for unbilled receivables and contract assets are established based on rates which management believes to be appropriate considering its historical experience. Specific customer provisions are made when a review of significant outstanding amounts, utilizing information about customer creditworthiness and current economic trends, indicates that collection is doubtful. The provision for expected losses associated with accounts receivable was $10.5 million at December 31, 2020 whereas allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was $7.7 million at December 31, 2019. The Company also maintains a reserve for potential credit memos and disputed items. The credit memo and disputed items reserve is based on historical credit memos relative to billings as well as specific customer reserves and was $4.4 million at December 31, 2020 and $4.8 million at December 31, 2019. The Company’s estimates of the expected losses associated with accounts receivable could change, and additional changes to the allowance for expected losses could be necessary in the future, if any major customer’s creditworthiness deteriorates or actual defaults are higher than the Company’s historical experience.
