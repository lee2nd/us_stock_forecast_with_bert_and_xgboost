Overview
All dollar amounts, except per customer and per share data, included in the following discussion, are presented in thousands.
Our Business
We principally provide broadband communications and video services in the United States and market our services primarily under two brands: Optimum, in the New York metropolitan area, and Suddenlink, principally in markets in the south-central United States. We deliver broadband, video, telephony, and mobile services to more than five million residential and business customers. Our footprint extends across 21 states through a fiber-rich hybrid-fiber coaxial ("HFC") broadband network and a fiber-to-the-home ("FTTH") network with more than nine million homes passed as of December 31, 2020. Additionally, we offer news programming and content, and advertising services. The Company launched Altice Mobile, our full service mobile offering, to consumers across our footprint in September 2019.
Key Factors Impacting Operating Results and Financial Condition
Our future performance is dependent, to a large extent, on the impact of direct competition, general economic conditions (including capital and credit market conditions), our ability to manage our businesses effectively, and our relative strength and leverage in the marketplace, both with suppliers and customers. For more information, see "Risk Factors" and "Business-Competition" included herein.
In March 2020, the United States declared a national emergency concerning the outbreak of the coronavirus ("COVID-19"). There have also been extraordinary and wide-ranging actions taken by federal, state and local governmental authorities to contain and combat the outbreak and spread of the virus. We have continued to provide our telecommunications services to our customers during this pandemic. We expect that our future results may be impacted, including if residential or business customers discontinue their service or are unable to pay for our products and services, or if advertising revenue declines. Additionally, in order to prioritize the demands of the business, we may continue to delay certain capital investments. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the magnitude and duration of business and economic impacts relating to COVID-19, including the effort to contain and combat the spread of the virus, and business impacts of government actions, we currently cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate impact of
COVID-19 on our business. See "Risk Factors - Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by the recent COVID-19 pandemic."
We derive revenue principally through monthly charges to residential customers of our broadband, video, and telephony services. We also derive revenue from DVR, VOD, pay-per-view, installation and home shopping commissions. Our residential broadband, video, and telephony services accounted for approximately 37%, 37%, and 5%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. We also derive revenue from the sale of a wide and growing variety of products and services to both large enterprise and SMB customers, including broadband, telephony, networking and video services. For the year ended December 31, 2020, 15% of our consolidated revenue was derived from these business services. In addition, we derive revenues from the sale of advertising time available on the programming carried on our cable television systems, digital advertising and data analytics, and affiliation fees for news programming, which accounted for approximately 5% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our mobile and other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 accounted for less than 1% of our consolidated revenue.
Revenue is impacted by rate increases, changes in the number of customers to our services, including additional services sold to our existing customers, programming package changes by our video customers, speed tier changes by our broadband customers, and acquisitions and construction of cable systems that result in the addition of new customers.
Our ability to increase the number of customers to our services is significantly related to our penetration rates.
We operate in a highly competitive consumer-driven industry and we compete against a variety of broadband, video and telephony providers and delivery systems, including broadband communications companies, wireless data and telephony providers, satellite-delivered video signals, Internet-delivered video content and broadcast television signals available to residential and business customers in our service areas. Our competitors include AT&T and its DirecTV subsidiary, CenturyLink, DISH, Frontier and Verizon. Consumers' selection of an alternate source of service, whether due to economic constraints, technological advances or preference, negatively impacts the demand for our services. For more information on our competitive landscape, see "Risk Factors" and "Business-Competition" included herein.
Our programming costs, which are the most significant component of our operating expenses, have increased and are expected to continue to increase primarily as a result of contractual rate increases. See "Results of Operations" below for more information regarding our key factors impacting our revenues and operating expenses.
Historically, we have made substantial investments in our network and the development of new and innovative products and other service offerings for our customers as a way of differentiating ourselves from our competitors and we may continue to do so in the future. Our FTTH network build, which would enable us to deliver more than 10 Gbps broadband speeds to meet the growing data needs of residential and business customers, is underway. In addition, we launched Altice Mobile to consumers across our footprint in September 2019. We may incur greater than anticipated capital expenditures in connection with these initiatives, fail to realize anticipated benefits, experience delays and business disruptions or encounter other challenges to executing them as planned. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources-Capital Expenditures" for additional information regarding our capital expenditures.
Certain Transactions
The following transactions occurred during the periods covered by this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations:
In December 2020, the Company completed the sale of a 49.99% interest in its Lightpath fiber enterprise business (the "Lightpath Transaction") based on an implied enterprise value of $3.2 billion. The Company retained a 50.01% interest in the Lightpath business and maintained control of Cablevision Lightpath LLC, the entity holding the interest in the Lightpath business. Accordingly, the Company continues to consolidate the operating results of the Lightpath business.
On July 14, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of certain cable assets in New Jersey and the operating results of the acquired business were consolidated as of the acquisition date.
In June 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of Cheddar Inc., a digital-first news company and the operating results of Cheddar were consolidated as of June 1, 2019.
As discussed in Note 1 of the Company's consolidated financial statements, the Company completed the ATS Acquisition in January 2018. ATS was previously owned by Altice Europe and a member of ATS's former management through a holding company. As the acquisition is a combination of businesses under common control, the Company combined the results of operations and related assets and liabilities of ATS for all periods since the formation of ATS.
In April 2018, Altice Europe transferred its ownership of i24NEWS, a 24/7 international news and current affairs channels, to the Company for minimal consideration. As the acquisition was a combination of businesses under common control, the Company combined the results of operations and related assets and liabilities of i24NEWS as of April 1, 2018. Operating results for periods prior to April 1, 2018 have not been revised to reflect the combination of i24NEWS as the impact was deemed immaterial.
In April 2018, the Company redeemed a 24% interest in Newsday.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We define Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as net income (loss) excluding income taxes, non-operating income or expenses, loss on extinguishment of debt and write-off of deferred financing costs, gain (loss) on interest rate swap contracts, gain (loss) on derivative contracts, gain (loss) on investments and sale of affiliate interests, interest expense, interest income, depreciation and amortization (including impairments), share-based compensation expense or benefit, restructuring expense or credits, and transaction expenses.
We believe Adjusted EBITDA is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the Company. Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures with similar titles are common performance measures used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in our industry. Internally, we use revenue and Adjusted EBITDA measures as important indicators of our business performance and evaluate management’s effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides management and investors a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business and operating results by excluding items that are not comparable across reporting periods or that do not otherwise relate to the Company’s ongoing operating results. Adjusted EBITDA should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), and other measures of performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Since Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with similar titles used by other companies.
We also use Operating Free Cash Flow (defined as Adjusted EBITDA less cash capital expenditures), and Free Cash Flow (defined as net cash flows from operating activities less cash capital expenditures) as indicators of the Company’s financial performance. We believe these measures are two of several benchmarks used by investors, analysts and peers for comparison of performance in the Company’s industry, although they may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.
Results of Operations - Altice USA
The following is a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA and Operating Free Cash Flow:
The following is a reconciliation of net cash flow from operating activities to Free Cash Flow:
The following table sets forth certain customer metrics for the Company (unaudited):
(a)Represents the estimated number of single residence homes, apartments and condominium units passed by the broadband network in areas serviceable without further extending the transmission lines. In addition, it includes commercial establishments that have connected to our broadband network. Broadband services were not available to approximately 30 thousand homes passed and telephony services were not available to approximately 500 thousand homes passed.
(b)Represents number of households/businesses that receive at least one of the Company's fixed-line services.
(c)Customers represent each customer account (set up and segregated by customer name and address), weighted equally and counted as one customer, regardless of size, revenue generated, or number of boxes, units, or outlets. Free accounts
are included in the customer counts along with all active accounts, but they are limited to a prescribed group. Most of these accounts are also not entirely free, as they typically generate revenue through pay-per-view or other pay services and certain equipment fees. Free status is not granted to regular customers as a promotion. In counting bulk residential customers, such as an apartment building, we count each subscribing family unit within the building as one customer, but do not count the master account for the entire building as a customer. We count a bulk commercial customer, such as a hotel, as one customer, and do not count individual room units at that hotel.
(d)Represents the number of total customer relationships divided by homes passed.
(e)Calculated by dividing the average monthly revenue for the respective quarter (fourth quarter for annual periods) derived from the sale of broadband, video and telephony services to residential customers for the quarter by the average number of total residential customers for the same period.
(f)Customer metrics do not include Altice Mobile customers.
(g)Pursuant to the Keep Americans Connected pledge ("Pledge") that the Company made in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and pursuant to the New Jersey Executive Order No. 126 ("NJ Order") enacted in April 2020, the Company did not disconnect certain internet and voice services to customers for non-payment. Customer metrics include the retention of certain of these previously non-paying customers who had current account balances as of December 31, 2020 due to the Company forgiving their past due balances or placing them on a payment plan. Customer metrics as of December 31, 2020 also include approximately 10 thousand customer relationships impacted by storms in Louisiana that have not been disconnected for non-payment (see table below).
(h) ARPU for the December 31, 2020 period reflects a reduction of $1.26 due to credits that we currently anticipate will be issued to video customers as a result of credits the Company expects to receive from certain sports programming networks whereby the minimum number of events were not delivered pursuant to the contractual agreements with the networks and related franchise fees.
Comparison of Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2020 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019 and for the Year Ended December 31, 2019 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018
Broadband Revenue
Broadband revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $3,689,159, $3,222,605, and $2,887,455, respectively. Broadband revenue is derived principally through monthly charges to residential subscribers of our broadband services. Revenue is impacted by rate increases, changes in the number of customers, including additional services sold to our existing subscribers, and changes in speed tiers. Additionally, revenue is impacted by changes in the standalone selling price of each performance obligation within our promotional bundled offers.
Broadband revenue increased $466,554 (14%) for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was due primarily to higher average recurring broadband revenue per broadband customer, primarily driven by certain rate increases and service level changes, and an increase in broadband customers, partially offset by customer credits issued for service outages following certain storms.
Broadband revenue increased $335,150 (12%) for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was due primarily to higher average recurring broadband revenue per broadband customer, primarily driven by certain rate increases and service level changes, and an increase in broadband customers.
Video Revenue
Video revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $3,670,859, $3,997,873 and $4,156,428, respectively. Video revenue is derived principally through monthly charges to residential customers of our video services. Revenue is impacted by rate increases, changes in the number of customers, including additional services sold to our existing customers, and changes in programming packages. Additionally, revenue is impacted by changes in the standalone selling price of each performance obligation within our promotional bundled offers.
Video revenue decreased $327,014 (8%) for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Video revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes estimated credits of approximately $94,300 that we currently anticipate will be issued to customers as a result of $90,100 of credits the Company expects to receive from certain sports programming networks whereby the minimum number of events were not delivered pursuant to the contractual agreements with the networks and related franchise fees. These credits did not impact Adjusted EBITDA for the periods. The remaining decrease was due primarily to a decline in video customers, as well as customer credits issued for service outages following certain storms.
Video revenue decreased $158,555 (4%) for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was due primarily to a decline in video customers and lower average revenue per video customer.
Telephony Revenue
Telephony revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $468,777, $598,694 and $652,895, respectively. Telephony revenue is derived principally through monthly charges to residential customers for our telephony services. Revenue is impacted by changes in rates for services, changes in the number of customers, and additional services sold to our existing customers. Additionally, revenue is impacted by changes in the standalone selling price of each performance obligation within our promotional bundled offers.
Telephony revenue decreased $129,917 (22%) for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was due to lower average revenue per telephony customer and a decline in telephony customers, as well as customer credits issued for service outages following certain storms.
Telephony revenue decreased $54,201 (8%) for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was due to lower average revenue per telephony customer and a decline in telephony customers.
Business Services and Wholesale Revenue
Business services and wholesale revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $1,454,532, $1,428,532, and $1,362,758, respectively. Business services and wholesale revenue is derived primarily from the sale of fiber based telecommunications services to the business market, and the sale of broadband, video and telephony services to SMB customers.
Business services and wholesale revenue increased $26,000 (2%) for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to higher average recurring broadband revenue per SMB customer, primarily driven by certain rate increases and service level changes and an increase in revenue related to an indefeasible right of use contract recorded in the second quarter of 2020, partially offset by a decrease in SMB customers, customer credits issued for service outages following certain storms and customer credits of approximately $2,900 that we currently anticipate will be issued to SMB customers as a result of credits the Company expects to receive from certain sports programming networks whereby the minimum number of events were not delivered pursuant to the contractual agreements with the networks and related franchise fees. These credits did not impact Adjusted EBITDA for the periods.
Business services and wholesale revenue increased $65,774 (5%) for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to higher average recurring broadband revenue per SMB customer, primarily driven by certain rate increases and service level changes, an increase in revenue from the backhaul of carrier data and an increase in installation revenue.
News and Advertising Revenue
News and advertising revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, was $519,205, $475,904, and $487,264, respectively. News and advertising revenue is primarily derived from the sale of (i) advertising inventory available on the programming carried on our cable television systems, (ii) advertising on over the top ("OTT") platforms, (iii) digital advertising, and (iv) data analytics. News and advertising revenue also includes affiliation fees for news programming.
News and advertising revenue increased $43,301 (9%) for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to higher political revenue and affiliate fees.
News and advertising revenue decreased $11,360 (2%) for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower political revenue, partially offset by an increase in digital advertising, and strong national sales.
Mobile Revenue
Mobile revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $78,127 and $21,264, respectively, and relates to sales of devices and mobile services that were launched to consumers in September 2019. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 169 thousand mobile lines.
Other Revenue
Other revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $13,983, $15,987, and $19,808, respectively. Other revenue includes revenue from other miscellaneous revenue streams.
Programming and Other Direct Costs
Programming and other direct costs for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 amounted to $3,340,442, $3,300,528 and $3,173,076, respectively. Programming and other direct costs include cable programming costs, which are costs paid to programmers (net of amortization of any incentives received from programmers for carriage) for cable content (including costs of VOD and pay-per-view) and are generally paid on a per-customer basis. These costs typically rise due to increases in contractual rates and new channel launches and are also impacted by changes in the number of customers receiving certain programming services. These costs also include interconnection, call completion, circuit and transport fees paid to other telecommunication companies for the transport and termination of voice and data services, which typically vary based on rate changes and the level of usage by our customers. These costs also include franchise fees which are payable to the state governments and local municipalities where we operate and are primarily based on a percentage of certain categories of revenue derived from the provision of video service over our cable systems, which vary by state and municipality. These costs change in relation to changes in such categories of revenues or rate changes. Additionally, these costs include the costs of mobile devices sold to our customers and direct costs of providing mobile services.
The increase of $39,914 (1%) for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to the following:
The increase of $127,452 (4%) for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to the following:
Programming costs
Programming costs aggregated $2,701,145, $2,722,656, and $2,620,585 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Programming costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 include estimated credits of approximately $93,000 that the Company expects to receive from certain sports programming networks whereby the minimum number of events were not delivered pursuant to the contractual agreements with the networks. These credits did not impact Adjusted EBITDA for the periods as we reduced video revenue for a corresponding amount as it is currently anticipated that these credits will be issued to customers. Our programming costs in 2021 will continue to be impacted by changes in programming rates, which we expect to increase, and by changes in the number of video customers.
Other Operating Expenses
Other operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 amounted to $2,264,473, $2,300,398, and $2,290,266, respectively. Other operating expenses include staff costs and employee benefits including salaries of company employees and related taxes, benefits and other employee related expenses, as well as third-party labor costs. Other operating expenses also include network management and field service costs, which represent costs associated with the maintenance of our broadband network, including costs of certain customer connections and other costs associated with providing and maintaining services to our customers.
Customer installation and network repair and maintenance costs may fluctuate as a result of changes in the level of activities and the utilization of contractors as compared to employees. Also, customer installation costs fluctuate as the portion of our expenses that we are able to capitalize changes. Costs associated with the initial deployment of new customer premise equipment necessary to provide broadband, video and telephony services are capitalized (asset-based). The redeployment of customer premise equipment is expensed as incurred.
Other operating expenses also include costs related to the operation and maintenance of our call center facilities that handle customer inquiries and billing and collection activities and sales and marketing costs, which include advertising production and placement costs associated with acquiring and retaining customers. These costs vary period to period and certain of these costs, such as sales and marketing, may increase with intense competition. Additionally, other operating expenses include various other administrative costs, including legal fees, and product development costs.
The decrease in other operating expenses of $35,925, net of an increase of $35,318 relating to our mobile service, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the prior year was attributable to the following:
The increase in other operating expenses of $10,132, including an increase of $32,458 relating to our mobile service, for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the prior year was attributable to the following:
Restructuring and Other Expense
Restructuring and other expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 amounted to $91,073, as compared to $72,978 for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $38,548 for the year ended December 31, 2018. These amounts primarily related to severance and other employee related costs resulting from headcount reductions, facility realignment costs and impairments of certain ROU assets, related to initiatives which commenced in 2016 and 2019 that are intended to simplify the Company's organizational structure. The expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 also included $47,631 related to contractual payments for terminated employees and $4,068 related to the facility realignment costs. We may incur additional restructuring expenses in the future as we continue to analyze our organizational structure.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 amounted to $2,083,365, $2,263,144 and $2,382,339, respectively.
The decrease in depreciation and amortization of $179,779 (8%) for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the prior year is due to certain fixed assets and intangible assets becoming fully depreciated or amortized, partially offset by the acceleration of amortization expense related to certain customer relationship intangible assets and an increase in depreciation as a result of asset additions.
The decrease in depreciation and amortization of $119,195 (5%) for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the prior year is due to certain fixed assets and intangible assets becoming fully depreciated or amortized, partially offset by an increase in depreciation as a result of asset additions.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA amounted to $4,414,814, $4,265,471, and $4,163,078 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that is defined as net income (loss) excluding income taxes, non-operating income or expenses, loss on extinguishment of debt and write-off of deferred financing costs, gain (loss) on interest rate swap contracts, gain (loss) on derivative contracts, gain (loss) on investments and sale of affiliate interests, interest expense, interest income, depreciation and amortization (including impairments), share-based compensation expense or benefit, restructuring expense or credits and transaction expenses. See reconciliation of net income (loss) to adjusted EBITDA above.
The increases in adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the prior year was due to the increases in revenue and a decrease in operating expenses for 2020 (excluding depreciation and amortization, restructuring and other expense and share-based compensation), as discussed above.
The increases in adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the prior year was due to the increases in revenue, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization, restructuring and other expense and share-based compensation), as discussed above.
Operating Free Cash Flow
Operating free cash flow was $3,340,859, $2,910,121 and $3,009,489 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in operating free cash flow for 2020 as compared to 2019 is due to a decrease in cash capital expenditures and an increase in adjusted EBITDA. The decrease in operating free cash flow in 2019 as compared to 2018 was due to an increase in cash capital expenditures, partially offset by an increase in adjusted EBITDA.
Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow was $1,906,209, $1,198,819 and $1,354,728 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in free cash flow in 2020 as compared to 2019 is primarily due to an increase in cash from operating activities and a decrease in cash capital expenditures. The decrease in free cash flow in 2019 as compared to 2018 is primarily due to an increase in cash capital expenditures.
Interest expense
Interest expense, net was $1,350,341, $1,530,850, and $1,545,426 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease of $180,509 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 and the decrease of $14,576 for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year
ended December 31, 2018 were attributable to the following:
Gain (Loss) on Investments and Sale of Affiliate Interests, net
Gain (loss) on investments, net for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, of $320,061, $473,406 and $(250,877) consists primarily of the increase (decrease) in the fair value of the Comcast common stock owned by the Company. The effects of these gains (losses) are partially offset by the losses and gains on the related equity derivative contracts, net described below.
Gain (Loss) on Derivative Contracts, net
Gain (loss) on derivative contracts, net amounted to $(178,264), $(282,713) and $218,848 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and includes realized and unrealized gains or losses due to the change in fair value of equity derivative contracts relating to the Comcast common stock owned by the Company. The effects of these gains (losses) are offset by losses (gains) on investment securities pledged as collateral, which are included in gain (loss) on investments and sale of affiliate interest, net discussed above.
Loss on Interest Rate Swap Contracts

The 2018 amounts also include the equity in the net losses of Newsday through April 2018 and i24NEWS through March 31, 2018.
Income Tax Benefit (Expense)
The Company recorded income tax expense of $139,748 for the year ended December 31, 2020, resulting in an effective tax rate of 24% which is higher than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%. The primary difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate is due to nondeductible officer’s and share-based compensation expense, state income taxes, net of the federal benefit, a revaluation of state deferred taxes primarily due to certain changes to the state tax rates used to measure the Company’s deferred tax liabilities, a tax benefit associated with claiming additional current year and prior year research and development tax credits, and certain other non-deductible expenses. Due to the taxable gain resulting from the Lightpath Transaction discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognized the benefit of fully utilizing its federal NOLs, capital loss carryover, research and development tax credits, and general business credits in 2020.
The Company recorded income tax expense of $47,190 for the year ended December 31, 2019, resulting in an effective tax rate of 25% which was higher than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%. The primary difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate was due to nondeductible share-based compensation expense, a revaluation of state deferred taxes primarily due to certain changes to the state tax rates used to measure the Company’s deferred tax liabilities and certain other non-deductible expenses.
The Company recorded income tax benefit of $38,655 for the year ended December 31, 2018. During 2018, the Company determined that it met the definition of a Qualified Technology Company for New York State tax purposes and thereby was eligible for the reduced tax rate. Additionally, during 2018, the state of New Jersey enacted significant tax law changes imposing a 2.5% surtax for tax years beginning January 1, 2018 and mandating combined return filing requirements for unitary corporations for tax years beginning January 1, 2019. Accordingly, the Company recorded a net deferred tax benefit of $52,915 based on a remeasurement of the net deferred tax liability.
CSC HOLDINGS, LLC
The consolidated statements of operations of CSC Holdings are essentially identical to the consolidated statements of operations of Altice USA, except for the following:
Refer to Altice USA's Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations herein.
The following is a reconciliation of CSC Holdings' net income to Adjusted EBITDA and Operating Free Cash Flow:
The following is a reconciliation of net cash flow from operating activities to Free Cash Flow:
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Altice USA has no operations independent of its subsidiaries. Funding for our subsidiaries has generally been provided by cash flow from their respective operations, cash on hand and borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the proceeds from the issuance of securities and borrowings under syndicated term loans in the capital markets. Our decision as to the use of cash generated from operating activities, cash on hand, borrowings under the revolving credit facility or accessing the capital markets has been based upon an ongoing review of the funding needs of the business, the optimal allocation of cash resources, the timing of cash flow generation and the cost of borrowing under the revolving credit facility, debt securities and syndicated term loans. We target a year-end leverage ratio of 4.5x to 5.0x for our CSC Holdings debt silo. We calculate our consolidated net leverage ratio as net debt to L2QA EBITDA (Adjusted EBITDA for the two most recent consecutive fiscal quarters multiplied by 2.0).
We expect to utilize free cash flow and availability under the CSC Holdings revolving credit facility, as well as future refinancing transactions, to further extend the maturities of, or reduce the principal on, our debt obligations. The timing and terms of any refinancing transactions will be subject to, among other factors, market conditions. Additionally, we may, from time to time, depending on market conditions and other factors, use cash on hand and the proceeds from other borrowings to repay the outstanding debt securities through open market purchases, privately negotiated purchases, tender offers, or redemptions.
We believe existing cash balances, operating cash flows and availability under the CSC Holdings revolving credit facility will provide adequate funds to support our current operating plan, make planned capital expenditures and fulfill our debt service requirements for the next twelve months. However, our ability to fund our operations, make planned capital expenditures, make scheduled payments on our indebtedness and repay our indebtedness depends on our future operating performance and cash flows and our ability to access the capital markets, which, in turn, are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. Competition, market disruptions or a deterioration in economic conditions could lead to lower demand for our products, as well as lower levels of advertising, and increased incidence of customers' inability to pay for the
services we provide. These events would adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Although we currently believe amounts available under the CSC Holdings revolving credit facility will be available when, and if, needed, we can provide no assurance that access to such funds will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets or other conditions. The obligations of the financial institutions under the revolving credit facility are several and not joint and, as a result, a funding default by one or more institutions does not need to be made up by the others.
In the longer term, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash from operations to fund anticipated capital expenditures, meet all existing future contractual payment obligations and repay our debt at maturity. As a result, we could be dependent upon our continued access to the capital and credit markets to issue additional debt or equity or refinance existing debt obligations. We intend to raise significant amounts of funding over the next several years to fund capital expenditures, repay existing obligations and meet other obligations, and the failure to do so successfully could adversely affect our business. If we are unable to do so, we will need to take other actions including deferring capital expenditures, selling assets, seeking strategic investments from third parties or reducing or eliminating stock repurchases and discretionary uses of cash.
Lightpath Transaction
In December 2020, the Company completed the sale of a 49.99% interest in its Lightpath fiber enterprise business (the "Lightpath Transaction") based on an implied enterprise value of $3,200,000. The Company received total gross cash proceeds of approximately $2,355,000 ($890,000 from the sale and $1,465,000 from the related financing activity, excluding the discount on the term loan of $3,000). The excess of the cash received from the sale, net of related expenses, over the book value of the interest sold of $741,471, net of taxes of $228,489, was recorded in stockholders' equity (deficiency) by Altice USA. The Company retained a 50.01% interest in the Lightpath business and maintained control of Cablevision Lightpath LLC, the entity holding the interest in the Lightpath business. Accordingly, the Company will continue to consolidate the operating results of the Lightpath business.
Cablevision Lightpath LLC was financed independently outside of the CSC Holdings restricted group. Cablevision Lightpath LLC issued $450,000 in aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes and $415,000 in aggregate principal amount of senior notes. Also, Cablevision Lightpath LLC entered into a credit agreement which provides a term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $600,000 and revolving loan commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $100,000. As of December 31, 2020, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Lightpath Revolving Credit Facility. Net proceeds from this transaction were used to fund the Tender Offer discussed below. See Note 11 and discussion below for additional information regarding the debt financing related to the Lightpath Transaction.

CSC Holdings Restricted Group
For financing purposes, the Company is structured as a restricted group (the "Restricted Group") and an unrestricted group, which includes certain designated subsidiaries and investments (the "Unrestricted Group"). The Restricted Group is comprised of CSC Holdings and substantially all of its wholly-owned operating subsidiaries. These subsidiaries are subject to the covenants and restrictions of the credit facility and indentures governing the notes issued by CSC Holdings. Cablevision Lightpath LLC became an unrestricted subsidiary prior to the issuance of its senior notes and senior secured notes in September 2020. See discussion below regarding the Lightpath debt financing.
Sources of cash for the Restricted Group include primarily cash flow from the operations of the businesses in the Restricted Group, borrowings under its credit facility and issuance of securities in the capital markets, contributions from its parent, and, from time to time, distributions or loans from its subsidiaries. The Restricted Group's principal uses of cash include: capital spending, in particular, the capital requirements associated with the upgrade of its digital broadband, video and telephony services, including costs to build our FTTH network; debt service; distributions made to its parent to fund share repurchases; other corporate expenses and changes in working capital; and investments that it may fund from time to time.
CSC Holdings Credit Facility
In October 2015, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Altice USA, which merged with and into CSC Holdings on June 21, 2016, entered into a senior secured credit facility, which currently provides U.S. dollar term loans currently in an aggregate principal amount of $3,000,000 ($2,895,000 outstanding at December 31, 2020) (the "CSC Term Loan Facility", and the term loans extended under the CSC Term Loan Facility, the "CSC Term Loans") and U.S. dollar revolving loan commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $2,475,000 ($625,000 outstanding at December 31, 2020) (the "CSC Revolving Credit Facility" and, together with the CSC Term Loan Facility, the "CSC Credit Facilities"), which are governed by a credit facilities agreement entered into by, inter alios, CSC Holdings certain lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent and security agent (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified on June 20, 2016, June 21, 2016, July 21, 2016, September 9, 2016, December 9, 2016, March 15, 2017, January 12, 2018, October 15, 2018, January 24, 2019, February 7, 2019, May 14, 2019, and October 3, 2019, respectively, and as further amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the "CSC Credit Facilities Agreement").

Managing our Interest Rate and Equity Price Risk
Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is primarily a result of exposures to changes in the level, slope and curvature of the yield curve, the volatility of interest rates and credit spreads. Our exposure to interest rate risk results from changes in short-term interest rates. Interest rate risk exists primarily with respect to our credit facility debt, which bears interest at variable rates.
To manage interest rate risk, we have from time to time entered into interest rate swap contracts to adjust the proportion of total debt that is subject to variable and fixed interest rates. Such contracts effectively fix the borrowing rates on floating rate debt to provide an economic hedge against the risk of rising rates and/or effectively convert fixed rate borrowings to variable rates to permit the Company to realize lower interest expense in a declining interest rate environment. We monitor the financial institutions that are counterparties to our interest rate swap contracts and we only enter into interest rate swap contracts with financial institutions that are rated investment grade. All such contracts are carried at their fair market values on our consolidated balance sheets, with changes in fair value reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.
