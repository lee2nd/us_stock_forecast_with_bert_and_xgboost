DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY
Core Molding Technologies
and its subsidiaries
operate in one
operating segment as
a molder of
thermoplastic and thermoset
structural products. The Company's operating segment consists
of two component reporting units, Core
Traditional and Horizon
Plastics. The Company offers customers a wide range of manufacturing processes to fit various
program volume and investment
requirements. These processes
include compression
molding of sheet
molding compound
("SMC"), bulk
molding compounds
("BMC"), resin
transfer molding
("RTM"), liquid
molding of
dicyclopentadiene ("DCPD"),
spray-up and
hand-lay-up, direct
long-fiber thermoplastics ("D
-LFT") and structural
foam and structural
web injection molding
("SIM"). Core Molding
Technologies serves
a wide
variety of
markets, including the
medium and
heavy-duty truck,
marine, automotive,
agriculture,
construction, and
other commercial
products. The demand
for Core
Molding Technologies
’
products is
affected by
economic
conditions in the United
States, Mexico, and
Canada. Core Molding Technologies
’
manufacturing operations have a
significant
fixed cost
component. Accordi
ngly, during
periods of
changing demand,
the profitability
of Core
Molding Technologies’
operations may change
proportionately more than
revenues from operations.
Core Molding Technologies serves
a wide variety
of markets, including
the medium
and heavy-duty
truck, marine,
automotive, agriculture,
construction, and
other commercial
products. Product sales to
medium and heavy-duty truck
markets accounted for 43%
of the Company's sales
for the year ended
December
31, 2020
and 58% and
56% for the
years ended
December
31, 2019
and 2018,
respectively. The demand
for Core
Molding Technologies’
products is affected
by economic conditions
in the United
States, Mexico, and
Canada. Core Molding
Technologies’
manufacturing operations
have a
significant fixed
cost component.
Accordingly, during
periods of
changing
demand, the
profitability of
Core Molding
Technologies’
operations may
change proportionately
more than
revenues from
operations.
In 1996, Core Molding Technologies acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Columbus Plastics,
a wholly owned
operating unit of
Navistar’s truck
manufacturing division since
its formation in
late 1980. Columbus
Plastics,
located in Columbus,
Ohio, was a
compounder and compression
molder of SMC.
In 1998, Core
Molding Technologies began
operations at its second facility in Gaffney, South Carolina, and in 2001, Core Molding Technologies added
a production facility
in Matamoros,
Mexico by
acquiring certain
assets of
Airshield Corporation.
As a
result of
this acquisition,
Core Molding
Technologies expanded its
fiberglass molding capabilities
to include the
spray up, hand
-lay-up open mold
processes and RTM
closed molding. In 2005, Core Molding Technologies acquired certain assets of the Cincinnati Fiberglass Division of Diversified
Glass, Inc.,
a Batavia,
Ohio-based, privately
held manufacturer
and distributor
of fiberglass
reinforced plastic
components
supplied primarily to the
heavy-duty truck market.
In 2009, the Company
completed construction of
a new production
facility
in Matamoros, Mexico
that replaced its
leased facility. In
March 2015, the
Company acquired substantially
all of the
assets of
CPI Binani, Inc., a
wholly owned subsidiary of
Binani Industries Limited, located in
Winona, Minnesota ("CPI"), which expanded
the Company's process capabilities to include D-LFT and diversified the customer base. In January 2018, the Company acquired
substantially all the assets of Horizon Plastics, which has manufacturing
operations in Cobourg, Ontario and Escobedo,
Mexico.
This acquisition expanded the Company's
customer base, geographic footprint, and process
capabilities to include structural foam
and structural web molding.
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
General
The Company’s
business and operating
results are directly
affected by changes
in overall customer
demand, operational
costs
and performance and leverage of our fixed cost and selling, general and
administrative ("SG&A") infrastructure.
Product sales fluctuate
in response to
several factors including
many that are
beyond the Company’s
control, such as
general
economic conditions, interest rates,
government regulations, consumer spending,
labor availability, and our
customers’
production
rates and inventory
levels. Product sales
consist of demand
from customers in
many different markets
with different levels
of
cyclicality and seasonality. The North American truck market, which is
highly cyclical, accounted for 43%, 58%, and 56% of the
Company’s product revenue for
the years ended December
31,
2020,
2019,
and 2018 respectively.
Operating performance is dependent on the Company’s
ability to manage changes in input costs for items such as raw materials,
labor, and overhead operating costs. Performance is also affected by manufacturing
efficiencies, including items such as on time
delivery, quality, scrap,
and productivity. Market
factors of supply
and demand can
impact operating costs.
In periods of
rapid
increases or decreases in customer demand, the Company is required
to ramp operations activity up or down quickly which may
impact manufacturing efficiencies more than in periods of steady demand.
Operating performance
is also
dependent on
the Company
’s ability
to effectively
launch new
customer programs,
which are
typically extremely complex
in nature. The
start of production
of a new
program is the
result of a
process of developing
new
molds and assembly equipment,
validation testing, manufacturing
process design, development
and testing, along with
training
and often hiring
employees. Meeting the targeted levels
of manufacturing efficiency for
new programs usually occurs over
time
as the Company gains
experience with new tools
and processes. Therefore,
during a new program
launch period, start
-up costs
and inefficiencies can affect operating results.
Results of 2020 Overview
Operating income increased
to $10,390,000 for
the year ended
December 31, 2020
compared to a
loss of $11,528,000
for the
same period a year ago on a product sales decrease of 22%. Lower demand from our customers as a
result of a cyclical downturn
in the truck market
and the negative effect
of COVID-19 on most
customer demand were the
primary drivers of the
sales decrease.
The increase
in operating
income was
largely due
to improved
manufacturing efficiencies
and cost
savings at
several of
the
Company's facilities. The Company also incurred lower SG&A costs and no goodwill impairment in 2020.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, product sales
to truck customers decreased by 38% compared to the
same period in 2019,
as a result of
a cyclical downturn in
the truck market and
demand deterioration related to
COVID-19. According to
ACT Research,
North American heavy-duty truck production decreased approximately 47% for the year
ended December 31, 2020 compared to
the same period in 2019.
For the year ended
December 31, 2020,
the Company recorded
net income of $8,165,000
or $0.98 per
basic and diluted
share,
compared with net loss of $15,223,000, or ($1.94) per basic
and diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2019. Net
income
in 2020 was favorably impacted by $5,279,000, or $0.67 per share, as a
result of a net tax valuation allowance reversal and a tax
rate benefit due
to tax law
changes that allow
the Company to
carryback net operating
losses to offset
taxable income in
through 2015, where
the Company paid
tax at 34%
compared to the
valuation of the
losses being recorded
at the 21%
current
U.S. statutory tax rate.
Looking forward, based on
industry analysts’
projections and customer
forecasts, the Company expects
sales levels for 2021
to
increase compared to
2020.
In the Company
’s largest market,
North American heavy-duty truck,
ACT Research is forecasting
production to
increase approximately 41%.
In several other
industries the Company
serves, customers
are forecasting
higher
demand in 2021 including in the marine and all-terrain vehicle
markets.
The Company
anticipates higher
raw material
costs in
2021 as
global economies
continue to
strengthen from
the COVID
effected 2020 economic
levels. Global demand
for certain raw
materials the Company
uses has increased
in the second
half of
2020 and in the first quarter of 2021.
As a result, suppliers have been increasing the price of
these materials.
The Company has
the ability to pass through a portion, but not all, of the cost increases
to its customers.
In February 2021, an unprecedented winter storm in Texas and Mexico caused operational disruptions to
many companies in the
area including the Company’s
Matamoros and Monterey Mexico
operations as well as to
our customers and suppliers.
Much of
North American resins
and glass supply
originate from the region
and these supplier operations
were significantly affected causing
suppliers to claim
force majeure and
set supply allocations.
While the Company
has been able
to coordinated its
raw material
supply with customer demand, other supplier disruptions throughout our customers
’
supply chain have resulted in our customers
delaying orders.
In addition,
suppliers of certain
materials, such as
polypropylene, have
increased prices
due to a
shortage of
supply.
Suppliers have indicated they anticipate supply levels to recover
during the second quarter of 2021.
2020 Compared to 2019
Net sales for
the years ended
December 31,
2020 and 2019
totaled $222,356,000
and $284,290,000, respectively.
Included in
total sales
were tooling
project sales
of $11,776,000
and $15,303,000
for the
years ended
December 31,
2020 and
2019,
respectively. These sales are sporadic
in nature and fluctuate in
regard to scope and
related revenue on a period
-to-period basis.
Product sales, excluding tooling project
sales, for the year ended December
31, 2020 were $210,580,000 compared
to
$268,987,000 for
the same period
in 2019. This
decrease in sales
is primarily the
result of lower
cyclical demand
from truck
customers as well
as lower demand
from most all
customers as a
result of COVID
-19, offset by
the increase in
demand from
customers in building products industry.
Gross margin was approximately 15.5% of sales for the year
ended December 31, 2020, compared with 7.6% for the year
ended
December 31, 2019. The
gross margin increase, as
a percent of sales,
was due to
favorable product mix and
production efficiencies
of 8.4% and changes in selling price and material costs of 1.0%,
offset by lower leverage of fixed costs of 1.5%.
Selling, general
and administrative
expense (“SG&A”)
totaled $24,08
4,000 in
2020, compared
to $28,934,000
in 2019.
The
decrease in SG&A expense primarily resulted from lower professional and outside
services of $2,023,000, government subsides
received in 2020 enacted as a result of COVID-19 of $1,416,000,
and lower travel costs of $783,000.
The Company incurred a
goodwill impairment of $4,100,000
associated with its Horizon Plastics
reporting unit during the year
ended December 31, 2019. In
2019, the Company incurred lower
profit margins in its Horizon
Plastics reporting unit caused by
selling price decreases that the Company had not been able to
fully offset with material cost reductions.
Interest expense totaled
$5,923,000 for the
year ended December 31,
2020, compared to
interest expense of $4,144,000
for the
year ended December 31, 2019.
The increase in interest expense was primarily due to
a loss on termination of interest rate swaps
of $1,253,000
and a one-time
expense related to
the deferred
loan costs for
the debt refinancing
of $583,000,
offset by lower
average outstanding debt in 2020.
Income tax
benefit was
approximately 80%
of total
income before
income taxes
in 2020
and 2%
of total
loss in
2019. The
Company’s effective
tax rate reflects
the effects of
taxable income and
taxable losses being
generated in tax
jurisdictions with
different tax rates, and in 2020
a net valuation allowance change of
$2,074,000 and a rate benefit of
$3,205,000 based on losses
being carried back to
years where the Company paid
tax at 34% compared
to the valuation of the
losses being recorded at
21%
current U.S. statutory tax rate.
The Company
recorded net
income for
2020 of
$8,165,000 or
$0.98 per
basic and
diluted share,
compared with
net loss
of
$15,223,000 or $(1.94) per basic and diluted share for 2019.
Comprehensive income totaled $8,170,000 in 2020, compared to a
comprehensive loss of $15,970,000 in 2019. The
increase was
primarily related to
higher net income
of $23,388,000
and a change
in net actuarial
adjustments of $1,982,000
for other post-
retirement benefit obligations.
Compared to 2018
Net sales for 2019 totaled $284,290,000, which was an increase from the $269,485,000 reported for 2018. Included in total sales
were tooling project sales
of $15,303,000 for 2019
and $13,268,000 for 2018.
Tooling project sales result
primarily from customer
approval and acceptance
of molds and
assembly equipment specific
to their products
as well as other
non-production services.
These sales are sporadic in nature and fluctuate in regard
to scope and related revenue on a period
-to-period basis. Total product
sales for 2019, excluding tooling project sales, totaled $268,987,000, representing a 5% increase from the
$256,217,000 reported
for 2018. The increase in product
sales is primarily the result of increased
sales to our truck and marine
customers of $11,707,000
and $3,144,000, respectively.
Gross margin was approximately 7.6% of sales in 2019 and 10.1% in 2018. The gross margin
decrease, as a percent of sales, was
due to unfavorable
product mix and
production inefficiencies of
3.8%.
These reductions were
offset by net
changes in selling
price and material costs of 1.3%.
Selling, general
and administrative
expense (“SG&A”)
totaled $28,934,000
in 2019,
compared to
$27,838,000 in
2018. The
increase in SG&A expense
primarily resulted from
higher labor and
benefit costs of
$1,144,000 and
higher insurance costs
of
$327,000 offset by lower professional and outside services of $1,017,000.
For the year ended December
31, 2018, the Company
incurred one-time acquisition fees of $1,289,000.
Goodwill impairment totaled
$4,100,000 and
$2,403,000 in 2019
and 2018, respectively,
based on the
Company's annual and
interim goodwill impairment
assessment for its
reporting units.
See
Note 2 -
Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies
, for
further details.
Net interest expense totaled
$4,144,000 for the year ended
December
31, 2019, compared to
net interest expense of $2,394,000
for the year ended December
31, 2018.
The increase in interest expense was primarily due
to a higher average outstanding debt
balance as well has higher interest rates in 2019.
Income tax benefit was approximately 2% of
total loss before income taxes in 2019
and 12% in 2018.
The effective income tax
rate in both
years is a
result of
the net effect
of taxable
losses in
lower statutory
rate tax jurisdictions
being offset
by taxable
income in higher statutory
rate tax jurisdictions.
Additionally, the effective rate
in 2019 includes the
impact of recording a
full
valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets in the United States
of approximately $3,267,000.
Net loss for 2019
was $15,223,000 or $(1.94)
per basic and diluted
share, compared with
net loss of $4,782,000
or $(0.62) per
basic and diluted share for 2018.
Comprehensive loss totaled
$15,970,000 in 2019,
compared to a
comprehensive loss of
$4,735,000 in 2018.
The decrease was
primarily related
to higher
net loss
of $10,441,000
and a
change in
net actuarial
adjustments of
$1,630,000 for
other post-
retirement benefit obligations offset by a change in hedging
derivatives of $836,000.
The net actuarial changes in 2018 and 2019
were primarily due to changes in discount rate.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL
RESOURCES
Cash Flow
The Company’s primary sources
of funds have been cash generated from operating
activities and borrowings from third parties.
Primary cash requirements are for operating expenses, capital expenditures, repayments of debt, and acquisitions.
The Company
from time
to time will
enter into
foreign exchange
contracts and
interest rate
swaps to
mitigate risk
of foreign
exchange and
interest rate
volatility. As of
December 31,
2020, the
Company had
no outstanding
foreign exchange
contracts, compared
to
notional amounts of
$15,358,000 outstanding
as of December
31, 2019. As of
December 31,
2020, the Company
also had no
outstanding interest rate swaps, compared to notional amount of $29,750,000
outstanding as of December 31, 2019.
Cash provided by
operating activities totaled
$28,164,000 for
the year ended
December 31,
2020.
Net income of
$8,165,000
positively impacted operating cash flows.
Non-cash deductions included in net
income from depreciation and
amortization and
share based compensation amounted to $11,662,000 and $1,355,000, respectively. A decrease in working capital resulted in cash
provided of
$5,648,000. The
decrease in
working capital
was primarily
related to
increase cash
from accounts
receivable,
inventory and other
accrued liabilities, offset
by decrease cash
from accounts payable
and prepaid
expenses and other
current
assets.
Cash used in
investing activities
totaled $3,683,000
for the year
ended December
31, 2020,
primarily related
to purchases
of
property, plant
and equipment
for new
programs and
equipment improvements
at the
Company’s production
facilities. The
Company anticipates spending approximately $19,500,000 during 2021 on property, plant and equipment purchases for all of the
Company's operations, including
approximately $8,500,000
to expand the
Company’s DLFT
capacity in Matamoros,
Mexico.
The Company
anticipates using
cash from
operations and
its revolving
line of
credit to
finance this
capital investment.
The
Company may also use equipment
financing for the DLFT
capacity expansion.
At December 31, 2020,
purchase commitments
for capital expenditures in progress were approximately $677,000.
Cash used in financing activities totaled $22,206,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Cash
activity primarily consisted of
net repayments
of revolving
loans of
$11,588,000, repayments
of principal
on outstanding
term loans
of $38,72
5,000, and
payment of deferred loan costs of $2,038,000, offset by borrowings under
new term loans of $30,165,000.
At December 31, 2020,
the Company had $4,131,000
of cash on hand and
an available revolving line
of credit of $19,223,000.
If a material adverse change in the financial
position of the Company should occur, or if actual
sales or expenses are substantially
different than what has
been forecasted, the Company's
liquidity and ability to
obtain further financing to
fund future operating
and capital requirements could be negatively impacted.
Management believes cash
on hand, cash
flow from operating
activities and available
borrowings under the
Company’s credit
agreement will be sufficient to meet the Company’s
current liquidity needs.

(the “FGI Term Loan”). On October 27, 2020,
FGI advanced to the Company $12,000,000
which proceeds were used to pay off the Company’s existing
outstanding indebtedness with KeyBank National Association, and
to pay certain fees
and expenses associated
with the transactions,
and $1,200,000 which
proceeds were used
to fund a
security
deposit to be held
by FGI. Interest on
the FGI Term Loan is
a fixed rate of
8.25% and is payable
monthly. The Company notes
that the security deposit of $1,200,000 is located in prepaid
expenses and other current assets on the balance sheet.
Following the advance
of funds by
FGI, the FGI
Term Loans are
to be repaid
in monthly principal
and interest installments
of
$117,000 for the
first 12 months,
$246,000 for the
subsequent 59 months
and $1,446,000 due
on October 31,
2026, subject to
certain optional and mandatory repayment
terms. The Company’s
obligations under the Master Security
Agreement are secured
by certain machinery and equipment of the guarantors located in Mexico, and real property of Core composites de Mexico, S. de
R.L. de C.V., also a subsidiary of the Company organized in Mexico,
located in Matamoros, Mexico.
The Company may
prepay in full
or in part
(but not less than
the amount equal
to 20% of
the original principal
amount of the
loan) outstanding amounts before they are due
on any scheduled Payment Date upon at
least thirty (30) days’
prior written notice.
The Company will
pay a “Prepayment
Fee” in an
amount equal to
an additional sum
equal to the
following percentage of
the
principal amount to be
prepaid for prepayments occurring
in the indicated period:
four percent (4.0%) (for
prepayments occurring
prior to
the first anniversary
of the Loan);
three percent (3.0%)
(for prepayments occurring
on and thereafter
and prior
to the
second anniversary
of the
Loan); two
percent (2.0%)
(for prepayments
occurring on
and thereafter
and prior
to the
third
anniversary of the Loan ); and one percent (1.0%) (for
prepayments occurring any time thereafter).
Leaf Capital Funding
On April 24, 2020
the Company entered
into a finance
agreement with Leaf
Capital Funding of
$175,000 for equipment.
The
parties agreed
to a
fixed interest
rate of
5.5% and
a term
of 60
months. The amount
outstanding at
December 31,
2020 was
$152,000 of which, $120,000 was classified as long-term debt.
Revolving Loans
Wells Fargo Revolving Loan
On October 27, 2020,
the Company entered into
a credit agreement (the
“Credit Agreement”) with Wells Fargo Bank,
National
Association, as adminis
trative agent, lead
arranger and book
runner, and the
lenders party thereto
(the “Lenders”). Pursuant
to
the terms of the
Credit Agreement, the
Lenders made available to
the Company a
revolving loan commitment (the
“WF Revolving
Loan”) of $25,000,000
($8,745,000 of which was
advanced to the
Company on October
28, 2020). The proceeds
from the WF
Revolving Loan were used to pay off the Company’s existing outstanding indebtedness with KeyBank National Association, and
to pay certain fees and expenses associated with the financing.
The Credit Agreement also makes available
to the Company an
incremental revolving commitment
in the maximum amount
of
$10,000,000 at the Company’s
option at any time during the three (3) year period following the closing.
The borrowing availability under the line of credit is the lesser of (a) the loan commitment of $25,000,000 or (b) the sum of 90%
of eligible investment grade accounts receivable,
85% of non-investment grade eligible accounts
receivable and 65% of eligible
inventory.
At the option of the Company,
the WF Revolving Loan bears
interest at a per annum
rate equal to LIBOR plus
a margin of 200
to 250 basis points
or base rate plus
a margin of 100 to
150 basis points, with
the margin rate being based
on the excess availability
amount under the line of credit.
LIBOR rate means the greater of (a) 0.75% per annum and (b) the per annum published LIBOR
rate for interest periods of one,
three or six months as chosen
by the Company.
Base rate is the greater of
(a) 1.0% per annum,
(b) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5%, (c) LIBOR Rate
plus 100 basis and (d) prime rate.
The weighted average interest rate was
4.75% as of December 31, 2020.
The WF Revolving Loan commitment
terminates, and all outstanding
borrowings thereunder must
be repaid, by November
30,
2024. The
Company has
available $19,223,000
of available
rate revolving
loans of
which
$420,000
is outstanding
as
of
December
31, 2020.
The WF Revolving Loan contains the same covenants as the WF Term Loans.
Wells Fargo Bank will issue up to $2,000,000 of Letters of Credit in accordance with
the terms of the Credit Agreement upon the
Company’s request. As of December 31, 2020, the Company
had one Letter of Credit outstanding for $160,000.
In conjunction with the October debt refinancing, the Company incurred
debt origination fees of $1,730,000 related to the Wells
Fargo financing,
which is
being amortized
over the
life of
the Credit
Agreement, which
expires on
November 30,
2024. In
addition, the Company
incurred debt origination
fees of $308,000
related to the FGI
Term loan, which is
being amortized over
the life of
the FGI Term
Loan, which expires
on October 31,
2026.
The aggregate unamortized
deferred financing fees
as of
December 31, 2020 totaled $1,957,000.
KeyBank Loan
On December 31, 2019, the
Company had a term
loan and revolving loan balance
of $38,250,000 and $12,008,000 with
KeyBank
National Association, respectively. The Company’s term loan and revolving loan had variable interest rates of 6.30% and 6.04%,
respectively at December
31, 2019. On
November 22, 2019
the Company entered
into a forbearance
agreement with KeyBank
and on
October 27,
2020 the
Company fully
repaid all
outstanding amounts.
As a
result of
the forbearance
agreement not
extending beyond a year, the Company’s remaining long-term debt balance was classified as a current liability in the Company’s
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019.
Interest Rate Swaps
The Company
entered into
two interest
rate swap
agreements that
became effective
January
18, 2018,
one of
which was
designated as a cash flow
hedge for $25,000,000 and the other
designated as a cash flow
hedge for $10,000,000 to the Company’s
subsidiary. Under these agreements, the
Company paid a fixed rate
of
2.49%
to the counterparty and
received a 30 day
LIBOR
for
both cash flow
hedges. Concurrent
with the closing
of the
KeyBank credit
agreement, the
Company settled
both outstanding
interest rate swaps, which
resulted in a loss
and cash outflow of
$1,253,000. These results were
categorized as interest expense
and operating activities in the Statement
of Operations and Statement of
Cash Flow, respectively. Due to the
settlement, the fair
value of the interest rate swaps was $0
at
December
31, 2020 compared to a liability of $706,000 at December 31,
2019.
Bank Covenants
The Company is required to meet certain financial covenants included in
the Credit Agreement with respect to fixed
charge ratio.
The following table presents the financial covenants specified in our Credit Agreement

of the offerings.
The
Registration Statement has a three-year term.
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET TRANSACTIONS
The Company has the
following minimum commitments under contractual
obligations, including purchase obligations, as
defined
by the SEC.
A “purchase obligation”
is defined as
an agreement to
purchase goods or
services that is
enforceable and
legally
binding on the Company and
that specifies all significant terms,
including: fixed or minimum
quantities to be purchased;
fixed,
minimum, or variable price
provisions; and the approximate
timing of the transaction.
Other long-term liabilities are
defined as
long-term liabilities
that are
reflected on
the Company
’s balance
sheet under
accounting principles
generally accepted
in the
United States. Based on
this definition, the table
below includes only those
contracts which include fixed
or minimum obligations.
It does not include normal purchases, which are made in the ordinary
course of business.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results
of Operations discuss
the Company’s
consolidated
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.
The preparation of
these consolidated financial
statements requires management
to make estimates
and assumptions that
affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements
and the
reported amounts
of revenues
and expenses
during the
reporting period.
On an
on-going basis,
management evaluates
its estimates
and judgments,
including those
related to
accounts receivable,
inventories, goodwill
and
other long-lived assets, self-insurance, post
retirement benefits, and income taxes.
Management bases its estimates and judgments
on historical experience
and on various
other factors that
are believed to
be reasonable under
the circumstances, the
results of
which form the
basis for making
judgments about the
carrying value of
assets and liabilities
that are not
readily apparent from
other sources. Actual results
may differ from
these estimates
, due to
the uncertainty around
the magnitude and
duration of the
COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other factors.
Management believes the following
critical accounting policies, among
others, affect its more
significant judgments and estimates
used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.
Accounts Receivable Allowances
Management maintains allowances for doubtful
accounts for estimated losses resulting
from the inability of
its customers to make
required payments. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their
ability to make
payments, additional allowances
may be required.
The Company has
determined that a
$41,000 allowance for
doubtful accounts is needed
at December 31,
2020 and $50,000
at December 31, 2019.
Management also records estimates
for
customer returns
and deductions,
discounts offered
to customers,
and for
price adjustments.
Should customer
returns and
deductions, discounts, and price
adjustments fluctuate from the estimated
amounts, additional allowances may
be required. The
Company had an allowance for
estimated chargebacks of $179,000
at December 31, 2020 and
$476,000 at December 31,
2019.
There have been no material changes in the methodology of these calculations.
Inventories
Inventories, which include
material, labor and
manufacturing overhead, are
valued at the
lower of cost
or net realizable
value.
The inventories are accounted for using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method of determining inventory costs. Inventory quantities
on-hand are
regularly reviewed,
and where
necessary, provisions
for excess
and obsolete
inventory are
recorded based
on
historical and anticipated usage.
The Company has recorded an allowance for
slow moving and obsolete inventory of $
546,000
at December 31, 2020 and $898,000 at December 31, 2019.
Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment
and finite-lived intangibles. The recoverability of long-lived
assets is evaluated
by an analysis
of operating results
and consideration of
other significant
events or changes
in the business
environment.
The Company evaluates,
whether impairment exists
for long-lived assets
on the basis
of undiscounted expected
future cash flows
from operations before
interest.
There was no
impairment of the
Company's long
-lived assets for
the years
ended December 31, 2020, 2019,
and 2018.
Goodwill
The purchase consideration of
acquired businesses have been
allocated to the assets
and liabilities acquired based on
the estimated
fair values on the respective acquisition dates. Based on these values, the excess purchase consideration over the fair
value of the
net assets acquired
was allocated to
goodwill. The Company accounts
for goodwill in
accordance with FASB
ASC Topic 350,
Intangibles -
Goodwill and
Other. FASB
ASC Topic
350 prohibits
the amortization
of goodwill
and requires
these assets
be
reviewed for impairment at each reporting unit. As a result of the Horizon Plastics acquisition on January 16, 2018 and the status
of its integration, the Company established two reporting units,
Core Traditional and Horizon Plastics.
The annual impairment
tests of goodwill may
be completed through
qualitative assessments; however
the, Company may
elect
to bypass the qualitative
assessment and proceed
directly to a quantitative
impairment test for
any reporting unit in
any period.
The Company may resume the qualitative assessment for any
reporting unit in any subsequent period.
Under a qualitative and quantitative
approach, the impairment tes
t
for goodwill consists of an
assessment of whether it is
more-
likely-than-not that a
reporting unit’s fair value is
less than its
carrying amount. As
part of the qualitative
assessment, the Company
considers relevant
events and
circumstances that
affect the
fair value
or carrying
amount of
the Company.
Such events
and
circumstances could
include changes
in economic
conditions, industry
and market
conditions, cost
factors, overall
financial
performance, reporting unit
specific events and
capital markets pricing.
The Company places
more weight on
the events and
circumstances that most affect the Company's
fair value or carrying amount. These factors
are all considered by management in
reaching its conclusion about whether to perform step one of the impairment test. If the Company elects to bypass the qualitative
assessment for any
reporting unit, or
if a qualitative
assessment indicates it
is more-likely-than
-not that the
estimated carrying
value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company proce
eds to a quantitative approach.
The company performed a qualitative analysis for the year end December 31, 2020 and determined that no impairment is needed
for the year 2020.
Due to the Company's
financial performance and continued depressed
stock price, the Company
performed a quantitative analysis
for both of its reporting units at September 30, 2019. During 2019, the Company incurred a loss of margin in its Horizon Plastics
reporting unit caused by selling price decreases that the Company
has not been able to fully offset with material cost reductions.
As a result of the quantitative
analysis, the Company concluded
that the carrying value of
Horizon Plastics was greater than
the
fair value, which resulted
in a goodwill impairment
charge of $4,100,000 at September
30, 2019 representing 19%
of the goodwill
related to the Horizon Plastics reporting unit. The company performed a
qualitative assessment at December 31, 2019, indicating
no additional goodwill impairment related to the Horizon Plastics reporting
unit.
The Company’s annual impairment assessment at December 31,
2018 consisted of a quantitative
analysis for both reporting units.
It concluded that the carrying value of Core
Traditional was greater than the fair value, which resulted
in a goodwill impairment
charge of $2,403,000, representing all the goodwill related to the Core Traditional reporting unit. The analysis of the Company’s
other reporting unit,
Horizon Plastics, indicated
no goodwill impairment
charge, based on
historical performance and
financial
projections at that time, as the excess of the estimated fair
value over the carrying value of its invested capital was approximately
23% of the book value of its net assets.
Self-Insurance
The Company is
self-insured with respec
t
to Columbus and
Batavia, Ohio; Gaffney,
South Carolina; Winona,
Minnesota;
and
Brownsville, Texas for medical, dental and vision claims and Columbus and Batavia, Ohio for
workers’ compensation claims, all
of which are subject to stop-loss insurance
thresholds. The Company is also self-insured for
dental and vision with respect to its
Cobourg, Canada location.
The Company has recorded
an estimated liability for
self-insured medical, dental and
vision claims
incurred but not reported and
worker’s compensation claims
incurred but not reported at
December 31, 2020 and December
31,
2019 of $933,000 and $1,203,000, respectively.
Post Retirement Benefits
Management records
an accrual
for post retirement
costs associated
with the health
care plan
sponsored by
the Company for
certain employees. Should
actual results differ
from the assumptions
used to determine the
reserves, additional provisions
may
be required.
In particular,
increases in
future healthcare
costs above
the assumptions
could have
an adverse
effect on
the
Company's operations. The effect
of a change in
healthcare costs is described
in
Note 12 -
Post Retirement Benefits
.
Core Molding
Technologies had
a liability for
post retirement healthcare
benefits based
on actuarially computed
estimates of
$9,109,000 at
December 31, 2020 and $9,160,000 at December 31, 2019.
Revenue Recognition
The Company historically
has recognized revenue
from two streams,
product revenue and
tooling revenue. Product
revenue is
earned from
the manufacture
and sale
of sheet
molding compound
and thermoset
and thermoplastic
products. Revenue
from
product sales is generally recognized as products are shipped, as the Company transfers control to the customer and is entitled to
payment upon
shipment. In
certain circumstances,
the Company
recognizes revenue
from product
sales when
products are
produced and the customer takes control at our production facility.
Tooling revenue is earned from
manufacturing multiple tools, molds and
assembly equipment as part of
a tooling program for a
customer. Given that the Company is
providing a significant service of
producing highly interdependent component
parts of the
tooling program,
each tooling
program consists
of a
single performance
obligation to
provide the
customer the
capability to
produce a single product. Based on the arrangement with the customer, the Company recognizes revenue either at a point in time
or over time. When the
Company does not
have an enforceable
right to payment, the
Company recognizes tooling revenue
at a
point in time. In such cases,
the Company recognizes revenue
upon customer acceptance, which
is when the customer has
legal
title to the tools.
The Company historically recognized
all tooling revenue at
a point in time,
upon customer acceptance,
before
the adoption of ASU 2014-09.
Certain tooling programs
include an enforceable
right to payment.
In those cases,
the Company recognizes
revenue over time
based on the extent of
progress towards completion o
f
its performance obligation. The
Company uses a cost-to-cost measure
of
progress for such
contracts because it
best depicts the
transfer of value
to the customer
and also correlates
with the amount
of
consideration to which the
entity expects to be
entitled in exchange for
transferring the promised goods
or services to
the customer.
Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date
to the
total estimated
costs at
completion of
the performance
obligation. Revenues
are recorded
proportionally as
costs are
incurred.
Income Taxes
The Company evaluates the
balance of deferred
tax assets that will
be realized based
on the premise that
the Company is more
likely than not to realize deferred tax benefits
through the generation of future taxable income. Management reviews
all available
evidence, both positive and
negative, to assess the
long-term earnings potential
of the Company using
a number of alternatives
to evaluate
financial results
in economic
cycles at
various industry
volume conditions.
Other factors
considered are
the
Company’s relationships with
its major customers, and any recent
customer diversification efforts. The projected
availability of
taxable income to realize
the tax benefits from the
reversal of temporary differences
before expiration of these
benefits are also
considered.
The Company evaluates
provisions and
deferred tax assets
quarterly to determine
if adjustments to
our valuation
allowance are required based on the consideration of all available
evidence.
As of December
31, 2020 the Company had
a net deferred tax asset
of $53,000 of which a
liability of $876,000 is related
to tax
positions in the
United States that is
displayed on the
balance sheet within the
other accrued liabilities portion,
an asset of
$460,000
related to tax positions in
Canada and an asset
of $469,000 related to
tax positions in Mexico.
The deferred tax liabilities
are in
other noncurrent liabilities
on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet.
During 2020,
the Company recorded
a valuation allowance
of
$1,193,000 against the
state net loss
carryforward and interest
limitation carryforward,
due to cumulative
losses in the
United
States over the
last three years
and uncertainty related
to the Company’s
ability to realize
net loss carryforwards
and other net
deferred tax assets
in the future.
The Company believes
that the deferred
tax assets associated
with the Canadian and
Mexican
tax jurisdictions are more-likely-than-not to be realizable based on estimates
of future taxable income and the Company's ability
to carryback losses.
Management recognizes
the financial
statement effects
of a
tax position
when it
is more
likely than
not the
position will
be
sustained upon examination.
COVID-19
In December 2019, COVID-19 surfaced and spread around the world resulting in business and social disruption. COVID-19 was
declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization on January 30, 2020. The
extent
to which the
coronavirus could impact
the Company’s
business activity will
depend on future
developments, which are
highly
uncertain and cannot be
predicted. Factors include,
new information concerning
the severity of COVID
-19, rollout plan for
the
COVID-19 vaccine, and the effectiveness of a vaccine.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Current expected credit loss (CECL)
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial
Instruments -Credit Losses,” which changes the
impairment model for
most financial assets
and certain other
instruments. For trade
and other receivables,
held-to-maturity debt securities,
loans and
other instruments, entities will
be required to use
a new forward-looking “expected loss”
model that will replace
today’s “incurred
loss” model and generally will result in
the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. For
available-for-sale debt securities with
unrealized losses,
entities will
measure credit
losses in
a manner
similar to
current practice,
except that
the losses
will b
e
recognized as an allowance. Subsequent to
issuing ASU 2016 -13, the FASB issued ASU 2018-19, “Codification Improvements
to Topic 326, Financial Instruments -
Credit Losses,” for the purpose
of clarifying certain aspects of ASU 2016 -13.
ASU 2018-
19 has the
same effective date
and transition requirements
as ASU 2016
-13. In April 2019,
the FASB issued
ASU 2019 -04,
“Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit
Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic
825, Financial Instruments,
”
which is effective
with the adoption
of ASU 2016-13. In May
2019, the FASB
issued ASU 2019-
05, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326),” which is
also effective with the adoption of ASU
2016-13. In November
2019, the FASB voted to delay the implementation date for certain companies, including those that qualify as a smaller reporting
company under SEC rules, until fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2022. We will adopt
this ASU on its effective date of
January 1, 2023.
We do not
expect the adoption
of this ASU to
have a material
impact on our
consolidated financial
position,
results of operations, cash flows, or presentation thereof.
Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes
In December 2019, the FASB issued
ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes -
Simplifying the Accounting for Income
Taxes. This guidance
is intended to
simplify various aspects
of income tax
accounting including the
elimination of certain
exceptions related
to the
approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of
deferred tax
liabilities for
outside basis
differences. The
new guidance also
simplifies aspects
of the accounting

Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on
Financial Reporting
(Topic 848). The ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP
to transactions affected by reference rate
(e.g., LIBOR) reform
if certain criteria
are met, for
a limited period
of time to
ease the potential
burden in accounting
for (or
recognizing the
effects of)
reference rate
reform on
financial reporting.
The ASU is
effective as
of March
12, 2020
through
December 31, 2022.
We will evaluate
transactions or contract
modifications occurring as
a result of
reference rate reform
and
determine whether to apply the optional guidance on an ongoing basis.
