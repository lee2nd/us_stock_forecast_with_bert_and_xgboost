Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
Management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the discussion of forward-looking statements at the beginning of this report.
The following section presents additional information to assess our results of operations and financial condition. This section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the supplemental financial data contained elsewhere in this report.
The information under Item 1 - Business of this report is incorporated here by reference.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Summary: Net income was $30.2 million ($36.8 million on a pretax basis) for 2020, compared to $32.0 million ($39.4 million on a pretax basis) for 2019. Earnings per common share on a diluted basis were $0.88 for 2020 and $0.94 for 2019.
Over the past several years, the improvement in our earnings has been the result of growth in revenue while expenses have been stable. The increase in revenue in 2020 compared to 2019 was due primarily to increased gains on sales of mortgage loans more than offsetting the reduction in net interest income. Net interest income decreased to $61.5 million in 2020 compared to $63.5 million in 2019. Gain on sales of mortgage loans were $6.5 million in 2020 compared to $2.3 million in 2019. Total noninterest expense was $45.7 million in 2020 compared to $44.2 million in 2019.
We recorded a provision for loan losses of $3.0 million in 2020 and a negative provision for loan losses of $450,000 in 2019. The provision taken in 2020 was driven by a $4.1 million charge-off taken in the second quarter of 2020 related to a single loan relationship with a movie theater business where the underlying assets were sold through bankruptcy proceedings. The 2020 provision also included additional allocations provided to the portfolio for qualitative allocations related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The provision was impacted by low levels of nonperforming loans, strong asset quality and the levels of net loan charge-offs/recoveries realized in recent periods (excluding the large charge-off to the movie theater business discussed above). These items are discussed more fully below.
Net Interest Income: Net interest income totaled $61.5 million during 2020 compared to $63.5 million during 2019.
The decrease in net interest income during 2020 compared to 2019 was due to the impact of an increase in average earning assets of $360.7 million from $1.89 billion in 2019 to $2.25 billion in 2020 being more than offset by a reduction in yields on earning assets, particularly overnight deposits as the federal funds rate was decreased by 150 basis points in March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Average yields on securities, interest earning assets and net interest margin are presented on a fully taxable equivalent basis. Our net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets (i.e. "net interest margin" or "margin") was 2.75% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 3.38% for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The yield on earning assets decreased 104 basis points from 4.04% for 2019 to 3.00% for 2020. The decrease from 2019 to 2020 was generally due to an increase of $216.5 million in average federal funds sold while the average short-term interest rates earned on these deposits decreased by 185 basis points from 2019 to 2020. Our margin in recent years has been negatively impacted by our decision to hold significant balances in liquid and short-term investments.
Net interest income for 2020 decreased $2.0 million compared to 2019. Of this decrease, $8.3 million was due to changes in rates earned or paid, partially offset by $6.3 million increase from changes in the volume of average interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. The largest changes came in commercial loan interest income which decreased by $1.9 million in 2020. Of the $1.9 million decrease in interest income on commercial loans, $7.4 million was due to decreases in rates earned, partially offset by $5.5 million increase from increases in average balances, driven by PPP loans.
Average interest earning assets totaled $2.25 billion for 2020 compared to $1.89 billion in 2019. Increases of $216.5 million in average short-term investment balances and $124.2 million in average loan balances from 2019 to 2020 were the primary drivers of the increase in total earning assets. Yield on commercial loans (excluding PPP loans) decreased from 4.72% in 2019 to 4.01% in 2020. Yield on PPP loans was 3.32% in 2020. Yield on residential mortgage loans decreased from 3.72% in 2019 to 3.66% in 2020, while yield on consumer loans decreased from 5.19% in 2019 to 4.32% in 2020. The decreases in yields on commercial loans and consumer loans, in particular, were the result of the predominance of loans in these categories with variable rates of interest tied to prime and LIBOR which decreased significantly in 2020.
Our net interest margin for 2020 was positively impacted from a 56 basis point decrease in our cost of funds from 0.94% for 2019 to 0.38% for 2020. Average interest bearing liabilities increased from $1.32 billion in 2019 to $1.47 billion in 2020. Decreases in the rates paid on certain deposit account types in response to market rate declines were the primary cause of the decrease in our cost of funds. While these costs have decreased, the yields on our interest earning assets decreased to a larger extent, causing net interest margin to decrease from 2019 to 2020.
- 25 -
In 2021, we expect that net interest margin will continue to be pressured by our higher levels of short-term investment balances held.
The following table shows an analysis of net interest margin for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in thousands).

The following table presents the dollar amount of changes in net interest income due to changes in volume and rate.
Provision for Loan Losses: The provision for loan losses for 2020 was $3.0 million compared to negative $450,000 for 2019. The provision for loan losses for 2020 was impacted by additional qualitative adjustments made to provide for estimated losses associated with the COVID-19 pandemic as well as a $4.1 million charge-off taken in June 2020 related to a single loan relationship with a movie theater business for which the underlying assets were sold through bankruptcy proceedings. No other loans of this industry type remain in our portfolio. This was partially offset by continued strong asset quality metrics and loan portfolio contraction. The balances of loans graded 5 and 6, which receive higher allocations increased by $1.0 million from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. Specific reserves on impaired loans decreased by $414,000 from $1.6 million at December 31, 2019 to $1.2 million at December 31, 2020. When excluding PPP loans, which are 100% guaranteed by the SBA, total loans decreased by $185.4 million from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. Net loan chargeoffs were $2.8 million in 2020 compared to net loan recoveries of $774,000 in 2019.
Our overall weighted average commercial loan grade has been below 4.00 for the past several years. Our weighted average commercial loan grade was 3.71 at December 31, 2020 and 3.67 at December 31, 2019.
The amounts of loan loss provision in each period were the result of establishing our allowance for loan losses at levels believed necessary based upon our methodology for determining the adequacy of the allowance. The sustained level of net recoveries over the past several years has had a significant effect on the historical loss component of our methodology. More information about our allowance for loan losses and our methodology for establishing its level may be found in this Item 7 of this report under the heading “Allowance for Loan Losses” below and in Item 8 of this report in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Noninterest Income: Noninterest income totaled $24.0 million in 2020 compared to $19.7 million in 2019. The components of noninterest income are shown in the table below (in thousands):
- 27 -
Net gains on sales of mortgage loans increased $4.1 million from 2019 to 2020 due to higher sales volumes in 2020. Net gains on mortgage loans included gains on the sale of real estate mortgage loans in the secondary market. We sell the majority of the fixed-rate mortgage loans we originate. We do not retain the servicing rights for the loans we sell.
A summary of gain on sales of loans and related loan volume was as follows (in thousands):
As demonstrated in the table above, volume of mortgage loans originated for sale was up significantly in 2020 compared to 2019. The low interest rates environment in 2020 has significantly impacted mortgage sale production volume. During 2020, more of our mortgage production volume was in products we sell on the secondary market than in the prior year, also contributing to the increase in gains on sales of mortgage loans in 2020.
Deposit service charges were down $385,000, primarily driven by lower overdraft fee income. These fees are driven by customer spending behavior and this activity tracked with the overall effect of government shutdowns on the economy, particularly in the second quarter of 2020, which was most impacted by the COVID-19 response. The stimulus checks sent by the federal government also helped our customers keep their accounts from overdrawing. In the fourth quarter of 2020, these fees had recovered significantly but remained below normal levels.
Trust service revenue decreased $54,000 in 2020. This decrease was due to changes in general market conditions in 2020.
ATM and debit card processing income decreased $54,000 in 2020 to $5.7 million compared to $5.8 million in 2019. This decrease reflected a decline in usage from customers in early 2020 when COVID-19 restrictions were first implemented. By the end of 2020, the volume was back to normal and above average levels. There was overall growth in the number of debit and ATM card customers in the latter months of the year and promotional efforts to increase volume in these low cost transaction alternatives continue to be successful.
We did not sell any securities in 2020 or 2019. We continually review our securities portfolio and will dispose of securities that pose higher than desired credit or market risk.
Investment services fees increased $289,000 in 2020. This increase was due to growth in our investment services customer base along with a shift in the choice of investments by customers to those with higher associated fees. The fees in 2020 were elevated due to the sale of a business by one of our customers with proceeds being invested in an annuity.
Earnings from bank owned life insurance decreased by $98,000 in 2020 compared to 2019 due to the general performance of the underlying investments. Other real estate rental income was $327,000 in 2020 compared to $495,000 in 2019. The year over year changes were a result of changes in rental arrangements on some of these properties.
Other income was up by $420,000 in 2020 due largely to fees collected on customer back-to-back interest rate swaps. These fees were $420,000 in 2020 compared to $62,000 in 2019.
- 28 -
Noninterest Expense: Noninterest expense was $45.7 million in 2020 and $44.2 million in 2019. The slight increase in total noninterest expense reflected our active management of controllable costs. The components of noninterest expense are shown in the table below (in thousands):
Salaries and benefits expense was the largest component of noninterest expense and was $25.5 million in 2020 and $24.7 million in 2019. The increase in 2020 was primarily driven by annual merit increases and an increase in variable compensation tied to higher mortgage loan production and investment services fees in 2020, partially offset by lower medical insurance costs resulting from lower claims experience in 2020, higher salary cost deferrals (driven by PPP loan originations) and lower 401k matching costs as we suspended our 401k matching for the second quarter of 2020. The table below identifies the primary components of salaries and benefits (in thousands):
Costs associated with nonperforming assets remained at low levels, totaling $115,000 in 2020 and $253,000 in 2019. These costs included legal costs, repossessed and foreclosed property administration expense and losses (gains) on repossessed and foreclosed properties. Repossessed and foreclosed property administration expense included survey and appraisal, property maintenance and management and other disposition and carrying costs. Net (gains) losses on repossessed and foreclosed properties included both net gains and losses on the sale of properties and unrealized losses from value declines for outstanding properties.
These costs are itemized in the following table (in thousands):
During 2020, we did not add any other real estate properties and sold $192,000 of other real estate and repossessed assets, allowing for another reduction in our year-end balance, bringing it from $2.7 million at December 31, 2019 to $2.5 million at December 31, 2020. In 2019, we did not add any other real estate properties and sold $618,000.
FDIC assessments increased to $400,000 in 2020 compared to $239,000 in 2019 primarily due to our assessment category and assessment credits applied during 2019, resulting in no expense in the third and fourth quarters of 2019. Assessment credits of $266,000 were applied in 2019, leaving approximately $172,000 in assessment credits that were fully utilized in 2020. Further discussion regarding the determination of FDIC assessments for the Bank may be found in Item 1 of this report under the heading "Supervision and Regulation."
- 29 -
Occupancy expense decreased by $39,000 in 2020 primarily due to a decrease in snow removal and outside grounds maintenance, partially offset by an increase in janitorial costs and building maintenance. Furniture and equipment expense increased by $258,000 in 2020 primarily due to an increase in equipment service contracts and software related to information security solutions, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense and equipment rental and repairs.
Data processing expenses were $3.4 million in 2020 and $3.0 million in 2019. Increases in data processing for our systems and card programs in 2020 and costs associated with our conversion to a new online banking service in 2020 were the primary reasons for the increase in 2020.
Other noninterest expenses not discussed above were $8.3 million in 2020 and $8.3 million in 2019.
Federal Income Tax Expense: We recorded federal income tax expense of $6.6 million in 2020 and $7.5 million in 2019. Our effective tax rate was 18.00% for 2020 and 18.92% for 2019. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we received the final distribution of a partnership interest we had acquired in a loan settlement. This removed the uncertainty regarding our realization of the related deferred tax asset and, as such, the $92,000 valuation allowance we had established at December 31, 2018 was reversed at December 31, 2020.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Summary: Total assets were $2.64 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $573.3 million from $2.07 billion at December 31, 2019. This change reflected increases of $511.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, $43.7 million in our loan portfolio, $11.6 million in securities available for sale, $7.9 million in other assets, $2.1 million in loans held for sale and $360,000 in bank owned life insurance, partially offset by decreases of $3.3 million in securities held to maturity, $211,000 in other real estate owned and $163,000 in premises and equipment. Total deposits increased by $545.3 million and other borrowed funds were up by $10.0 million at December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019.
Total shareholders’ equity increased by $22.4 million from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. Shareholders’ equity was increased by $30.2 million of net income in 2020, partially offset by cash dividends of $10.9 million, or $0.32 per share. Shareholders’ equity also increased by $2.7 million in 2020 as a result of a swing in accumulated other comprehensive income due to the effect of interest rate movement on the fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Bank was categorized as “well capitalized” under applicable regulatory guidelines.
Cash and Cash Equivalents: Our cash and cash equivalents, which include federal funds sold and short-term investments, were $783.7 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $272.5 million at December 31, 2019. This $511.3 million increase was primarily due to many of our customers holding higher balances, particularly liquid deposits, in the low interest rate environment and due to uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Securities: Securities available for sale were $236.8 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $225.2 million at December 31, 2019. The balance at December 31, 2020 primarily consisted of U.S. agency securities, agency mortgage backed securities and various municipal investments. Our held to maturity portfolio decreased from $82.7 million at December 31, 2019 to $79.5 million at December 31, 2020. Our held to maturity portfolio is comprised of state aid notes and locally sourced municipal and commercial bonds. The commercial bond component of this category declined by $2.7 million in 2020. These bonds represent financing provided to some of our non-profit commercial customers who qualified for borrowing on a tax-exempt basis.
Portfolio Loans and Asset Quality: Total portfolio loans increased by $43.7 million to $1.43 billion at December 31, 2020 compared to $1.39 billion at December 31, 2019. During 2020, our commercial portfolio increased by $119.6 million, while our residential mortgage portfolio decreased by $61.5 million and our consumer portfolio decreased by $14.4 million. The SBA created the Paycheck Protection Program to provide an efficient means to provide funding for small businesses to maintain payroll and operations during the COVID-19 pandemic. We were an active participant in this program and originated a total of 1,738 loans totaling $346.7 million in 2020. Borrowers who use the funds from their PPP loans to maintain payroll and for certain fixed expenses such as rent, occupancy, etc. are eligible to have 100% of their loans forgiven by the SBA. Through December 31, 2020, we had received disbursement of $113.5 million from the SBA for approved forgiveness applications. Our remaining balance of PPP loans was $229.1 million at December 31, 2020. We expect the majority of the remaining PPP loans to be forgiven in the first half of 2021. This program was reauthorized at the end of 2020 and will be open until March 31, 2021, or until the $284 billion authorized is used. We will be participating in this program again in 2021 and anticipate the volume to be somewhat less than we experienced in 2020. This expectation is subject to change due to borrower behavior, changing SBA requirements and processes relating to loan forgiveness and other relevant factors.
The volume of residential mortgage loans originated for sale in 2020 increased significantly compared to 2019 due to the mortgage rate environment and customer preference for loan types that we sell on the secondary market, primarily longer term fixed rate mortgages. Residential mortgage loans originated for sale were $156.4 million in 2020 compared to $82.3 million in 2019.
- 30 -
We experienced year over year growth in commercial loan balances for the past three years, $74.9 million in 2018, $16.0 million in 2019 and $119.6 million in 2020. As discussed previously, most of the growth in 2020 is attributable to PPP loan originations. We plan to continue measured, high quality loan portfolio growth in 2021.
Commercial and commercial real estate loans remained our largest loan segment and accounted for 85.2% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2020 and 79.2% at December 31, 2019. Residential mortgage and consumer loans comprised 14.8% of total loans at December 31, 2020 and 20.8% at December 31, 2019.
A further breakdown of the composition of the loan portfolio is shown in the table below (in thousands):
(1)
Includes both owner occupied and non-owner occupied commercial real estate.
Commercial real estate loans decreased $46.3 million since December 31, 2019 and accounted for 38.6% of our total loan portfolio at year-end 2020 and consisted primarily of loans to business owners and developers of owner and non-owner occupied commercial properties and loans to developers of single and multi-family residential properties. In the table above, we show our commercial real estate portfolio by loans secured by residential and commercial real estate, and by stage of development. Improved loans are generally secured by properties that are under construction or completed and placed in use. Development loans are secured by properties that are in the process of development or fully developed. Vacant and unimproved loans are secured by raw land for which development has not yet begun and agricultural land.
Our commercial and industrial loan portfolio increased by $165.8 million to $665.4 million at December 31, 2020 and represented 46.6% of our total loan portfolio. As discussed above, this increase includes $229.1 million in outstanding balances on PPP loans, which are subject to forgiveness by the SBA.
Our consumer residential mortgage loan portfolio, which also includes residential construction loans made to individual homeowners, comprised approximately 10.5% of portfolio loans at December 31, 2020 and 15.3% at December 31, 2019. We expect to continue to retain in our loan portfolio certain types of residential mortgage loans (primarily high quality, low loan to value, adjustable rate loans) in an effort to continue to diversify our credit risk and deploy our excess liquidity. A large portion of our residential mortgage loan production continues to be sold on the secondary market with servicing released.
The volume of residential mortgage loans originated for sale during 2020 increased significantly from 2019 as interest rates declined in 2020 and there was a shift in production from financing new home purchases to refinancings. In addition, customer preference drove more production in loan product types we sell on the secondary market (i.e. fixed-rate long-term mortgages). As of December 31, 2020, the Company had no repurchase demands or claims related to residential mortgage loans sold on the secondary market during the five-year period ended December 31, 2020.
- 31 -
Our portfolio of other consumer loans includes loans secured by personal property and home equity fixed term and line of credit loans. Consumer loans decreased by $14.4 million to $62.2 million at December 31, 2020 from $76.5 million at December 31, 2019 primarily due to a decrease in home equity loans. Consumer loans comprised approximately 4.3% of our portfolio loans at December 31, 2020 and 5.5% at December 31, 2019.
The following table shows our loan origination activity for portfolio loans during 2020 and 2019, broken out by loan type and also shows average originated loan size (dollars in thousands):
(1) 2020 includes $346.7 million in PPP loan originations
The table above demonstrates that our loan origination activity in 2020 was higher than in 2019, but was significantly impacted by PPP loan originations. We believe the lower origination activity (excluding PPP activity) is primarily the result of reduced business activity occurring in our marketplace in response to uncertainty over economic and political conditions with the COVID-19 pandemic.
Our loan portfolio is reviewed regularly by our senior management, our loan officers, and an internal loan review team that is independent of our loan originators and credit administration. An administrative loan committee consisting of senior management and seasoned lending and collections personnel meets monthly to manage our internal watch list and proactively manage high risk loans.
When reasonable doubt exists concerning collectability of interest or principal of one of our loans, the loan is placed in nonaccrual status. Any interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed and charged against current earnings.
Nonperforming assets are comprised of nonperforming loans, foreclosed assets and repossessed assets. At December 31, 2020, nonperforming assets totaled $3.1 million compared to $3.0 million at December 31, 2019. There were no additions to other real estate owned in 2020 or in 2019. Based on the loans currently in their redemption period, we expect there to be few additions to other real estate owned in 2021. Proceeds from sales of foreclosed and repossessed properties were $192,000 in 2020, resulting in a net realized gain on sale of $13,000. Proceeds from sales of foreclosed properties were $656,000 in 2019 resulting in a net realized gain on sale of $38,000. We expect there to be little change in the balance of our foreclosed properties in 2021.
Nonperforming loans include loans on nonaccrual status and loans delinquent more than 90 days but still accruing. As of December 31, 2020, nonperforming loans totaled $533,000, or 0.04% of total portfolio loans, compared to $203,000, or 0.01% of total portfolio loans, at December 31, 2019.
Nonperforming loans at December 31, 2020 consisted of $438,000 of commercial real estate loans secured by various types of non-residential real estate and $95,000 of consumer and residential mortgage loans.
- 32 -
Foreclosed and repossessed assets include assets acquired in settlement of loans. Foreclosed assets totaled $2.5 million at December 31, 2020 and $2.7 million at December 31, 2019. Of this balance at December 31, 2020, there were 4 commercial real estate properties totaling approximately $2.5 million. All properties acquired through or in lieu of foreclosure are initially transferred at their fair value less estimated costs to sell and then evaluated monthly for impairment after transfer using a lower of cost or market approach. Updated property valuations are obtained at least annually on all foreclosed assets.
At December 31, 2020, our foreclosed asset portfolio had a weighted average age held in portfolio of 8.83 years. Below is a breakout of our foreclosed asset portfolio at December 31, 2020 and 2019 by property type and the percentages the property has been written down since taken into our possession and the combined writedown percentage, including losses taken when the property was loan collateral (dollars in thousands):
The following table shows the composition and amount of our nonperforming assets (dollars in thousands):

The following table further shows the composition of our TDRs over the past five years (dollars in thousands):
We had a total of $9.4 million and $13.7 million of loans whose terms have been modified in TDRs as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These loans may have involved the restructuring of terms to allow customers to mitigate the risk of foreclosure by meeting a lower loan payment requirement based upon their current cash flow. These may also include loans that renewed at existing contractual rates, but below market rates for comparable credit. For each restructuring, a comprehensive credit underwriting analysis of the borrower’s financial condition and prospects of repayment under the revised terms is performed to assess whether the structure can be successful and that cash flows will be sufficient to support the restructured debt. An analysis is also performed to determine whether the restructured loan should be on accrual status. Generally, if the loan is on accrual at the time of restructure, it will remain on accrual after the restructuring. In some cases, a nonaccrual loan may be placed on accrual at restructuring if the loan’s actual payment history demonstrates it would have cash flowed under the restructured terms. After six consecutive payments under the restructured terms, a nonaccrual restructured loan is reviewed for possible upgrade to accruing status. In situations where there is a subsequent modification or renewal and the loan is brought to market terms, including a contractual interest rate not less than a market interest rate for new debt with similar credit risk characteristics, the TDR and impaired designations may be removed.
As with other impaired loans, an allowance for loan loss is estimated for each TDR based on the most likely source of repayment for each loan. For impaired commercial real estate loans that are collateral dependent, the allowance is computed based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, less estimated costs to sell. For impaired commercial loans where repayment is expected from cash flows from business operations, the allowance is computed based on a discounted cash flow computation. Certain groups of TDRs, such as residential mortgages, have common characteristics and for them the allowance is computed based on a discounted cash flow computation on the change in weighted rate for the pool. The allowance allocations for commercial TDRs where we have reduced the contractual interest rate are computed by measuring cash flows using the new payment terms discounted at the original contractual rate.
On March 22, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an “Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus”. This guidance encourages financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers that may be unable to meet their contractual obligations because of the effects of COVID-19. The guidance goes on to explain that in consultation with the FASB staff that the federal banking agencies concluded that short-term modifications (e.g. six months) made on a good faith basis to borrowers who were current as of the implementation date of a modification are not TDRs. The CARES Act was passed by Congress on March 27, 2020. Section 4013 of the CARES Act also addressed COVID-19 related modifications and specified that COVID-19 related modifications on loans that were not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019 are not TDRs. The Economic Aid Act passed by Congress on December 27, 2020 extended the date for such modifications to not be treated as TDRs to the earlier of 60 days after date on which the national emergency declared as a result of COVID-19 is terminated or January 1, 2022. Through December 31, 2020, the Bank had applied this guidance and modified 726 individual loans with aggregate principal balances totaling $337.2 million. The majority of these modifications involved three-month extensions.
By December 31, 2020, most of these modification had expired, down from a quarter end peak of $297.3 million at June 30, 2020. The table below shows the number and balances of loans with such modifications as of the past four quarter end dates (dollars in thousands):
Allowance for loan losses: Determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses is highly subjective. Timely identification of risk rating changes within the commercial loan portfolio is key to our process of establishing an appropriate allowance balance. The internal risk rating system is discussed below.
- 34 -
The allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2020 was $17.4 million, an increase of $208,000, compared to $17.2 million at December 31, 2019. The balance of the allowance for loan losses was 1.22% of total portfolio loans at December 31, 2020 compared to 1.24% of total portfolio loans at December 31, 2019. The ratio at December 31, 2020 was impacted by $229.1 million of remaining PPP loans which were generated during 2020. The ratio excluding these loans was 1.45% at December 31, 2020. The allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loan coverage ratio remained high at 3266% at December 31, 2020 compared to 8473% at December 31, 2019.
The following is a summary of our portfolio loan balances at the end of each period and the daily average balance of these loans. It also includes changes in the allowance for loan losses arising from loans charged-off, recoveries on loans previously charged-off, and provisions for loan losses.
The continued reduction in net charge-offs over the last several years has had a significant effect on the historical loss component of our allowance for loan losses computation as have the improvements in our credit quality metrics.
The table below shows the changes in these metrics over the past five years:
Nonperforming loans have been low over the past several years. At December 31, 2020, we have had net loan recoveries in twenty-two of the past twenty-four quarters. Perhaps even more importantly, our total delinquencies have continued to be minimal, and were just $600,000 at December 31, 2020.
- 35 -
These factors all provide for a reduction in our allowance for loan losses, and thus impact our provision for loan losses. The provision for loan losses was $3.0 million for 2020 compared to a negative $450,000 for 2019. The provision in each period was due to the levels of nonperforming loans and net charge-off/recovery experience. We had net charge-offs in 2020 totaling $2.8 million compared to net recoveries of $774,000 in 2019. The ratio of net charge-offs / (recoveries) to average loans was 0.19% for 2020 compared to (0.06%) for 2019.
Despite the unique charge-off we incurred in 2020, we are encouraged by the low level of charge-offs over the past several years. We do, however, recognize that future charge-offs and resulting provisions for loan losses are expected to be impacted by the timing and extent of changes in the overall economy and the real estate markets.
Our allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed appropriate based upon our assessment of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Our methodology for measuring the appropriate level of allowance and related provision for loan losses relies on several key elements, which include specific allowances for loans considered impaired, general allowance for commercial loans not considered impaired based upon applying our loan rating system, and general allocations based on historical trends for homogeneous loan groups with similar risk characteristics.
Impaired loans decreased $3.2 million, or 23%, to $10.6 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $13.9 million at December 31, 2019. The specific allowance for impaired loans decreased $414,000 to $1.2 million, or 11.4% of total impaired loans, at December 31, 2020 compared to $1.6 million, or 11.7% of total impaired loans, at December 31, 2019.
Specific allowances are established on individually impaired credits where we believe it is probable that a loss may be incurred. Specific allowances are determined based on discounting estimated cash flows over the life of the loan or based on the fair value of collateral supporting the loan. For commercial real estate loans, generally appraisals are used to estimate the fair value of the collateral and determine the appropriate specific allowance. Estimated selling costs are also considered in the estimate. When it becomes apparent that liquidation of the collateral is the only source of repayment, the collateral shortfall is charged off rather than carried as a specific allowance.
The general allowance (referred to as “formula allowance”) allocated to commercial loans that were not considered to be impaired was based upon the internal risk grade of such loans. We use a loan rating method based upon an eight point system. Loans are stratified between real estate secured and non-real estate secured. The real estate secured portfolio is further stratified by the type of real estate. Each stratified portfolio is assigned a loss allocation factor. Generally, a worse grade assigned to a loan category results in a greater allocation percentage. Changes in risk grade of loans affect the amount of the allowance allocation.
The determination of our loss factors is based upon our actual loss history by loan grade and adjusted for significant factors that, in management's judgment, affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the analysis date. We use a rolling 18 month (6 quarter) actual net charge-off history as the base for our computation for commercial loans. The 18 month period ended December 31, 2020 reflected net recoveries for most of our loan pools. We addressed this volatility in the qualitative factor considerations applied in our allowance computation. We also considered the extended period of improved asset quality in assessing the overall qualitative component.
At December 31, 2020, we also considered the effect that the COVID-19 pandemic has had and is having on our loan borrowers and our local economy. An analysis of each credit in our commercial loan portfolio was performed to evaluate the impact of the shutdown on each business and identify the potential loss exposure. While this analysis revealed limited stress in our portfolio and significant stimulus and mitigation efforts are expected to soften the impact of the shutdowns, we determined a downgrade to our economic qualitative factor was appropriate and we added 7 basis points in March 2020, 6 basis points in June 2020, 2 basis points in September 2020 and 7 basis points in December, for a total of 22 additional basis points coverage at December 31, 2020.
Considering the change in our qualitative factors and changes in our commercial loan portfolio balances, the general commercial loan allowance increased $840,000 to $13.8 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $12.9 million at December 31, 2019. The general reserve increase was primarily due to additional allocations provided to address risk associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The qualitative component of our allowance allocated to commercial loans was $12.7 million at December 31, 2020, up from $12.2 million at December 31, 2019.
Groups of homogeneous loans, such as residential real estate and open- and closed-end consumer loans, receive allowance allocations based on loan type. A rolling 12 month (4 quarter) historical loss experience period was applied to residential mortgage and consumer loan portfolios. As with commercial loans that are not considered impaired, the determination of the allowance allocation percentage is based principally on our historical loss experience. These allocations are adjusted for consideration of general economic and business conditions, credit quality and delinquency trends, collateral values, and recent loss experience for these similar pools of loans. The homogeneous loan allowance was $2.4 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $2.6 million at December 31, 2019.
As noted above, the formula allowance allocated to commercial loans that are not considered to be impaired is calculated by applying historical loss factors to outstanding loans based on the internal risk rating of such loans. We use a loan rating method based upon an eight point system. Loans rated a 4 or better are considered of acceptable risk. Loans rated a 5 exhibit above-normal risk to the Company and warrant a greater level of attention by management. These loans are subject to on-going review and assessment by our Administrative Loan Committee. Loans rated a 6 or worse are considered substandard, doubtful or loss, exhibit a greater relative risk of loss to the Company based upon the rating and warrant an active workout plan administered by our Special Asset Group.
- 36 -
The qualitative factors assessed and used to adjust historical loss experience reflect our assessment of the impact of economic trends, delinquency and other problem loan trends, trends in valuations supporting underlying collateral, changes in loan portfolio concentrations, effect of changes in interest rates on loan collectability, competition and changes in internal credit administration practices have on probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio. Qualitative adjustments are inherently subjective and there can be no assurance that these adjustments have properly identified probable losses in our loan portfolio. More information regarding the subjectivity involved in determining the estimate of the allowance for loan losses may be found in this Item 7 of this report under the heading "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates."
The following table shows the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by portfolio type at the dates indicated.
The components of the allowance for loan losses were as follows:
With the exception of certain TDRs, impaired commercial loans at December 31, 2020 were classified as substandard or worse per our internal risk rating system. $4.2 million of residential mortgage TDRs were associated with programs approved by the U.S. government during 2009 to minimize the number of consumer foreclosures. These loans involved the restructuring of terms on consumer mortgages to allow customers to mitigate foreclosure by meeting a lower loan payment requirement based upon their current cash flow. Also included in this category are certain consumer home equity loans that were restructured maturing home equity lines of credit that did not qualify for traditional term financing. We have been actively working with our customers to reduce the risk of foreclosure using these programs. Additional information regarding impaired loans at December 31, 2020 and 2019 may be found in Item 8 of this report in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Our weighted average loan grade was 3.68 at December 31, 2018, 3.67 at December 31, 2019 and 3.71 at December 31, 2020. The increase of $459,000 in reserves on commercial loans for 2020 was due to a $345,000 decrease in specific reserves on impaired loans and a $804,000 increase in the loss allocation factor on non-impaired loans due to additional allocations for the COVID-19 pandemic uncertainty at December 31, 2020.
- 37 -
Of the $17.4 million allowance at December 31, 2020, 7% related to specific allocations on impaired loans, 78% related to formula allowance on commercial loans and 14% related to general allocations for homogeneous loans. Of the $17.2 million allowance at December 31, 2019, 10% related to specific allocations on impaired loans, 75% related to formula allowance on commercial loans and 15% related to general allocations for homogeneous loans. Of the $16.2 million total formula based allowance for loan loss allocations at December 31, 2020, $16.1 million is from general/environmental allocations and $56,000 was driven from historical experience. Of the $15.6 million total formula based allowance for loan loss allocations at December 31, 2019, $14.8 million is from general/environmental allocations and $807,000 is driven from historical experience. The above allocations are not intended to imply limitations on usage of the allowance. The entire allowance is available for any loan losses without regard to loan type.
More information regarding steps to address the elevated levels of substandard, impaired and nonperforming loans may be found in this Item 7 of this report under the heading "Portfolio Loans and Asset Quality" above and in Item 8 of this report in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Certain industry sectors will be more negatively impacted than others by the economic effects of COVID-19 and governmental action. For example, businesses that thrive on large masses of people assembling in close proximity, such as hospitality, restaurants and sporting events will likely incur longer lasting negative effects than other industries. We believe our commercial portfolio is adequately diversified, with our largest commercial concentrations in Real Estate, Rental and Leasing (24.0%), followed by Manufacturing (15.6%) and Retail Trade (10.6%).
The table below breaks down our commercial loan portfolio by industry type at December 31, 2020 and identifies the percentage of loans in each type that have a pass rating within our grading system (4 or better) and criticized rating (5 or worse) (dollars in thousands):
Accommodations and Food Services in the table above includes our loans to restaurants and hotels. We have reviewed each relationship in this industry group and have determined based upon their nature of operations and our loan structure that we believe our loss exposure is limited.
Although we believe our allowance for loan losses has captured the losses that are probable in our portfolio as of December 31, 2020, there can be no assurance that all losses have been identified or that the allowance is sufficient. The additional efforts by management to accelerate the identification and disposition of problem assets discussed above, and the impact of the lasting economic slowdown, may result in additional losses in 2021.
Premises and Equipment: Premises and equipment totaled $43.3 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $43.4 million at December 31, 2019 as capital additions were more than offset by depreciation of current facilities during 2020.
- 38 -
Bank owned life insurance (BOLI): The Bank has purchased life insurance policies on certain officers. BOLI is recorded at its currently realizable cash surrender value and totaled $42.5 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $42.2 million at December 31, 2019.
Deposits and Other Borrowings: Total deposits increased $545.3 million to $2.30 billion at December 31, 2020, as compared to $1.75 billion at December 31, 2019. Noninterest checking account balances increased $326.9 million in 2020. Interest bearing demand account balances increased $163.6 million and savings and money market account balances increased $103.4 million in 2020 while our certificates of deposits (primarily short-term) decreased by $48.6 million in 2020. We believe our success in maintaining and increasing the balances of personal and business checking and savings accounts was primarily attributable to our focus on quality customer service, the desire of customers to deal with a local bank, the convenience of our branch network and the breadth and depth of our product line.
Noninterest bearing demand accounts comprised 35% of total deposits at December 31, 2020 compared to 28% of total deposits at December 31, 2019. Because of the generally low rates paid on interest bearing account alternatives, many of our business customers chose to keep their balances in these more liquid noninterest bearing demand account types. Interest bearing demand, money market and savings accounts, comprised 60% of total deposits at December 31, 2020 and 64% at December 31, 2019. Time accounts as a percentage of total deposits were 5% at December 31, 2020 and 9% at December 31, 2019.
Borrowed funds totaled $90.6 million at December 31, 2020 including $70.0 million in Federal Home Loan Bank advances and $20.6 million in long-term debt associated with trust preferred securities. Borrowed funds totaled $80.6 million at December 31, 2019 including $60.0 million of Federal Home Loan Bank advances and $20.6 million in long-term debt associated with trust preferred securities. The $10.0 million increase in borrowed funds in 2020 was due to the addition of a single $10.0 million advance with the Federal Home Loan Bank executed in early 2020.
At December 31, 2020, the Company had outstanding $20.0 million aggregate liquidation amount of pooled trust preferred securities (“TRUPs”) issued through its wholly-owned subsidiary grantor trust, Macatawa Statutory Trust II (issued $20.0 million aggregate liquidation amount with a floating interest rate of three-month LIBOR plus 2.75%).
Information regarding our off-balance sheet commitments may be found in Item 8 of this report in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
CAPITAL RESOURCES
Total shareholders’ equity increased by $22.4 million from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. Shareholders’ equity was increased by $30.2 million of net income in 2020, partially offset by cash dividends of $10.9 million, or $0.32 per share. Shareholders’ equity also increased by $2.7 million in 2020 as a result of a swing in accumulated other comprehensive income due to the effect of interest rate movement on the fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio. As of December 31, 2020, the Bank was categorized as “well capitalized” under applicable regulatory guidelines.
Our regulatory capital ratios (on a consolidated basis) continue to significantly exceed the levels required to be categorized as “well capitalized” according to the requirements specified by the rules implementing Basel III.
The following table shows our regulatory capital ratios (on a consolidated basis) for the past three years.
Our Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends to common shareholders beginning with the first quarter of 2014, and each subsequent quarter in 2014 through 2020. The declaration and payment of future dividends to common shareholders will be considered by the Board of Directors in its discretion and will depend on a number of factors, including our financial condition and anticipated profitability.
All of the $20.0 million of trust preferred securities outstanding at December 31, 2020 qualified as Tier 1 capital.
Capital sources include, but are not limited to, additional private and public common stock offerings, preferred stock offerings and subordinated debt.
- 39 -
On July 3, 2013, the FDIC Board of Directors approved the Regulatory Capital Interim Final Rule, implementing Basel III. This rule redefined Tier 1 capital as two components (Common Equity Tier 1 and Additional Tier 1), created a new capital ratio (Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-based Capital Ratio) and implemented a capital conservation buffer. It also revised the prompt corrective action thresholds and made changes to risk weights for certain assets and off-balance-sheet exposures. Banks were required to transition into the new rule beginning on January 1, 2015. Based on our capital levels and balance sheet composition at December 31, 2020, we believe implementation of the new rule had no material impact on our capital needs.
Macatawa Bank:
The Bank was categorized as "well capitalized" at December 31, 2020 and 2019 according to the requirements specified by the rules implementing Basel III. The following table shows the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios for the past three years.
LIQUIDITY
Liquidity of Macatawa Bank: The liquidity of a financial institution reflects its ability to manage a variety of sources and uses of funds. Our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows categorize these sources and uses into operating, investing and financing activities. We primarily focus on developing access to a variety of borrowing sources to supplement our deposit gathering activities and provide funds for our investment and loan portfolios. Our sources of liquidity include our borrowing capacity with the FRB's discount window, the Federal Home Loan Bank, federal funds purchased lines of credit and other secured borrowing sources with our correspondent banks, loan payments by our borrowers, maturity and sales of our securities available for sale, growth of our deposits, federal funds sold and other short-term investments, and the various capital resources discussed above.
Liquidity management involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of our customers. Our customers may be either borrowers with credit needs or depositors wanting to withdraw funds. Our liquidity management involves periodic monitoring of our assets considered to be liquid and illiquid, and our funding sources considered to be core and non-core and short-term (less than 12 months) and long-term. We have established parameters that monitor, among other items, our level of liquid assets to short-term liabilities, our level of non-core funding reliance and our level of available borrowing capacity. We maintain a diversified wholesale funding structure and actively manage our maturing wholesale sources to reduce the risk to liquidity shortages. We have also developed a contingency funding plan to stress test our liquidity requirements arising from certain events that may trigger liquidity shortages, such as rapid loan growth in excess of normal growth levels or the loss of deposits and other funding sources under extreme circumstances.
We maintain a non-core funding dependency ratio below our peer group average and have had no brokered deposits on our balance sheet since before December 2012. At December 31, 2020, the Bank held $752.3 million of federal funds sold and other short-term investments as well as $213.2 million of unpledged securities available for sale. In addition, the Bank’s available borrowing capacity from correspondent banks was approximately $298.9 million as of December 31, 2020.
In the normal course of business, we enter into certain contractual obligations, including obligations which are considered in our overall liquidity management.
The table below summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands):
In addition to normal loan funding, we also maintain liquidity to meet customer financing needs through unused lines of credit, unfunded loan commitments and standby letters of credit. The level and fluctuation of these commitments is also considered in our overall liquidity management. At December 31, 2020, we had a total of $596.3 million in unused lines of credit, $88.0 million in unfunded loan commitments and $11.8 million in standby letters of credit.
- 40 -
Liquidity of Holding Company: The primary sources of liquidity for the Company are dividends from the Bank, existing cash resources and the capital markets if the need to raise additional capital arises. Banking regulations and the laws of the State of Michigan in which our Bank is chartered limit the amount of dividends the Bank may declare and pay to the Company in any calendar year. Under the state law limitations, the Bank is restricted from paying dividends to the Company in excess of retained earnings. In 2019, the Bank paid dividends to the Company totaling $32.5 million. In the same period, the Company paid $20.0 million to redeem trust preferred securities and paid $9.5 million in dividends to its shareholders. In 2020, the Bank paid dividends to the Company totaling $11.7 million. In the same period, the Company paid dividends to its shareholders totaling $10.9 million. The Company retained the remaining balance in each period for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2020, the Bank had a retained earnings balance of $86.3 million.
During 2020 and 2019, the Company received payments from the Bank totaling 7.7 million and $8.0 million, respectively, representing the Bank’s intercompany tax liability for the 2020 and 2019 tax years, respectively, in accordance with the Company’s tax allocation agreement.
The Company has the right to defer interest payments for 20 consecutive quarters on its trust preferred securities if necessary for liquidity purposes. During the deferral period, the Company may not declare or pay any dividends on its common stock or make any payment on any outstanding debt obligations that rank equally with or junior to the trust preferred securities.
The Company’s cash balance at December 31, 2020 was $6.7 million. The Company believes that it has sufficient liquidity to meet its cash flow obligations.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES:
To prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management makes estimates and assumptions based on available information. These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and future results could differ. The allowance for loan losses, other real estate owned valuation, loss contingencies and income taxes are deemed critical due to the required level of management judgment and the use of estimates, making them particularly subject to change.
Our methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses is described above in the "Allowance for Loan Losses" discussion. This area of accounting requires significant judgment due to the number of factors which can influence the collectability of a loan. Unanticipated changes in these factors could significantly change the level of the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses. Although, based upon our internal analysis, and in our judgment, we believe that we have provided an adequate allowance for loan losses, there can be no assurance that our analysis has properly identified all of the probable losses in our loan portfolio. As a result, we could record future provisions for loan losses that may be significantly different than the levels that we recorded in 2020.
Assets acquired through or instead of foreclosure, primarily other real estate owned, are initially recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. New real estate appraisals are generally obtained at the time of foreclosure and are used to establish fair value. If fair value declines, a valuation allowance is recorded through expense. Estimating the initial and ongoing fair value of these properties involves a number of factors and judgments including holding time, costs to complete, holding costs, discount rate, absorption and other factors.
Loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. This, too, is an accounting area that involves significant judgment. Although, based upon our judgment, internal analysis, and consultations with legal counsel we believe that we have properly accounted for loss contingencies, future changes in the status of such contingencies could result in a significant change in the level of contingent liabilities and a related impact to operating earnings.
Our accounting for income taxes involves the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities primarily associated with differences in the timing of the recognition of revenues and expenses for financial reporting and tax purposes. At December 31, 2020, we had gross deferred tax assets of $5.1 million and gross deferred tax liabilities of $3.1 million resulting in a net deferred tax asset of $2.1 million. Accounting standards require that companies assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against their deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence using a "more likely than not" standard. At December 31, 2020, a valuation allowance of $92,000 that had been maintained against a capital loss carryforward created by the liquidation of the assets of a partnership interest the Bank acquired through a loan settlement was reversed as the final distribution of the partnership interest was received. With the positive results in 2020 and positive future projections, we concluded at December 31, 2020 that no valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset was required. Changes in tax laws, changes in tax rates, changes in ownership and our future level of earnings can impact the ultimate realization of our net deferred tax asset.
