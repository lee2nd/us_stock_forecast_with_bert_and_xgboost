Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engineering a novel class of injectable biologics to selectively engage and modulate targeted T cells directly within the patient’s body. We believe our proprietary Immuno-STAT™ (Selective Targeting and Alteration of T Cells) platform will allow us to harness the fullest potential of an individual’s intrinsic immune repertoire for restoring health while avoiding the deleterious side-effects of broad immune activation (for immuno-oncology or infectious immunity) or broad immune suppression (for autoimmunity and inflammation). In addition to the selective modulation of T cell activity, we believe Immuno-STATs offer several key points of potential differentiation over competing approaches, including modularity and versatility providing broad disease coverage, manufacturability, and convenient administration.
Through rational protein engineering, we leverage the modular and versatile nature of the Immuno-STAT platform to design drug product candidates for selective immune modulation in cancer, chronic infectious disease, and autoimmune disease. To address the needs of these clinical indications, we have developed four biologic series within the Immuno-STAT platform: CUE-100, CUE-200, CUE-300, and CUE-400, each specifically designed through rational engineering to possess distinct signaling modules for desired biological mechanisms that may be applied across many diseases. The CUE-100 series exploits rationally engineered IL-2 in context of the core Immuno-STAT framework for selective activation of targeted tumor-specific T cells, while the CUE-200 series is focused on cell surface receptors including CD80 and/or 4-1BBL to address T cell exhaustion associated with chronic infections. The CUE-300 series, being developed for autoimmune diseases, incorporates the inhibitory PDL1 co-modulator for selective inhibition of the autoreactive T cell repertoire. This approach is pertinent for autoimmune diseases with known, well characterized, limited or few autoantigens, such as type 1 diabetes. The CUE-400 series, for autoimmune diseases with diverse or unknown autoantigens, represents a novel class of bispecific molecules that can selectively and effectively expand induced regulatory T cells, or iTregs. We categorize these molecules as “pathway-specific modulators,” or PSM. The first candidate, CUE-401, incorporates the two key biological signals that are necessary for generation of iTregs, namely IL-2 and TGF-beta. Based on structure-based rational protein engineering, both IL-2 and TGF-beta have been affinity tuned to maintain on-target engagement while minimizing systemic toxicities.
Our drug product candidates are in various stages of clinical and preclinical development, and while we believe that these candidates hold potential value, our activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. We have not yet commenced any commercial revenue-generating operations, have limited cash flows from operations, and will need to access additional capital to fund our growth and ongoing business operations.
Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic
The COVID-19 outbreak, which the World Health Organization has classified as a pandemic, has prompted governments and regulatory bodies throughout the world to issue “stay-at-home” or similar orders, and enact restrictions on the performance of “non-essential” services, public gatherings and travel.
Beginning in March 2020, we undertook precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of virus transmission to our employees, including the establishment of remote working standards, pausing all non-essential travel worldwide for our employees, and limiting employee attendance at industry events and in-person work-related meetings, to the extent those events and meetings are continuing. We also established policies and procedures for all personnel who enter our company premises. The policies and procedures we implemented are consistent with the rules and guidelines recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the City of Cambridge. To date, we do not believe these actions have had a significant negative impact on our productivity or our operations. However, these actions or additional measures we may undertake may ultimately delay progress of our developmental goals or otherwise negatively affect our business. In addition, third-party actions taken to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and mitigate public health effects may negatively affect our business.
In January 2021, we were notified by our contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, that the manufacture of our cGMP material for the CUE-102 drug candidate would be delayed by approximately six weeks due to the invocation of the Defense Production Act, or DPA, which gives priority to the manufacture of vaccines and other drug products used to prevent or treat COVID-19. The delay in the manufacturing of our CUE-102 cGMP batch impacted the expected filing date of the CUE-102 IND that was planned for the fourth quarter of 2021. The CUE-102 IND is now expected to be filed in the first quarter of 2022 based on the revised CUE-102 cGMP manufacturing date provided by our CMO.
Plan of Operation
Our technology is in the development phase. We believe that our licensed platforms have the potential for creating a diverse pipeline of drug product candidates addressing multiple medical indications. We intend to maximize the value and probability of commercialization of our Immuno-STAT drug product candidates by focusing on research, testing, optimization, conducting pilot studies, performing early stage clinical development and potentially partnering for more extensive, later stages of clinical development, as well as seeking extensive patent protection and intellectual property development.
Since we are a development-stage company, the majority of our business activities to date and our planned future activities will be devoted to furthering research and development.
A fundamental part of our corporate development strategy is to establish one or more strategic partnerships with leading pharmaceutical or biotechnology organizations that will allow us to more fully exploit the potential of our technology platform, such as those described below under the headings “Collaboration Agreement with Merck” and “Collaboration with LG Chem”.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, and the reported revenue and expenses during the reported periods. We evaluate these estimates and judgments, including those described below, on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, contractual milestones and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While the Company’s significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K, we believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the following accounting policies may have the greatest potential impact on the financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. There were no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as of December 31, 2020.
Revenue Recognition
We follow the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. We generate revenue solely through collaboration arrangements with strategic partners for the development and commercialization of drug product candidates. The core principle of ASC 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods and/or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and/or services. To determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized for arrangements that we determine are within the scope of ASC 606, we perform the following steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied.
We recognize collaboration revenue under certain of our license or collaboration agreements that are within the scope of ASC 606. Our contracts with customers typically include promises related to licenses to intellectual property and research and development services. If the license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenue from non-refundable, up-front fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the licensee and the licensee is able to use and benefit from the license. For licenses that are bundled with other promises, we utilize judgement to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue from non-refundable, up-front fees. Accordingly, the transaction price is generally comprised of a fixed fee due at contract inception and variable consideration in the form of milestone payments due upon the achievement of specified events and tiered royalties earned when customers recognize net sales of licensed products. We measure the transaction price based on the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods and/or services to the customer. We utilize the “most likely amount” method to estimate the amount of variable consideration, to predict the amount of consideration to which we will be entitled for our two open contracts. Amounts of variable consideration are included in the transaction price to the extent that it is probable
that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. At the inception of each arrangement that includes development and regulatory milestone payments, we evaluate whether the associated event is considered probable of achievement and estimates the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. Currently, we have one contract with an option to acquire additional goods and/or services in the form of additional research and development services for additional drug product candidates.
Research and Development Costs
Research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation costs, fees paid to consultants, outside service providers and organizations (including research institutes at universities), facility costs, and development and clinical trial costs with respect to our drug product candidates.
Research and development expenses incurred under contracts are expensed ratably over the life of the underlying contracts, unless the achievement of milestones, the completion of contracted work, or other information indicates that a different pattern of expense recognition is more appropriate. Other research and development expenses are charged to operations as incurred. Payments made pursuant to research and development contracts are initially recorded as research and development contract advances in our balance sheet and then charged to research and development expenses in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as those contract services are performed. Expenses incurred under research and development contracts in excess of amounts advanced are recorded as research and development contract liabilities in our balance sheet, with a corresponding charge to research and development expenses in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
Nonrefundable advance payments for future research and development activities pursuant to an executory contractual arrangement are recorded as advances as described above. Nonrefundable advance payments are recognized as an expense as the related services are performed. We evaluate whether we expect the services to be rendered at each quarter end and year end reporting date. If we do not expect the services to be rendered, the advance payment is charged to expense. To the extent that a nonrefundable advance payment is for contracted services to be performed within 12 months from the reporting date, such advance is included in current assets; otherwise, such advance is included in non-current assets.
We evaluate the status of our research and development agreements and contracts, and the carrying amount of the related assets and liabilities, at each quarter end and year end reporting date, and adjusts the carrying amounts and their classification on the balance sheet as appropriate.
Stock-Based Compensation
We periodically issue stock-based awards to officers, directors, employees, Scientific and Clinical Advisory Board members, non-employees and consultants for services rendered. Such issuances vest and expire according to terms established at the issuance date.
Stock-based payments to officers, directors, members of our Scientific and Clinical Advisory Board, non-employees and outside consultants and employees, including grants of employee stock options, are recognized in the financial statements based on their grant date fair values. Stock option grants, which are generally time-vested, are measured at the grant date fair value and charged to operations on a straight-line basis over the service period, which generally approximates the vesting term. We also grant performance-based awards periodically to our officers. We recognize compensation costs related to performance awards over the requisite service period if and when we conclude that it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved.
The fair value of stock options and restricted stock units is determined utilizing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which is affected by several variables, including the risk-free interest rate, the expected dividend yield, the life of the equity award, the exercise price of the stock option as compared to the fair value of the common stock on the grant date, and the estimated volatility of the common stock over the term of the equity award.
The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Until we have established a trading history for our common stock that approximates the expected term of the options, estimated volatility is based on the average historical volatilities of comparable public companies in a similar industry. The expected dividend yield is based on the current yield at the grant date; we have never declared or paid dividends and have no plans to do so for the foreseeable future. As permitted by Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, due to our lack of history and option activity, we utilize the simplified method to estimate the expected term of options at the date of grant. The fair value of common stock is determined by reference to either recent or anticipated cash transactions involving the sale of our common stock.
We recognize the fair value of stock-based compensation in general and administrative expenses and in research and development expenses in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, depending on the type of services provided by the recipient of the equity award. We issue new shares of common stock to satisfy stock option exercises.
Income Taxes
We account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Accordingly, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected impact of differences between the financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities.
We account for uncertainties in income tax law under a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns as prescribed by GAAP. The tax effects of a position are recognized only if it is “more-likely-than-not” to be sustained by the taxing authority as of the reporting date. If the tax position is not considered “more-likely-than-not” to be sustained, then no benefits of the position are recognized.
We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be credited to operations in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to operations in the period such determination was made.
We are subject to U.S. federal and Massachusetts state income taxes. As our net operating losses have yet to be utilized, all previous tax years remain open to examination by federal and state taxing authorities in which we currently operate.
We recognize interest accrued relative to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expense.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
A discussion of recent accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Significant Contracts and Agreements Related to Research and Development Activities
Einstein License Agreement
On January 14, 2015, we entered into a license agreement, as amended and restated on July 31, 2017 and as amended on October 30, 2018, or the Einstein License, with Albert Einstein College of Medicine, or Einstein, for certain patent rights relating to our core technology platform for the engineering of biologics to control T cell activity, precision, immune-modulatory drug candidates, and two supporting technologies that enable the discovery of costimulatory signaling molecules (ligands) and T cell targeting peptides.
We hold an exclusive worldwide license, with the right to sublicense, import, make, have made, use, provide, offer to sell, and sell all products, processes and services that use the patents covered by the Einstein License, including certain technology received from Einstein related thereto, or the Licensed Products. Under the Einstein License, we are required to:
•
Pay royalties and amounts based on certain percentage of proceeds, as defined in the Einstein License, from sales of Licensed Products and sublicense agreements.
•
Pay escalating annual maintenance fees, which are non-refundable, but are creditable against the amount due to Einstein for royalties.
•
Make significant payments based upon the achievement of certain milestones, as defined in the Einstein License. At December 31, 2020, one of these milestones had been achieved, as we had filed an investigational new drug application, or IND, in 2019.
•
Incur minimum product development costs per year until the first commercial sale of the first Licensed Product.
We were in compliance with our obligations under the Einstein License at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
The Einstein License expires upon the expiration of the last obligation to make royalty payments to Einstein which may be due with respect to certain Licensed Products, unless terminated earlier under the provisions thereof. The Einstein License includes certain termination provisions if we fail to meet our obligations thereunder.
We account for the costs incurred in connection with the Einstein License in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, costs incurred with respect to the Einstein License aggregated $75,000 and $565,659, respectively. Such costs are included in research and development costs in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
Pursuant to the Einstein License, we issued to Einstein 671,572 shares of our common stock in connection with the consummation of the initial public offering of our common stock on December 27, 2017.
See “Our License Agreement with Einstein” under Part I, Item 1 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion of the Einstein License.
Collaboration Agreement with Merck
On November 14, 2017, we entered into an Exclusive Patent License and Research Collaboration Agreement, or the Merck Agreement, with Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., or Merck, for a partnership to research and develop certain of our proprietary biologics that target certain autoimmune disease indications, or the Initial Indications. We view the Merck Agreement as a component of our development strategy since it will allow us to advance our autoimmune programs in partnership with a world class pharmaceutical company, while also continuing our focus on our more advanced cancer programs. The research program outlined in the Merck Agreement entails (1) our research, discovery and development of certain Immuno-STAT drug candidates up to the point of demonstration of certain biologically relevant effects, or Proof of Mechanism, and (2) the further development by Merck of the Immuno-STAT drug candidates that have demonstrated Proof of Mechanism, or the Proposed Drug Product Candidates, up to the point of demonstration of all or substantially all of the properties outlined in such Proposed Drug Product Candidates’ profiles as described in the Merck Agreement.
For the purposes of this collaboration, we granted to Merck under the Merck Agreement an exclusive license under certain of our patent rights, including a sublicense of patent rights licensed from Einstein, to the extent applicable to the specific Immuno-STAT that are elected to be developed by Merck. So long as Merck continues product development on a Proposed Drug Product Candidate, we are restricted from conducting any development activities within the Initial Indication covered by such Proposed Drug Product Candidate other than pursuant to the Merck Agreement.
In exchange for the licenses and other rights granted to Merck under the Merck Agreement, Merck paid to us a $2.5 million nonrefundable up-front payment. Additionally, we may be eligible to receive funding in developmental milestone payments, as well as tiered royalties, if all research, development, regulatory and commercial milestones agreed upon by both parties are successfully achieved. Excluding the up-front payment described above, we are eligible to earn up to $101 million for the achievement of certain research and development milestones, $120 million for the achievement of certain regulatory milestones and $150 million for the achievement of certain commercial milestones, in addition to tiered royalties on sales, if all pre-specified milestones associated with multiple products across the primary disease indication areas are achieved. The Merck Agreement requires us to use the first $2.5 million of milestone payments we receive under the agreement to fund contract research. The amount of the royalty payments is a percentage of product sales ranging in the single digits based on the amount of such sales. We recorded approximately $177,000 in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the Merck Agreement, compared to $874,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The term of the Merck Agreement extends until the expiration of all royalty obligations following a product candidate’s receipt of marketing authorization, at which point Merck’s licenses and sublicenses granted under the agreement shall become fully paid-up, perpetual licenses and sublicenses, as applicable. Royalties on each product subject to the Merck Agreement shall continue on a country-by-country basis until the expiration of the later of: (1) the last-to-expire patent claiming the compound on which such product is based and (2) a period of ten years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country.
On November 18, 2020, we entered into a First Amendment to the Merck Agreement, or the Amendment, with Merck. Pursuant to rights granted to Merck under the Merck Agreement, the Amendment extends the term of the research program under the Merck Agreement for an additional year, until December 31, 2021. Under the terms of the Amendment, Merck will reimburse us for specified expenses and provide additional financial research support to further study and develop preclinical biologics with the objective of identifying clinical candidates subject, in each case, to specified maximum amounts, with any amounts in excess of such maximum amounts to be borne by us. On November 18, 2020, we earned a milestone payment related to this Amendment in the amount of $300,000. The $300,000 milestone payment was recorded as a contract liability upon receipt. We will recognize revenue related to this milestone payment pursuant to our revenue recognition policy in relation to the performance of our obligations related to the development of Immuno-STAT drug candidates under the arrangement.
See “Our Collaboration Agreement with Merck” under Part I, Item 1 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion of the Merck Agreement.
Collaboration Agreement with LG Chem
Effective November 6, 2018, we entered into a collaboration agreement with LG Chem, Ltd., or LG Chem, which we refer to as the LG Chem Agreement, related to the development of Immuno-STATs focused in the field of oncology.
Pursuant to the LG Chem Agreement, we granted LG Chem an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize our lead product, CUE-101, as well as Immuno-STATs that target T cells against two additional cancer antigens, or Drug Product Candidates, in Australia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia, China (including Macau and Hong Kong) and Taiwan, which we refer to collectively as the LG Chem Territory. On December 20, 2018, we reported the selection of Wilms Tumor 1, or WT1, as the first target antigen for a Product Candidate under the LG Chem Agreement. We retain rights to develop and commercialize all assets included in the LG Chem Agreement in the United States and in global markets outside of the LG Chem Territory. Under the LG Chem Agreement, we will engineer the selected Immuno-STATs for up to three alleles, which are expected to include the predominant alleles in the LG Chem Territory, thereby enhancing our market reach by providing for greater patient coverage of populations in global markets, while LG Chem will establish a chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, process for the development and commercialization of selected Drug Product Candidates. The LG Chem Agreement provided LG Chem with the option to select one additional Immuno-STAT for an oncology target, or an Additional Immuno-STAT, for an exclusive worldwide development and commercialization license. On December 18, 2019, we and LG Chem entered into a global license and commercialization agreement, which was amended on November 5, 2020. We refer to such agreement, as amended, as the Global License and Collaboration Agreement. The Global License and Collaboration Agreement supersedes the provisions of the LG Chem Agreement related to LG Chem’s option for an Additional Immuno-STAT but generally does not become effective unless and until LG Chem exercises its option, other than certain select provisions including the length of the option period and representations, warranties and covenants of the parties. If LG Chem exercises this option, which expires on April 30, 2021, then the other provisions of the Global License and Collaboration Agreement, including the license to the Additional Immuno-STAT from us to LG Chem and the terms and conditions for such license, will become effective. We will retain an option to co-develop and co-commercialize the additional program worldwide.
Under the terms of the LG Chem Agreement, LG Chem paid us a $5.0 million non-refundable, non-creditable upfront payment and purchased approximately $5.0 million of shares of our common stock at a price per share equal to a 20% premium to the volume weighted-average closing price per share over the 30 trading day period immediately prior to the effective date of the LG Chem Agreement. We are also eligible to receive additional aggregate payments of approximately $400 million if certain research, development, regulatory and commercial milestones are successfully achieved. On May 16, 2019, we earned a $2.5 million milestone payment for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA’s, acceptance of the IND for our lead drug candidate, CUE-101, pursuant to the LG Chem Agreement. In addition, the LG Chem Agreement also provides that LG Chem will pay us tiered single-digit royalties on net sales of commercialized Drug Product Candidates, or Collaboration Products, in the LG Chem Territory on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the later of expiration of patent rights in a country, the expiration of regulatory exclusivity in such country, or ten years after the first commercial sale of a Collaboration Product in such country, subject to certain royalty step-down provisions set forth in the LG Chem Agreement. On December 7, 2020, we earned a $1.25 million milestone payment on the selection of a pre-clinical candidate pursuant to the LG Chem Agreement. The $1.25 million milestone payment was recorded as a contract liability upon receipt. We will recognize revenue related to this milestone payment pursuant to our revenue recognition policy in relation to the performance of our obligations related to the development of the selected pre-clinical candidate under the arrangement.
Pursuant to the LG Chem Agreement, the parties will share research costs related to Collaboration Products, and LG Chem will provide CMC process development for selected Drug Product Candidates and potentially additional downstream manufacturing capabilities, including clinical and commercial supply for Collaboration Products. In return for performing CMC process development, LG Chem is eligible to receive low-single digit royalty payments on the sales of Collaboration Products sold in all countries outside the LG Chem Territory. Furthermore, should LG Chem exercise its option for an Additional Immuno-STAT, LG Chem will pay us a one-time, non-refundable, non-creditable upfront payment and we will be eligible to receive up to approximately $470 to $675 million in fees and milestone payments as well as tiered royalty payments on future global sales that range from high-single digits to mid-double digit teens in the United States and mid-single to low-double digits outside of the United States. The amount of fees and milestone payments, as well as whether we receive royalty payments, will depend on when LG Chem nominates the Additional Immuno-STAT Biologic, the number of alleles selected by LG Chem and whether we exercise our option to co-develop and co-commercialize the additional program worldwide, in which case we would share costs and profits instead of receiving royalties and post-option-exercise milestones. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized approximately $2,978,000 and $2,584,000, respectively, in collaboration revenue related to this agreement.
See “Our Collaboration Agreement with LG Chem” under Part I, Item 1 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion of the LG Chem Agreement.
Results of Operations
Collaboration Revenue
We have not generated commercial revenue from product sales. To date, we have generated collaboration revenue from the Merck Agreement and LG Chem Agreement.
Operating Expenses
We generally recognize operating expenses as they are incurred in two general categories, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses. Our operating expenses also include non-cash components related to depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, trademark, and stock-based compensation, which are allocated, as appropriate, to general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses.
General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses for executive, legal, finance, human resources, information technology and administrative personnel, as well as professional fees, insurance costs, and other general corporate expenses. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase in future periods as we add personnel and incur additional expenses related to an expansion of our research and development activities and our operation as a public company, including higher legal, accounting, insurance, compliance, compensation and other expenses.
Research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation expenses, fees paid to consultants, outside service providers and organizations (including research institutes at universities), facility expenses, and development and clinical trial expenses with respect to our drug product candidates. We charge research and development expenses to operations as they are incurred. We expect research and development expenses to increase in the future as we increase our efforts to develop technology for potential future products based on our technology and research.
Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, as discussed herein are presented below.
Collaboration Revenue
Collaboration revenue totaled $3,154,325 and $3,458,331 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. This decrease was due to a revised estimate of our progress under the LG Chem Agreement during the year ended December 31, 2020, which resulted in a decrease to collaboration revenue of approximately $47,000 during the fourth quarter of 2020. Upon the preclinical candidate selection of A02 Allele pursuant to the LG Chem Agreement, we reimbursed LG Chem final costs of approximately $68,000 related to the termination of the A24 Allele funding. We also recorded a decrease to collaboration revenue of approximately $79,000 during the fourth quarter of 2020 related to the Merck Amendment, which extended the term and revised budgeted costs for an additional year through December 31, 2021.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses totaled approximately $14,651,000 and $12,740,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. This increase of approximately $1,911,000 was due primarily to higher stock-based compensation related to executive management and legal fees offset by a decrease in travel expenses as the COVID-19 pandemic continued to hamper business travel throughout 2020. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to expand our operations. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 included expenses related to employee and board compensation of $3,875,000, professional and consulting fees of $4,483,000, rent of $1,082,000, insurance of $256,000, stock-based compensation of $4,094,000, investor relations of $275,000, travel of $31,000, depreciation and amortization of $97,000, and other expenses of $458,000.
General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 included expenses related to employee and board compensation of approximately $3,547,000, professional and consulting fees of $4,663,000, rent of $965,000, insurance of $448,000, stock-based compensation of $2,109,000, investor relations of $200,000, travel of $179,000, depreciation and amortization of $115,000, and other expenses of $514,000.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses totaled approximately $33,546,000 and $27,487,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. This increase of approximately $6,059,000 was due primarily to higher laboratory and drug substance manufacturing costs, stock-based compensation expense and clinical expenses, offset by a decrease in travel expenses as the COVID-19 pandemic continued to hamper business travel. We expect our research and development expenses to continue to increase as we expand our development activities. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 included expenses related to employee and Scientific and Clinical Advisory Board compensation of $7,886,000, depreciation and amortization of $960,000, stock-based compensation of $6,387,000, research and laboratory expenses of $8,420,000, rent of $3,511,000, licensing fees of $99,000, other professional fees of $531,000, clinical expenses of $4,264,000, travel of $27,000, insurance expense of $666,000, and other expenses of $795,000.
Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 included expenses related to employee and Scientific and Clinical Advisory Board compensation of $6,997,000, depreciation and amortization of $885,000, stock-based compensation of $4,412,000, research and laboratory expenses of $6,500,000, rent of $3,509,000, licensing fees of $658,000, other professional fees of $1,271,000, clinical expenses of $2,053,000, travel of $128,000, insurance expense of $234,000, and other expenses of $840,000.
Interest Income
Interest income was $463,914 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $482,790 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in interest income was from higher amortization of discounts received on certain of our marketable securities offset by interest income earned on the investment of an increased portion of our cash in cash equivalents and marketable securities during 2020. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 included $80,110 in expense resulting from amortization of discounts received on certain of our marketable securities, compared to $64,078 of other income for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Foreign Withholding Taxes
Provision for income tax for the year ended December 31, 2020 was comprised of $206,250 in foreign income tax expense on the LG Chem milestone payment, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 comprised of $412,500.
Net Loss
As a result of the foregoing, our net loss was $44,784,921 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $36,698,957 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We have financed our working capital requirements primarily through private and public offerings of equity securities and cash received from Merck and LG Chem under their respective collaboration agreements. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $84,868,683 and $59,409,955, respectively, available to fund our ongoing business activities. Additional information concerning our financial condition and results of operations is provided in the financial statements included in this report.
The amounts that we actually spend for any specific purpose may vary significantly and will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our research and development activities and programs, clinical testing, regulatory approval, market conditions, and changes in or revisions to our business strategy and technology development plans.
On January 4, 2019, we filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, or the 2019 Shelf, to register for sale from time to time up to $150 million of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and/or units in one or more offerings (File No. 333-229140). This registration statement became effective on February 3, 2019.
In June 2019, we entered into an “at-the-market”, or ATM, equity offering sales agreement, or the June 2019 Sales Agreement, with Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc., or Stifel, to sell shares of our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of up to $30 million, from time to time, through an “at-the-market” equity offering program under which Stifel acts as sales agent. As of December 31, 2020, we had sold a total of 3,584,945 shares of common stock under the June 2019 Sales Agreement for proceeds of approximately $29.4 million, net of commissions paid, but excluding estimated transaction expenses. Due to the issuance and sale of all the shares of common stock subject thereto, the June 2019 Sales Agreement terminated in accordance with its terms.
In November 2019, we entered into an ATM equity offering sales agreement, or the November 2019 Sales Agreement, with Stifel to sell shares of our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of up to $20 million, from time to time, through an “at-the-market” equity offering program under which Stifel acts as sales agent. As of December 31, 2020, we had sold a total of 1,729,110 shares of common stock under the November 2019 Sales Agreement for proceeds of approximately $19.6 million, net of commissions paid, but excluding estimated transaction expenses. Due to the issuance and sale of all the shares of common stock subject thereto, the November 2019 Sales Agreement terminated in accordance with its terms.
In March 2020, we entered into an ATM equity offering sales agreement, or the March 2020 Sales Agreement, with Stifel to sell shares of our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of up to $35 million, from time to time, through an “at-the-market” equity offering program under which Stifel acts as sales agent. As of December 31, 2020, we had sold a total of 1,824,901 shares of common stock under the March 2020 Sales Agreement for proceeds of approximately $34.3 million, net of commissions paid, but excluding estimated transaction expenses. Due to the issuance and sale of all the shares of common stock subject thereto, the March 2020 Sales Agreement terminated in accordance with its terms.
The shares of common stock sold under the June 2019 Sales Agreement, November 2019 Sales Agreement and the March 2020 Sales Agreement were made pursuant to the 2019 Shelf.
On June 22, 2020, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3ASR, which became automatically effective upon filing with the SEC (File No. 333-239357), or the 2020 Shelf, to register for sale from time to time up to $300 million of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, rights and/or units in one or more offerings.
In June 2020, we entered into an ATM equity offering sales agreement, or the June 2020 Sales Agreement, with Stifel to sell shares of our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of up to $40 million, from time to time, through an “at-the-market” equity offering program under which Stifel acts as sales agent. The sales agreement will terminate upon the earliest of (a) the sale of $40 million of shares of our common stock or (b) the termination of the June 2020 Sales Agreement by us or Stifel. As of December 31, 2020, we had sold 1,192,000 shares of common stock under the June 2020 Sales Agreement for proceeds of approximately $22.4 million, net of commissions paid, but excluding estimated transaction expenses. The shares of common stock sold under the June 2020 Sales Agreement are made pursuant to the 2020 Shelf.
If we issue additional equity securities to raise funds, the ownership percentage of our existing stockholders would be reduced. New investors may demand rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock. If we issue debt securities, we may be required to grant security interests in our assets, could have substantial debt service obligations, and lenders may have a senior position (compared to stockholders) in any potential future bankruptcy or liquidation. Additionally, corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, give up certain rights relating to our intellectual property and research and development activities, increase our near- and long-term expenditures, issue securities that dilute our existing stockholders, issue debt which may require liens on our assets and which will increase our monthly expense obligations, or disrupt our management and business.

Funding Requirements
We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue the research and development of our Immuno-STAT platform, continue ongoing and initiate new clinical trials of and seek marketing approval for our drug product candidates. In addition, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. Our expenses will also increase if, and as, we:
•
continue the clinical development of CUE-101;
•
leverage our programs to advance our other drug product candidates into preclinical and clinical development;
•
seek regulatory approvals for any drug product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;
•
seek to discover and develop additional drug product candidates;
•
establish a sales, marketing, medical affairs and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any drug product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval and intend to commercialize on our own or jointly;
•
hire additional clinical, quality control and scientific personnel;
•
expand our manufacturing, operational, financial and management systems;
•
increase personnel, including personnel to support our clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization efforts and our operations as a public company;
•
maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;
•
acquire or in-license other drug product candidates and technologies; and
•
incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses in operating as a public company.
We believe that our existing cash resources as of December 31, 2020 will enable us to fund our operating requirements for at least the next 12 months. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect.
We will need to raise additional capital or incur indebtedness to continue to fund our operations in the future. Our ability to raise additional funds will depend on financial, economic and market conditions, many of which are outside of our control, and we may be unable to raise financing when needed, or on terms favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development or future commercialization efforts, or grant rights to develop and market drug product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves, which could adversely affect our business prospects, and we may be unable to continue our operations. Because of numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of drug product candidates, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our working capital requirements. Factors that may affect our planned future capital requirements and accelerate our need for additional working capital include the following:
•
the progress, timing, scope and costs of our clinical trials, including the ability to timely enroll patients in our planned and potential future clinical trials;
•
the outcome, timing and cost of regulatory approvals by the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities, including the potential that the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities may require that we perform more studies than those that we currently expect;
•
the number and characteristics of drug product candidates that we may in-license and develop;
•
our ability to successfully commercialize our drug product candidates;
•
the amount of sales and other revenues from drug product candidates that we may commercialize, if any, including the selling prices for such potential products and the availability of adequate third-party reimbursement;
•
selling and marketing costs associated with our potential products, including the cost and timing of expanding our marketing and sales capabilities;
•
the terms and timing of any potential future collaborations, licensing or other arrangements that we may establish;
•
cash requirements of any future acquisitions and/or the development of other drug product candidates;
•
the costs of operating as a public company;
•
the cost and timing of completion of commercial-scale, outsourced manufacturing activities;
•
the time and cost necessary to respond to technological and market developments;
•
any disputes which may occur between us and Einstein, employees, collaborators or other prospective business partners; and
•
the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights.
A change in the outcome of any of these or other variables with respect to the development of any of our drug product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. Further, our operating plans may change in the future, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements associated with such operating plans.
Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic partnerships or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties and grants from organizations and foundations. If we raise additional funds by selling shares of our common stock or other equity-linked securities, the ownership interest of our current stockholders will be diluted. We may seek to access the public or private capital markets whenever conditions are favorable, even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or drug product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be acceptable to us. If we raise additional funds through debt financing, we may have to grant a security interest on our assets to the future lenders, our debt service costs may be substantial, and the lenders may have a preferential position in connection with any future bankruptcy or liquidation.
If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, we may be required to curtail the development of our technology or materially curtail or reduce our operations. We could be forced to sell or dispose of our rights or assets. Any inability to raise adequate funds on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition, including the possibility that a lack of funds could cause our business to fail, dissolve and liquidate with little or no return to investors.
Principal Commitments
Leased Facilities
On January 18, 2018, we entered into an operating lease agreement for our laboratory and office space in Cambridge, Massachusetts for the period from May 1, 2018 through April 30, 2021, or the Laboratory and Office Lease. The lease contains escalating payments during the lease period. Upon execution of this lease agreement, we prepaid three months of rent, two of which will be held in escrow and credited against future rent payments and the other of which was applied to the first month’s rent. We also prepaid seven and one half months’ rent pursuant to an amendment to the lease agreement executed on June 18, 2018. We record monthly rent expense on a straight-line basis, equal to the total of the lease payments over the lease term divided by the number of months of the lease term.
On June 18, 2018, we entered into an amendment to the Laboratory and Office Lease that provide us with a reduction in rental fees for our office and laboratory space in exchange for prepayment of a portion of the fees. This amendment was effective beginning on May 15, 2018 and expires on April 14, 2021. The monthly rent payment due under the Laboratory and Office Lease is currently $330,550 until April 2021 and will increase to $375,174 for the remainder of the term.
On September 20, 2018, we entered into an operating lease for additional laboratory space at 21 Erie Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts for the period from October 15, 2018 through April 14, 2021, or the Additional Laboratory Lease. The lease contains escalating payments during the lease period. The monthly rental rate under the Additional Laboratory Lease was $72,600 for the first 12 months and $78,600 for the remainder of the term. Upon execution of this lease agreement, we prepaid 12 months’ rent pursuant to the lease agreement executed on September 20, 2018.
On September 19, 2019, we entered into a second amendment to the Additional Laboratory Lease that removed one holding room from the additional laboratory space. The amendment was effective beginning on October 1, 2019 and expires on April 14, 2021. The monthly rental rate under the Additional Laboratory Lease decreased from $78,600 to $58,995 for the remainder of the lease term.
On June 24, 2020, we entered into a second amendment to the Laboratory and Office Lease. Pursuant to the amendment (1) the term of the lease was extended to June 14, 2022 and (2) the monthly rental rate for the last 14 months of the lease term was increased to $375,174. We determined that the amendment should be accounted for as a lease modification under Accounting Standards Codification 842, Leases, or ASC 842, not as a separate contract, with an effective date of lease modification of May 14, 2020. At the effective date of modification, we recorded an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and lease liability in the amount of approximately $4,826,000.
On July 20, 2020, we entered into a third amendment to the Additional Laboratory Lease. Pursuant to the amendment the term of the lease was extended to June 14, 2022. We determined that the amendment should be accounted for as a lease modification under ASC 842, not as a separate contract, with an effective date of lease modification of August 4, 2020, when the agreement was fully executed. At the effective date of modification, we recorded an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and lease liability in the amount of approximately $813,000.
