Net Loss
The net loss for the year ended September 30, 2020 was $53,496 compared to $10,464 for the year ended September 30, 2019.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company’s ability to raise additional capital and implement its business plan. Since its inception, the Company has been funded by related parties through capital investment and borrowing of funds.
At September 30, 2020, the Company had total current assets of $79,216 compared to $403 at September 30, 2019. Current assets consisted primarily of cash. At September 30, 2020, the Company had total current liabilities of $135,206 compared to $2,897 at September 30, 2019. Current liabilities consisted primarily of the accrued expenses, due to related party. The increase in our current liabilities was attributed to the increase in amounts owed to related party.
We had negative working capital of $55,990 as of September 30, 2020.
Cash flow from Operating Activities
During the year ended September 30, 2020, cash used in operating activities was $56,858 compared to $9,667 for the year ended September 30, 2019. The increase in the amounts of cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the increase in general and administrative expenses of $32,132.
Cash flow from Financing Activities
For the year ended September 30, 2020, cash provided by financing activity was $132,111 compared to $0 provided during the year ended September 30, 2019.
Going Concern
We have not attained profitable operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to pursue any extensive activities. For these reasons, our auditors stated in their report on our audited financial statements that they have substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern without further financing.
The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs for the next fiscal year and allow it to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. As of September 30, 2020, the Company has a net loss of $53,496, and if the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations.
