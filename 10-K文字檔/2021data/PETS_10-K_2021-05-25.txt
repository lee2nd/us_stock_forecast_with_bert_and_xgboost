ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Executive Summary
PetMed Express was incorporated in the state of Florida in January 1996. The Company’s common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “PETS.” The Company began selling pet medications and other pet health products in September 1996. In March 2010, the Company started offering for sale additional pet supplies on its website, and these items are drop shipped to customers by third party vendors. Presently, the Company’s product line includes approximately 3,000 of the most popular pet medications, health products, and supplies for dogs, cats, and horses.
The Company markets its products through national advertising campaigns which aim to increase the recognition of the “1-800-PetMeds” brand name, and “PetMeds” family of trademarks, increase traffic on its website at www.1800petmeds.com, acquire new customers, and maximize repeat purchases. Approximately 84% of all sales were generated via the Internet in both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020. The twelve-month average purchase was approximately $89 per order for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, compared to $87 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and the results of our operations contained herein are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements and the data used to prepare them. The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. On an ongoing basis we re-evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to product returns, bad debts, inventories, and income taxes. We base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience, knowledge of current conditions, and our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering available information. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our estimates are guided by observing the following critical accounting policies.
Revenue recognition
The Company generates revenue by selling pet medication products and pet supplies mainly to retail customers. Certain pet supplies offered on the Company’s website are drop shipped to customers. The Company considers itself the principal in the arrangement because the Company controls the specified good before it is transferred to the customer. Revenue contracts contain one performance obligation, which is delivery of the product; customer care and support is deemed not to be a material right to the contract. The transaction price is adjusted at the date of sale for any applicable sales discounts and an estimate of product returns, which are estimated based on historical patterns; however, this is not considered a key judgment. There are no amounts excluded from variable consideration. Revenue is recognized when control transfers to the customer at the point in time in which the shipment of the product occurs. This key judgment is determined as the shipping point represents the point in time in which the Company has a present right to payment, title has transferred to the customer, and the customer has assumed the risks and rewards of ownership.
Outbound shipping and handling fees are an accounting policy election, and are included in sales as the Company considers itself the principal in the arrangement given responsibility for supplier selection and discretion over pricing. Shipping costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are an accounting policy election and are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of sales. Virtually all of the Company’s sales are paid by credit cards and the Company usually receives the cash settlement in two to three banking days. Credit card sales minimize accounts receivable balances relative to sales.
The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses that the Company estimates will arise from customers’ inability to make required payments, arising from either credit card charge-backs or insufficient funds checks. The Company determines its estimates of the un-collectability of accounts receivable by analyzing historical bad debts and current economic trends. The allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $39,000 at March 31, 2021 compared to $59,000 at March 31, 2020.
Valuation of inventory
Inventories consist of prescription and non-prescription pet medications and pet supplies that are available for sale and are priced at the lower of cost or net realizable value using a weighted average cost method. The Company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence. The inventory reserve was approximately $86,000 and $45,000 at March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Advertising
The Company's advertising expense consists primarily of Internet marketing, direct mail/print, and television advertising. Internet costs are expensed in the month incurred and direct mail/print advertising costs are expensed when the related brochures and postcards are produced, distributed, or superseded. Television advertising costs are expensed as the advertisements are televised.
Accounting for income taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of ASC Topic 740, (“Accounting for Income Taxes”), which generally requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax benefits or consequences of events that have been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting carrying values and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, and are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws for the taxable years in which those differences are expected to reverse.
Results of Operations
The following should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere herein. The following table sets forth, as a percentage of sales, certain operating data appearing in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income:
Fiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020
COVID-19
We are dedicated to making every effort to ensure our customers’ pets receive the medications they need. We are also dedicated to making every effort to ensure the health and safety of our employees. We have continued with working from home where possible and enhanced disinfection and social distancing within our work place. The Company has been open during our normal business hours without any material disruptions to our operations. We have not seen any major disruptions in our supply chain, however we have experienced some delays in the delivery of some inventory items. See risk factor “The outbreak of the COVID-19 global pandemic and related government, private sector and individual consumer responsive actions may adversely affect our business operations, employee availability, financial performance, liquidity and cash flow for an unknown period of time” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
Sales
Sales increased by approximately $25.1 million, or 8.8%, to $309.2 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, from approximately $284.1 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. The increase in sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 was primarily due to increased reorder sales and new order sales. Fiscal 2021 started out with greater than expected e-commerce demand due to COVID-19, with consumers shifting their purchases to online, which positively impacted our reorder and new order sales during the year. In the latter half of fiscal 2021, veterinarian clinics and retail stores re-opened. The Company acquired approximately 443,000 new customers for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, compared to approximately 421,000 new customers for the same period the prior year. The following chart illustrates sales by various sales classifications:
Going forward sales may be adversely affected due to increased competition and consumers giving more consideration to price. The changes in consumer behavior post pandemic makes future sales somewhat challenging to predict. No guarantees can be made that sales will continue to grow in the future. The majority of our product sales are affected by the seasons, due to the seasonality of mainly heartworm, and flea and tick medications. For the quarters ended June 30, September 30, December 31, and March 31 of fiscal 2021, the Company’s sales were approximately 31%, 25%, 21%, and 23%, respectively. For the quarters ended June 30, September 30, December 31, and March 31 of fiscal 2020, the Company’s sales were approximately 28%, 25%, 21%, and 26%, respectively.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales increased by approximately $16.4 million, or 8.1% to $219.3 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, from $202.9 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. The cost of sales increase can be directly related to the increase in sales during fiscal 2021. As a percentage of sales, cost of sales was 70.9% in fiscal 2021, as compared to 71.4% in fiscal 2020. The cost of sales percentage decrease can be attributed to the benefit of having direct relationships with all major manufacturers, which helped reduce product costs, and these manufacturers having minimum advertised price policies. In the future, cost of sales may be adversely impacted due to the major manufacturers shifting their rebate funding from discounting product costs to cooperative marketing rebates.
Gross profit
Gross profit increased by approximately $8.7 million, or 10.7%, to $89.9 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, from $81.2 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. The increase in gross profit can be directly related to the increase in sales during fiscal 2021. Gross profit as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2021 was 29.1% compared to 28.6% for fiscal 2020. The increase in gross profit percentage can be attributed to the benefit of having direct relationships with all major manufacturers, which helped reduce product costs, and these manufacturers having minimum advertised price policies. Going forward gross profit may be adversely affected due to increased competition and consumers giving more consideration to price. In the future, gross profit may also be adversely impacted due to the major manufacturers shifting their rebate funding from discounting product costs to cooperative marketing rebates.
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses increased by approximately $3.0 million, or 12.0%, to $28.3 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 from $25.3 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 was primarily due to the following: a $1.9 million increase in payroll expenses, due to increased sales and increased COVID-19 related work from home expenses, with $485,000 related to increased stock compensation expense due to the accelerated vesting of the Company’s former Chairman Robert Schweitzer’s unvested restricted stock upon his passing on February 23, 2021; a $619,000 increase in bank service fees due to increased sales; a $388,000 increase in property expenses related to the Company’s e-commerce platform; and a $207,000 increase in telephone expenses due to employees working from home in response to COVID-19. Offsetting the increase was a net decrease of $48,000 to other expenses which include insurance, professional fees, and bad debt expense. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was 9.1% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, compared to 8.9% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020.
Advertising expenses
Advertising expenses decreased by approximately $1.1 million to $21.6 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, from $22.7 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. The decrease in advertising expenses for fiscal 2021 was due to the Company receiving increased cooperative marketing funds from product manufacturers to offset our advertising expenses, within the terms of our contractual relationships. Overall advertising spending increased over the prior year, yet total net advertising expenses decreased due to increased cooperative advertising rebates. The advertising costs of acquiring a new customer, defined as total advertising costs divided by new customers acquired, was $49 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, compared to $54 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. The decrease to customer acquisition costs for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 can also be attributed to receiving increased cooperative marketing funds from product manufacturers. Advertising cost of acquiring a new customer can be impacted by the advertising environment, the effectiveness of our advertising creative, advertising spending, and price competition. Historically, the advertising environment fluctuates due to supply and demand. A more favorable advertising environment may positively impact future sales, whereas a less favorable advertising environment may negatively impact future sales. As a percentage of sales, advertising expense was 7.0% and 8.0% for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in advertising expense as a percentage of total sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 can be attributed to a decrease in advertising expenses and an increase in sales as compared to the same period in the prior year. The Company currently anticipates advertising as a percentage of sales to be approximately 7% for fiscal 2022. However, the advertising percentage may fluctuate quarter to quarter due to seasonality and advertising availability.
Depreciation
Depreciation expense for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 increased slightly to approximately $2.4 million from $2.3 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. This increase to depreciation expense for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 can be attributed to increased new property and equipment additions in fiscal 2021.
Other income
Other income decreased by approximately $1.3 million to $1.6 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, from $2.9 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. The decrease to other income was primarily related to decreased interest income due to decreased interest rates compared to the prior year. Interest income may decrease in the future as the Company utilizes its cash balances on its share repurchase plan, with approximately $28.7 million remaining at March 31, 2021, on any quarterly dividend payment, on its operating activities, or with further decreases in interest rates.
Provision for income taxes
For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded an income tax provision of approximately $8.6 million and $8.0 million, respectively. The increase to the income tax provision for fiscal 2021 is related to an increase in operating income compared to fiscal 2020. The effective tax rate for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 were 22.0% and 23.7%, respectively. The decrease to the effective rate for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 can be attributed to the Company receiving a one-time state income tax refund of $285,000 in the June 2020 quarter and a $135,000 income tax benefit related to restricted stock compensation in the September 2020 and March 2021 quarters, compared to a $322,000 income tax charge related to restricted stock compensation, which was recognized in the September 2019 quarter. The Company estimates its effective tax rate will be approximately 23.5% for fiscal 2022.
Net income
Net income increased by approximately $4.7 million, or 18.4%, to approximately $30.6 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 from approximately $25.9 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. The increase to net income was primarily related to an increase in gross profit, offset by an increase in operating expenses and a decrease to interest income during the fiscal year.
Fiscal 2020 Compared to Fiscal 2019
COVID-19
As an essential business, 1-800-PetMeds has been open during our normal business hours without any material disruptions to our operations. Due to COVID-19, consumer demand has increased for the e-commerce channel with pet owners shifting their purchases to online. We are dedicated to making every effort to ensure the health and safety of our employees. We have implemented working from home where possible and enhanced disinfection and social distancing within our work place. We are also dedicated to making every effort to ensure our customers’ pets receive the medications they need. See risk factor “The recent outbreak of the COVID-19 global pandemic and related government, private sector and individual consumer responsive actions may adversely affect our business operations, employee availability, financial performance, liquidity and cash flow for an unknown period of time” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
Sales
Sales increased slightly to approximately $284.1 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, from approximately $283.4 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. The increase in sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 was primarily due to increased reorder sales, offset by decreased new order sales. The Company acquired approximately 421,000 new customers for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, compared to approximately 467,000 new customers for the same period the prior year. The following chart illustrates sales by various sales classifications:
Going forward sales may be adversely affected due to COVID-19, increased competition, and consumers giving more consideration to price. See risk factor “The recent outbreak of the COVID-19 global pandemic and related government, private sector and individual consumer responsive actions may adversely affect our business operations, employee availability, financial performance, liquidity and cash flow for an unknown period of time” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. No guarantees can be made that sales will continue to grow in the future.
The majority of our product sales are affected by the seasons, due to the seasonality of mainly flea, tick, and heartworm medications. For the quarters ended June 30, September 30, December 31, and March 31 of fiscal 2020, the Company’s sales were approximately 28%, 25%, 21%, and 26%, respectively. For the quarters ended June 30, September 30, December 31, and March 31 of fiscal 2019, the Company’s sales were approximately 31%, 25%, 21%, and 23%, respectively.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales increased by $14.8 million, or 7.9% to $202.9 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, from $188.1 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. As a percentage of sales, cost of sales was 71.4% in fiscal 2020, as compared to 66.4% in fiscal 2019. The cost of sales increase and percentage increase can be attributed to price reductions given to customers to stimulate sales in response to increased online competition, and an increase to product costs during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. One of our long-term strategic initiatives and primary purchasing goals has always been to have direct purchasing relationships with all major manufacturers, which we now have.
Gross profit
Gross profit decreased by $14.1 million, or 14.8%, to $81.2 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, from $95.3 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. Gross profit as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2020 was 28.6% compared to 33.6% for fiscal 2019. The decrease in gross profit and percentage decrease in fiscal 2020 is directly related to price reductions given to customers to stimulate sales, and an increase to product costs. We now have direct relationships with all major manufacturers and these manufacturers have minimum advertised price policies, which should cause a general price discipline in the online market. Going forward gross profit may be adversely affected due to increased competition and consumers giving more consideration to price.
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses increased by $497,000, or 2.0%, to $25.3 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 from $24.8 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 was primarily due to the following: a $361,000 increase in payroll expenses in the customer care, pharmacy, and information technology departments; a $107,000 increase to bad debt expense; and a $92,000 increase in bank service fees due to increased sales. Offsetting the increase was a net decrease of $63,000 to other expenses which include travel and professional fees. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was 8.9% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, compared to 8.7% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.
Advertising expenses
Advertising expenses increased by approximately $600,000 to approximately $22.7 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, from approximately $22.1 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. The increase in advertising expenses for fiscal 2020 was intended to stimulate sales and acquire new customers. The advertising costs of acquiring a new customer, defined as total advertising costs divided by new customers acquired, was $54 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, compared to $47 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. The increase to customer acquisition costs for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 can be attributed to increased advertising costs, primarily television advertising, and a lower-than-expected consumer response in the June 2019 and September 2019 quarters, which may be attributed to increased online competition. Advertising cost of acquiring a new customer can be impacted by the advertising environment, the effectiveness of our advertising creative, advertising spending, and price competition. Historically, the advertising environment fluctuates due to supply and demand. A more favorable advertising environment may positively impact future sales, whereas a less favorable advertising environment may negatively impact future sales.
As a percentage of sales, advertising expense was 8.0% and 7.8% for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in advertising expense as a percentage of total sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 can be mainly attributed to increased advertising to stimulate sales and acquire new customers. The Company currently anticipates advertising as a percentage of sales to be approximately 9% for fiscal 2021. However, the advertising percentage may fluctuate quarter to quarter due to seasonality and advertising availability.
Depreciation
Depreciation expense for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 increased slightly to approximately $2.3 million from approximately $2.2 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. This increase to depreciation expense for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 can be attributed to an increase in new property and equipment additions in fiscal 2020.
Other income
Other income remained relatively flat at $2.9 million for both the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019. Other income includes interest income, advertising income, and rental income. Interest income may decrease in the future as the Company utilizes its cash balances on its share repurchase plan, with approximately $28.7 million remaining at March 31, 2020, on any quarterly dividend payment, on its operating activities, or with further decreases in interest rates.
Provision for income taxes
For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded an income tax provision for approximately $8.0 million and $11.4 million, respectively. The decrease to the income tax provision for fiscal 2020 is related to a decrease in operating income, and reduction to the Florida state corporate income tax rate. The effective tax rate for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 were 23.7% and 23.2%, respectively. The increase to the effective rate for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 can be attributed to a $322,000 income tax charge related to restricted stock compensation, which was recognized in September 2019. The Company estimates its effective tax rate will be approximately 23.5% for fiscal 2021.
Net income
Net income decreased by approximately $11.9 million, or 31.5%, to approximately $25.9 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 from approximately $37.7 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. The decrease to net income was primarily related to a decrease in gross profit due to price reductions given to customers to stimulate sales, and an increase to product costs.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company’s working capital at March 31, 2021 and 2020 was approximately $116.3 million and approximately $104.7 million, respectively. The $11.6 million increase in working capital was primarily attributable to cash flow generated by operations, offset by dividends paid in the period. Net cash provided by operating activities was $40.1 million and $38.8 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. This change can be mainly attributed to an increase in the Company’s net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 and an increase to accounts payable, offset by an increase to inventory compared to the prior year. Net cash used in investing activities was $2.4 million and $2.3 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. This change in investing activities is related to increased property and equipment additions acquired in fiscal 2021. The majority of the increase in property and equipment relates primarily to the Company’s new e-commerce platform. Net cash used in financing activities was $22.7 million and $33.3 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease to financing activities relates to the Company purchasing approximately 613,000 shares of its common stock for approximately $11.5 million during fiscal 2020, compared to no share repurchases in fiscal 2021. The remaining change to financing activities related to an increase in the dividend paid in fiscal 2021, compared to the dividend paid in fiscal 2020. At March 31, 2021, the Company had approximately $28.7 million remaining under the Company’s share repurchase plan.
Subsequent to March 31, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors declared an increased quarterly dividend from $0.28 to $0.30 per share on May 3, 2021. The Board established a May 14, 2021 record date and a May 21, 2021 payment date. Depending on future market conditions the Company may utilize its cash and cash equivalents on the remaining balance of its current share repurchase plan, on quarterly dividends, or on its operating activities.
At March 31, 2021 the Company had no material outstanding lease commitments. We are not currently bound by any long or short term agreements for the purchase or lease of capital expenditures. Any material amounts expended for capital expenditures would be the result of an increase in the capacity needed to adequately provide for any future increase in our business. To date we have paid for any needed additions to our capital equipment infrastructure from working capital funds and anticipate this being the case in the future. Presently, we have approximately $2.0 million forecasted for capital expenditures in fiscal 2022, which will be funded through cash from operations. The Company’s primary source of working capital is cash from operations. The Company presently has no need for alternative sources of working capital, and has no commitments or plans to obtain additional capital.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements at March 31, 2021.
