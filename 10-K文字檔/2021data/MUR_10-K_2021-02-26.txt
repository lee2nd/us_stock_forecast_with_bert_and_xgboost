Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Murphy Oil Corporation is a worldwide oil and natural gas exploration and production company. A more detailed description of the Company’s significant assets can be found in Item 1 of this Form 10-K report.
In 2020 the continued spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to significant disruption in the global economy and an associated weakness in demand for crude oil which has resulted in lower commodity prices in 2020 versus 2019. Commodity prices at the end of the first quarter and all of the second quarter were exceptionally impacted. In the first quarter of 2020, certain major global suppliers of crude oil announced supply increases which resulted in a contribution to the lower global commodity prices in the first quarter, shortly followed by exceptional demand reduction from the COVID-19 pandemic. In the second quarter of 2020, the OPEC+ group of oil producing countries agreed to supply restrictions which helped support the oil price in the latter part of the second quarter and through the year end. Nevertheless, oil prices during 2020 remained below average 2019 prices.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and reduced commodity prices, the Company reduced 2020 capital expenditures significantly from the original plan of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion to $712 million (adjusted for comparability to exclude NCI and Kings Quay expenditures). The Company also executed a cost reduction plan for both future direct operational expenditures and general and administrative costs, including closing its headquarters office in El Dorado, Arkansas, its office in Calgary, Alberta, and consolidating all worldwide staff activities to its existing office location in Houston, Texas (see Note W - Restructuring Charges). The Company is closely monitoring the impact of lower commodity prices on its current and future financial position and is currently in compliance with the covenants related to the revolving credit facility (see Note H - Financing Arrangements and Debt). Also see the Company’s response to COVID-19 as discussed in more detail in the Risk Factors starting on page 14.
Significant Company operating and financial highlights during 2020 were as follows:
•Preserved liquidity of $1.7 billion, including $310.6 million of cash as of December 31, 2020 and $1.4 billion available on an unsecured revolving credit facility
•Realized $272.0 million as a result of commodity price risk management (forward sale fixed swaps) activities
•Maintained capital discipline with full year accrued capital expenditures of $712.1 million, excluding noncontrolling interest ($21.7 million) and King’s Quay Floating Production System (FPS) of $92.8 million (which is held for sale at the end of 2020)
•Decreased full year Selling, general and administrative costs by 40% from 2019, as a result of a Company wide restructuring
•Produced 174,636 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day (163,617 excluding noncontrolling interest, NCI)
Throughout this section, the term, ‘excluding noncontrolling interest’ or ‘excluding NCI’ refers to amounts attributable to Murphy. Unless noted, amounts include noncontrolling interest.
Murphy’s continuing operations generate revenue by producing crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGL) and natural gas in the United States, Gulf of Mexico and Canada and then selling these products to customers. The Company’s revenue is affected by the prices of crude oil, natural gas and NGL. In order to make a profit and generate cash in its exploration and production business, revenue generated from the sales of oil and natural gas produced must exceed the combined costs of producing these products, depreciation of capital expenditures, and expenses related to exploration, administration, and for capital borrowed from lending institutions and note holders.
Changes in the price of crude oil and natural gas have a significant impact on the profitability of the Company. In 2020, liquids from continuing operations represented 64% of total hydrocarbons produced on an energy equivalent basis. In 2021, the Company’s ratio of hydrocarbon production represented by liquids is expected to be 59%. If the prices for crude oil and natural gas are lower in 2021 or beyond, this will have an unfavorable impact on the Company’s operating profits. The Company, from time to time, may choose to use a variety of commodity hedge instruments to reduce commodity price risk, including forward sale fixed financial swaps and long-term fixed-price physical commodity sales.
Oil prices weakened in 2020 compared to the 2019 period. The sales price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil averaged $39.40 in 2020, $57.03 in 2019, and $64.77 in 2018. The WTI index decreased approximately 31% over the prior year as a result of decreased demand during the global downturn triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic (see Risk Factors).
The most common crude oil indices used to price the Company’s crude include WTI Houston (MEH), Heavy Louisiana Sweet (HLS), Mars and Brent.
The NYMEX natural gas price per million British Thermal Units (MMBTU) averaged $1.99 in 2020, $2.52 in 2019 and 3.12 in 2018. The 2020 NYMEX natural gas price was lower compared to the 2019 price. On an energy equivalent basis, the market continued to discount North American natural gas and NGLs compared to crude oil in 2020. Natural gas prices in North America in 2021 have thus far been above those in the comparable period in 2020.
Results of Operations
Murphy Oil’s results of operations, with associated diluted earnings per share (EPS), for the last three years are presented in the following table.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company produced 175 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (including noncontrolling interest) from continuing operations. The Company invested $826.6 million in capital expenditures (on a value of work done basis) in the year ended December 31, 2020, which included $21.7 million attributable to noncontrolling interest and $92.8 million to fund the development of the King’s Quay FPS. The Company reported net loss from continuing operations of $1,255.3 million (which includes post tax impairment charges of $854.2 million and loss attributable to noncontrolling interest of $113.7 million) for the year ended December 31, 2020.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company produced 186 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (including noncontrolling interest) from continuing operations. The Company invested $2.7 billion in capital expenditures (on a value of work done basis) for the year ended December 31, 2019, which included the LLOG acquisition of $1.2 billion. The Company reported net income from continuing operations of $188.8 million (which includes income attributable to noncontrolling interest of $103.6 million) for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Other key performance metrics
The Company uses other operational performance and income metrics to review operational performance. The table below presents Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and adjusted EBITDA. Management uses EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA internally to evaluate the Company’s operational performance and trends between periods and relative to its industry competitors. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be considered a substitute for Net income (loss) or Cash provided by operating activities as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also presented below is adjusted EBITDA per barrel of oil equivalent sold. Management uses EBITDA per barrel of oil equivalent sold to evaluate the Company’s profitability of one barrel of oil equivalent sold in the period. Adjusted EBITDA per barrel of oil equivalent sold is a non-GAAP financial metric.
Other key performance metrics (Cont’d.)
1 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense used in the computation of EBITDA excludes the portion attributable to the non-controlling interest. Impairment of assets and retirement obligation gains used in the computation of Adjusted EBITDA exclude the portion attributable to the non-controlling interest.

2020 vs 2019
All amounts include amounts attributable to a noncontrolling interest in MP GOM (a subsidiary of Murphy Expro USA, operating and developing properties in the Gulf of Mexico) and exclude discontinued operations, unless otherwise noted.
Exploration and production (E&P) continuing operations recorded a loss of $1,134.9 million in 2020 compared to earnings of $460.6 million in 2019. The results for 2020 were unfavorably impacted by impairment charges and lower oil and natural gas liquid prices and volumes, partially offset by lower depreciation and accretion expenses, general and administrative (G&A) expenses, exploration expenses and taxes. See below for further details. Based on an evaluation of expected future cash flows from properties as of December 31, 2020, the Company did not have any other significant properties with carrying values that were impaired at that date. If quoted prices decline in future periods, the lower level of projected cash flows for properties could lead to future impairment charges being recorded. The Company cannot predict the amount or timing of impairment expenses that may be recorded in the future.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and certain major global suppliers announcing crude oil supply increases in the first quarter of 2020, commodity prices were generally lower in 2020 vs 2019. Crude oil price realizations averaged $38.02 per barrel in the current year compared to $60.27 per barrel in 2019, a price decrease of 37% year over year. U.S. natural gas realized price per thousand cubic feet (MCF) averaged $2.02 in the current year compared to $2.45 per MCF in 2019, a price decrease of 18% year over year. Canada natural gas realized price per MCF averaged U.S. $1.79 in the current year compared to U.S. $1.60 per MCF in 2019, a price increase of 12% year over year. Oil and natural gas production costs, including associated production taxes, on a per-unit basis, were $9.81 in 2020 excluding TGP (2019: $9.66). The increase in production costs in 2020 is primarily attributable to costs associated with well workovers at Cascade and Dalmatian in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico (discussed below).
United States E&P operations reported a loss of $1,014.3 million in 2020 compared to earnings of $518.4 million in 2019. Results were $1,532.7 million unfavorable in 2020 compared to the 2019 period primarily due to higher impairment charges ($1,152.5 million), lower revenues ($955.2 million) and higher lease operating expenses ($15.4 million), partially offset by lower income tax expense ($359.8 million), depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) ($129.3 million), G&A
Exploration and Production
($49.7 million), other operating expenses ($27.2 million) and transportation, gathering, and processing ($13.1 million). The impairment charge is primarily the result of lower future prices at the time of calculation, as a result of decreased oil demand.
Lower revenues were primarily due to lower commodity prices year over year and lower volumes in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico (as a result of shut-ins related to hurricanes and storms and lower capital expenditures). Higher lease operating expenses were due primarily to Gulf of Mexico well workovers at Cascade ($51.3 million) and Dalmatian ($20.5 million). Lower income tax expense is a result of pre-tax losses driven by the impairment charge and lower commodity prices. Lower other operating expense is primarily due to a favorable mark to market revaluation on contingent consideration (as a result of lower commodity prices) from prior Gulf of Mexico (GOM) acquisitions ($13.8 million). Lower G&A is due to cost reductions and lower headcount as a result of restructuring (primarily closing the El Dorado and Calgary offices).
Canadian E&P operations reported a loss of $35.0 million in 2020 compared to income of $4.3 million in 2019. Results were unfavorable $30.7 million compared to 2019 primarily due to lower revenue ($101.2 million) partially offset by lower DD&A ($29.8 million), lease operating expense ($20.8 million), income tax charges ($18.5 million) and G&A ($12.9 million). Lower revenues were due to lower oil and condensate prices versus the prior year and a shut-in at Terra Nova for Asset Integrity work (starting in December 2019 and expected to continue until 2022). Lower DD&A and lease operating expenses were a result of lower sales. Lower income tax expense is a result of pre-tax losses. Lower G&A is due to cost reductions and lower headcount as a result of restructuring.
Other international E&P operations reported a loss from continuing operations of $85.6 million in 2020 compared to a loss of $53.5 million in the prior year. The 2020 results include an impairment charge of $39.7 million and lower revenues of $9.8 million in Brunei.
2019 vs 2018
E&P continuing operations recorded a profit of $460.6 million in 2019 compared to a profit of $277.4 million in 2018. The results for 2019 were favorably impacted by higher oil and natural gas volumes, lower exploration expenses, and no impairment charge, partially offset by higher lease operating expenses and transportation, gathering and processing expenses, higher G&A expenses, higher DD&A and higher taxes.
Crude oil price realizations averaged $60.27 per barrel 2019 compared to $65.87 per barrel in 2018, a price decrease of 9% year over year. U.S. natural gas realized price per thousand cubic feet (MCF) averaged $2.45 in 2019 compared to $3.18 per MCF in 2018, a price decrease of 23% year over year. Canada natural gas realized price per MCF averaged U.S.$1.60 in 2019 compared to U.S. $1.71 per MCF in 2018, a price decrease of 6% year over year. Oil and natural gas production costs, including associated production taxes, on a per-unit basis, were $9.66 in 2019 (2018: $9.02), which together with higher oil and natural gas volumes sold, resulted in $247.2 million higher costs in 2019.
United States E&P operations reported earnings of $518.4 million in 2019 compared to earnings of $242.9 million in 2018. Results were $275.5 million favorable in the 2019 period compared to the 2018 period due to higher revenues ($1,034.3 million), partially offset by higher DD&A ($359.2 million), lease operating expenses ($231.0 million), transportation, gathering and processing ($97.7 million) income tax expense ($47.5 million), other operating expenses ($29.2 million) and G&A ($25.3 million). Higher revenues were primarily due to higher volumes from the MP GOM transaction in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the LLOG acquisition in the second quarter of 2019. Higher lease operating, transportation, gathering and processing expenses and DD&A were primarily due to higher volumes. Higher income taxes were due to higher profits. Higher other operating expense was due to higher business development, acquisition transaction costs and mark to market valuation on contingent consideration. Higher G&A was due to higher long-term incentive charges.
Canadian E&P operations reported a loss of $4.3 million in 2019 compared to earnings of $51.1 million in 2018. Results were unfavorable $55.4 million primarily due to lower revenues ($23.5 million), higher lease operating expense ($19.8 million), lower other income ($13.0 million) primarily related to more Seal insurance proceed received in 2018; and partially offset by lower income tax charges ($17.4 million). Lower revenues were due to lower oil and condensate prices than 2018 and a shut-in at Hibernia in the third quarter of 2019, partially offset by higher volumes at Kaybob Duvernay and Tupper Montney. Higher lease operating expenses were due to higher costs at Tupper Montney as a result of transferring a gain on a previous natural gas processing plant sale and lease-back transaction to equity as a result of the implementation of ASC 842 (see Note B - New Accounting Principles and Recent Accounting Pronouncements). In 2018, this gain was being credited to operating expenses equally over the life of the lease.
Other international E&P operations reported a loss from continuing operations of $53.5 million in 2019 compared to a net loss of $16.6 million in 2018. The 2019 result included the write-off of previously suspended exploration costs of $13.2 million attributable to the CM-1X and the CT-1X wells (originally drilled in 2017) in Vietnam and lower revenues from Brunei ($10.6 million), and lower tax benefits ($12.9 million).
Cost per equivalent barrel sold for these production-related expenses are shown by geographical area in the following table.
1 For the year ended December 31, 2020, lease operating expense (LOE) per barrel of oil equivalents (BOE) sold for the U.S. Gulf of Mexico excluding cost associated with well workovers was $9.52. Workovers for the year ended December 31, 2020 included Dalmatian and Cascade.
2 For the year ended December 31, 2020, Canada Offshore LOE per BOE excluding the costs associated with the Terra Nova life extension project was $5.24.
3 For the year ended December 31, 2020, total LOE per BOE excluding cost associated with Gulf of Mexico well workovers was $7.91.
Corporate
2020 vs 2019
On May 6, 2020, the Company announced that it was closing its headquarters office in El Dorado, Arkansas, its office in Calgary, Alberta, and consolidating all worldwide staff activities to its existing office location in Houston, Texas. As a result of this decision, certain directly attributable costs and charges have been recognized and reported as Restructuring charges as part of net loss in 2020. These costs include severance, relocation, IT costs, pension curtailment and a write-off of the right of use asset lease associated with the Canada office. Further, the office building in El Dorado is classified as held for sale.
Corporate activities, which include interest expense and income, foreign exchange effects, realized and unrealized gains/losses on crude oil contracts and corporate overhead not allocated to Exploration and Production, reported a loss of $120.3 million in 2020 compared to a loss of $271.8 million in 2019. The $151.5 million favorable variance is primarily due to higher realized gains on forward swap commodity contracts ($239.5 million), lower interest charges ($50.2 million), lower G&A ($14.5 million), and partially offset by higher tax charges ($55.3 million), restructuring charges ($48.8 million) related to the closure of the El Dorado and Calgary offices, and impairment charges ($14.1 million). Higher realized gains on forward swap commodity contracts are due to lower market pricing whereby the contract provides the Company with a fixed price. Interest charges are lower primarily due to 2019 temporary borrowings on the Company’s revolving credit facility (RCF) to fund the LLOG acquisition (the RCF borrowings were repaid in the third quarter 2019 following the divestment of the Malaysia business) and gains from the buy-back of debt in the second quarter 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the average forward NYMEX WTI prices for 2021 and 2022 were $48.34 and $46.76, respectively (versus fixed hedge prices of $42.77 and $44.88; see Outlook section).
2019 vs 2018
Corporate activities, as defined above, reported a net loss of $271.8 million in 2019 compared to a loss of $108.3 million in 2018. The $163.5 million unfavorable variance is due to a 2018 income tax credit ($120.0 million, related to an IRS interpretation of the Tax Act), higher interest charges ($38.6 million) primarily due to early retirement of debt, foreign exchange losses ($6.6 million; versus an $16.1 million gain in 2018), Ecuador arbitration income in 2018 ($26.0 million); partially off-set by lower losses on forward crude contracts ($41.1 million) and lower income taxes (excluding the $120 million tax act credit; $22.1 million).
Discontinued Operations
The Company has presented its Malaysia E&P operations and former U.K. and U.S. refining and marketing operations as discontinued operations in its consolidated financial statements.
2020 vs 2019
In 2020, discontinued operations reported a loss of $7.2 million, primarily related to charges in Malaysia following the sale of this business in 2019 (see below).
2019 vs 2018
Malaysia E&P operations reported earnings of $1,086.6 million in 2019 compared to $251.7 million in the 2018 period. Results for 2019 were favorable by $834.9 million primarily as a result of the gain on sale of Malaysia to PTT Exploration and Production Public Company Limited (PTTEP) (see Note G - Property, Plant, and Equipment). The sale closed on July 10, 2019. The Company recognized a net gain of $985.4 million on the transaction. Excluding the gain, Malaysia income was $168.2 million lower than the 2018 period principally due to lower revenues ($486.4 million), partially offset by lower operating expenses ($74.9 million), lower depreciation ($164.9 million) and lower income taxes ($73.1 million). Lower revenues are principally due to lower volumes sold as a result of a partial year of operations and declining daily production. The lower depreciation is due to the cessation of charges as a result of the assets being classified as held for sale and partial year of operations.
Production Volumes and Prices
2020 vs 2019
Total hydrocarbon production from all E&P continuing operations averaged 174,636 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2020, which represented a 6% decrease from the 185,649 barrels per day produced in 2019. Production in the Gulf of Mexico was significantly impacted by a record breaking hurricane year which resulted in shut-ins and loss of approximately 6.4 MBOED of production in 2020. Lower volumes in the Eagle Ford Shale volumes were due to lower capital expenditures.
Average crude oil and condensate production from continuing operations was 103,966 barrels per day in 2020 compared to 114,742 barrels per day in 2019. The decrease of 10,776 barrels per day was principally due to lower Eagle Ford Shale production (8,158 barrels per day) and lower volumes in the Gulf of Mexico (2,143 barrels per day) as stated above. On a worldwide basis, the Company’s crude oil and condensate prices averaged $38.02 per barrel in 2020 compared to $60.27 per barrel in the 2019 period, a decrease of 37% year over year, resulting from the global downturn triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Total production of natural gas liquids (NGL) from continuing operations was 11,541 barrels per day in 2020 compared to 11,888 barrels per day in the 2019 period. The average sales price for U.S. NGL was $11.29 per barrel in 2020 compared to $14.85 per barrel in 2019. The average sales price for NGL in Canada was $18.54 per barrel in 2020 compared to $26.04 per barrel in 2019. NGL prices are higher in Canada due to the higher value of product produced at the Kaybob and Placid assets.
Natural gas sales volumes from continuing operations averaged 355 million cubic feet per day (MMCFD) in 2020 compared to 354 MMCFD in 2019. The increase of 1 MMCFD was a primarily the result of higher volumes in the Gulf of Mexico (14 MMCFD) due to a full year contribution from the assets associated with the LLOG transaction.
Natural gas prices for the total Company averaged $1.85 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) in 2020, versus $1.80 per MCF average in the same period of 2019. Average natural gas prices in the US and Canada in 2020 were $2.02 and $1.79 per MCF, respectively.
2019 vs 2018
Total hydrocarbon production from continuing operations averaged 185,649 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2019, which represented a 49% increase from the 124,337 barrels per day produced in 2018. The increase was principally due to the acquisition of producing Gulf of Mexico assets as part of the MP GOM transaction in the fourth quarter 2018 and the addition of further Gulf of Mexico assets as part of the LLOG acquisition in the second quarter of 2019.
Average crude oil and condensate production from continuing operations was 114,742 barrels per day in 2019 compared to 63,438 barrels per day in 2018. The increase of 51,304 barrels per day was principally due to higher volumes in the Gulf of Mexico (48,121 barrels per day) due to the acquisition of assets as part of the MP GOM transaction and the LLOG acquisition. On a worldwide basis, the Company’s crude oil and condensate prices averaged $60.27 per barrel in 2019 compared to $65.87 per barrel in 2018, a decrease of 9% year over year.
Total production of natural gas liquids (NGL) from continuing operations was 11,888 barrels per day in 2019 compared to 8,798 per day in 2018. The average sales price for U.S. NGL was $14.85 per barrel in 2019 compared to $26.12 per barrel in 2018. The average sales price of NGL in Canada was $26.04 per barrel in 2019 compared to $37.47 per barrel in 2018. NGL prices are higher in Canada due to the higher value of product produced at the Kaybob Duvernay and Placid Montney assets.
Natural gas sales volumes from continuing operations averaged 354 million cubic feet per day (MMCFD) in 2019 compared to 313 MMCFD in 2018. The increase of 42 MMCFD was a primarily the result of higher volumes in the Gulf of Mexico (38 MMCFD). Higher volumes in the Gulf of Mexico are due to the acquisition of assets related to the MP GOM transaction and the LLOG acquisition.
Natural gas prices for the total Company averaged $1.80 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) in 2019, versus $1.93 per MCF average in 2018. Average prices in the U.S. and Canada in 2019 were $2.45 and $1.60 respectively.

Financial Condition
Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Net cash provided by continuing operating activities was $802.7 million in 2020 compared to $1,489.1 million in 2019. The decreased cash from operating activities is primarily attributable to lower revenue from sales to customers ($1,065.4 million), partially offset by higher cash payments received on forward swap commodity contracts ($239.5 million), lower general and administrative expenses ($92.5 million) and lower lease operating expenses ($5.1 million). Lower revenues were primarily due to lower commodity prices resulting from lower demand triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic and lower volumes (due to reduced capital expenditures). See above for further explanation of underlying business reasons.
Cash flow provided by continuing operations was $739.7 million higher in 2019 than in 2018 due to higher Sales volume and higher realized gain on forward crude contracts partially off-set by higher lease operating, transportation, gathering and processing expenses. Higher revenues, lease operating, transportation, gathering and processing expenses and higher depreciation expenses are principally a result of the LLOG acquisition and a full year of the 2018 MP GOM transaction, which was completed in the fourth quarter 2018.
The total reductions of operating cash flows for interest paid during the three years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were $191.6 million, $179.7 million, and $158.1 million, respectively. Higher cash interest paid in 2020 was due to the new 2027 notes paying interest at 5.875% and revolver borrowing during the year. Higher cash interest paid in 2019 was due to maintaining a higher average outstanding revolver balance 2019 (timing of LLOG acquisition and Malaysia disposition) and also the cost of the $500 million term loan outstanding from May to July 2019.
Cash Used for Investing Activities
Cash used for property additions and dry holes, which includes amounts expensed, were $859.0 million and $2,536.2 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. In 2020, this includes $113.0 million used to fund the development of the King’s Quay FPS, which is expected to be refunded on the closing of a transaction to sell this asset to a third party. Lower property additions in 2020 are a result of a significant (approximately 50%) reduction to the 2020 capital spending budget in response to the reduced commodity price environment.
In 2019 and 2018, property additions included the LLOG and MPGOM acquisitions, respectively.
The accrual basis of capital expenditures, which includes $1,261.1 million for proved property acquisitions (principally the LLOG acquisition) in 2019 and the $794.6 million MP GOM acquisition in 2018, were as follows:
A reconciliation of property additions and dry hole costs in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows to total capital expenditures for continuing operations follows.
Capital expenditures in the exploration and production business in 2020 compared to 2019 have decreased as a result of the 2019 LLOG acquisition and in response to the current commodity price environment, resulting in lower capital expenditures in

the Eagle Ford Shale. The King’s Quay FPS development project is expected to be refunded on the closing of a transaction to sell this asset to a third party.
Cash Used by and Provided by Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $39.7 million in 2020 compared to net cash used by financing activities of $1,130.0 million during 2019. In 2020, the cash provided by financing activities was principally from borrowings on the Company’s unsecured revolving credit facility ($200.0 million), partially offset by dividends paid ($96.0 million) and distributions to noncontrolling interest ($43.7 million).
The primary sources of the Company’s liquidity are internally generated funds, access to outside financing and working capital. The Company generally uses its internally generated funds to finance its capital and operating expenditures, but it also maintains lines of credit with banks and will borrow as necessary to meet spending requirements. At December 31, 2020, the Company has a $1.6 billion senior unsecured guaranteed credit facility (RCF) with a major banking consortium, which expires in November 2023. As of December 31, 2020 and in the event it is required to fund investing activities from borrowings, the Company has approximately $1.4 billion available on its committed revolving credit facility.
In 2019, the cash required by financing activities of $1,130.0 million was principally from borrowings on our revolver and short-term loan ($1,725.0 million) to fund the LLOG acquisition. These borrowings, along with the opening revolver balance ($325.0 million) of $2,050.0 million were repaid in July 2019 following the completion of the Malaysia divestment. The Company issued $550 million notes due December 2027 that bear a rate of 5.875%, for net proceeds of $542.4 million; these proceeds were used to redeem a portion of the Company’s $500 million 4.00% notes due June 2022 and a portion of the Company’s $600 million 4.45% notes due December 2022 ($521.3 million in the aggregate). The Company paid an early retirement premium of $26.6 million in relation to the retirement of the debt. Finally, in 2019, the Company also used cash to buy back issued ordinary shares ($499.9 million), pay dividends ($163.7 million) and make distributions to noncontrolling interest ($128.2 million).
In 2018, net cash provided by financing activities of $143.6 million consisted of $325.0 million of borrowings on the Company’s revolving credit facility to partially fund the MP GOM transaction, which was fully repaid following the completion of the Malaysia divestment in 2019, offset by dividends paid ($173.0 million).
Working Capital
At the end of 2020, working capital (total current assets less total current liabilities, excluding assets and liabilities held for sale) amounted to a net working capital liability of $29.4 million (2019: net working capital liability of $79.0 million). The total working capital liability reduction of $49.6 million in 2020 is primarily attributable lower accounts receivable ($164.7 million) and lower inventory ($10.0 million) offset by lower accounts payable ($195.0 million) and lower other accrued liabilities ($46.9 million). Lower accounts receivable is due to both lower sales volumes and lower commodity sales prices. Lower accounts payable is due to overall lower business activity, principally lower capital expenditures in the fourth quarter 2020 compared to 2019 resulting in both lower trade payables and capital expenditure accruals, and lower volumes resulting in lower royalties payable. Lower other accrued liabilities is principally due to lower liabilities associated with compensation awards and benefits.
Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2020 totaled $310.6 million (2019: $306.8 million). Borrowings of $200.0 million from the revolving credit facility were outstanding at the end of the year (2019: no borrowings).
Cash and invested cash are maintained in several operating locations outside the United States. At December 31, 2020, Cash and cash equivalents held outside the U.S. included U.S dollar equivalents of approximately $119.4 million (2019: $116.5 million), the majority of which was held in Canada. In addition, approximately $10.2 million of cash were held in Brunei, respectively, and has been classified as part of Assets held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at year-end 2020. In certain cases, the Company could incur cash taxes or other costs should these cash balances be repatriated to the U.S. in future periods. Canada currently collects a 5% withholding tax on any earnings repatriated to the U.S. See Note J - Income Taxes for further information regarding potential tax expense that could be incurred upon distribution of foreign earnings back to the United States.
Capital Employed
At December 31, 2020, long-term debt of $2,988.1 million had increased by $184.7 million compared to December 31, 2019, as a result of net borrowing of $200.0 million on the revolving credit facility. The fixed-rate notes had a weighted average maturity of 6.8 years and a weighted average coupon of 5.9%.
A summary of capital employed at December 31, 2020 and 2019 follows.
Financial Condition (Contd.)
Murphy shareholders’ equity was $4.21 billion at the end of 2020 (2019: $5.47 billion). Shareholders’ equity decreased in 2020 primarily due to the net loss ($1.15 billion), which was driven by impairment charges ($1.21 billion) as a result of lower future prices at the time of calculation, as a result of decreased oil demand. A summary of transactions in stockholders’ equity accounts is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity on page 64 of this Form 10-K report.
Other Balance Sheet Activity - Long Term Assets and Liabilities
Other significant changes in Murphy’s balance sheet at the end of 2020, compared to 2019 are discussed below.
Property, plant and equipment, net of depreciation decreased $1,700.7 million principally due to impairment charges ($1,206.3 million) primarily the result of lower forecast future prices, as a result of decreased oil demand triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic and an annual charge of depreciation, depletion and amortization. Capital expenditures are discussed above in the ‘Cash Used for Investing Activities’ section.
Murphy had commitments for capital expenditures of approximately $747.0 million at December 31, 2020 (2019: $574.5 million). This amount includes $529.0 million for approved expenditure for capital projects relating to non-operated interests in deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico, principally at St Malo ($392.5 million) and Lucius ($113.2 million).
Operating lease assets and liabilities increased $329.4 million principally due to the addition of a 5-year lease for the Cascade/Chinook FPSO in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico ($268.8 million) and a 20-year lease related to a gas plant expansion in Canada ($168.4 million).
Deferred income tax assets increased $266.0 million as a result of the increase in the estimated U.S. net operating loss of $2.8 billion at year-end 2020, up from $2.4 billion at year-end 2019.
Long-term asset retirement obligations decreased $9.5 million to $816.3 million, principally due to lower cost estimates.
Deferred credits and other liabilities increased $67.2 million primarily as a result of the pension remeasurement which was triggered by the restructuring. The Company incurred pension curtailment and special termination benefit charges as a result of the associated reduction of force.
At December 31, 2020, the Company had $200.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the RCF and $3.8 million of outstanding letters of credit, which reduce the borrowing capacity of the RCF. Borrowings under the RCF bear interest at rates, based, at the Company’s option, on the “Alternate Base Rate” of interest in effect plus the “ABR Spread” or the “Adjusted LIBOR Rate,” which is a periodic fixed rate based on LIBOR with a term equivalent to the interest period for such borrowing, plus the “Eurodollar Spread.” The “Alternate Base Rate” of interest is the highest of (i) the Wall Street Journal prime rate, (ii) the New York Federal Reserve Bank Rate plus 0.50%, and (iii) one-month LIBOR plus 1.00%. The “Eurodollar Spread” ranges from 1.075% to 2.10% per annum based upon the Corporation’s senior unsecured long-term debt securities credit ratings (the “Credit Ratings”). A facility fee accrues and is payable quarterly in arrears at a rate ranging from 0.175% to 0.40% per annum (based upon the Company’s Credit Ratings) on the aggregate commitments under the 2018 facility. At December 31, 2020, the interest rate in effect on borrowings under the facility was 1.84%. At December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all covenants related to the RCF.
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
Murphy faces various environmental, health and safety risks that are inherent in exploring for, developing and producing hydrocarbons. To help manage these risks, the Company has established a robust health, safety and environmental governance program comprised of a worldwide policy, guiding principles, annual goals and a management system incorporating oversight at each business unit, senior leadership and board levels. The Company strives to minimize these risks by continually improving its processes through design, operation and implementation of a comprehensive asset integrity plan, and through emergency and oil spill response planning to address any credible risks. These plans are presented to, reviewed and approved by a health, safety, environmental and corporate responsibility committee consisting of certain members of Murphy’s Board of Directors.
Environmental Matters (Cont’d.)
The oil and natural gas industry is subject to numerous international, foreign, national, state, provincial and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Murphy allocates a portion of both its capital expenditures and its general and administrative budget toward compliance with existing and anticipated environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These requirements affect virtually all operations of the Company and increase Murphy’s overall cost of business, including its capital costs to construct, maintain and upgrade equipment and facilities as well as operating costs for ongoing compliance.
The principal environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which Murphy is subject address such matters as the generation, storage, handling, use, disposal and remediation of petroleum products, wastewater and hazardous materials; the emission and discharge of such materials to the environment, including greenhouse gas emissions; wildlife, habitat and water protection; the placement, operation and decommissioning of production equipment; and the health and safety of our employees, contractors and communities where our operations are located. These laws and regulations also generally require permits for existing operations, as well as the construction or development of new operations and the decommissioning facilities once production has ceased. Violations can give rise to sanctions including significant civil and criminal penalties, injunctions, construction bans and delays.
Further information on environmental, health and safety laws and regulations applicable to Murphy are contained in the Business section beginning page 9.
Climate Change
The world’s population and standard of living is growing steadily along with the demand for energy. Murphy recognizes that this generates increasing amounts of greenhouse gases (GHGs), which raise important climate change concerns. Murphy works to assess the Company’s governance, strategy, risk identification, and management and measurement of climate risks and opportunities in order to remain in alignment with the Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) core elements. The TCFD was created by the Financial Stability Board to focus on climate-related financial disclosures to improve and increase reporting of climate-related financial information. Murphy’s disclosures related to its alignment with the TCFD are included in the Company’s 2020 Sustainability Report issued on October 9, 2020, which is not incorporated by reference hereto.
During 2020, the Company made significant strides in our sustainability efforts, including:
•Establishing a further goal of reducing our GHG emissions intensity 15 percent to 20 percent by 2030 from our 2019 levels, excluding divested assets from the 2019 baseline, for an aggregate of 35 percent to 40 percent reduction from our reported 2019 levels;
•Expanding our GHG, air quality, climate risk management and biodiversity management public disclosures; and
•Expanding the purview of our health, safety, environmental and corporate responsibility committee consisting of certain members of Murphy’s Board of Directors to include environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, and creating a director of sustainability role.
Other Matters
Impact of inflation - General inflation was moderate during the last three years in most countries where the Company operates; however, the Company’s revenues and capital and operating costs are influenced to a larger extent by specific price changes in the oil and natural gas and allied industries than by changes in general inflation. Crude oil prices generally reflect the balance between supply and demand, with crude oil prices being particularly sensitive to OPEC production levels and/or attitudes of traders concerning supply and demand in the future. Prices for oil field goods and services are usually affected by the worldwide prices for crude oil.
In 2020, some downward service cost relief was observed. In 2019 the cost of goods and services in the oil and natural gas industry were stable.
Natural gas prices are also affected by supply and demand, which are often affected by the weather and by the fact that delivery of natural gas is generally restricted to specific geographic areas.
As a result of the overall volatility of oil and natural gas prices, it is not possible to predict the Company’s future cost of oil field goods and services.
Accounting changes and recent accounting pronouncements - see Note B - New Accounting Principles and Recent Accounting Pronouncements
SEC Rules Adopted
SEC Disclosures Modernization of Regulation S-K Items 101, 103, and 105. The new rules, which are part of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) broader project to modernize Regulation S-K, became effective November 9, 2020. As a result, 2020 Form 10-Ks and other filings subject to Regulation S-K filed on or after this date need to include the new disclosures. The new disclosures include principles-based disclosure of information material to an understanding of the general development of the business, and eliminating the previously prescribed five-year timeframe, a description of the registrant’s human capital resources to the extent such disclosures would be material to an understanding of the registrant’s business, and disclosure of any alternative threshold chosen for disclosure of environmental proceedings.
SEC Disclosures Update and Simplification. In August 2018, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted the final rule under SEC Release No. 33-10532 Disclosure Update and Simplification, to eliminate or modify certain disclosure rules that are redundant, outdated, or duplicative of U.S. GAAP or other regulatory requirements. Among other changes, the amendments eliminated the annual requirement to disclose the high and low trading prices of our common stock and the ratio of earnings to fixed charges. In addition, the amendments provide that disclosure requirements related to the analysis of shareholders’ equity are expanded for interim financial statements. An analysis of the changes in each caption of shareholders’ equity presented in the balance sheet must be provided in a note or separate statement, as well as the amount of dividends per share for each class of shares. This rule was effective on November 5, 2018; and the expanded interim disclosure requirements for changes in shareholders’ equity was effective for the Company for our quarterly reporting beginning March 31, 2019.
SEC Rules Not Yet Adopted
SEC Disclosures Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A), Selected Financial Data, and Supplementary Financial Information. The new rules, which are part of the SEC’s broader project to modernize Regulation S-K, were published January 11, 2021 and became effective February 10, 2021. The rules can be applied 30 days after publication in the Federal Register, and compliance is mandatory 210 days after publication. Before the mandatory compliance date, registrants can choose which amended items to apply. The amendments are intended to modernize, simplify, and enhance certain financial disclosure requirements in Regulation S-K. Specifically, they eliminate the requirement for Selected Financial Data, streamline the requirement to disclose Supplementary Financial Information, and amend MD&A. These amendments are intended to eliminate duplicative disclosures and modernize and enhance MD&A disclosures for the benefit of investors, while simplifying compliance efforts for registrants.
Other Matters (Cont’d.)
Significant accounting policies - In preparing the Company’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management must make a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Application of certain of the Company’s accounting policies requires significant estimates. The most significant of these accounting policies and estimates are described below.
Oil and natural gas proved reserves - Oil and natural gas proved reserves are defined by the SEC as those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations before the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire (unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain). Proved developed reserves of oil and natural gas can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared with the cost of a new well, or through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well.
Although the Company’s engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves as established by the SEC, the estimation of reserves requires the engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment. SEC rules require the Company to use an unweighted average of the oil and natural gas prices in effect at the beginning of each month of the year for determining quantities of proved reserves. These historical prices often do not approximate the average price that the Company expects to receive for its oil and natural gas production in the future. The Company often uses significantly different oil and natural gas price and reserve assumptions when making its own internal economic property evaluations. Changes in oil and natural gas prices can lead to a decision to start-up or shut-in production, which can lead to revisions to reserves quantities.
Estimated reserves are subject to future revision, certain of which could be substantial, based on the availability of additional information, including reservoir performance, new geological and geophysical data, additional drilling, technological advancements, price changes and other economic factors. Reserves revisions inherently lead to adjustments of the Company’s depreciation rates and the timing of settlement of asset retirement obligations. Downward reserves revisions can also lead to significant impairment expense. The Company cannot predict the type of oil and natural gas reserves revisions that will be required in future periods.
The Company’s proved reserves of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas are presented on pages 102 to 110 of this Form 10-K report. Murphy’s estimations for proved reserves were generated through the integration of available geoscience, engineering, and economic data, and commercially available technologies, to establish ‘reasonable certainty’ of economic producibility. As defined by the SEC, reasonable certainty of proved reserves describes a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered. In estimating proved reserves, Murphy uses familiar industry-accepted methods for subsurface evaluations, including performance, volumetric, and analog-based studies.
Where appropriate, Murphy includes reliable geologic and engineering technology to estimate proved reserves. Reliable geologic and engineering technology is a method or combination of methods that are field-tested and have demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. This integrated approach increases the quality of and confidence in Murphy’s proved reserves estimates. It was utilized in certain undrilled acreage at distances greater than the directly offsetting development spacing areas, and in certain reservoirs developed with the application of improved recovery techniques. Murphy utilized a combination of 3D seismic interpretation, core analysis, wellbore log measurements, well test data, historic production and pressure data, and commercially available seismic processing and numerical reservoir simulation programs. Reservoir parameters from analogous reservoirs were used to strengthen the reserves estimates when available.
See further discussion of proved reserves and changes in proved reserves during the three years ended December 31, 2020 beginning on pages 5 and 102 of this Form 10-K report.
Property, Plant & Equipment - impairment of long-lived assets - The Company continually monitors its long-lived assets recorded in Property, plant and equipment (PPE) in the Consolidated Balance Sheet to make sure that they are fairly presented. The Company must evaluate its PPE for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from future cash flows.
A significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events. Such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices, an estimate of the amount of oil and natural gas that will be produced from a field, the timing of this future production, future costs to produce the oil and natural gas, future capital, operating and abandonment costs, and future inflation levels.
Other Matters (Cont’d.)
Significant accounting policies (Cont’d.)
The need to test a long-lived asset for impairment can be based on several factors, including but not limited to a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and/or natural gas, unfavorable revisions of oil or natural gas reserves, or other changes to contracts, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, tax laws or other regulatory changes. All of these factors must be considered when evaluating a property’s carrying value for possible impairment.
Due to the volatility of world oil and natural gas markets, the actual sales prices for oil and natural gas have often been different from the Company’s projections.
Estimates of future oil and natural gas production and sales volumes are based on a combination of proved and risked probable and possible reserves. Although the estimation of reserves and future production is uncertain, the Company believes that its estimates are reasonable; however, there have been cases where actual production volumes were higher or lower than projected and the timing was different than the original projection. The Company adjusts reserves and production estimates as new information becomes available.
The Company generally projects future costs by using historical costs adjusted for both assumed long-term inflation rates and known or expected changes in future operations. Although the projected future costs are considered to be reasonable, at times, costs have been higher or lower than originally estimated.
In 2020, declines in future oil and natural gas prices (principally driven by reduced commodity demand in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and increased supply in the first quarter of 2020 from foreign oil producers) led to impairments in certain of the Company’s U.S. Offshore and Other Foreign properties and assets. In 2020, the Company recognized pretax noncash impairment charges of $1,206.3 million to reduce the carrying values at select properties.
There were no impairments in 2019.
As a result of management’s assessments during 2018, the Company recognized a pretax, noncash impairment charge of $20.0 million at select Midland properties. See also Note G - Property, Plant, and Equipment for further discussion of impairment charges.
Income taxes - The Company is subject to income and other similar taxes in all areas in which it operates. When recording income tax expense, certain estimates are required because: (a) income tax returns are generally filed months after the close of its annual accounting period; (b) tax returns are subject to audit by taxing authorities and audits can often take years to complete and settle; (c) future events often impact the timing of when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized by the Company and (d) changes to regulations may be subject to different interpretations and require future clarification from issuing authorities or others.
The Company has deferred tax assets mostly relating to U.S net operating losses, liabilities for dismantlement, retirement benefit plan obligations and net deferred tax liabilities relating to tax and accounting basis differences for property, plant & equipment.
The Company routinely evaluates all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of their realization and reduce such assets to the expected realizable amount by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In assessing the need for valuation allowances, we consider all available positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence includes projected future taxable income and assessment of future business assumptions, a history of utilizing tax assets before expiration, significant proven and probable reserves and reversals of taxable temporary differences. Negative evidence includes losses in recent years.
As at December 31, 2020 the Company had a U.S. deferred tax asset associated with net operating losses of $589.1 million. In reviewing the likeliness of realizing this asset the Company considered the reversal of taxable temporary differences, carryforward periods, and future taxable income estimates based on projected financial information which, based on currently available evidence, we believe to be reasonably likely to occur. Certain estimates and assumptions are used in the estimation of future taxable income, including (but not limited to) (a) future commodity prices for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, (b) estimated reserves for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, (c) expected timing of production, (d) estimated lease operating costs, and (e) future capital requirements. In the future, the underlying actual assumptions utilized in estimating future taxable income could be different and result in different conclusions about the likelihood of the future utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards.
Accounting for retirement and postretirement benefit plans - Murphy and certain of its subsidiaries maintain defined benefit retirement plans covering certain full-time employees. The Company also sponsors health care and life insurance benefit plans covering most retired U.S. employees. The expense associated with these plans is estimated by management based on a number of assumptions and with consultation assistance from qualified third-party actuaries. The most important of these assumptions for the retirement plans involve the discount rate used to measure future plan obligations and the expected long-term rate of
Other Matters (Cont’d.)
Significant accounting policies (Cont’d.)
return on plan assets. For the retiree medical and insurance plans, the most important assumptions are the discount rate for future plan obligations and the health care cost trend rate. Discount rates are based on the universe of high-quality corporate bonds that are available within each country. Cash flow analyses are performed in which a spot yield curve is used to discount projected benefit payment streams for the most significant plans. The discounted cash flows are used to determine an equivalent single rate which is the basis for selecting the discount rate within each country. Expected plan asset returns are based on long-term expectations for asset portfolios with similar investment mix characteristics. Anticipated health care cost trend rates are determined based on prior experience of the Company and an assessment of near-term and long-term trends for medical and drug costs.
Based on bond yields at December 31, 2020, the Company has used a weighted average discount rate of 2.47% at year-end 2020 for the primary U.S. plans. This weighted average discount rate is 0.9% lower than prior year, which increased the Company’s recorded liabilities for retirement plans compared to a year ago. Although the Company presently assumes a return on plan assets of 5.50% for the primary U.S. plan, it periodically reconsiders the appropriateness of this and other key assumptions. The Company’s retirement and postretirement plan expenses in 2021 are expected to be $12.3 million lower than 2020 primarily due to termination benefit charges recorded relating to the restructuring in 2020 and lower interest charges. Cash contributions are anticipated to be $9.9 million higher in 2021.
In 2020, the Company paid $30.2 million into various retirement plans and $1.8 million into postretirement plans. In 2021, the Company is expecting to fund payments of approximately $36.6 million into various retirement plans and $5.3 million for postretirement plans. The Company could be required to make additional and more significant funding payments to retirement plans in future years. Future required payments and the amount of liabilities recorded on the balance sheet associated with the plans could be unfavorably affected if the discount rate declines, the actual return on plan assets falls below the assumed return, or the health care cost trend rate increase is higher than expected.
Contractual obligations and guarantees - The Company is obligated to make future cash payments under borrowing arrangements, operating leases, purchase obligations primarily associated with existing capital expenditure plans, and other long-term liabilities. Total payments due after 2020 under such contractual obligations and arrangements are shown in the table below.
1 Other leases refers to a finance lease in Brunei, which is classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2020 (see Note E - Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations).
2 Capital expenditures, drilling rigs and other includes $529.0 million and $31.5 million in the years 2021 to 2023 for approved capital projects in non-operated interests in U.S. Gulf of Mexico and U.S. Onshore, respectively. Also includes $56.7 million (2021), $117.0 million (2022 - 2023), $90.9 million (2024 - 2025) and $254.3 million (After 2025) for pipeline transportation commitments in Canada. Also includes $4.3 million (2021), $9.8 million (2022 - 2023), $10.4 million (2024 - 2025) and $37.2 million (After 2025) for long term take or pay commitments relating to gas processing in Canada.
3 Other long-term liabilities, including debt interest includes future cash outflows for asset retirement obligations.
The Company has entered into agreements to lease production facilities for various producing oil fields as well as other arrangements that call for future payments as described in the following section. The Company’s share of the contractual obligations under these leases and other arrangements has been included in the table above.
In the normal course of its business, the Company is required under certain contracts with various governmental authorities and others to provide letters of credit that may be drawn upon if the Company fails to perform under those contracts. Total outstanding letters of credit were $210.6 million as of December 31, 2020.
Material off-balance sheet arrangements - Certain U.S. transportation contracts require minimum monthly payments through 2045, while Western Canada processing contracts call for minimum monthly payments through 2051. Future required minimum annual payments under these arrangements are included in the contractual obligation table above.
Outlook
Prices for the Company’s primary products are often volatile. The price of crude oil is primarily affected by the levels of supply and demand for energy. Anticipated future variances between the predicted demand for crude oil and the projected available supply can lead to significant movement in the price of crude oil. As of close on February 25, 2021, the NYMEX WTI forward curve price for the remainder of 2021 and 2022 were $61.38 and $56.51 per barrel, respectively; however we cannot predict what impact the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and other economic factors may have on future commodity pricing. Lower prices are expected to result in lower profits and operating cash-flows. The Company is closely monitoring the impact of lower commodity prices on its financial position and is currently in compliance with the covenants related to the revolving credit facility (see Note H - Financing Arrangements and Debt). The Company’s response to COVID-19 is discussed in more detail in the Risk Factors - General Risks.
The Company’s capital expenditure spend for 2021 is expected to be between $675.0 million and $725.0 million. Capital and other expenditures will be routinely reviewed during 2021 and planned capital expenditures may be adjusted to reflect differences between budgeted and forecast cash flow during the year. Capital expenditures may also be affected by asset purchases or sales, which often are not anticipated at the time a budget is prepared. The Company will primarily fund its capital program in 2021 using operating cash flow and available cash, but will supplement funding where necessary with borrowings under available credit facilities. If oil and/or natural gas prices weaken, actual cash flow generated from operations could be reduced such that capital spending reductions are required and/or borrowings might be required during the year to maintain funding of the Company’s ongoing development projects.
The Company currently expects average daily production in 2021 to be between 164,800 and 174,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day (including noncontrolling interest of 9,800 BOEPD). If significant price declines occur, the Company will review the option of production curtailments to avoid incurring losses on certain produced barrels.
The Company has entered into derivative or forward fixed-price delivery contracts to manage risk associated with certain future oil and natural gas sales prices as follows:
