Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.
This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those set forth as a result of general economic conditions and changes in the assumptions used in making such forward-looking statements. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the audited financial statements and accompanying notes and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The analysis set forth below is provided pursuant to applicable Securities and Exchange Commission regulations and is not intended to serve as a basis for projections of future events.
Overview of Our Company
International Land Alliance, Inc. was incorporated pursuant to the laws of the State of Wyoming on September 26, 2013. We are based in San Diego, California. We are a residential land development company with target properties located primarily in the Baja California Northern region of Mexico and Southern California. Our principal activities are purchasing properties, obtaining zoning and other entitlements required to subdivide the properties into residential and commercial building lots, securing financing for the purchase of the lots, improving the properties’ infrastructure and amenities, and selling the lots to homebuyers, retirees, investors and commercial developers. We offer the option of financing (i.e. taking a promissory note from the buyer for all or part of the purchase price) with a guaranteed acceptance on any purchase for every customer.
Overview
As of December 31, 2020, we had:
● Continued our research and marketing efforts to identify potential home buyers in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia. Through the formation of a partnership with a similar development company in the Baja California Norte Region of Mexico, we have been able to leverage additional resources with the use of their established and proven marketing plan which can help us with sophisticated execution and the desired results for residential lot sales and development.
● Continued the development of our interactive website for visitors to view condominium and villa options and allow customization;
● Title of the Oasis Park Resort in San Felipe was assumed during 2019. As progress continues on the development of the Oasis Park Resort, we are expecting the transfer of title on the Villas del Enologo in Rancho Tecate, Valle Divino in Ensenada, Baja California and Costa Bajamar in Ensenada, Baja California during the Company second fiscal quarter of 2021 as it continues to follow the necessary steps to complete this legal process.
● Continued our efforts to secure the proper financing and capital by exploring various options that will help achieve our goals of advanced development and additional investment opportunities.
Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Revenues
Our total revenue reported for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $8,290, compared with $463,799 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The change is a result of the sales of lots related to our Oasis Park Resort having assumed title of the property in June 2019. The Company has not yet recognized revenue from the sale of lots when title has not yet transferred. The unrecognized revenue is recorded under contract liability as the Company has not performed all of its performance obligations. The Company has a balance of $111,684 and $50,000 in contract liability as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Cost of Revenues
Our total cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $0 compared with $21,042 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The change is a result of the cost of associated with the sale of lots at Oasis Park Resort.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses increased to $2,146,047 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from to $1,825,369 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The detail by major category is reflected in the table below.
Sales and marketing costs decreased by $66,461 for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to the decreased operations of the Company resulting from the impact of COVID-19 and the resulting border restrictions. The Company anticipates sales and marketing to increase into 2021 as our target market is currently experiencing pre covid-19 record real estate sales.
General and administrative costs increased by $387,139 for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to compensation expense resulting from new employment contracts for our officers, stock-based consulting, and professional fees.
Net Loss
We finished the year ended December 31, 2020 with a net loss of $2,666,798, as compared to a loss of $1,596,086 for the year ended December 31, 2019, which is primarily the result of increased professional, marketing, and stock-based consulting fees incurred during the 2020 as well as increased interest expense associated with the additional financing during 2020.
The factors that will most significantly affect future operating results will be:
● The acquisition of land with lots for sale.
● The sale price of future lots, compared to the sale price of lots in other resorts in Mexico.
● The cost to construct a home on the lots to be transferred, and the quality of construction.
● The quality of our amenities.
● The global economy and the demand for vacation homes.
● The effects of COVID-19 on the US and Global economy.
● The securement of additional financing, and
● The negotiations to extend or refinance our debt in default.
Other than the foregoing we do not know of any trends, events or uncertainties that have had, or are reasonably expected to have, a material impact on our revenues or expenses.
Capital Resources and Liquidity
Cash and cash equivalents were $13,171 at December 31, 2020. As shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we recorded a loss of $2,666,798 and $1,596,086 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our working capital deficit at December 31, 2020 was $3,075,331 and net cash flows used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $709,754. These factors and our limited ability to raise additional capital to accomplish our objectives, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We expect our expenses will continue to increase during the foreseeable future as a result of increased operations and the development of our current business operations. We anticipate generating continued revenues over the next twelve months as we continue to market the sale of lots held for sale, now having assumed title of our Oasis Park Resort property; however, we there can be no assurance that such revenue will be sufficient to cover our expenses. Consequently, we expect to be dependent on the proceeds from future debt or equity investments to sustain our operations and implement our business plan. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital, we will be required to delay or forego some portion of our business plan, which would have a material adverse effect on our anticipated results from operations and financial condition. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain necessary amounts of capital or that our estimates of our capital requirements will prove to be accurate.
We presently do not have any significant credit available, bank financing or other external sources of liquidity. Due to our operating losses, our operations have not been a significant source of liquidity. We will need to acquire other profitable properties or obtain additional capital in order to expand operations and become profitable. In order to obtain capital, we may need to sell additional shares of our common stock or borrow funds from private lenders. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining additional funding.
To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities may result in dilution to existing stockholders. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities, these securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations. Regardless of whether our cash assets prove to be inadequate to meet our operational needs, we may seek to continue to compensate providers of services by issuance of stock in lieu of cash, which may also result in dilution to existing shareholders. Even if we are able to raise the funds required, it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and expenses, fail to collect significant amounts owed to us, or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek alternative financing.
No assurance can be given that sources of financing will be available to us and/or that demand for our equity/debt instruments will be sufficient to meet our capital needs, or that financing will be available on terms favorable to us. If funding is insufficient at any time in the future, we may not be able to take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or may be required to reduce the scope of our planned development, any of which could have a negative impact on our business and operating results. In addition, insufficient funding may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, which could require us to:
● Curtail our operations significantly, or
● Seek arrangements with strategic partners or other parties that may require us to relinquish significant rights to our development of resorts and correlated services, or
● Explore other strategic alternatives including a merger or sale of our Company.

Our ability to continue as a going concern is still dependent on our success in obtaining additional financing from investors.
Critical Accounting Polices
In December 2001, the SEC requested that all registrants list their “critical accounting polices” in the Management Discussion and Analysis. The SEC indicated that a “critical accounting policy” is one which is both important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results, and requires management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2 of our audited consolidated financial statements included herein. We consider the following accounting policies critical to the understanding of the results of our operations:
● Going concern,
● Revenue recognition,
● Issuance with debt with attached financial instruments.
Off-balance Sheet Arrangements
Since our inception through December 31, 2020, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The recent accounting pronouncements that are material to our financial statements are disclosed in Note 1 of our consolidated audited financial statements included herein.
