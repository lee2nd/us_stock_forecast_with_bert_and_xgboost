During the year ended April 30, 2021, the Company recorded operating expenses of $2,964,408 compared to $259,217 during the year ended April 30, 2020. The increase in operating expenses was due to an impairment loss on the Company’s acquisition of oil and gas properties of $1,927,810, as the Company acquired multiple oil and gas royalty interests during the year that was subject to impairment testing. Although the Company recorded the impairment loss in accordance with ASC 932, the Company continues to focus on all oil and gas interests that it required during the year and intends to acquire more oil and gas interests moving forward. In addition, the Company had increases in consulting fees of $81,300, general and administrative costs of $459,632, management fees of $165,970, and professional fees of $68,910 due to an overall increase in operating activity during the year.

As of April 30, 2021, the Company's total asset balance was $3,217,998, compared to $1,631 as at April 30, 2020. The increase in total assets was due to increases in cash of $2,086,266 due to financing received from the issuance of common shares during the year, $895,487 relating to the carrying value of oil and gas interests acquired during the year, $86,744 of accounts receivable relating to royalty receivable from the Company’s oil and gas interests. $115,478 of right-of -use assets relating to the Company’s operating lease on its head office.
As of April 30, 2021, the Company had total liabilities of $562,242 compared with total liabilities of $3,136,509 as at April 30, 2020. The decrease in total liabilities was due to the settlement of outstanding convertible debentures during the year which resulted in a decrease of carrying value of convertible debentures of $563,522, a decrease in derivative liability of $1,597,049 due to a lower amount of debt that is subject to variable conversion rates, and a decrease of $368,060 on the convertible preferred series B liability due to conversions into common shares during the year. The amounts were offset by an increase in operating lease liability of $125,811 for the operating lease of the Company’s head office. The remaining differences were due to normal timing differences between settlement of accounts payable and accrued liabilities and amounts due to related parties.
As of April 30, 2021, the Company had a working capital of $1,723,019 compared with a working capital deficit of $3,134,878 as of April 30, 2020.

Critical Accounting Policies
Our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in the notes to our financial statements. In general, management's estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.
