Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
You should read this MD&A together with our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020 and the accompanying notes. This MD&A does not discuss 2018 performance or a comparison of 2018 versus 2019 performance for select areas where we have determined the omitted information is not necessary to understand our current-period financial condition, changes in our financial condition, or our results. The omitted information may be found in our 2019 Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 13, 2020, in MD&A sections titled “Consolidated Results of Operations,” “Single-Family Business,” “Multifamily Business,” and “Liquidity and Capital Management.”
Key Market Economic Indicators
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant adverse effect on both the U.S. and global economies. Below we discuss how varying macroeconomic conditions can influence our financial results across different business and economic environments. See “Executive Summary-COVID-19 Impact” for additional information on the effects of the pandemic on the economy and the uncertainty associated with its ultimate impact on our business and financial results.
Our forecasts and expectations relating to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic are subject to many uncertainties and may change, perhaps substantially, from our current forecasts and expectations.

How interest rates can affect our financial results
•Net interest income. In a rising interest-rate environment, our mortgage loans tend to prepay more slowly, which typically results in lower net amortization income from cost basis adjustments on mortgage loans and related debt. Conversely, in a declining interest-rate environment, our mortgage loans tend to prepay faster,

typically resulting in higher net amortization income from cost basis adjustments on mortgage loans and related debt.
•Fair value gains (losses). We have exposure to fair value gains and losses resulting from changes in interest rates, primarily through our mortgage commitment derivatives and risk management derivatives, which we mark to market through earnings. Fair value gains and losses on our mortgage commitment derivatives fluctuate depending on how interest rates and prices move between the time the commitment is opened and settled. The net position and composition across the yield curve of our risk management derivatives changes over time. As a result, interest rate changes (increases or decreases) and yield curve changes (parallel, steepening or flattening shifts) will generate varying amounts of fair value gains or losses in a given period. In January 2021, we implemented fair value hedge accounting to reduce the impact of interest-rate volatility on our financial results. For additional information on the expected impact of hedge accounting, see “Consolidated Results of Operations-Fair Value Losses, Net.”
•Credit-related income (expense). Increases in mortgage interest rates tend to lengthen the expected lives of our loans, which generally increases the expected impairment and provision for credit losses on such loans. Decreases in mortgage interest rates tend to shorten the expected lives of our loans, which reduces the impairment and provision for credit losses on such loans.
Single-Family Annual Home Price Growth Rate(1)
(1) Calculated internally using property data on loans purchased by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other third-party home sales data. Fannie Mae’s home price index is a weighted repeat transactions index, measuring average price changes in repeat sales on the same properties. Fannie Mae’s home price index excludes prices on properties sold in foreclosure. Fannie Mae’s home price estimates are based on preliminary data and are subject to change as additional data becomes available.
How home prices can affect our financial results
•Actual and forecasted home prices impact our provision or benefit for credit losses.
•Changes in home prices affect the amount of equity that borrowers have in their homes. Borrowers with less equity typically have higher delinquency and default rates.
•As home prices increase, the severity of losses we incur on defaulted loans that we hold or guarantee decreases because the amount we can recover from the properties securing the loans increases. Declines in home prices increase the losses we incur on defaulted loans.
•Home price growth in 2020 was very robust at 10.5% despite the COVID-19 pandemic, benefiting from continued low interest rates, low levels of supply and high levels of demand, particularly from first-time homebuyers.
•We currently expect home price growth on a national basis to slow to 4.5% in 2021, which is an improvement from our prior forecast but lower than the exceptionally strong home price growth we saw in 2020. However, higher-than-expected increases in supply or decreases in demand could lead to decreases or slower growth in home prices. We also expect significant regional variation in the timing and rate of home price growth.
•Our forecasts and expectations relating to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic are subject to many uncertainties and may change, perhaps substantially, from our current forecasts and expectations. For example, home price growth could slow and potentially decline if GDP growth is weaker than we currently expect, if unemployment, particularly among existing homeowners and potential new home buyers, is higher than we expect, or if the housing market is more sensitive to economic and labor-market weaknesses than we

expect. For further discussion on housing activity, see “Single-Family Business-Single-Family Mortgage Market” and “Multifamily Business-Multifamily Mortgage Market.”
New Housing Starts(1)
(1)According to U.S. Census Bureau and subject to revision.
How housing activity can affect our financial results
•Two key aspects of economic activity that can impact supply and demand for housing and thus mortgage lending are the rates of household formation and housing construction.
•Household formation is a key driver of demand for both single-family and multifamily housing. A newly formed household will either rent or purchase a home. Thus, changes in the pace of household formation can affect prices and credit performance as well as the degree of loss on defaulted loans.
•Growth of household formation stimulates homebuilding. Homebuilding has typically been a cyclical leading indicator, weakening prior to a slowdown in U.S. economic activity and accelerating prior to a recovery, which contributes to the growth of GDP and employment. However, the housing sector’s performance may vary from its historical precedent due to the many uncertainties related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy and the housing market, as well as uncertainty surrounding future economic or housing policy.
•With regard to housing construction, a decline in housing starts results in fewer new homes being available for purchase and potentially a lower volume of mortgage originations. Construction activity can also affect credit losses through its impact on home prices. If the growth of demand exceeds the growth of supply, prices will appreciate and impact the risk profile of newly originated home purchase mortgages, depending on where in the housing cycle the market is. A reduced pace of construction is often associated with a broader economic slowdown and may signal expected increases in delinquency and losses on defaulted loans.
•After falling sharply in the second quarter, home sales rebounded significantly in the second half of 2020 as purchase demand strengthened due to the low mortgage-rate environment and pent-up demand from the earlier pandemic-related declines, among other factors.
•Given both the current strength in demand and low supply of existing and new homes available for sale at the end of the year, we expect single-family housing starts in 2021 to exceed 2020 levels by 18.6%, with overall housing activity also remaining strong throughout 2021.
Fannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 65
MD&A | Key Market Economic Indicators
•We expect multifamily starts to remain mostly flat in 2021 compared with the levels seen at the end of 2020; however, due primarily to the high level of multifamily starts at the beginning of 2020, multifamily starts are projected to fall by 13.0% on an annual basis in 2021.
GDP, Unemployment Rate and Personal Consumption
(1)GDP growth (decline) and personal consumption growth (decline) for periods prior to the fourth quarter of 2020 are based on the quarterly series calculated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and are subject to revision.
(2)According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and subject to revision.
How GDP, the unemployment rate and personal consumption can affect our financial results
•Changes in GDP, the unemployment rate and personal consumption can affect several mortgage market factors, including the demand for both single-family and multifamily housing and the level of loan delinquencies, which in turn can lead to credit losses.
•Economic growth is a key factor for the performance of mortgage-related assets. In a growing economy, employment and income are rising, thus allowing existing borrowers to meet payment requirements, existing homeowners to consider purchasing and moving to another home, and renters to consider becoming homeowners. Homebuilding typically increases to meet the rise in demand. Mortgage delinquencies typically fall in an expanding economy, thereby decreasing credit losses.
•In a slowing economy, employment and income growth slow and housing activity slows as an early indicator of reduced economic activity. Typically, as an economic slowdown intensifies, households reduce their spending. This reduction in consumption then accelerates the slowdown. An economic slowdown can lead to employment losses, impairing the ability of borrowers and renters to meet mortgage and rental payments, thus causing loan delinquencies to rise. Home sales and mortgage originations also typically fall in a slowing economy.
Fannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 66
MD&A | Key Market Economic Indicators
•The impact of COVID-19 resulted in a significant decline in GDP and a significant rise in the unemployment rate in the first half of 2020, with partial recovery in the second half of 2020 resulting in estimated negative GDP of 3.5% for the full year compared to the 2019 annual level. We expect economic recovery to continue into 2021, as we expect the positive impacts of further stimulus, increased vaccinations and reduction of lockdown measures should help spur economic growth, particularly beginning in the spring. We expect positive GDP growth of 6.1% for 2021.

MD&A | Consolidated Results of Operations
Net Interest Income
Our primary source of net interest income is guaranty fees we receive for managing the credit risk on loans underlying Fannie Mae MBS held by third parties.
Guaranty fees consist of two primary components:
•base guaranty fees that we receive over the life of the loan; and
•upfront fees that we receive at the time of loan acquisition primarily related to single-family loan-level pricing adjustments and other fees we receive from lenders, which are amortized into net interest income as cost basis adjustments over the contractual life of the loan. We refer to this as amortization income.
We recognize almost all of our guaranty fee revenue in net interest income because we consolidate the substantial majority of loans underlying our Fannie Mae MBS in consolidated trusts in our consolidated balance sheets. Guaranty fees from these loans account for the difference between the interest income on loans in consolidated trusts and the interest expense on the debt of consolidated trusts.
The timing of when we recognize amortization income can vary based on a number of factors, the most significant of which is a change in mortgage interest rates. In a rising interest-rate environment, our mortgage loans tend to prepay more slowly, which typically results in lower net amortization income. Conversely, in a declining interest-rate environment, our mortgage loans tend to prepay faster, typically resulting in higher net amortization income.
We also recognize net interest income on the difference between interest income earned on the assets in our retained mortgage portfolio and our other investments portfolio (collectively, our “portfolios”) and the interest expense associated with the debt that funds those assets. See “Retained Mortgage Portfolio” and “Liquidity and Capital Management-Liquidity Management-Other Investments Portfolio” for more information about our portfolios.
The table below displays the components of our net interest income from our guaranty book of business, which we discuss in “Guaranty Book of Business,” and from our portfolios. Prior-period amounts have been adjusted to reflect the current-year change in presentation related to our yield maintenance fees. See “Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for more information about our change in presentation.

(3)Includes interest income from assets held in our retained mortgage portfolio and our other investments portfolio, as well as other assets used to generate lender liquidity. Also includes interest expense on our outstanding Connecticut Avenue Securities of $857 million in 2020 and $1.4 billion in both 2019 and 2018.
Net interest income increased in 2020 compared with 2019 and in 2019 compared with 2018, driven by higher net amortization income and higher base guaranty fee income, partially offset by lower income from portfolios.
•Higher net amortization income. A declining interest-rate environment in 2020 and 2019 led to increased prepayment volumes as loans refinanced, which accelerated the amortization of cost basis adjustments on mortgage loans of consolidated trusts and the related debt.
When refinance activity slows, we expect the amortization rate of our loans to also slow, which will likely result in less amortization income.
Fannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 68
MD&A | Consolidated Results of Operations
•Higher base guaranty fee income. An increase in the size of our guaranty book of business combined with loans with higher average base guaranty fees comprising a greater portion of our book contributed to the increase in base guaranty fee income in 2020 and 2019.
•Lower income from portfolios. Lower yields in 2020 on mortgage loans and assets in our other investments portfolio, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on our funding debt as key benchmark rates declined as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, contributed to a decline in income from portfolios in 2020. We discuss the impact of COVID-19 on our funding needs and funding activity in “Liquidity and Capital Management-Liquidity Management-Debt Funding.”
Sales of reperforming loans as well as liquidations in 2019 reduced the average balance of our retained mortgage portfolio, which contributed to lower income from portfolios in 2019. This was partially offset by increased interest income in our other investment portfolio due to higher short-term interest rates on our federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell or similar arrangements, and a higher average balance of non-mortgage related securities.
Given the historically low interest-rate environment throughout 2020, we acquired a higher-than-usual portion of our outstanding book of business over the last 12 months, with 38% of the loans in our single-family conventional guaranty book of business as of December 31, 2020 being originated during 2020. We expect mortgage rates to remain low through 2021, contributing to continued mortgage refinance activity and high levels of amortization income. Because a large portion of our book of business has been and is expected to be originated in a historically low interest rate environment, we anticipate that refinancing activity will decrease at some point in the future as fewer borrowers can benefit from a refinancing or as interest rates rise. Lower levels of refinancing in the future will likely slow the rate at which we amortize cost basis adjustments and therefore will likely result in lower amortization income in any one period as the average life of our outstanding book of business may extend. In addition, a slower turnover rate would limit the impact that changes in our guaranty fees have on our future revenues as any changes would take longer to meaningfully impact the average charged guaranty fee on our total book of business.
Net Interest Income for Loans Negatively Impacted by COVID-19
We have updated the application of our accounting policy for nonaccrual loans as it relates to loans negatively impacted by COVID-19. As a result, for loans that were current as of March 1, 2020 and subsequently become delinquent, we continue to accrue interest income for up to six months pursuant to an April 2020 Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus (the “Interagency Statement”). For single-family, if those loans are in a forbearance plan beyond six months of delinquency, we continue to accrue interest income provided collection of principal and interest continues to be reasonably assured. Multifamily loans that are in a forbearance plan are placed on nonaccrual status when the borrower is six months past due unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection.
As a result of this update, in 2020 we recognized $2.8 billion in interest income related to these loans that we would not have recognized prior to the application of our updated policy, and we recognized $216 million of provision for loan losses on the related accrued interest receivable in 2020. For those single-family loans that remain on accrual status as of period end, and where we continue to accrue interest after six or more contractual payments were past due, we recognized in total $1.6 billion of interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020, and $151 million of provision for loan losses on the related accrued interest receivable for the year ended December 31, 2020. This update also resulted in a significant portion of delinquent loans staying on accrual status. See “Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for more information about our accounting policy update and “Single-Family Business-Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management-Single-Family Problem Loan Management” and “Multifamily Business-Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk Management-Multifamily Problem Loan Management and Foreclosure Prevention” for details about loans in forbearance, as well as on-balance sheet loans past due 90 days or more and continuing to accrue interest.

Analysis of Net Interest Income
The table below displays an analysis of our net interest income, average balances and related yields earned on assets and incurred on liabilities. For most components of the average balances, we use a daily weighted average of unpaid principal balance net of unamortized cost basis adjustments. When daily average balance information is not available, such as for mortgage loans, we use monthly averages. Prior-period amounts have been adjusted to reflect the current-year change in presentation related to our yield maintenance fees.

Analysis of Deferred Amortization Income
We initially recognize mortgage loans and debt of consolidated trusts in our consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The difference between the initial fair value and the carrying value of these instruments is recorded as a cost basis adjustment, either as a premium or a discount, in our consolidated balance sheets. We amortize these cost basis adjustments over the contractual lives of the loans or debt. On a net basis, for mortgage loans and debt of consolidated trusts, we are in a premium position with respect to debt of consolidated trusts, which represents deferred income we will recognize in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income as amortization income in future periods. The amount of our deferred amortization income decreased in 2020 primarily as a result of high refinance volumes.

Investment gains, net primarily includes gains and losses recognized from the sale of available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities, sale of loans, gains and losses recognized on the consolidation and deconsolidation of securities, and lower of cost or fair value adjustments on held for sale (“HFS”) loans. Investment gains, net decreased during 2020 compared with 2019 primarily driven by a significant decrease in the volume of sales of single-family HFS loans. Investment gains, net increased during 2019 compared with 2018 primarily driven by an increase in gains on sales of single-family HFS loans.

The estimated fair value of our derivatives, trading securities and other financial instruments carried at fair value may fluctuate substantially from period to period because of changes in interest rates, the yield curve, mortgage and credit spreads and implied volatility, as well as activity related to these financial instruments. While the estimated fair value of our derivatives that serve to mitigate certain risk exposures may fluctuate, some of the financial instruments that generate these exposures are not recorded at fair value in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.
The table below displays the components of our fair value gains and losses.

Risk Management Derivatives Fair Value Gains (Losses), Net
Risk management derivative instruments are an integral part of our interest-rate risk management strategy. We supplement our issuance of debt securities with derivative instruments to further reduce duration risk, which includes prepayment risk. We purchase option-based risk management derivatives to economically hedge prepayment risk. In
Fannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 72
MD&A | Consolidated Results of Operations
cases where options obtained through callable debt issuances are not needed for risk management derivative purposes, we may sell options in the over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives market in order to offset the options obtained in the callable debt. Our principal purpose in using derivatives is to manage our aggregate interest-rate risk profile within prescribed risk parameters. We generally use only derivatives that are relatively liquid and straightforward to value. We consider the cost of derivatives used in our management of interest-rate risk to be an inherent part of the cost of funding and hedging our mortgage investments and economically similar to the interest expense that we recognize on the debt we issue to fund our mortgage investments.
We present, by derivative instrument type, the fair value gains and losses on our derivatives in “Note 8, Derivative Instruments.”
The primary factors that may affect the fair value of our risk management derivatives include the following:
•Changes in interest rates. Our primary derivative instruments are interest-rate swaps, including pay-fixed and receive-fixed interest-rate swaps. Pay-fixed swaps decrease in value and receive-fixed swaps increase in value as swap rates decrease (with the opposite being true when swap rates increase). Because the composition of our pay-fixed and receive-fixed derivatives varies across the yield curve, different yield curve changes (that is, parallel, steepening or flattening) will generate different gains and losses.
•Changes in our derivative activity. The mix and balance of our derivative portfolio changes from period to period as we enter into or terminate derivative instruments to respond to changes in interest rates and changes in the balances and modeled characteristics of our assets and liabilities. Changes in the composition of our derivative portfolio affect the derivative fair value gains and losses we recognize in a given period.
Additional factors that affect the fair value of our risk management derivatives include implied interest-rate volatility and the time value of purchased or sold options, among other factors.
We recognized total risk management derivatives fair value losses in 2020 and 2019, primarily as a result of net interest expense on interest-rate swaps combined with a decrease in the fair value of our interest-rate swaps due to the declines in swap rates during 2020 and 2019.
For additional information on our use of derivatives to manage interest-rate risk, see “Risk Management-Market Risk Management, Including Interest-Rate Risk Management-Interest-Rate Risk Management.”
Expected Impact of Hedge Accounting
We implemented fair value hedge accounting in January 2021 to reduce the impact of interest-rate volatility on our financial results. Under this hedge program, fair value gains and losses attributable to changes in certain benchmark interest rates, such as LIBOR or SOFR, for derivatives that are in a designated hedge relationship may be reduced by offsetting gains and losses in the fair value of designated hedged mortgage loans or debt. Therefore, we expect the volatility of our financial results associated with changes in fair value due to interest rates will be reduced substantially going forward. We expect fair value gains and losses driven by other factors, such as credit spreads, will continue. During the hedge period, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item will be recognized in net interest income.
Mortgage Commitment Derivatives Fair Value Gains (Losses), Net
We account for certain commitments to purchase or sell mortgage-related securities and to purchase single-family mortgage loans as derivatives. For open mortgage commitment derivatives, we include changes in their fair value in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. When derivative purchase commitments settle, we include the fair value of the commitment on the settlement date in the cost basis of the loan or security we purchase. When derivative commitments to sell securities settle, we include the fair value of the commitment on the settlement date in the cost basis of the security we sell. Purchases of securities issued by our consolidated MBS trusts are treated as extinguishments of debt; we recognize the fair value of the commitment on the settlement date as a component of debt extinguishment gains and losses in “Other expenses, net.” Sales of securities issued by our consolidated MBS trusts are treated as issuances of consolidated debt; we recognize the fair value of the commitment on the settlement date as a component of debt in the cost basis of the debt issued.
We recognized fair value losses on our mortgage commitments in 2020 and 2019 primarily due to losses on commitments to sell mortgage-related securities driven by increases in prices during the commitment periods as interest rates declined during 2020 and 2019.
Trading Securities Gains, Net
Gains on trading securities in 2020 and 2019 were primarily driven by declines in interest rates, which resulted in gains on fixed-rate securities held in portfolio.
Fannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 73

CAS Debt Fair Value Gains, Net
Credit risk transfer transactions, including CAS debt issuances, transfer a portion of credit losses on a reference pool of mortgage loans to investors. CAS debt we issued prior to 2016 is reported at fair value as “Debt of Fannie Mae” in our consolidated balance sheets. CAS debt issued subsequent to 2016 is not accounted for in a manner that generates fair value gains and losses. We expect our exposure to fair value gains and losses on CAS debt to continue to decline as the outstanding balance of this debt declines.
We recognized fair value gains on CAS debt reported at fair value in 2020 and 2019 primarily due to widened spreads between CAS debt yields and LIBOR.
For further discussion of our credit risk transfer transactions, see “Single-Family Business-Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management-Single-Family Credit Enhancement and Transfer of Mortgage Credit Risk-Credit Risk Transfer Transactions.”
Fair Value Option Debt of Consolidated Trusts Fair Value Gains (Losses), Net
We elected the fair value option for our long-term debt of consolidated trusts that contain embedded derivatives that would otherwise require bifurcation. The fair value of our long-term consolidated trust debt held at fair value is reported as “Debt of Consolidated Trusts” in our consolidated balance sheets. The changes in the fair value of our long-term consolidated trust debt held at fair value are included in “Other, net” in the table above.
We recognized fair value losses on our long-term debt of consolidated trusts held at fair value in 2020 and 2019 due to declines in interest rates.
Credit-Related Income (Expense)
Our credit-related income or expense can vary substantially from period to period based on a number of factors, such as changes in actual and forecasted home prices or property valuations, fluctuations in actual and forecasted interest rates, borrower payment behavior, events such as natural disasters or pandemics, the types and volume of our loss mitigation activities, including forbearances and loan modifications, the volume of foreclosures completed and the redesignation of loans from held for investment (“HFI”) to HFS. In recent periods, the redesignation of certain reperforming and nonperforming single-family loans has been a significant driver of credit-related income. We suspended new sales of reperforming and nonperforming loans in the second quarter of 2020, as investor interest in purchasing these loans was severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects. Market conditions for the sale of these loans, particularly reperforming loans, improved following the second quarter of 2020. As a result, we resumed sales of reperforming loans in the third quarter of 2020. However, our volume of nonperforming and reperforming loans sales in 2020 was still much less than 2019.
Our credit-related income or expense and our loss reserves can also be impacted by updates to the models, assumptions and data used in determining our allowance for loan losses. The January 1, 2020 CECL standard implementation introduced additional volatility in our financial results as credit-related income or expense now includes expected lifetime losses on our loans and thus is sensitive to fluctuations in the factors detailed above. Although CECL impacts the timing and amount of estimated credit-related income or expense recognized in any given period, it does not impact the amount of credit losses we ultimately realize at the time a loan is written-off.
As described below, since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, our credit-related income or expense and our loss reserves have been significantly affected by our estimates of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which require significant management judgment. Changes in our estimates of borrowers that will ultimately receive forbearance (referred to as our “cumulative forbearance take-up rate”) and even more significantly, the loss mitigation outcomes of affected borrowers after the forbearance period ends, remain uncertain and can affect the amount of credit-related income or expense we recognize. Although we believe the estimates underlying our allowance are reasonable, we may observe future volatility in these estimates as we continue to observe actual loan performance data and update our models and assumptions relating to this unprecedented event.

Provision for Credit Losses
The table below provides a quantitative analysis of the drivers in 2020 of our single-family and multifamily benefit or provision for credit losses and the decrease or increase in expected benefit from freestanding credit enhancements. The provision for credit losses includes our provision for loan losses, accrued interest receivable losses and our guaranty loss reserves, and excludes credit losses on our AFS securities. It also excludes the transition impact of adopting the CECL standard, which was recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2020. Many of the drivers that contribute to our provision for credit losses overlap or are interdependent. The attribution shown below is based on internal allocation estimates.

For multifamily, changes in loan activity also includes changes in the allowance due to loan delinquencies and the impact of changes in debt service coverage ratios (“DSCRs”) based on updated property financial information, which is used to assess loan credit quality.
(2)Includes changes in the allowance due to assumptions regarding loss mitigation when loans exit forbearance as well as adjustments to modeled results.
(3)Includes provision for allowance for accrued interest receivable. For single-family, also includes changes in the reserve for guaranty losses that are not separately included in the other components.
(4)Includes changes in expected credit enhancement recoveries only for active loans. Recoveries received after foreclosure, which are included in “Change in expected credit enhancement recoveries” in “Summary of Consolidated Results of Operations,” are not included.
The primary factors that contributed to our single-family provision for credit losses in 2020 were:
•Provision from changes in actual and expected loan delinquencies and change in assumptions regarding COVID-19 forbearance, which includes adjustments to modeled results. The economic dislocation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic was a significant driver of credit-related expenses during 2020, with the majority of the impact recognized in the first quarter of 2020. Estimating expected credit losses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to require significant management judgment regarding a number of matters, including our
Fannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 75
MD&A | Consolidated Results of Operations
expectations surrounding the length of time that loans remain in forbearance and the type and extent of loss mitigation that may be needed when loans exit a COVID-19-related forbearance, political uncertainty and the high degree of uncertainty regarding the future course of the pandemic, including new strains of the virus and its effect on the economy. As a result, we believe the model used to estimate single-family credit losses does not capture the entirety of losses we expect to incur relating to COVID-19. Accordingly, management used its judgment to significantly increase the loss projections developed by our credit loss model in the first quarter of 2020. The model has consumed data from the initial quarters of the pandemic, including loan delinquencies, and updated credit profile data for loans in forbearance. As more of this data was consumed by our credit loss model throughout the year, we have reduced the non-modeled adjustment initially recorded in the first quarter of 2020.
Management continued to apply its judgment and supplement model results as of December 31, 2020, taking into account the continued high degree of uncertainty regarding the future impact of the pandemic and its effect on the economy. In determining our allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2020, we estimated that 8.5% our single-family borrowers, calculated by loan count, would ultimately receive forbearance due to a COVID-19-related financial hardship. This represents a downward revision from the 15% take-up rate estimated as of March 31, 2020, which was revised based on recent economic data and actual forbearance activity observed during the last nine months of 2020. See “Single-Family Business-Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management-Single-Family Problem Loan Management-Single-Family Loans in Forbearance” for information on our single-family loans in forbearance.
The impact of these factors was partially offset by the impact of the following factors, which reduced our single-family provision for credit losses recognized in 2020:
•Benefit from actual and expected home price growth. In the first quarter of 2020, we significantly reduced our expectations for home price growth to near-zero for 2020. However, the negative impact from the first quarter of 2020 was more than offset by a robust increase in actual home price growth through the remainder of 2020 despite the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we also expect more moderate home price growth for 2021. See “Key Market Economic Indicators” for additional information about how home prices affect our credit loss estimates, including a discussion of our home price forecast.
•Benefit from lower actual and projected interest rates. For much of 2020, we continued to be in a historically low interest rate environment, which we expect to continue in 2021. As mortgage interest rates decline, we expect an increase in future prepayments on single-family loans, including modified loans. Higher expected prepayments shorten the expected lives of modified loans, which decreases the expected impairment relating to term and interest-rate concessions provided on these loans and results in a benefit for credit losses.
•Benefit from the redesignation of certain reperforming single-family loans from HFI to HFS. In the third quarter of 2020, we resumed sales of reperforming loans after our suspension of new loan sales in the second quarter of 2020. As a result, we redesignated certain reperforming single-family loans from HFI to HFS in the second half of 2020, as we no longer intend to hold them for the foreseeable future or to maturity. Upon redesignation of these loans, we recorded the loans at the lower of cost or fair value with a write-off against the allowance for loan losses. Amounts recorded in the allowance related to these loans exceeded the amounts written off, resulting in a benefit as shown in the table above.
Our multifamily provision for credit losses in 2020 was primarily driven by:
•Provision from actual and projected economic data and estimated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which includes adjustments to modeled results. Our multifamily provision for credit losses in 2020 was driven by higher expected losses as a result of the economic dislocation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and heightened economic uncertainty, driven by elevated unemployment, which we expect will result in a decrease in multifamily property income and property values. In addition, the multifamily provision for credit losses includes increased expected credit losses on seniors housing loans, as these properties have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. Consistent with the single-family discussion above, we believe the model we use to estimate multifamily credit losses does not capture the entirety of losses we expect to incur relating to COVID-19. Accordingly, management used its judgment to increase the loss projections developed by our credit loss model. The model has consumed data from the initial quarters of the pandemic, but we continue to apply management judgment and supplement model results as of December 31, 2020, taking into account the continued high degree of uncertainty that remains relating to the impact of the pandemic.

The table below provides quantitative analysis of the drivers in 2019 and 2018 of our single-family benefit for credit losses. The presentation of our components represents amounts recognized prior to our transition to the lifetime loss model prescribed by the CECL standard. Many of the drivers that contribute to our benefit for credit losses overlap or are interdependent. The attribution shown below is based on internal allocation estimates. The table does not include our multifamily provision for credit losses as the amounts in 2019 and 2018 were less than $50 million.

(2) Primarily consists of the impact of model and assumption changes and changes in the reserve for guaranty losses that are not separately included in the other components.
The primary factors that contributed to our single-family benefit for credit losses in 2019 were:
•The redesignation of certain reperforming single-family loans from HFI to HFS as we no longer intend to hold them for the foreseeable future or to maturity.
•During 2019, we enhanced the model used to estimate cash flows for individually impaired single-family loans within our allowance for loan losses. This enhancement was performed as a part of management’s routine model performance review process. In addition to incorporating recent loan performance data, this model enhancement better captures recent prepayment activity, default rates, and loss severity in the event of default. The enhancement resulted in a decrease in our allowance for loan losses and an incremental benefit for credit losses of approximately $850 million and is included in “Other” in the table above.
•An increase in actual and forecasted home prices. Higher home prices decrease the likelihood that loans will default and reduce the amount of credit loss on loans that do default, which impacts our estimate of losses and ultimately reduces our loss reserves and provision for credit losses.
•Changes in loan activity. Higher loan liquidation activity generally occurs during a lower interest-rate environment as loans prepay, and during the peak home buying season of the second and third quarters of each year. When mortgage loans prepay, we reverse any remaining allowance related to these loans, which contributed to the benefit for credit losses.
The primary factors that impacted our single-family benefit for credit losses in 2018 were:
•We recognized a benefit from the redesignation of certain reperforming and nonperforming single-family loans from HFI to HFS during the year.
•We recognized a benefit for credit losses due to higher actual and forecasted home prices in the year.
•The benefit for credit losses was partially offset by the impact of higher actual and projected mortgage interest rates. As mortgage interest rates rise, we expect a decrease in future prepayments on single-family loans, including modified loans. Lower expected prepayments lengthen the expected lives of modified loans, which increases the impairment relating to term and interest rate concessions provided on these loans and results in an increase in the provision for credit losses.

MD&A | Consolidated Results of Operations
TCCA Fees
Pursuant to the TCCA, in 2012 FHFA directed us to increase our single-family guaranty fees by 10 basis points and remit this increase to Treasury. This TCCA-related revenue is included in “Net interest income” and the expense is recognized as “TCCA fees” in our consolidated financial statements.
TCCA fees increased in 2020 compared with 2019 as our book of business subject to the TCCA continued to grow during the year. FHFA has provided guidance that we are not required to accrue or remit TCCA fees to Treasury with respect to loans backing MBS trusts that have been delinquent for four months or longer. Once payments on such loans resume, we will resume accrual and remittance to Treasury of the associated TCCA fees on the loans. See “Business-Legislation and Regulation-GSE Act and Other Legislative and Regulatory Matters-Guaranty Fees and Pricing” for further discussion of the TCCA.
Credit Enhancement Expense
Credit enhancement expense consists of costs associated with our freestanding credit enhancements, which primarily include our CAS and CIRT programs, EPMI, and amortization expense for certain lender risk-sharing programs. For our CAS and CIRT programs, this expense is generally based on the average balance of the covered reference pool. Therefore, the periodic expense at the transaction or security level generally increases or decreases as the covered balance increases or decreases, respectively. We exclude from this expense costs related to our CAS transactions accounted for as debt instruments and credit risk transfer programs accounted for as derivative instruments. Credit enhancement expense has been presented as a separate line item for all periods presented. In prior periods, credit enhancement expenses were recorded in “Other expenses, net.” We discuss the transfer of mortgage credit risk in “Single-Family Business-Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management-Single-Family Credit Enhancement and Transfer of Mortgage Credit Risk” and “Multifamily Business-Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk Management-Transfer of Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk.”
Change in Expected Credit Enhancement Recoveries
Change in expected credit enhancement recoveries consists of the change in benefits recognized from our freestanding credit enhancements, including any realized amounts. Benefits, if any, from our CAS, CIRT and EPMI programs previously recorded in “Fee and other income” have been reclassified to “Change in expected credit enhancement recoveries” for all periods presented. Benefits from other lender risk-sharing programs, including our multifamily Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (“DUS®”) program, were recorded as a reduction of credit-related expense in periods prior to 2020. However, with our adoption of the CECL standard on January 1, 2020, benefits from freestanding credit enhancements are no longer recorded as a reduction of credit-related expenses. These benefits from lender risk-sharing have been reclassified into “Change in expected credit enhancement recoveries” on a prospective basis beginning January 1, 2020.
Other Expenses, Net
Other expenses primarily consists of debt extinguishment gains and losses, housing trust fund expenses, loan subservicing costs, servicer fees paid in connection with certain loss mitigation activities, and gains and losses from partnership investments. Other expenses increased in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to an increase in housing trust fund expenses due to increases in acquisitions during the year. We expect our fees paid to servicers for loss mitigation work to increase into 2021 as single-family borrowers who received a COVID-19-related forbearance enter into various loss mitigation solutions once the forbearance period ends, such as repayment plans, payment deferrals or loan modifications. For additional information about our loans in forbearance, see “Single-Family Business-Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management-Single-Family Loans in Forbearance.”
Federal Income Taxes
We recognized provisions for federal income taxes of $3.1 billion in 2020, $3.4 billion in 2019 and $4.1 billion in 2018. Our provision for federal income taxes declined in 2020 compared with 2019 and in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily because of decreases in our pre-tax income. In addition, we recognized a benefit for federal income taxes in 2019 of $205 million as a result of a favorable resolution with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) of an uncertain tax position.
Our effective tax rates were 20.7% in 2020, 19.4% in 2019 and 20.6% in 2018. Our effective tax rates for each of these periods was also impacted by the benefits of our investments in housing projects eligible for low-income housing tax credits. See “Note 9, Income Taxes” for additional information on our income taxes.

Cash and Cash Equivalents and Federal Funds Sold and Securities Purchased under Agreements to Resell or Similar Arrangements and Investments in Securities
The increase in both (1) cash and cash equivalents and federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell or similar arrangements and (2) investments in securities from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by the investment of proceeds from new debt issuances, which we discuss in “Liquidity and Capital Management-Liquidity Management-Cash Flows” as well as proceeds from loan payoffs. These funds were mostly invested in U.S. Treasury securities at period end.
Restricted Cash
The increase in restricted cash from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by an increase in prepayments due to high refinance volumes for loans of consolidated trusts. The cash from these prepayments has been received from the borrower but not yet been remitted to MBS certificateholders. For information on our accounting policy for restricted cash, see “Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”
Mortgage Loans, Net of Allowance
The mortgage loans reported in our consolidated balance sheets are classified as either HFS or HFI and include loans owned by Fannie Mae and loans held in consolidated trusts.
Fannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 79
MD&A | Consolidated Balance Sheet Analysis
Mortgage loans, net of allowance for loan losses increased as of 2020 compared with 2019 primarily driven by:
•an increase in mortgage loans due to acquisitions, primarily from record levels of refinancing activity, outpacing liquidations and sales;
•partially offset by an increase in our allowance for loan losses we expect to incur as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of our adoption of the CECL standard on January 1, 2020.
For additional information on our mortgage loans, see “Note 3, Mortgage Loans,” and for additional information on changes in our allowance for loan losses, see “Note 4, Allowance for Loan Losses.”
Other Assets
The increase in other assets from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by an increase in advances to lenders. As interest rates declined during 2020, mortgage activity increased, resulting in higher funding needs by lenders. For information on our accounting policy for advances to lenders, see “Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”
Debt
Debt of consolidated trusts represents the amount of Fannie Mae MBS issued from consolidated trusts and held by third-party certificateholders. Debt of Fannie Mae is the primary means of funding our mortgage purchases. Debt of Fannie Mae also includes CAS debt, which we issued in connection with our transfer of mortgage credit risk. We provide a comparison of the mix between our outstanding short-term and long-term debt and a summary of activity in debt of Fannie Mae in “Liquidity and Capital Management-Liquidity Management-Debt Funding.” Also see “Note 7, Short-Term and Long-Term Debt” for additional information on our outstanding debt.
The increase in debt of Fannie Mae from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by long-term debt issuances to support elevated refinancing and purchase activity in preparation for the implementation in December 2020 of new liquidity risk management requirements issued by FHFA, and in support of current and potential future liquidity needs due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in debt of consolidated trusts from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by sales of Fannie Mae MBS, which are accounted for as issuances of debt of consolidated trusts in our consolidated balance sheets, since the MBS certificate ownership is transferred from us to a third party.
Stockholders’ Equity
Our net equity increased as of December 31, 2020 compared with December 31, 2019 by the amount of our comprehensive income recognized during 2020, partially offset by a charge of $1.1 billion to retained earnings due to our implementation of the CECL standard on January 1, 2020. See “Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-New Accounting Guidance-The Current Expected Credit Loss Standard” for further details.
The aggregate liquidation preference of the senior preferred stock increased from $138.0 billion as of September 30, 2020 to $142.2 billion as of December 31, 2020. For more information about how this liquidation preference is determined see “Business-Conservatorship, Treasury Agreements and Housing Finance Reform-Treasury Agreements-Senior Preferred Stock.”
Retained Mortgage Portfolio
We use our retained mortgage portfolio primarily to provide liquidity to the mortgage market through our whole loan conduit and to support our loss mitigation activities, particularly in times of economic stress when other sources of liquidity to the mortgage market may decrease or withdraw. Previously, we also used our retained mortgage portfolio for investment purposes.
Our retained mortgage portfolio consists of mortgage loans and mortgage-related securities that we own, including Fannie Mae MBS and non-Fannie Mae mortgage-related securities. Assets held by consolidated MBS trusts that back mortgage-related securities owned by third parties are not included in our retained mortgage portfolio.

MD&A | Retained Mortgage Portfolio
The chart below separates the instruments within our retained mortgage portfolio, measured by unpaid principal balance, into three categories based on each instrument’s use:
•Lender liquidity, which includes balances related to our whole loan conduit activity, supports our efforts to provide liquidity to the single-family and multifamily mortgage markets.
•Loss mitigation supports our loss mitigation efforts through the purchase of delinquent loans from our MBS trusts.
•Other represents assets that were previously purchased for investment purposes. More than half of the balance of “Other” as of December 31, 2020 consisted of Fannie Mae reverse mortgage securities and reverse mortgage loans. We expect the amount of assets in “Other” will continue to decline over time as they liquidate, mature or are sold.
Retained Mortgage Portfolio
(Dollars in billions)
The increase in our retained mortgage portfolio as of December 31, 2020 compared with December 31, 2019 was primarily due to an increase in our acquisitions of loans through our whole loan conduit, which primarily supports liquidity for small- to medium-sized lenders, during 2020 driven by higher mortgage refinance activity. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in our legacy investment portfolio due to continued liquidations of loans and a decrease in our loss mitigation portfolio due to the sale of reperforming loans. See “Executive Summary-Conservatorship, Treasury Agreements and Housing Finance Reform-Treasury Agreements-Covenants under Treasury Agreements” for information on new volume limitations related to single-family loan acquisitions through the our whole loan conduit under the terms of our senior preferred stock purchase agreement with Treasury.
The table below displays the components of our retained mortgage portfolio, measured by unpaid principal balance. Based on the nature of the asset, these balances are included in either “Investments in securities” or “Mortgage loans of Fannie Mae” in our Summary of Consolidated Balance Sheets shown above.

(3)Consists of Fannie Mae and Ginnie Mae reverse mortgage securities.
The amount of mortgage assets that we may own is capped at $250 billion and will decrease to $225 billion on December 31, 2022 under the terms of our senior preferred stock purchase agreement with Treasury. We are currently managing our business to a $225 billion cap pursuant to instructions from FHFA.
We include 10% of the notional value of interest-only securities in calculating the size of the retained portfolio for the purpose of determining compliance with the senior preferred stock purchase agreement retained portfolio limits and associated FHFA guidance. As of December 31, 2020, 10% of the notional value of our interest-only securities was $2.3 billion, which is not included in the table above.
Under the terms of our MBS trust documents, we have the option or, in some instances, the obligation, to purchase mortgage loans that meet specific criteria from an MBS trust. The purchase price for these loans is the unpaid principal balance of the loan plus accrued interest. If a delinquent loan remains in a single-family MBS trust, the servicer is responsible for advancing the borrower’s missed scheduled principal and interest payments to the MBS holders for up to four months, after which time we must make these missed payments. In addition, we must reimburse servicers for advanced principal and interest payments. The cost of purchasing most delinquent loans from a single-family Fannie Mae MBS trust and holding them in our retained mortgage portfolio is currently less than the cost of advancing delinquent payments to security holders.
In September 2020, FHFA instructed both us and Freddie Mac to extend the timeframe for our single-family delinquent loan buyout policy to 24 consecutively missed monthly payments (that is, loans that are 24 months past due) effective January 1, 2021. Despite this change in policy, we currently anticipate that in most cases we will purchase delinquent loans from single-family MBS trusts prior to the 24-month deadline under one of the exceptions to the general policy, which includes loans that are permanently modified, loans subject to a short-sale or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, loans that are paid in full and loans referred to foreclosure.
Fannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 82
MD&A | Retained Mortgage Portfolio
In support of our loss mitigation strategies, we purchased $13.5 billion of loans from our single-family MBS trusts during 2020, the substantial majority of which were delinquent, compared with $10.5 billion of loans purchased from single-family MBS trusts during 2019. We expect the amount of loans we buy out of trusts to increase in 2021 as a result of COVID-19-related loan delinquencies and loss mitigation strategies, which will increase the size of our retained mortgage portfolio, perhaps substantially. However, the volume of loans we ultimately buy, the timing of those purchases, and the length of time those loans remain in our retained mortgage portfolio remain highly uncertain and depend on a number of factors, including the success of our loss mitigation activities, particularly payment deferrals and repayment plans, which do not require us to purchase loans out of trust. Because of our mortgage asset limit, our business activities may be constrained. See “Single-Family Business-Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management-Single-Family Problem Loan Management-Single-Family Loans in Forbearance” and “Multifamily Business-Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk Management-Multifamily Problem Loan Management and Foreclosure Prevention” for information on our loans in forbearance.
Guaranty Book of Business
Our “guaranty book of business” consists of:
•Fannie Mae MBS outstanding, excluding the portions of any structured securities we issue that are backed by Freddie Mac securities;
•mortgage loans of Fannie Mae held in our retained mortgage portfolio; and
•other credit enhancements that we provide on mortgage assets.
“Total Fannie Mae guarantees” consists of:
•our guaranty book of business; and
•the portions of any structured securities we issue that are backed by Freddie Mac securities.
We and Freddie Mac began issuing single-family uniform mortgage-backed securities, or “UMBS®,” in June 2019. In this report, we use the term “Fannie Mae-issued UMBS” to refer to single-family Fannie Mae MBS that are directly backed by fixed-rate mortgage loans and generally eligible for trading in the to-be-announced (“TBA”) market. We use the term “Fannie Mae MBS” or “our MBS” to refer to any type of mortgage-backed security that we issue, including UMBS, Supers, Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit securities (“REMICs”) and other types of single-family or multifamily mortgage-backed securities.
Some Fannie Mae MBS that we issue are backed in whole or in part by Freddie Mac securities. When we resecuritize Freddie Mac securities into Fannie Mae-issued structured securities, such as Supers and REMICs, our guaranty of principal and interest extends to the underlying Freddie Mac securities. However, Freddie Mac continues to guarantee the payment of principal and interest on the underlying Freddie Mac securities that we have resecuritized. We do not charge an incremental guaranty fee to include Freddie Mac securities in the structured securities that we issue. References to our single-family guaranty book of business in this report exclude Freddie Mac-acquired mortgage loans underlying Freddie Mac securities that we have resecuritized.
The table below displays the composition of our guaranty book of business based on unpaid principal balance. Our single-family guaranty book of business accounted for 90% of our guaranty book of business as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.

Our total exposure as of December 31, 2019 to Freddie Mac securities backing Fannie Mae-issued REMICs may have been lower than the amount disclosed because a portion of the Freddie Mac securities backing these Fannie Mae-issued REMICs may have been backed by Fannie Mae MBS.
The GSE Act requires us to set aside each year an amount equal to 4.2 basis points of the unpaid principal balance of our new business purchases and to pay this amount to specified U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) and Treasury funds in support of affordable housing. In February 2020, we paid $280 million to the funds based on our new business purchases in 2019. For 2020, we recognized an expense of $603 million related to this obligation based on $1.4 trillion in new business purchases during the period. We expect to pay this amount to the funds in 2021. See “Business-Legislation and Regulation-GSE Act and Other Legislative and Regulatory Matters-Affordable Housing Allocations” for more information regarding this obligation.
Business Segments
We conduct business in the U.S. residential mortgage markets and the global securities market. According to the Federal Reserve, total U.S. residential mortgage debt outstanding was estimated to be approximately $13.2 trillion as of September 30, 2020 (the latest date for which information is available). We owned or guaranteed mortgage assets representing approximately 26% of total U.S. residential mortgage debt outstanding as of September 30, 2020.
We have two reportable business segments: Single-Family and Multifamily. The Single-Family business operates in the secondary mortgage market relating to single-family mortgage loans, which are secured by properties containing four or fewer residential dwelling units. The Multifamily business operates in the secondary mortgage market relating primarily to multifamily mortgage loans, which are secured by properties containing five or more residential units.
The chart below displays the net revenues and net income for each of our business segments. Net revenues consist of net interest income and fee and other income.
Business Segment Net Revenues and Net Income
(Dollars in billions)
Fannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 84
MD&A | Business Segments
Segment Allocation Methodology
The majority of our assets, revenues and expenses are directly associated with each respective business segment and are included in determining its asset balance and operating results. Those assets, revenues and expenses that are not directly attributable to a particular business segment are allocated based on the size of each segment’s guaranty book of business. The substantial majority of our gains and losses associated with our risk management derivatives are allocated to our Single-Family business segment.
In the following sections, we describe each segment’s primary business activities, customers, competitive and market conditions, business metrics, and financial results. We also describe how each segment manages mortgage credit risk and its credit metrics.
Single-Family Business
Single-Family Primary Business Activities
Providing Liquidity for Single-Family Mortgage Loans
Working with our lender customers, our Single-Family business provides liquidity to the mortgage market primarily by acquiring single-family loans from lenders and securitizing those loans into Fannie Mae MBS, which are either delivered to the lenders or sold to investors or dealers. We describe our securitization transactions and the types of Fannie Mae MBS that we issue in “Business-Mortgage Securitizations” above. Our Single-Family business also supports liquidity in the mortgage market and the businesses of our lender customers through other activities, such as issuing structured Fannie Mae MBS backed by single-family mortgage assets and buying and selling single-family agency mortgage-backed securities.
Our Single-Family business securitizes and purchases primarily conventional (not federally insured or guaranteed) single-family fixed-rate or adjustable-rate, first-lien mortgage loans, or mortgage-related securities backed by these types of loans. We also securitize or purchase loans insured by FHA, loans guaranteed by the VA, loans guaranteed by the Rural Development Housing and Community Facilities Program of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, manufactured housing mortgage loans and other mortgage-related securities.
Single-Family Mortgage Servicing
Our single-family mortgage loans are serviced by mortgage servicers on our behalf. Some loans are serviced by the lenders that initially sold the loans to us. In other cases, loans are serviced by third-party servicers that did not originate or sell the loans to us. For loans we own or guarantee, the lender or servicer must obtain our approval before selling servicing rights to another servicer.
Our mortgage servicers typically collect and deliver principal and interest payments, administer escrow accounts, monitor and report on loan performance, perform default prevention activities, evaluate transfers of ownership interests, respond to requests for partial releases of security, and handle proceeds from casualty and condemnation losses. Our mortgage servicers are the primary point of contact for borrowers and perform a key role in the effective implementation of our servicing policies, negotiation of workouts for delinquent and troubled loans, and other loss mitigation activities. If necessary, mortgage servicers inspect and preserve properties and process foreclosures and bankruptcies. For information on the risks of our reliance on servicers, refer to “Risk Factors-Credit Risk.”
We compensate servicers primarily by permitting them to retain a specified portion of each interest payment on a serviced mortgage loan as a servicing fee. Servicers also generally retain assumption fees, late payment charges and other similar charges, to the extent they are collected from borrowers, as additional servicing compensation. We also compensate servicers for negotiating workouts on problem loans.
Our servicers are required to develop, follow and maintain written procedures relating to loan servicing and legal compliance in accordance with our Servicing Guide. We oversee servicer compliance with our Servicing Guide requirements and execution of our loss mitigation programs by conducting reviews of select servicers. These reviews are designed to test a servicer’s quality control processes and compliance with our requirements across key servicing functions. Issues identified through these Servicing Guide compliance reviews are provided to the servicer with prescribed corrective actions and expected resolution due dates, and we monitor servicers’ remediation of their compliance issues.
Performance management staff measure, monitor and manage overall servicer performance by providing loss mitigation workout projections to targeted servicers, discussing performance against projections and tracking action items to improve, and following up on remediation of findings identified from compliance reviews. Additionally, we employ a servicer performance management program, called the STARTM Program, which provides our largest servicers a
Fannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 85
MD&A | Single-Family Business
transparent framework of key metrics and operational assessments to recognize strong performance and identify areas of weakness.
Repercussions for poor performance by a servicer may include performance improvement plans, lost incentive income, compensatory fees, monetary and non-monetary remedies, and reduced opportunity for STAR Program recognition. If poor performance persists, servicing may ultimately be transferred to a different servicer.
Single-Family Credit Risk and Credit Loss Management
Our Single-Family business:
•Prices and manages the credit risk on loans in our single-family guaranty book of business through our loan acquisition policies.
•Works to reduce costs of defaulted single-family loans through home retention solutions and foreclosure alternatives, management of foreclosures and our REO inventory, selling nonperforming loans, and pursuing contractual remedies from lenders, servicers and providers of credit enhancement.
•Enters into transactions that transfer a portion of the credit risk on some of the loans in our single-family guaranty book of business through our credit risk transfer programs.
See “Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management” below for discussion of our strategies for managing credit risk and credit losses on single-family loans.
Single-Family Customers
Our principal single-family customers are lenders that operate within the primary mortgage market where mortgage loans are originated and funds are loaned to borrowers. Our customers include mortgage banking companies, savings and loan associations, savings banks, commercial banks, credit unions, community banks, private mortgage originators, insurance companies, and state and local housing finance agencies. Lenders originating mortgages in the primary mortgage market often sell them in the secondary mortgage market in the form of whole loans or in the form of mortgage-related securities.
During 2020, approximately 1,200 lenders delivered single-family mortgage loans to us. We acquire a significant portion of our single-family mortgage loans from several large mortgage lenders. During 2020, our top five lender customers, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately 31% of our single-family business volume, compared with approximately 44% in 2019. Rocket Companies, Inc., including its subsidiary Quicken Loans, LLC, was the only customer that accounted for 10% or more of our single-family business volume in 2020, representing approximately 12%.
We have a diversified funding base of domestic and international investors. Purchasers of single-family Fannie Mae MBS include asset managers, commercial banks, pension funds, insurance companies, Treasury, central banks, corporations, state and local governments, and other municipal authorities. Our CAS investors include asset managers, real estate investment trusts, hedge funds and insurance companies, while our CIRT transaction counterparties are insurers and reinsurers.
Single-Family Competition
We compete to acquire single-family mortgage assets in the secondary market. We also compete for the issuance of single-family mortgage-related securities to investors. Competition in these areas is affected by many factors, including the number of residential mortgage loans offered for sale in the secondary market by loan originators and other market participants, the nature of the residential mortgage loans offered for sale (for example, whether the loans represent refinancings), the current demand for mortgage assets from mortgage investors, the interest-rate risk investors are willing to assume and the yields they will require as a result, and the credit risk and prices associated with available mortgage investments.
Competition to acquire mortgage assets is significantly affected by both our and our competitors’ pricing and eligibility standards, as well as investor demand for UMBS and for our and our competitors’ other mortgage-related securities. Our competitive environment also may be affected by many other factors, including our risk appetite and capital requirements; new or existing legislation or regulations applicable to us, our customers or our investors; and digital innovation and disruption in our markets. The Director of FHFA has indicated that, during conservatorship, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should reduce competition with each other and FHA. As a result, in order to successfully acquire loans in the secondary market, we focus on understanding what drives our customers’ execution decisions and identifying how to best deliver value. See “Business-Conservatorship, Treasury Agreements and Housing Finance Reform,” “Business-Legislation and Regulation,” and “Risk Factors” for information on matters that could affect our business and competitive environment.
Fannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 86
MD&A | Single-Family Business
Our competitors for the acquisition of single-family mortgage assets are financial institutions and government agencies that manage residential mortgage credit risk or invest in residential mortgage loans, including Freddie Mac, FHA, the VA, Ginnie Mae (which primarily guarantees securities backed by FHA-insured loans and VA-guaranteed loans), the FHLBs, U.S. banks and thrifts, securities dealers, insurance companies, pension funds, investment funds and other mortgage investors. In 2020, our primary competitors for the issuance of single-family mortgage-related securities were Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae, as many private market competitors dramatically reduced or ceased their activities in the single-family secondary mortgage market in early 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic started to impact market confidence. Competition for investors and counterparties in our credit risk transfer transactions comes primarily from other issuers of mortgage credit risk transactions, such as Freddie Mac and private mortgage insurers. We also compete for investor funds against other credit-related securitized products, such as private-label residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”), commercial RMBS, and collateralized loan obligations. As noted above, the nature of our primary competitors and the overall levels of competition we face could change as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside our control.
Single-Family Mortgage Market
In the charts below we present macroeconomic factors that affect the single-family mortgage market in which our Single-Family business operates. Home sales and the supply of unsold homes are indicators of the underlying demand for mortgage loans, which impacts our acquisition volumes.

Single-Family Mortgage Acquisition Share
The chart below displays our estimated share of single-family mortgage acquisitions in 2020 as compared with that of our primary competitors. Our acquisition share estimate is based on publicly available data regarding the amount of single-family first-lien mortgage loans originated and our competitors’ acquisitions. We exclude our purchase of delinquent loans from our MBS trusts in the calculation of our estimated share.
2020 Single-Family Mortgage Acquisition Share
Fannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 88
MD&A | Single-Family Business | Single-Family Market Activity
The table below shows our estimated share of mortgage acquisitions from 2000 through 2020. Our share of total mortgage acquisitions has fluctuated and is often impacted by economic cycles. For example, during periods of recession, our acquisition share has historically increased as some other market competitors reduced their acquisitions.
Fannie Mae Single-Family Acquisition Share of Total Market Originations(1)
(1) Acquisition share is calculated as the ratio of Fannie Mae single-family acquisitions over our estimate of total market originations. We exclude our purchase of delinquent loans from our MBS trusts in the calculation of our acquisition share. Acquisition share is subject to change as additional data become available. Prior-period amounts have been updated to reflect revised acquisition data.
(2) Recession periods include any year in which any month in that year is determined to be recessionary by the National Bureau of Economic Research.
Single-Family Mortgage-Related Securities Issuances Share
Our single-family Fannie Mae MBS issuances were $1.34 trillion in 2020, compared with $591.1 billion in 2019 and $470.5 billion in 2018. The significant increase in 2020 compared with 2019 was driven by a very high volume of refinance activity due to historically low mortgage rates. Based on the latest data available, the chart below displays our estimated share of single-family mortgage-related securities issuances in 2020 as compared with that of our primary competitors for the issuance of single-family mortgage-related securities.
We estimate our share of single-family mortgage-related securities issuances was 37% in 2019 and 39% 2018.

Presentation of Our Single-Family Guaranty Book of Business
For purposes of the information reported in this “Single-Family Business” section, we measure the single-family guaranty book of business using the unpaid principal balance of our mortgage loans underlying Fannie Mae MBS outstanding. By contrast, the single-family guaranty book of business presented in the “Composition of Fannie Mae Guaranty Book of Business” table in the “Guaranty Book of Business” section is based on the unpaid principal balance of the Fannie Mae MBS outstanding, rather than the unpaid principal balance of the underlying mortgage loans. These amounts differ primarily as a result of payments we receive on underlying loans that have not yet been remitted to the MBS holders. As measured for purposes of the information reported below, our single-family conventional guaranty book of business was $3,200.9 billion as of December 31, 2020, $2,951.9 billion as of December 31, 2019 and $2,903.3 billion as of December 31, 2018.
Single-Family Business Metrics
Net interest income for our Single-Family business is driven by the guaranty fees we charge and the size of our single-family conventional guaranty book of business. Our business volume and growth in our guaranty book of business is affected by the rate of growth in total U.S. residential mortgage debt outstanding, the size of the U.S. residential mortgage market and our share of mortgage acquisitions. The guaranty fees we charge are based on the characteristics of the loans we acquire. We may adjust our guaranty fees in light of market conditions and to achieve return targets, which are based on FHFA’s conservatorship capital framework that currently applies to Fannie Mae. As a result, the average charged guaranty fee on new acquisitions may fluctuate based on the credit quality and product mix of loans acquired, as well as market conditions and other factors.
We implemented a new adverse market refinance fee effective December 1, 2020. The new fee is intended to help us offset some of the higher projected expenses and risk due to COVID-19. For every $1 billion in eligible refinance loans we acquire, we will collect $5 million in adverse market refinance fees, which will be amortized into net interest income over the contractual life of the loans as a cost basis adjustment. See “Executive Summary-COVID-19 Impact” for additional information on the new adverse market refinance fee.
The charts below display our average charged guaranty fees, net of TCCA fees, on our single-family conventional guaranty book of business and on new single-family conventional loan acquisitions, along with our average single-family conventional guaranty book of business and our single-family conventional loan acquisitions for the periods presented.

(1) Excludes the impact of a 10 basis-point guaranty fee increase implemented pursuant to the TCCA, the incremental revenue from which is remitted to Treasury and not retained by us.
(2) Our single-family conventional guaranty book of business primarily consists of single-family conventional mortgage loans underlying Fannie Mae MBS outstanding. It also includes single-family conventional mortgage loans of Fannie Mae held in our retained mortgage portfolio, and other credit enhancements that we provide on single-family conventional mortgage assets. Our single-family conventional guaranty book of business does not include: (a) non-Fannie Mae single-family mortgage-related securities held in our retained mortgage portfolio for which we do not provide a guaranty; (b) mortgage loans guaranteed or insured, in whole or in part, by the U.S. government; or (c) Freddie Mac-acquired mortgage loans underlying Freddie Mac-issued UMBS that we have resecuritized. Our average single-family conventional guaranty book of business is based on quarter-end balances.
Average charged guaranty fee represents the sum of the average base guaranty fees during the period for our single-family conventional guaranty arrangements, which we receive over the life of the loan, plus the recognition of any upfront cash payments, including loan-level pricing adjustments and the recently implemented adverse market fee, based on an estimated average life at the time of acquisition. We use loan-level price adjustments, including various upfront risk-based fees, to price for the credit risk we assume in providing our guaranty. FHFA must approve changes to the national loan-level price adjustments we charge and can direct us to make other changes to our single-family guaranty fee pricing. Management uses average charged guaranty fee on new acquisitions as a metric to assess the reasonableness of our compensation for the credit risk we manage on newly acquired single-family loans.
Our average charged guaranty fee on newly acquired conventional single-family loans, net of TCCA fees, decreased to 46.4 basis points in 2020 compared with 47.0 basis points in 2019 due to the improved credit risk profile of our 2020 acquisitions. See “Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management-Single-Family Portfolio Diversification and Monitoring” for further information on the credit risk profile of our acquisitions in 2020 compared with 2019 and 2018.
If eligible refinances continue to be a large proportion of our acquisitions in 2021, we expect our average charged guaranty fee on new single-family conventional acquisitions to increase in 2021 as a result of the new adverse market refinance fee implemented on December 1, 2020.

(5)Consists primarily of debt extinguishment gains and losses, housing trust fund expenses, servicer fees paid in connection with certain loss mitigation activities, and loan subservicing costs.
Net interest income
Single-family net interest income increased in 2020 compared with 2019, driven by higher net amortization income and higher base guaranty fee income, partially offset by lower income from portfolios.
Single-family net interest income decreased slightly in 2019 compared with 2018, primarily due to a decline in net interest income from portfolios partially offset by an increase in single-family base guaranty fee income.
The drivers of net interest income for the Single-Family segment are consistent with the drivers of net interest income in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, which we discuss in “Consolidated Results of Operations-Net Interest Income.”
_____________________________________________________________________________
Investment gains, net
Single-family investment gains, net decreased during 2020 compared with 2019 primarily driven by a significant decrease in the volume of sales of single-family HFS loans.
Investment gains, net increased during 2019 compared with 2018 primarily driven by an increase in gains on sales of single-family HFS loans.

MD&A | Single-Family Business | Single-Family Financial Results
Fair value gains (losses), net
As we discuss more fully in “Consolidated Results of Operations-Fair Value Gains (Losses), Net,” fair value losses in 2020 were primarily driven by fair value losses on our commitments to sell mortgage-related securities and our long-term debt of consolidated trusts held at fair value, partially offset by fair value gains on trading securities and CAS debt.
Fair value losses in 2019 were primarily driven by losses on our risk management derivatives and our commitments to sell mortgage-related securities.
The drivers of fair value losses, net for the Single-Family segment are consistent with the drivers of fair value losses, net in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, which we discuss in “Consolidated Results of Operations-Fair Value Gains (Losses), Net.”
We expect our implementation of fair value hedge accounting in January 2021 will affect the fair value gains and losses we report in the future, as we discuss in “Consolidated Results of Operations-Fair Value Gains (Losses), Net,”
_____________________________________________________________________________
Credit-related income (expense)
Credit-related expense in 2020 consists of an increase in our allowance for loan losses due to losses we expect to incur as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This was mostly offset by higher actual and forecasted home prices, lower actual and projected mortgage interest rates and the redesignation of certain reperforming single-family loans from HFI to HFS.
Credit-related income in 2019 was primarily driven by the redesignation of certain single-family loans from HFI to HFS; the result of an enhancement to the model used to estimate cash flows for individually impaired single-family loans within our allowance for loan losses, which incorporated recent loan performance data within the model; and an increase in actual and forecasted home prices.
See “Consolidated Results of Operations-Credit-Related Income (Expense)” in this report for more information on the primary factors that contributed to our single-family credit-related income (expense).

Other expenses, net
Other expenses, net increased in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to an increase in housing trust fund expenses driven by significantly higher acquisitions volumes throughout 2020.

Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management
Our strategy for managing single-family mortgage credit risk consists of four primary components:
•our acquisition and servicing policies along with our underwriting and servicing standards;
•portfolio diversification and monitoring;
•the transfer of credit risk through risk transfer transactions and the use of credit enhancements; and
•management of problem loans.
We typically obtain our single-family credit information from the sellers or servicers of the mortgage loans in our guaranty book of business and receive representations and warranties from them as to the accuracy of the information. While we perform various quality assurance checks by sampling loans to assess compliance with our underwriting and eligibility criteria, we do not independently verify all reported information and we rely on lender representations and warranties regarding the accuracy of the characteristics of loans in our guaranty book of business. See “Risk Factors” for a discussion of the risk that we could experience mortgage fraud as a result of this reliance on lender representations and warranties. We provide information on non-Fannie Mae mortgage-related securities held in our portfolio in “Note 5, Investments in Securities.”
Single-Family Acquisition and Servicing Policies and Underwriting and Servicing Standards
Overview
Our Single-Family business, with the oversight of our Enterprise Risk Management division, is responsible for setting underwriting and servicing standards and pricing, and managing credit risk relating to our single-family guaranty book of business.
Underwriting and Servicing Standards
Our Selling Guide sets forth our underwriting and eligibility guidelines, as well as our policies and procedures related to selling single-family mortgages to us. Our Servicing Guide sets forth our policies for servicing the loans in our single-family guaranty book.
Desktop Underwriter
Our proprietary automated underwriting system, Desktop Underwriter® (“DU®”), is used by mortgage lenders to evaluate the substantial majority of our single-family loan acquisitions. DU measures credit risk by assessing the primary risk factors of a mortgage and provides a comprehensive risk assessment of a borrower’s loan application and eligibility of the loan for sale to us. Risk factors evaluated by DU include the key loan attributes described under “Single-Family
Fannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 94
MD&A | Single-Family Business | Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management
Portfolio Diversification and Monitoring” below. DU does not use a FICO credit score to evaluate the borrower’s credit history, but applies our own assessment of the borrower’s credit data, including using trended credit data when available. DU analyzes the results of this risk and eligibility evaluation to arrive at the underwriting recommendation for the loan case file. As part of our comprehensive risk management approach, we regularly review DU’s underlying risk assessment models and recalibrate these models to improve DU’s ability to effectively analyze risk and avoid excessive risk layering. Factors we take into account in these evaluations include the profile of loans delivered to us, loan performance and current market conditions. We periodically update DU to reflect changes to our underwriting and eligibility guidelines based on these evaluations.
DU eligibility assessment. As part of our comprehensive risk management approach, we periodically update DU to reflect changes to our underwriting and eligibility guidelines. As part of normal business operations, we regularly review DU to determine whether its risk analysis and eligibility assessment are appropriate based on the current market environment and loan performance information. We expect to enhance DU to ensure our future loan acquisitions comply with risk criteria imposed on our loan acquisitions as a result of recent changes to our senior preferred stock purchase agreement with Treasury.
We will continue to closely monitor loan acquisitions and market conditions and, as appropriate, make changes to DU, including its eligibility criteria, to ensure the loans we acquire are consistent with our risk appetite and FHFA guidance.
Other Underwriting Standards
DU was used to evaluate over 90% of the single-family loans we acquired in 2020. However, we also purchase and securitize mortgage loans that have been underwritten using other automated underwriting systems, as well as manually underwritten mortgage loans that meet our stated underwriting requirements or meet agreed-upon standards that differ from our standard underwriting and eligibility criteria. The majority of loans we acquired in 2020 that were not underwritten with DU were underwritten through a third-party automated underwriting system, such as Freddie Mac’s Loan Product Advisor®.
COVID-19 Selling Policies
We are working closely with Freddie Mac, under the guidance of FHFA, to offer temporary measures during the COVID-19 national emergency that provide lenders with the clarity and flexibility to continue lending in a prudent and responsible manner.
Temporary policy flexibilities and updates to our Selling Guide requirements have been designed to mitigate the operational impact of COVID-19 on loan underwriting and originations. These flexibilities have included:
•purchasing certain loans that originated in 2020 and are subject to a COVID-19-related payment forbearance at the time of sale, subject to payment of a loan-level price adjustment;
•offering additional methods of obtaining verbal verifications of borrower employment;
•allowing alternative property valuation methods; and
•expanding guidelines for the use of a power of attorney.
Temporary policy updates to provide clarity and mitigate risk include:
•assessment of more recent documentation of borrower employment (including self-employment), income, and assets;
•requiring evidence of receipt of funds from stocks, stock options and mutual funds when used for down payment or closing costs, and reducing the value to 70% when considered for reserves;
•requiring additional due diligence regarding the payment status of a borrower’s existing mortgage loans;
•providing clarity for assessing self-employment income for qualifying purposes; and
•requiring that loans be no more than six months old to be eligible for sale to us.
Servicing Policies
Our servicing policies establish the requirements our servicers must follow in:
•processing and remitting loan payments;
•working with delinquent borrowers on loss mitigation activities;
•managing and protecting Fannie Mae’s interest in the pledged property; and
•processing bankruptcies and foreclosures.
Our goal is to ensure that our policies support management of risk over the life of the mortgage loan by enabling default prevention activities, promoting loss mitigation in the event of default and providing for the preservation and protection
Fannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 95
MD&A | Single-Family Business | Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management
of the collateral supporting the mortgage loan. See “Single-Family Primary Business Activities-Single-Family Mortgage Servicing” above for more information on the servicing of our single-family mortgage loans.
COVID-19 Servicing Policies
We also continue to work with Freddie Mac as instructed by FHFA to implement temporary policies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, to enable our single-family loan servicers to better assist borrowers impacted by COVID-19. We issued initial requirements to servicers on temporary policies to assist borrowers impacted by COVID-19 in March 2020, and have subsequently amended the requirements. We will continue monitoring the market to determine whether further adjustments to or extensions of our temporary policies are appropriate.
These temporary policies include:
•authorizing servicers to offer up to 12 months of forbearance, upon the request of any single-family borrower experiencing a financial hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic, regardless of the borrower’s delinquency status; for loans already in a COVID-19-related forbearance as of February 28, 2021, servicers may grant an extension of forbearance for up to an additional three months, to a total of up to 15 months, provided that the forbearance does not result in the loan becoming greater than 15 months delinquent;
•beginning July 1, 2020, offering a payment deferral workout option to eligible borrowers who have resolved a COVID-19-related financial hardship but cannot afford to bring the loan current by reinstating the loan (that is, repaying all the missed payments at one time) or through a repayment plan (that is, repaying the missed payments over time). The payment deferral workout option allows the borrower to defer up to 15 months of past-due payments, without interest, to the end of the loan term (or when the loan is refinanced, the property is sold or the loan is otherwise paid off before the end of the loan term). All other terms of the loan remain unchanged;
•suspending foreclosures and certain foreclosure-related activities for single-family properties through at least March 31, 2021, other than for vacant or abandoned properties; and
•reporting as current to the credit bureaus the obligation of a borrower who receives a forbearance plan or other form of relief as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic during the CARES Act covered period if the borrower was current before the accommodation and makes payments as agreed under the accommodation in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended by the CARES Act.
Certain states and localities have implemented COVID-19-related borrower and renter protections that are more extensive than the CARES Act requirements or our Servicing Guide requirements. States and localities may continue to consider such proposals in the future or extend the time period of existing protections. Our servicers must comply with all applicable laws.
In February 2021, we announced that a COVID-19-related forbearance can be extended for up to an additional three months, to a total of up to 15 months, to support borrowers who are already in a forbearance as of February 28, 2021 and continue to be impacted by the economic dislocation caused by the pandemic. Extending our forbearance timelines may impact the type of loss mitigation offered and their outcomes, which could impact our credit-related expense. In addition, this may impact our assessment of collectability used in determining when we place a loan on nonaccrual status.
Quality Control Process
Our quality control process includes using automated tools to help us determine whether a loan meets our underwriting and eligibility guidelines, performing in-depth reviews, and selecting random samples of performing loans for quality control review shortly after delivery.
Repurchase Requests and Representation and Warranty Framework
If we determine that a mortgage loan did not meet our underwriting or eligibility requirements, loan representations or warranties were violated, or a mortgage insurer rescinded coverage, then, except as described below, our mortgage sellers and/or servicers are obligated to either repurchase the loan or foreclosed property, reimburse us for our losses or provide other remedies. We refer to our demands that mortgage sellers and servicers meet these obligations collectively as repurchase requests.
Under our representation and warranty framework, lenders can obtain relief from repurchase liability for violations of certain underwriting representations and warranties. Loans with 36 months of consecutive monthly payments and minimal delinquencies over a specified time period or with satisfactory conclusion of a full-file quality control review are eligible for relief. However, no relief may be granted for violations of “life of loan” representations and warranties, such as those relating to whether a loan was originated in compliance with applicable laws or conforms to our charter requirements.
Fannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 96
MD&A | Single-Family Business | Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management
As of December 31, 2020, approximately 45% of the outstanding loans in our single-family conventional guaranty book of business that were acquired and are subject to this framework have obtained relief based solely on payment history or the satisfactory conclusion of a full-file quality control review, and an additional 51% remain eligible for relief in the future.
In addition, lenders may obtain relief from liability for violations of a more narrow set of representations and warranties through the use of specified underwriting tools. This primarily includes relief for:
•borrower income, asset and employment data that has been validated through DU; and
•appraised property value for appraisals that have received a qualifying risk score in Collateral Underwriter®, our appraisal review tool.
Single-Family Portfolio Diversification and Monitoring
Overview
The composition of our single-family conventional guaranty book of business is diversified by product type, loan characteristics and geography, all of which influence credit quality and performance and may reduce our credit risk. We monitor various loan attributes, in conjunction with housing market and economic conditions, to determine if our pricing, eligibility and underwriting criteria accurately reflect the risk associated with loans we acquire. In some cases, we may decide to significantly reduce our participation in riskier loan product categories. We also review the payment performance of loans in order to help identify potential problem loans early in the delinquency cycle and to guide the development of our loss mitigation strategies.
The profile of our single-family conventional guaranty book of business includes the following key risk characteristics:
•LTV ratio. LTV ratio is a strong predictor of credit performance. The likelihood of default and the severity of a loss in the event of default are typically lower as LTV ratio decreases. This also applies to estimated mark-to-market LTV ratios, particularly those over 100%, as this indicates that the borrower’s mortgage balance exceeds the property value.
•Product type. Certain loan product types have features that may result in increased risk. Generally, intermediate-term, fixed-rate mortgages exhibit the lowest default rates, followed by long-term, fixed-rate mortgages. Historically, adjustable-rate mortgages (“ARMs”), including negative-amortizing and interest-only loans, and balloon/reset mortgages have exhibited higher default rates than fixed-rate mortgages, partly because the borrower’s payments rose, within limits, as interest rates changed.
•Number of units. Mortgages on one-unit properties tend to have lower credit risk than mortgages on two-, three- or four-unit properties.
•Property type. Certain property types have a higher risk of default. For example, condominiums generally are considered to have higher credit risk than single-family detached properties.
•Occupancy type. Mortgages on properties occupied by the borrower as a primary or secondary residence tend to have lower credit risk than mortgages on investment properties.
•Credit score. Credit score is a measure often used by the financial services industry, including us, to assess borrower credit quality and the likelihood that a borrower will repay future obligations as expected. A higher credit score typically indicates lower credit risk.
•Debt-to-income ratio. Debt-to-income (“DTI”) ratio refers to the ratio of a borrower’s outstanding debt obligations (including both mortgage debt and certain other long-term and significant short-term debts) to that borrower’s reported or calculated monthly income, to the extent the income is used to qualify for the mortgage. As a borrower’s DTI ratio increases, the associated risk of default on the loan generally increases, especially if other higher-risk factors are present. From time to time, we revise our guidelines for determining a borrower’s DTI ratio. The amount of income reported by a borrower and used to qualify for a mortgage may not represent the borrower’s total income; therefore, the DTI ratios we report may be higher than borrowers’ actual DTI ratios.
•Loan purpose. Loan purpose refers to how the borrower intends to use the funds from a mortgage loan-either for a home purchase or refinancing of an existing mortgage. Cash-out refinancings have a higher risk of default than either mortgage loans used for the purchase of a property or other refinancings that restrict the amount of cash returned to the borrower.
•Geographic concentration. Local economic conditions affect borrowers’ ability to repay loans and the value of collateral underlying loans. Geographic diversification reduces mortgage credit risk.
•Loan age. We monitor year of origination and loan age, which is defined as the number of years since origination. Credit losses on mortgage loans typically do not peak until the third through fifth year following
Fannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 97
MD&A | Single-Family Business | Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management
origination; however, this range can vary based on many factors, including changes in macroeconomic conditions and foreclosure timelines.
The table below displays our single-family conventional business volumes and our single-family conventional guaranty book of business, based on certain key risk characteristics that we use to evaluate the risk profile and credit quality of our single-family loans. We provide additional information on the credit characteristics of our single-family loans in quarterly financial supplements, which we furnish to the SEC with current reports on Form 8-K and make available on our website.

Characteristics of our New Single-Family Loan Acquisitions
Our share of our single-family loan acquisitions consisting of refinance loans rather than home purchase loans increased sharply in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to a historically low interest-rate environment throughout 2020, which encouraged refinance activity. Typically, refinance loans have lower LTV ratios than home purchase loans. This trend contributed to a decrease in the percentage of our single-family loan acquisitions with LTV ratios over 90%, from 20% in 2019 to 12% in 2020. The historically low interest-rate environment, combined with the high level of refinancing activity, also led to an increase in the percentage of loans we acquired with a FICO credit score over 740, from 63% in 2019 to 73% in 2020. In addition, our acquisitions of loans from first-time home buyers decreased from 23% of our single-family loan acquisitions in 2019 to 13% in 2020.
Our share of acquisitions of loans with DTI ratios above 45% decreased in 2020 compared with 2019. This decrease was driven in part by changes in our eligibility guidelines implemented in 2019 to further limit risk layering, particularly with respect to loans with DTI ratios above 45%, as well as by a higher volume of refinance loan acquisitions, which tend to have lower DTI ratios than home purchase loans.
The credit profile of our future acquisitions will depend on many factors, including:
•our future guaranty fee pricing and our competitors’ pricing, and any impact of that pricing on the volume and mix of loans we acquire;
•our internal risk limits;
•our future eligibility standards and those of mortgage insurers, FHA and VA;
•the percentage of loan originations representing refinancings;
•changes in interest rates;
•our future objectives and activities in support of those objectives, including actions we may take to reach additional underserved creditworthy borrowers;
•government and regulatory policy;
•market and competitive conditions;
•the volume and characteristics of high LTV refinance loans we acquire in the future; and
•our future capital requirements.
We expect the ultimate performance of all our loans will be affected by borrower behavior, public policy and macroeconomic trends, including unemployment, the economy and home prices. In addition, if lender customers retain more of the higher-quality loans they originate, it could negatively affect the credit profile of our new single-family acquisitions.
High-Balance Loans
The standard conforming loan limit for a one-unit property was $484,350 for 2019, $510,400 for 2020 and increased to $548,250 for 2021. As we discuss in “Business-Our Mission and Charter-Charter Act,” we are permitted to acquire loans with higher balances in certain areas, which we refer to as high-balance loans.

Reverse Mortgages
In 2010, we stopped acquiring newly originated reverse mortgages. The outstanding unpaid principal balance of reverse mortgage loans and Fannie Mae MBS backed by reverse mortgage loans in our guaranty book of business was $16.4 billion as of December 31, 2020 and $21.9 billion as of December 31, 2019.
Mortgage Products with Rate Resets
ARMs are mortgage loans with an interest rate that adjusts periodically over the life of the mortgage based on changes in a specified index. Rate-reset modifications are mortgage loans we have modified with terms that include a reduction in the borrowers’ interest rate that is fixed for an initial period and is followed by one or more annual interest rate increases. The majority of these loans have fixed interest rates for an initial five-year period followed by annual interest rate increases, of up to 1 percent per year, until the mortgage rate reaches the prevailing market rate at the time of modification.
The outstanding unpaid principal balance of rate-reset modifications in our guaranty book of business was $5.4 billion as of December 31, 2020. During 2020, approximately 72% of these modified loans experienced an interest rate reset to a weighted-average interest rate of 3.85%. Approximately 19% of our modified loans that are performing included a reduction in the borrower’s interest rate that was fixed for an initial period and subject to one or more annual interest rate increases thereafter.
The table below displays the unpaid principal balance for ARMs and rate-reset modifications in our single-family conventional guaranty book of business by the year of their next scheduled contractual reset date. The contractual reset is either an adjustment to the loan’s interest rate or a scheduled change to the loan’s monthly payment to begin to reflect the payment of principal. The timing of the actual reset dates may differ from those presented due to a number of factors, including refinancing or exercising of other provisions within the terms of the mortgage.

We have not observed a materially different performance trend for rate-reset modifications, interest-only loans or negative-amortizing loans that have recently reset as compared to those that are still in the initial period. We believe the current performance trend for these loans is the result of the historically low interest-rate environment. If interest rates rise significantly, it is uncertain that this trend will continue.

Single-Family Credit Enhancement and Transfer of Mortgage Credit Risk
One of the key components of our credit risk management strategy is the transfer of mortgage credit risk to third parties. The table below displays information about the loans in our single-family conventional guaranty book of business covered by one or more forms of credit enhancement, including mortgage insurance or a credit risk transfer transaction. For a discussion of our exposure to and management of the counterparty credit risk associated with the providers of these credit enhancements, see “Risk Management-Mortgage Credit Risk Management-Institutional Counterparty Credit Risk Management” and “Note 13, Concentrations of Credit Risk.”

Mortgage Insurance
Our charter generally requires credit enhancement on any single-family conventional mortgage loan that we purchase or securitize if it has an LTV ratio over 80% at the time of acquisition. We generally achieve this through primary mortgage insurance. Primary mortgage insurance transfers varying portions of the credit risk associated with a mortgage loan to a third-party insurer. For us to receive a payment in settlement of a claim under a primary mortgage insurance policy, the insured loan must be in default and the borrower’s interest in the property securing the loan must have been extinguished, generally in a foreclosure action. Claims are generally paid three to six months after title to the property has been transferred. For a discussion of our policies that govern mortgage insurers’ claim-paying obligations to us, see “Risk Management-Mortgage Credit Risk Management-Institutional Counterparty Credit Risk Management.”
Credit Risk Transfer Transactions
Our Single-Family business has developed other risk-sharing capabilities to transfer portions of our single-family mortgage credit risk to the private market. Our credit risk transfer transactions are designed to transfer a portion of the losses we expect would be incurred in an economic downturn or a stressed credit environment. We continually evaluate our credit risk transfer transactions which, in addition to managing our credit risk, also affect our returns on capital under FHFA’s conservatorship capital requirements and recently finalized enterprise regulatory capital framework.
In previous years, we have targeted over 90% of acquisitions in the following loan categories for credit risk transfer transactions:
•fixed-rate single-family conventional loans with terms greater than 20 years that meet certain additional, minimum criteria;
•loans that are non-Refi Plus; and
•loans with LTV ratios between 60% and 97%.
This criteria covered over 55% of our 2020 single-family acquisitions. Loans are generally included in reference pools for CAS and CIRT transactions on a lagged basis. In the years leading up to 2020, we shortened this lag for a majority of target loans to typically less than six months after we initially acquire the loans. The portion of our single-family loan acquisitions we include in credit risk transfer transactions can vary from period to period based on market conditions and other factors.
We did not enter into new credit risk transfer transactions in the second quarter of 2020 due to adverse market conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Market conditions improved in the second half of 2020, but we have not entered into any new transactions as we evaluate their costs and benefits, including a reduction in the capital relief these transactions provide under FHFA’s enterprise regulatory capital framework. We may engage in credit risk transfer
Fannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 102
MD&A | Single-Family Business | Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management
transactions in the future, which could help us manage capital and manage within our risk appetite, particularly given the growth and turnover in our book in 2020. The structure of and extent to which we engage in any additional credit risk transfer transactions will be affected by the enterprise regulatory capital framework, our risk appetite, the strength of future market conditions, including the cost of these transactions, and the review of our overall business and capital plan.
See “Risk Factors” in this report for additional information on the risks associated with the constraints on credit risk transfer transactions and “Business-Legislation and Regulation-GSE Act and Other Legislative and Regulatory Matters” in this report for more information on FHFA’s enterprise regulatory capital framework.
In 2020, pursuant to our credit risk transfer transactions, we transferred a portion of the mortgage credit risk on single-family mortgages with an unpaid principal balance of $182 billion at the time of the transactions. Below is a table that describes our various risk-transfer products. Because we did not enter into new credit risk transfer transactions in the last three quarters of 2020, the percentage of loans in our single-family conventional guaranty book of business with credit enhancement declined from 53% as of December 31, 2019 to 42% as of December 31, 2020.

(6)For CAS transactions, “First Loss” represents all B tranche balances.
(7)For CAS and some lender risk-sharing transactions, represents outstanding reference pools, not the outstanding unpaid principal balance of the underlying loans. The outstanding unpaid principal balance for all loans covered by credit risk transfer programs, including all loans on which risk has been transferred in lender risk-sharing transactions, $955 billion as of December 31, 2020.
While these deals are expected to mitigate some of our potential future credit losses, they are not designed to shield us from all losses. We retain a portion of the risk of future credit losses on loans covered by CAS and CIRT transactions, including a portion of the first loss positions and all of the senior loss positions. In addition, on our CAS transactions, we retain a pro rata share of risk equal to approximately 5% of all notes sold in mezzanine tranches. The risk in force of these transactions, which refers to the maximum amount of losses that could be absorbed by credit risk transfer investors, was approximately $40 billion as of December 31, 2020.
We have designed our credit risk transfer transactions so that the principal payment and loss performance of the transactions correspond to the performance of the loans in the underlying reference pools. Losses are applied in reverse sequential order starting with the first loss tranche. Principal repayments may be allocated to reduce the mezzanine amounts outstanding; however, these payments may be subject to certain lock-out periods and performance triggers in order to build additional credit protection for the senior tranches retained by us. For CAS transactions, all principal payments and losses assigned to the mezzanine tranches are allocated pro rata between the sold notes and the portion we retain, when performance is above a certain threshold.
The following table displays the approximate cash paid or transferred to investors for these credit risk transfer transactions. The cash represents the portion of guaranty fee paid to investors as compensation for taking on a share of the credit risk.

Single-Family Problem Loan Management
Overview
Our problem loan management strategies are focused primarily on reducing defaults to avoid losses that would otherwise occur and pursuing foreclosure alternatives to mitigate the severity of the losses we incur. If a borrower does not make required payments, or is in jeopardy of not making payments, we work with the loan servicer to offer workout solutions to minimize the likelihood of foreclosure as well as the severity of loss. When appropriate, we seek to move to foreclosure expeditiously.
Below we describe the following:
•delinquency statistics on our problem loans;
•efforts undertaken to manage our problem loans, including the role of servicers in loss mitigation, forbearances, loan workouts, and sales of nonperforming loans;
•metrics regarding our loan workout activities;
•REO management; and
•other single-family credit-related information, including our credit loss performance and credit loss concentration metrics, loss reserves and TDRs resulting from loan modifications.
We also provide ongoing credit performance information on loans underlying single-family Fannie Mae MBS and loans covered by single-family credit risk transfer transactions. For loans backing Fannie Mae MBS, see the “Forbearance and Delinquency Dashboard” available in the MBS section of our Data Dynamics® tool, which is available at www.fanniemae.com/datadynamics. For loans covered by credit risk transfer transactions, see the “Deal Performance Data” report available in the CAS and CIRT sections of the tool. Information on our website is not incorporated into this report. Information in Data Dynamics may differ from similar measures presented in our financial statements and other public disclosures for a variety of reasons, including as a result of variations in the loan population covered, timing differences in reporting and other factors.

Delinquency
The tables below display the delinquency status of loans and changes in the volume of seriously delinquent loans in our single-family conventional guaranty book of business. Single-family seriously delinquent loans are loans that are 90 days or more past due or in the foreclosure process, expressed as a percentage of our single-family conventional guaranty book of business based on loan count. Management monitors the single-family serious delinquency rate as an indicator of potential future credit losses and loss mitigation activities. Serious delinquency rates are reflective of our performance in assessing and managing credit risk associated with single-family loans in our guaranty book of business. Typically, higher serious delinquency rates result in a higher allowance for loan losses.
For purposes of our disclosures regarding delinquency status, we report loans receiving COVID-19-related payment forbearance as delinquent according to the contractual terms of the loan. Pursuant to the CARES Act, for purposes of reporting to the credit bureaus, servicers must report a borrower receiving a COVID-19-related payment accommodation during the covered period, such as a forbearance plan or loan modification, as current if the borrower was current prior to receiving the accommodation and the borrower makes all required payments in accordance with the accommodation.

Our single-family serious delinquency rate increased in 2020 compared with 2019 and 2018 due to the economic dislocation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which sharply increased borrower participation in forbearance plans. A significant majority of our single-family seriously delinquent loan additions in 2020 have been in a COVID-19-related forbearance. As of December 31, 2020, single-family loans in forbearance comprised 78% of our single-family seriously delinquent loans.
Our single-family serious delinquency rate excluding loans in forbearance was 0.66% as of December 31, 2020. We monitor the single-family serious delinquency rate excluding loans that received a forbearance to better understand the impact that forbearance activity has had on the rate and to monitor loans that are seriously delinquent not as a result of COVID-19. We expect the COVID-19 pandemic to result in a continued higher single-family serious delinquency rate over the next several quarters compared to pre-pandemic levels.
Factors that affect our single-family serious delinquency rate include:
•the percentage of our loans that receive forbearance and the length of time they remain in forbearance;
•the pace and effectiveness of loan modifications and other workouts, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic;
•the timing and volume of nonperforming loan sales we execute;
•pandemics and natural disasters;
Fannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 108
MD&A | Single-Family Business | Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management
•servicer performance; and
•changes in home prices, unemployment levels and other macroeconomic conditions.
Certain higher-risk loan categories, such as Alt-A loans and our 2005 through 2008 loan vintages, continue to exhibit higher-than-average delinquency rates. Single-family loans originated in 2005 through 2008 constituted 2% of our conventional single-family book of business as of December 31, 2020, but constituted 15% of our seriously delinquent single-family loans as of December 31, 2020 and drove 54% of our 2020 single-family credit losses.
The table below displays the serious delinquency rates for, and the percentage of our seriously delinquent single-family conventional loans represented by, the specified loan categories. Percentage of book amounts present the unpaid principal balance of loans for each category divided by the unpaid principal balance of our total single-family conventional guaranty book of business. The reported categories are not mutually exclusive.

(5)Refers to loans included in reference pools for credit risk transfer transactions, including loans in these transactions that are also covered by primary mortgage insurance. For CAS and some lender risk-sharing transactions, this represents outstanding unpaid principal balance of the underlying loans on the single-family mortgage credit book, not the outstanding reference pool, as of the specified date. Loans included in our credit risk transfer transactions have all been acquired since 2009.
Single-Family Loans in Forbearance
As a part of our relief programs, we are providing payment forbearance to borrowers experiencing a COVID-19-related financial hardship for up to 12 months or, for borrowers already in forbearance as of February 28, 2021, for a total of up to 15 months, provided that the forbearance does not result in the loan becoming greater than 15 months delinquent. We estimate that, through December 31, 2020, approximately 8% of the single-family loans, based on loan count of our conventional guaranty book of business as of March 31, 2020, have been in a COVID-19-related forbearance at some point between then and the end of the year (referred to as our “single-family cumulative forbearance take-up rate”). As shown in the tables below, many of these loans have since exited forbearance; therefore, the percentage of loans in our single-family conventional guaranty book of business in forbearance as of December 31, 2020 has declined to 3.0%. Some borrowers whose loans are in forbearance continue to make payments according to the original contractual terms of the loan notwithstanding the forbearance arrangement; we expect some of these borrowers will continue to do so and therefore remain current. The table below provides information on the delinquency and accrual status of our single-family loans in forbearance. We expect many of the loans in forbearance will resolve their delinquency through a payment deferral or other form of loan workout. As discussed below, servicers are required to contact borrowers prior to the end of forbearance to evaluate them for loan workout options that can support their successful transition out of forbearance.
We continue to accrue interest income on the vast majority of our single-family loans in forbearance because we have determined that collection of principal and interest on these loans is reasonably assured. For information on our updated application of our nonaccrual policy for loans negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, see “Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”

As a part of our loss mitigation efforts, servicers must attempt to contact the borrower no later than 30 days before the end of the forbearance period to evaluate them for a workout option after the forbearance period. Those options include:
•a reinstatement (where the borrower repays all of the missed payments at one time);
•a repayment plan (where the borrower repays the missed payments over time);
•a payment deferral (where the borrower defers the missed payments to the end of the loan term, or to when the loan is refinanced, the property is sold or the loan is otherwise paid off before the end of the loan term); or
•a modification of the loan terms so that the borrower may be brought current, which typically results in the borrower making reduced monthly contractual payments over a longer period of time.
Unlike a loan modification, repayment plans and payment deferrals do not require us to purchase the loan out of trust.
The table below displays the status as of the current period end of the single-family loans in our guaranty book of business that have received a forbearance, many of which have successfully transitioned out of forbearance. As shown in the forbearance status table below, a majority of loans that received forbearance during 2020 have resolved their delinquency through reinstatement, payment deferral, or a liquidation. We expect the percentage of loans that receive a modification upon transitioning out of forbearance to increase in 2021. See “MD&A- Single-Family Business-Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management-Loan Workout Metrics” for additional information about actions taken by us to help reinstate a loan to current status.

Accrued Interest Receivable, Net on Single-Family Loans in Forbearance
As discussed in “Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” we have updated our application of our nonaccrual accounting policy for loans negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. For loans that were current as of March 1, 2020 and subsequently become delinquent, we continue to accrue interest income for up to six months. For those loans that are in a forbearance plan where we have provided relief beyond six months of delinquency, we continue to accrue interest income provided collection of principal and interest continues to be reasonably assured according to the updated policy. Our evaluation of whether the collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured considers the probability of default, the current value of the collateral, and any proceeds that are expected from contractually attached mortgage insurance. Once the forbearance period has ended, we will also consider the extent to which the borrower and the servicer have agreed to any of the loss mitigation options that are available. We then measure an allowance for expected credit losses on the unpaid accrued interest receivable balances such that the balance sheet reflects the net amount of interest we expect to collect. This update resulted in a significant portion of delinquent loans, including those in forbearance, remaining on accrual status.
Under the updated nonaccrual accounting policy, our allowance for accrued interest receivable considers both the loan’s principal and accrued interest receivable balances when assessing collectability, which requires significant management judgment. As such, our allowance for accrued interest receivable is subject to the same review processes, as well as other established governance and controls, used for our allowance for loan losses. The table below displays an aging analysis of our accrued interest receivable, net of allowance on single-family loans that are in a forbearance plan as of December 31, 2020. Accrued interest receivable on loans in forbearance as of December 31, 2019 was not material.

Principal and Interest Payments while Loans are in Forbearance
While a loan is in forbearance and backs an MBS trust, investors in the MBS are entitled to continue to receive principal and interest payments on the MBS even though the borrower is not required to make principal and interest payments. For the majority of loans in our single-family guaranty book of business, our Single-Family Servicing Guide has, until recently, required servicers to advance missed scheduled principal and interest payments to the MBS trusts until the loans were purchased from the MBS trusts. Because we typically do not purchase loans from MBS trusts while they are in forbearance, this servicer payment obligation could have continued for the entirety of the forbearance plan. Beginning August 2020, at FHFA’s instruction, we reduced our single-family servicers’ obligations to advance these missed borrower payments and only require servicers to advance missed scheduled principal and interest payments on a loan for the first four months of missed borrower payments. After four months, we make the missed scheduled principal and interest payments to the MBS trust for payment to MBS holders so long as the loan remains in the MBS trust. For the
Fannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 113
MD&A | Single-Family Business | Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management
year ended December 31, 2020, we advanced $1.2 billion in missed borrower principal and interest payments to MBS trusts for payment to MBS holders. See “Retained Mortgage Portfolio” for a description of when we purchase loans from single-family MBS trusts. Also, see “Liquidity and Capital Management-Liquidity Management-Debt Funding-Debt Funding Activity” for information on the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on our liquidity and debt funding needs.
Loan Workout Metrics
As a part of our credit risk management efforts, loan workouts represent actions taken by us to help reinstate a loan to current status and help homeowners stay in their home or to otherwise avoid foreclosure. Our loan workouts reflect various types of home retention solutions, including repayment plans, payment deferrals, and loan modifications. Our loan workouts also include foreclosure alternatives, such as short sales and deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure.
We work with our servicers to implement our home retention solution and foreclosure alternative initiatives, and we emphasize the importance of early contact with borrowers and early entry into a home retention solution. We require that servicers first evaluate borrowers for eligibility under a workout option before considering foreclosure. The existence of a second lien may limit our ability to provide borrowers with loan workout options, particularly those that are part of our foreclosure prevention efforts; however, we are not required to contact a second lien holder to obtain their approval prior to providing a borrower with a loan modification.
Home Retention Solutions
When a borrower cannot bring the loan current by reinstating the loan or through a repayment plan, we use our payment deferral and loan modification workout options to help resolve the loan’s delinquency. We developed a payment deferral workout option for borrowers impacted by COVID-19 that allows the borrower to defer up to 15 months of past-due payments, without interest, to the end of the loan term (or when the loan is refinanced, the property is sold or the loan is otherwise paid off before the end of the loan term). All other terms of the loan remain unchanged. We have also developed a payment deferral option for borrowers impacted by natural disasters. The total amount of principal and interest deferred to the end of the loan term for single-family loans was $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Characteristics of our loan modifications may include:
•changes to the original mortgage terms such as product type, interest rate, amortization term, maturity date and/or unpaid principal balance;
•collection of less than the contractual amount due under the original loan; or
•receiving the full amount due, or certain installments due, under the loan over a period of time that is longer than the period of time originally provided for under the terms of the loan.
Our primary loan modification program is currently the Flex Modification program, which offers payment relief for eligible borrowers, targeting a 20% payment reduction.
Foreclosure Alternatives
We continue to focus on foreclosure alternatives for borrowers who are unable to retain their homes. Foreclosure alternatives may be more appropriate if the borrower has experienced a significant adverse change in financial condition due to events such as long-term unemployment or reduced income, divorce, or unexpected issues like medical bills, and is therefore no longer able to make the required mortgage payments. To avoid foreclosure and satisfy the first-lien mortgage obligation, our servicers work with a borrower to:
•accept a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, whereby the borrower voluntarily signs over the title to their property to the servicer, or
•sell the home prior to foreclosure in a short sale, whereby the borrower sells the home for less than the full amount owed to Fannie Mae under the mortgage loan.
These alternatives are designed to reduce our credit losses while helping borrowers avoid having to go through a foreclosure. We work to obtain the highest price possible for the properties sold in short sales.

The chart below displays the unpaid principal balance of our completed single-family loan workouts by type, as well as the number of loan workouts. This table does not include loans in an active forbearance arrangement, trial modifications, loans to certain borrowers who have received bankruptcy relief that are classified as troubled debt restructurings, and repayment plans that have been initiated but not completed.
(1)There were approximately 14,400 loans in a trial modification period that was not yet complete as of December 31, 2020.
(2)Includes repayment plans and foreclosure alternatives. Repayment plans reflect only those plans associated with loans that were 60 days or more delinquent. Beginning with the year ended December 31, 2020, we exclude completed forbearance arrangements from the table. For year ended December 31, 2019, includes $105 million of completed forbearance arrangements that involve loans that were 90 days or more delinquent. For year ended December 31, 2018, includes $271 million of completed forbearance arrangements that involve loans that were 90 days or more delinquent.
The increase in home retention solutions in 2020 compared with 2019 was primarily driven by completed COVID-19-related payment deferrals, which has been the primary loan workout solution for borrowers exiting forbearance. Given the continuing impact of the pandemic, we expect higher loan workout activity to continue into 2021.
The decrease in home retention solutions in 2019 compared with 2018 was primarily driven by improved loan performance and a decrease in the volume of modifications and forbearances granted, which was elevated in 2018 due to the number of borrowers affected by major hurricanes in the second half of 2017.
The table below displays the percentage of our single-family loan modifications completed during 2019 and 2018 that were current or paid off one year after modification and, for modifications completed during 2018, two years after modification. The performance of these modified loans was impacted in 2020 by the economic dislocation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Nonperforming and Reperforming Loan Sales
We also undertake efforts to mitigate credit losses and manage our problem loans by selling our reperforming and nonperforming loans, thereby removing them from our guaranty book of business. This problem loan management strategy is intended to reduce: the number of seriously-delinquent loans, the severity of losses incurred on these loans, and the capital we would be required to hold for such loans.
In recent years, this has been an integral component of our credit loss mitigation strategy. In 2020, we suspended new sales of nonperforming and reperforming loans in the second quarter, as investor interest in purchasing these loans was severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, market conditions for the sale of these loans, particularly reperforming loans, improved following the second quarter, and we resumed sales of reperforming loans in the third quarter. During 2020, we sold approximately 50,500 reperforming loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $7.5 billion.
FHFA is currently examining potential issues relating to sales of nonperforming and reperforming loans during the COVID-19 national emergency and has instructed us to refrain from engaging in such sales until at least February 28, 2021, or later if instructed by FHFA, while FHFA evaluates what additional loss mitigation requirements will apply to any future sales. For instance, although we already require purchasers to perform workout solutions like modifications to avoid foreclosure, we may attach additional terms to these sales that would require purchasers to offer borrowers protections included in existing legislation.
REO Management
If a loan defaults, we may acquire the property through foreclosure or a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. The table below displays our REO activity by region. Regional REO acquisition trends generally follow a pattern that is similar to, but lags, that of regional delinquency trends.

Fannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 116
MD&A | Single-Family Business | Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management
The decline in single-family REO properties in 2020 compared with 2019 was primarily due to the suspension of foreclosures. In response to the pandemic and with instruction from FHFA, we have prohibited our servicers from completing foreclosures on our single-family loans through at least March 31, 2021, except in the case of vacant or abandoned properties.
We market and sell the majority of our foreclosed properties through local real estate professionals. Our primary objectives are both to minimize the severity of loss to Fannie Mae by maximizing sales prices and to stabilize neighborhoods by preventing empty homes from depressing home values. In some cases, we use alternative methods of disposition, including selling homes to municipalities, other public entities or non-profit organizations, and selling properties through public auctions. We also engage in third-party sales at foreclosure, which allow us to avoid maintenance and other REO expenses we would have incurred had we acquired the property.
As shown in the chart below, the majority of our REO properties are unable to be marketed at any given time because the properties are occupied, under repair, or are subject to state or local redemption or confirmation periods, or eviction moratoriums, which delays the marketing and disposition of these properties.
Although the total number of our REO properties decreased in 2020 compared with 2019, the COVID-19-related eviction moratorium on single-family REOs led to a larger portion of properties being classified as "unable to market,” as the majority of these properties were occupied.

Single-Family Credit Loss Metrics and Loan Sale Performance
The single-family credit loss and loan sale performance measures below present information about gains or losses we realized on our single-family loans during the periods presented. The amount of these gains or losses in a given period is driven by foreclosures, pre-foreclosure sales, REO activity, mortgage loan redesignations, and other events that trigger write-offs and recoveries. The single-family credit loss metrics we present are not defined terms within GAAP and may not be calculated in the same manner as similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management uses these measures to evaluate the effectiveness of our single-family credit risk management strategies in conjunction with leading indicators such as serious delinquency and forbearance rates, which are potential indicators of future realized single-family credit losses. We believe these measures provide useful information about our single-family credit performance and the factors that impact our credit performance.
We revised the presentation of our single-family credit loss metrics in connection with our implementation of the CECL standard in January 2020, principally by separating the “Charge-offs, net of recoveries” line item into three line items: “Write-offs,” “Recoveries,” and “Write-offs on the redesignation of mortgage loans from HFI to HFS.” Because sales of nonperforming and reperforming loans have been an important part of our credit loss mitigation strategy in recent periods, we also provide information in the table below on our loan sale performance through the “Gains on sales and other valuation adjustments” line item.

(3)Consists of gains or losses realized on the sales of nonperforming and reperforming mortgage loans during the period and temporary lower-of-cost-or-market adjustments on HFS loans, which are recognized in “Investment gains, net” in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.
Our single-family credit losses and credit loss ratios decreased in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to reduced foreclosures driven mostly by the COVID-19-related foreclosure moratorium.
Our single-family write-offs on redesignation decreased in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily as a result of a reduction in the volume of reperforming loans redesignated from HFI to HFS in 2020.
Gains on sales and other valuation adjustments decreased in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily driven by a significant decrease in the volume of sales of single-family HFS loans.
We do not expect a substantial increase in our single-family credit losses in the near term as a result of COVID-19, as we are currently offering up to 15 months of forbearance to eligible single-family borrowers suffering financial hardship relating to the pandemic and because we have suspended foreclosures and certain foreclosure-related activities for single-family properties through at least March 31, 2021. Over the longer term, we expect the COVID-19 pandemic will result in higher single-family credit losses, as reflected in our increased allowance for loan losses since the inception of the pandemic. See “Risk Factors” for additional information on the potential credit risk impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

(3)Credit losses on mortgage loans typically do not peak until the third through sixth years following origination; however, this range can vary based on many factors, including changes in macroeconomic conditions and foreclosure timelines.
The majority of our single-family credit losses in 2020 continued to be driven by loans originated in 2005 through 2008. However, these loans accounted for the majority of the decrease in our credit losses in 2019 compared with 2020. As a result, the percentage of overall credit losses driven by loans originated in more recent years increased, to 33% in 2020 from 27% in 2019, even as the amount of credit losses from these loans decreased.
Single-Family Loss Reserves
Our single-family loss reserves, which include our allowance for loan losses and the related accrued interest receivable, and our reserve for guaranty losses, provide for an estimate of credit losses in our single-family guaranty book of business. For periods beginning January 1, 2020, our measurement of loss reserves reflects a lifetime credit loss methodology pursuant to our adoption of the CECL standard and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable forecast information to develop credit loss estimates. For prior periods, single-family loss reserves were measured using an incurred loss impairment methodology for loans that were collectively evaluated for impairment. For further details on our previous single-family loss reserves methodology, refer to “Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”

As discussed above, we modify loans as part of our home retention solutions. The majority of these loans, including those with trial modifications and loans to certain borrowers who received bankruptcy relief, are classified as TDRs.

The decline in new TDRs in 2020 compared with 2019 and 2018 was a result of our election to account for certain eligible loss mitigation activities under the COVID-19 relief granted pursuant to the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021. To be eligible for this treatment, a loan must not have been more than 30 days
Fannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 120

delinquent as of December 31, 2019, and the activity must occur between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of January 1, 2022 or 60 days after the date on which the COVID-19 pandemic national emergency terminates. Accordingly, we do not expect to a see a significant increase in our single-family TDRs in 2021.
The decline in single-family foreclosures in 2020 compared with 2019 and 2018 was primarily due to the temporary suspension of foreclosures. In response to the pandemic and with instruction from FHFA, we have prohibited our servicers from completing foreclosures on our single-family loans through at least March 31, 2021, except in the case of vacant or abandoned properties.
The table below displays the single-family loans classified as TDRs that were on accrual status and single-family loans on nonaccrual status.

(3)Primarily includes amounts accrued while the loans were performing, including the amortization of any deferred cost basis adjustments, and cash payments received on nonaccrual loans held as of the end of each period.
Our updated nonaccrual policy, combined with the elevated number of borrowers in forbearance, contributed to a significant increase in loans accruing on-balance sheet that were past due 90 days or more as of December 31, 2020. As discussed in “Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” we have updated the application of our accounting policy for nonaccrual loans that were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. For loans that were current as of March 1, 2020 and subsequently become delinquent, we continue to accrue interest income for up to six months. If those loans are in a forbearance plan, where we have provided relief beyond six months of delinquency, we continue to accrue interest income provided collection of principal and interest continues to be reasonably assured according to the updated policy. We then measure an allowance for expected credit losses on the unpaid accrued interest receivable balances such that the balance sheet reflects the net amount of interest we expect to collect.
This nonaccrual policy update resulted in an increase in our accrued interest receivable balance, as a significant portion of delinquent loans negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic remained on accrual status. We have established a valuation allowance of $209 million as of December 31, 2020 on the total single-family accrued interest receivable balance based on our assessment of collectability. For those single-family loans that are six or more months delinquent as of December 31, 2020, we have recorded a total accrued interest receivable balance of $1.7 billion, for which we have established a valuation allowance of $167 million.

Multifamily Primary Business Activities
Providing Liquidity for Multifamily Mortgage Loans
Our Multifamily business provides mortgage market liquidity primarily for properties with five or more residential units, which may be apartment communities, cooperative properties, seniors housing, dedicated student housing or manufactured housing communities. Our Multifamily business works with our lender customers to provide funds to the mortgage market primarily by securitizing multifamily mortgage loans acquired from these lenders into Fannie Mae MBS, which are sold to investors or dealers. We also purchase multifamily mortgage loans and provide credit enhancement for bonds issued by state and local housing finance authorities to finance multifamily housing. Our Multifamily business also supports liquidity in the mortgage market through other activities, such as issuing structured MBS backed by Fannie Mae multifamily MBS and buying and selling multifamily agency mortgage-backed securities. We also continue to invest in low-income housing tax credit (“LIHTC”) multifamily projects to help support and preserve the supply of affordable housing.
Key Characteristics of the Multifamily Business
The Multifamily business has a number of key characteristics that distinguish it from our Single-Family business.
•Collateral: Multifamily loans are collateralized by properties that generate cash flows and effectively operate as businesses, such as garden and high-rise apartment complexes, seniors housing communities, cooperatives, dedicated student housing and manufactured housing communities.
•Borrowers and sponsors: Multifamily borrowers are entities that are typically owned, directly or indirectly, by for-profit corporations, limited liability companies, partnerships, real estate investment trusts and individuals who invest in real estate for cash flow and expected returns in excess of their original contribution of equity. Borrowers are typically single-asset entities, with the property as their only asset. The ultimate owner of a multifamily borrower is referred to as the borrower’s “sponsor.” We evaluate both the borrowing entity and its sponsor when considering a new transaction or managing our business. In this report, we refer to both the borrowing entities and their sponsors as “borrowers.” When considering a multifamily borrower, creditworthiness is evaluated through a combination of quantitative and qualitative data including liquid assets, net worth, number of units owned, experience in a market and/or property type, multifamily portfolio performance, access to additional liquidity, debt maturities, asset/property management platform, senior management experience, reputation, and exposures to lenders and Fannie Mae.
•Recourse: Multifamily loans are generally non-recourse to the borrowers.
•Lenders: During 2020, we executed multifamily transactions with 28 lenders. Of these, 23 lenders delivered loans to us under our DUS program described below. In determining whether to partner with a multifamily lender, we consider the lender’s financial strength, multifamily underwriting and servicing experience, portfolio performance and willingness and ability to share in the risk of loss associated with the multifamily loans they originate.
•Loan size: The average size of a loan in our multifamily guaranty book of business is $13 million.
•Underwriting process: Multifamily loans require detailed underwriting of the property’s operating cash flow. Our underwriting includes an evaluation of the property’s ability to support the loan, property quality, market and submarket factors, and ability to exit at maturity.
•Term and lifecycle: In contrast to the standard 30-year single-family residential loan, multifamily loans typically have terms of 5, 7 or 10 years, with balloon payments due at maturity.
•Prepayment terms: To protect against prepayments, most multifamily Fannie Mae loans and MBS impose prepayment premiums, primarily yield maintenance, consistent with standard commercial investment terms. This is in contrast to single-family loans, which typically do not have prepayment protection.
Delegated Underwriting and Servicing
Fannie Mae’s DUS program, which was initiated in 1988, is a unique business model in the commercial mortgage industry. Our DUS model aligns the interests of the lender and Fannie Mae. Our current 23-member DUS lender network, which is comprised of large financial institutions and independent mortgage lenders, continues to be our principal source of multifamily loan deliveries. DUS lenders are pre-approved and delegated the authority to underwrite and service loans on behalf of Fannie Mae in accordance with our standards and requirements. Delegation permits lenders to respond to customers more rapidly, as the lender generally has the authority to approve a loan within
Fannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 122
MD&A | Multifamily Business
prescribed parameters. Based on a given loan’s unique characteristics and Fannie Mae’s established delegation criteria, lenders assess whether a loan must be reviewed by Fannie Mae. If review is required, Fannie Mae’s internal credit team will assess the loan’s risk profile to determine if it meets our risk tolerances. DUS lenders are required to share with us the risk of loss over the life of the loan, as discussed in more detail in “Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk Management.” Since DUS lenders share in the credit risk, the servicing fee to the lenders includes compensation for credit risk.
Multifamily Mortgage Servicing
Multifamily mortgage servicing is typically performed by the lenders who sell mortgages to us. Because of our loss-sharing arrangements with our multifamily lenders, transfers of multifamily servicing rights are infrequent, and we monitor our servicing relationships and enforce our right to approve servicing transfers. As a seller-servicer, the lender is responsible for ongoing evaluation of the financial condition of properties and property owners, administering various types of loan and property-level agreements (including agreements covering replacement reserves, completion or repair, and operations and maintenance), as well as conducting routine property inspections.
Multifamily Credit Risk and Credit Loss Management
Our Multifamily business:
•Prices and manages the credit risk on loans in our multifamily guaranty book of business. Lenders retain a portion of the credit risk in most multifamily transactions.
•Has entered into transactions that transfer an additional portion of Fannie Mae’s credit risk on some of the loans in our multifamily guaranty book of business through back-end credit risk transfer transactions.
•Works to maintain the credit quality of the multifamily book of business, prevent foreclosures through certain loss mitigation strategies such as forbearance or modification, reduce costs of defaulted multifamily loans, manage our REO inventory, and pursue contractual remedies from lenders, servicers, borrowers, and providers of credit enhancement.
See “Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk Management” for discussion of our strategies for managing credit risk and credit losses on multifamily loans.
The Multifamily Markets in Which We Operate
In the multifamily mortgage market, we aim to address the rental housing needs of a wide range of the population in all markets across the country, with the substantial majority of our focus on supporting rental housing that is affordable to families earning at or below the median income in their area. We serve the market steadily, rather than moving in and out depending on market conditions. Through the secondary mortgage market, we support rental housing for the workforce population, for senior citizens and students, and for families with the greatest economic need. Over 90% of the multifamily units we financed in 2020 were affordable to families earning at or below 120% of the median income in their area, providing support for both workforce housing and affordable housing.
Our Multifamily business is organized and operated as an integrated commercial real estate finance business, addressing the spectrum of multifamily housing finance needs, including the need for smaller multifamily property financing and financing that serves low- and very low-income households.
•To meet the growing need for smaller multifamily property financing, we focus on the acquisition of small multifamily loans, which includes loans of up to $6 million in original unpaid principal balance. As of December 31, 2020, small loans represented 45% of our multifamily guaranty book of business by loan count and 7% based on unpaid principal balance.
•To serve low- and very low-income households, we have a team that focuses exclusively on relationships with lenders financing privately-owned multifamily properties that receive public subsidies in exchange for maintaining long-term affordable rents. We enable borrowers to leverage housing programs and subsidies provided by local, state and federal agencies. These public subsidy programs are largely targeted to provide housing to families earning less than 60% of area median income (as defined by HUD) and are structured to ensure that the low- and very low-income households who benefit from the subsidies pay no more than 30% of their gross monthly income for rent and utilities. As of December 31, 2020, affordable loans represented approximately 10% of our multifamily guaranty book of business, based on unpaid principal balance, including $9.4 billion in bond credit enhancements.

Multifamily Customers
Our multifamily lenders are primarily mortgage banking companies, large diversified financial institutions, and banks. During 2020, we executed multifamily transactions with 28 lenders. During 2020, our top five multifamily lender customers, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately 47% of our multifamily business volume, compared with approximately 48% in 2019. One of our customers, Walker & Dunlop, accounted for 15% of our 2020 multifamily business volume. No other customers accounted for more than 10% of our multifamily business volume in 2020.
We have a diversified funding base of domestic and international investors. Purchasers of multifamily Fannie Mae MBS include fund managers, commercial banks, pension funds, insurance companies, corporations, state and local governments, and other municipal authorities. Our Multifamily Connecticut Avenue SecuritiesTM (“MCASTM”) investors include fund managers, hedge funds and insurance companies, while our Multifamily CIRTTM (“MCIRTTM”) transactions are executed with insurers and reinsurers.
Multifamily Competition
Our primary competitors for the acquisition of multifamily mortgage assets and issuance of multifamily mortgage-related securities are Freddie Mac, life insurers, U.S. banks and thrifts, other institutional investors, Ginnie Mae and private-label issuers of commercial mortgage-backed securities.
Competition to acquire mortgage assets is significantly affected by both our and our competitors’ pricing, credit standards and loan structures, as well as investor demand for our and our competitors’ mortgage-related securities. Our competitive environment also may be affected by many other factors, including changes in our obligations under our senior preferred stock purchase agreement with Treasury or in our capital requirements; new legislation or regulations applicable to us, our customers or investors; and digital innovation and disruption in our markets. The Director of FHFA has indicated that, during conservatorship, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should reduce competition with each other and FHA. As a result, our ability to compete depends on our pricing and on our ability to address and adapt to changing lender and borrower preferences and changes made in pursuit of housing finance reform. See “Business-Conservatorship, Treasury Agreements and Housing Finance Reform,” “Business-Legislation and Regulation,” and “Risk Factors” for information on matters that could affect our business and competitive environment.
Multifamily Mortgage Market
Multifamily market fundamentals, which include factors such as vacancy rates and rents, were negatively impacted in many parts of the country throughout 2020 by the economic dislocation stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.
•Vacancy rates. Based on preliminary third-party data, the estimated national multifamily vacancy rate for institutional investment-type apartment properties as of December 31, 2020 increased to 6.0% compared with 5.8% as of September 30, 2020 and 5.5% as of December 31, 2019. The estimated vacancy rate is consistent with its estimated average rate of about 6.0% over the last 10 years. We believe that elevated levels of new supply delivered during the fourth quarter, especially in higher cost metros and submarkets that have been experiencing a decline in multifamily demand, pushed the national vacancy level higher at year-end 2020.
•Rents. Effective rents are estimated to have declined by 0.8% in 2020 and by 0.5% during the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with a decline of 0.3% in the third quarter of 2020. Assuming full-year 2020 has negative national rent growth, this would mark the first time that annualized rent growth was negative since 2009.
Vacancy rates and rents are important to loan performance because multifamily loans are generally repaid from the cash flows generated by the underlying property. Several years of improvement in these fundamentals helped to increase property values in most metropolitan areas. Based on current multifamily property sales data, transaction volumes in 2020 were lower than in previous years yet capitalization rates appear to have remained low. This may be due to property owners choosing to retain their multifamily properties despite declining rent levels rather than accepting a discounted offer, as well as commercial real estate investors remaining interested in multifamily rather than other hard-hit sectors such as hospitality and retail, thus keeping overall property values relatively stable.
Despite construction delays earlier in the year, the most recent third-party estimates indicate that approximately 396,000 new multifamily units were completed in 2020. We believe this additional supply resulted in rising concession rates overall in many places across the country.
We expect the multifamily sector to be impacted in the first half of 2021 from a rising national vacancy rate and declining rents, but overall we still expect the multifamily residential sector to perform well relative to other commercial real estate property types for the year.

Our multifamily new business volume increased in 2020 compared with 2019 driven by the economic dislocation resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic as some other market participants were less active in the market.
FHFA’s 2020 conservatorship scorecard included an objective to maintain the dollar volume of new multifamily business at or below $100 billion for the five-quarter period from October 1, 2019 through December 31, 2020. Pursuant to FHFA’s guidelines, at least 37.5% of our multifamily business during that time period had to be mission-driven, affordable housing, which includes loans on targeted affordable properties and loans on other properties with affordable units that meet certain income criteria. Our multifamily new business volume remained under the cap by $5.9 billion. Acquisition volume was $18.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2019 and $76.0 billion for 2020 to total $94.1 billion over the five-quarter period, including over 37.5% in mission-driven, affordable housing activity.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, FHFA established a 2021 multifamily volume cap of $70 billion in new business volume over the four-quarter period from January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021. FHFA also announced the requirement that at least 50% of our 2021 multifamily business volume must be mission-driven, focused on certain affordable and underserved market segments, which consists of loans on properties affordable for residents who earn 80% of area median income or below, with special provisions for rural housing and for manufactured housing communities. Furthermore, FHFA’s 2021 multifamily volume cap requires that a minimum of 20% of our multifamily loan purchases in 2021 must be affordable to residents at 60% of area median income or below. Loan purchases that meet the minimum 20% requirement may also count as loan purchases that meet the minimum 50% requirement.
Included in the January 2021 amendment to the senior preferred stock purchase agreement are certain restrictions on Fannie Mae’s business activities, including our Multifamily business volume. We may not acquire more than $80 billion in multifamily mortgage assets calculated in any 52-week period. FHFA will adjust the dollar amount of this limitation on multifamily mortgage purchase activity up or down at the end of each calendar year based on changes to the consumer price index. Additionally, at least 50% of our multifamily acquisitions in any calendar year must, at the time of acquisition, be classified as mission-driven, consistent with FHFA guidelines. We understand that the $70 billion multifamily volume cap and related requirements established by FHFA in the fourth quarter of 2020 remain in effect for calendar year 2021, and that the $80 billion limit on multifamily mortgage purchase activity established under the senior preferred stock purchase agreement operates as an independent limit on our prospective multifamily loan acquisitions. We are assessing the operational and business impacts of the new covenants in the senior preferred stock purchase agreement and our compliance with them, including how these new limitations will impact, and may require changes to our underwriting standards and requirements for acquisitions of multifamily loans. These changes may impact the overall volume and types of multifamily loans we acquire in 2021. We also continue to discuss certain interpretive questions about the new covenants with FHFA. For information on how conservatorship may affect our business activities see, “Risk Factors.”
Our multifamily business securitizes the vast majority of mortgage loans we acquire through lender swap transactions. We also support liquidity in the market through issuing structured MBS backed by Fannie Mae MBS.

Presentation of Our Multifamily Guaranty Book of Business
For purposes of the information reported in this “Multifamily Business” section, we measure our multifamily guaranty book of business using the unpaid principal balance of mortgage loans underlying Fannie Mae MBS. By contrast, the multifamily guaranty book of business presented in the “Composition of Fannie Mae Guaranty Book of Business” table in the “Guaranty Book of Business” section is based on the unpaid principal balance of Fannie Mae MBS outstanding, rather than the unpaid principal balance of the underlying mortgage loans. These amounts differ primarily as a result of payments we receive on underlying loans that have not yet been remitted to the MBS holders. As measured for purposes of the information reported below, the following chart displays our multifamily guaranty book of business.
Multifamily Guaranty Book of Business
(Dollars in billions)
(1)Our multifamily guaranty book of business primarily consists of multifamily mortgage loans underlying Fannie Mae MBS outstanding, multifamily mortgage loans of Fannie Mae held in our retained mortgage portfolio, and other credit enhancements that we provide on multifamily mortgage assets. It does not include non-Fannie Mae multifamily mortgage-related securities held in our retained mortgage portfolio for which we do not provide a guaranty.
Average charged guaranty fee represents our effective revenue rate relative to the size of our multifamily guaranty book of business. Management uses this metric to assess the reasonableness of our annual compensation rate for the multifamily credit risk we manage. While our multifamily guaranty fee pricing is primarily based on the individual credit risk characteristics of the loans we acquire, it is also influenced by market forces such as the availability of other sources of liquidity, our mission-related goals, the FHFA volume cap and the management of our overall portfolio composition.

Net interest income
Multifamily net interest income increased in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to higher guaranty fee income due to an increase in our multifamily guaranty book of business and an increase in average charged guaranty fees, partially offset by lower yield maintenance fees and lower net interest income on other portfolios as a result of declining interest rates.
Multifamily net interest income increased in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to an increase in guaranty fee income as a result of growth in the size of our multifamily guaranty book of business, partially offset by a decrease in average charged guaranty fees on the multifamily guaranty book.

Other income, net
Other income, net decreased in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to higher debt extinguishment losses in 2020, driven by the interest rate environment in the first quarter of 2020.
Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk Management
The credit risk profile of a loan in our multifamily book of business is influenced by:
•the current and anticipated cash flows from the property;
•the type and location of the property;
•the condition and value of the property;
•the financial strength of the borrower;
•market trends; and
•the structure of the financing.
These and other factors affect both the amount of expected credit loss on a given loan and the sensitivity of that loss to changes in the economic environment.
Multifamily Acquisition Policy and Underwriting Standards
Our Multifamily business is responsible for pricing and managing the credit risk on our multifamily guaranty book of business, with oversight from our Enterprise Risk Management division. Multifamily loans that we purchase or that back Fannie Mae MBS are underwritten by a Fannie Mae-approved lender and may be subject to our underwriting review prior to closing, depending on the product type, loan size, market and/or other factors. Our underwriting standards generally include, among other things, property cash flow analysis and third-party appraisals. Additionally, our standards for multifamily loans specify maximum original LTV ratio and minimum original debt service coverage ratio (“DSCR”) values that vary based on loan characteristics. Our experience has been that original LTV ratio and DSCR values have been reliable indicators of future credit performance. At underwriting, we evaluate the DSCR based on both actual and underwritten debt service payments. The original DSCR is calculated using the underwritten debt service payments for the loan, which assumes both principal and interest payments, rather than the actual debt service payments. Depending on the loan’s interest rate and structure, using the underwritten debt service payments may result in a more
Fannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 129
MD&A | Multifamily Business | Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk Management
conservative estimate of the debt service payments (for example, loans with an interest-only period). This approach is used for all loans, including those with full and partial interest-only terms.
To address possible fluctuations in borrower income and expenses resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we instituted additional reserve requirements in 2020 for certain new multifamily loan acquisitions depending on the product type, LTV ratio and DSCR.

Transfer of Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk
Lender risk-sharing is a cornerstone of our Multifamily business. We primarily transfer risk through our DUS program, which delegates to DUS lenders the ability to underwrite and service multifamily loans, in accordance with our standards and requirements. DUS lenders receive credit risk-related revenues for their respective portion of credit risk retained and, in turn, are required to fulfill any loss-sharing obligation. This aligns the interests of the lender and Fannie Mae throughout the life of the loan. We monitor the capital resources and loss sharing capacity of our DUS lenders on an ongoing basis.
Our DUS model typically results in our lenders sharing approximately one-third of the credit risk on our multifamily loans. Lenders in the DUS program may also share in loan-level credit losses up to the first 5% of the unpaid principal balance of the loan and then share with us any remaining losses up to a prescribed limit.
Loans serviced by DUS lenders and their affiliates represented substantially all of our multifamily guaranty book of business as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. In certain situations, to effectively manage our counterparty risk, we do not allow the lender to fully share in one-third of the credit risk, but have them share in a smaller portion.
While not a large portion of our multifamily guaranty book of business, our non-DUS lenders typically also have lender risk-sharing, where the lenders typically share or absorb losses based on a negotiated percentage of the loan or the pool balance. These risk-sharing agreements not only transfer credit risk, but also better align our interests with those of the lenders.
Our maximum potential loss recovery from lenders under current risk-sharing agreements represented over 20% of the unpaid principal balance of our multifamily guaranty book of business as of December 31, 2020 and as of December 31, 2019.
To complement our front-end lender-risk sharing program through our DUS model, we engage in back-end credit risk transfer transactions through our multifamily CIRT and MCAS transactions. In our multifamily CIRT transactions we transfer a portion of Fannie Mae’s mortgage credit risk on multifamily loans in our multifamily guaranty book of business to insurers or reinsurers. We retain an initial portion of losses on the loans in the pool and reinsurers cover losses above this retention amount up to a detachment point. We retain all losses above this detachment point. The insurance layer typically provides coverage for losses on the pool that are likely to occur only in a stressed economic environment.
We did not enter into new credit risk transfer transactions in the second quarter of 2020 due to adverse market conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Market conditions improved in the second half of 2020, but we have not entered into any new transactions as we evaluate their costs and benefits, including a reduction in the capital relief these transactions provide under FHFA’s enterprise regulatory capital framework. We may engage in credit risk transfer transactions in the future, which could help us manage capital and manage within our risk appetite, particularly given the growth and turnover in our book in 2020. The structure of and extent to which we engage in any additional credit risk transfer transactions will be affected by the enterprise regulatory capital framework, our risk appetite, the strength of future market conditions, including the cost of these transactions, and the review of our overall business and capital plan.

Our back-end multifamily credit-risk sharing transactions were primarily designed to further reduce the capital requirements associated with loans in the reference pool under FHFA’s conservatorship capital framework with the associated benefit of additional credit risk protection in the event of a stress environment. We transfer multifamily credit risk through lender risk sharing at the time of acquisition, but our multifamily back-end credit risk transfer activity occurs later, typically up to a year or more after acquisition.
Multifamily Portfolio Diversification and Monitoring
Diversification within our multifamily book of business by geographic concentration, term to maturity, interest rate structure, borrower concentration, loan size, and credit enhancement coverage are important factors that influence credit performance and may help reduce our credit risk.
As part of our ongoing credit risk management process, we and our lenders monitor the performance and risk characteristics of our multifamily loans and the underlying properties on an ongoing basis throughout the loan term at the asset and portfolio level. We require lenders to provide quarterly and annual financial updates for the loans for which we are contractually entitled to receive such information. We closely monitor loans with an estimated current DSCR below 1.0, as that is an indicator of heightened default risk. The percentage of loans in our multifamily guaranty book of business, calculated based on unpaid principal balance, with a current DSCR less than 1.0 was approximately 2% as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Our estimates of current DSCRs are based on the latest available income information for these properties and exclude co-op loans. Although we use the most recently available results from our multifamily borrowers, there is a lag in reporting, which typically can range from three to six months, but in some cases may be longer. Accordingly, the financial information we have received from borrowers may not reflect the most recent impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In addition to the factors described above, we track credit risk characteristics to determine the loan credit quality indicators, which are the internal risk categories we use and are further discussed in “Note 3, Mortgage Loans”:
•the physical condition of the property;
•delinquency status;
Fannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 131
MD&A | Multifamily Business | Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk Management
•the relevant local market and economic conditions that may signal changing risk or return profiles; and
•other risk factors.
For example, we closely monitor rental payment trends and vacancy levels in local markets, as well as capitalization rates, to identify loans that merit closer attention or loss mitigation actions. We manage our exposure to refinancing risk for multifamily loans maturing in the next several years. We have a team that proactively manages upcoming loan maturities to minimize losses on maturing loans. This team assists lenders and borrowers with timely and appropriate refinancing of maturing loans with the goal of reducing defaults and foreclosures related to these loans. The primary asset management responsibilities for our multifamily loans are performed by our DUS and other multifamily lenders. We periodically evaluate these lenders’ performance for compliance with our asset management criteria.
Multifamily Problem Loan Management and Foreclosure Prevention
In addition to the credit performance information on our multifamily loans provided below, we provide information about multifamily loans in a COVID-19-related forbearance that back MBS and whole loan REMICs in a “Multifamily MBS COVID-19 Forbearance List” in the “Data Collections” section of our DUS Disclose® tool, available at www.fanniemae.com/dusdisclose. Information on our website is not incorporated into this report.
We periodically refine our underwriting standards in response to market conditions and implement proactive portfolio management and monitoring which are each designed to keep credit losses and delinquencies to a low level relative to our multifamily guaranty book of business.
Delinquency Statistics on our Problem Loans
The percentage of our multifamily loans classified as substandard increased as of December 31, 2020 compared with December 31, 2019, due to loans in a COVID-19-related forbearance. Substandard loans are loans that have a well-defined weakness that could impact their timely full repayment. While the majority of the substandard loans in our multifamily guaranty book of business are currently making timely payments or are in forbearance, we continue to monitor the performance of the full substandard loan population. For more information on our credit quality indicators, including our population of substandard loans, see “Note 3, Mortgage Loans.”
Our multifamily serious delinquency rate increased to 0.98% as of December 31, 2020, compared with 0.04% as of December 31, 2019, due to the economic dislocation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which increased borrower participation in forbearance plans. Our multifamily serious delinquency rate consists of multifamily loans that were 60 days or more past due based on unpaid principal balance, expressed as a percentage of our multifamily guaranty book of business. Management monitors the multifamily serious delinquency rate as an indicator of potential future credit losses and loss mitigation activities. Serious delinquency rates are reflective of our performance in assessing and managing credit risk associated with multifamily loans in our guaranty book of business. Typically, higher serious delinquency rates result in a higher allowance for loan losses.
Our multifamily serious delinquency rate, excluding loans that received a forbearance, was 0.03% as of December 31, 2020. We monitor the multifamily serious delinquency rate excluding loans that received a forbearance to better understand the impact that forbearance activity has had on the rate and to monitor loans that are seriously delinquent not as a result of COVID-19.
COVID-19 Forbearance and Multifamily Eviction Moratorium
We initially offered forbearance relief to multifamily borrowers by delegating to our lenders the authority to execute a forbearance agreement with a multifamily borrower experiencing a documented financial hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic for up to three monthly payments, beginning with the first missed monthly payment occurring after February 1, 2020. Effective July 1, 2020, we delegated to our lenders the ability to extend forbearance for up to three additional monthly payments for most loan types. For certain types of loans, such as seniors housing loans and loans with unpaid principal balances above $50 million, Fannie Mae determines whether to extend forbearance relief. For any forbearance request extending beyond six months, Fannie Mae does not delegate the decision and will determine itself whether to extend relief. For forbearance of any duration after July 1, 2020, the borrower is required to bring the loan current within a time period determined by multiplying the number of months of forbearance by four. For example, if a borrower receives a six-month forbearance period, the borrower would be required to make all missed payments over a period of 24 months. The borrower may also repay the missed payments in a lump sum at any time. In exchange for receiving forbearance, borrowers must agree to suspend tenant evictions for nonpayment of rent, provide monthly operating statements and remit any excess cash flow to our servicers on a monthly basis, to be held until the end of the forbearance period and then applied to missed mortgage payments. In addition, effective August 20, 2020, borrowers with new, extended or amended forbearance agreements must also provide each residential tenant with specified written notices regarding the protections available to them and certify their compliance with these notification requirements.
Fannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 132
MD&A | Multifamily Business | Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk Management
In January 2021, the CDC extended the moratorium on evictions through March 31, 2021, as described in “Business-Legislation and Regulation-U.S. Government Response to COVID-19-Relief for Individuals and Businesses; Federal Eviction Moratoriums.”
Multifamily Loan Forbearance
Since the COVID-19 pandemic was declared a national emergency in March 2020, we have broadly offered forbearance to affected multifamily borrowers. We estimate that, through December 2020, approximately 1.5% of our multifamily book of business as of March 31, 2020, based on unpaid principal balance, had been in a COVID-19-related forbearance at some point in time. As shown in the table below, some of these loans have exited forbearance into a repayment plan, have reinstated, have defaulted, or have since liquidated.
The table below displays the status as of December 31, 2020 of the multifamily loans in our guaranty book of business that have received a forbearance, as well as the serious delinquency rate of such loans. As of December 31, 2020, nearly all of our multifamily loans in forbearance were associated with a COVID-19-related financial hardship. Seniors housing loans, which constituted 4.5% of our multifamily guaranty book of business as of December 31, 2020, comprised approximately 40% of the total unpaid principal balance of multifamily loans that received a forbearance and remained in our multifamily guaranty book as of December 31, 2020.

(4)Includes loans that are no longer in forbearance and are not on a repayment plan. Loans in this population may proceed to other loss mitigation activities, such as foreclosure or modification.
As discussed in “Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” we have updated our application of our nonaccrual accounting policy for those loans negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. For loans that were current as of March 1, 2020 and subsequently become delinquent, we continue to accrue interest income for up to six months. Multifamily loans that are in a forbearance plan beyond six months past due are placed on nonaccrual status unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection.
For multifamily loans that received forbearance and were in our book of business as of December 31, 2020, we have recorded a total accrued interest receivable balance of $84 million, for which we have established a valuation allowance of $7 million.

REO Management
The number of multifamily foreclosed properties held for sale was 14 properties with a carrying value of $114 million as of December 31, 2020, compared with 12 properties with a carrying value of $72 million as of December 31, 2019. We expect an increase in our multifamily foreclosed properties due to loans that receive a COVID-19 forbearance but do not enter a repayment plan or other modification.

Multifamily Credit Loss Performance Metrics
The amount of multifamily credit loss or income we realize in a given period is driven by foreclosures, pre-foreclosure sales, REO activity and write-offs, net of recoveries. Our multifamily credit loss performance metrics are not defined terms within GAAP and may not be calculated in the same manner as similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We believe our multifamily credit losses and our multifamily credit losses, net of freestanding loss-sharing benefit, may be useful to stakeholders because they display our credit losses in the context of our guaranty book of business, including the benefit we receive from loss-sharing arrangements. Management views multifamily credit losses, net of freestanding loss-sharing benefit as a key metric related to our multifamily business model and our strategy to share multifamily credit risk.
The table below displays the components of our multifamily credit loss performance metrics, as well as our multifamily initial write-off severity rate.

(2)For 2020, excludes estimated recoveries of $61 million relating to amounts previously written off pursuant to the Advisory Bulletin. Under the CECL standard we adopted on January 1, 2020, estimated recoveries of amounts previously written off due to improved valuations are recorded as a component of “Benefit (provision) for credit losses” in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income and are adjusted over time as expectations change. The changes in expected loss-sharing benefit associated with these recoveries are included in the Freestanding loss-sharing benefit.
(3)Represents expected benefits that we receive upon foreclosure as a result of certain freestanding credit enhancements, primarily multifamily DUS lender risk-sharing transactions, as well as the expected loss-sharing benefit from write-offs pursuant to the Advisory Bulletin. These benefits are recorded in “Change in expected credit enhancement recoveries” in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. Prior to the adoption of the CECL standard, benefits from lender risk-sharing transactions were included in “Benefit (provision) for credit losses” in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.
(4)Calculated based on the amount of “credit income (losses)” and “credit income (losses), net of freestanding loss-sharing benefit,” divided by the average multifamily guaranty book of business during the period.
(5)Rate is calculated as the initial write-off amount divided by the average defaulted unpaid principal balance. The rate excludes write-offs pursuant to the provisions of the Advisory Bulletin and any costs, gains or losses associated with REO after initial acquisition through final disposition. Write-offs are net of lender loss-sharing agreements.
Our multifamily credit losses increased in 2020 compared with 2019 driven by a write down in the value of a seniors housing portfolio during 2020 following its default on its forbearance agreement.
Fannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 134
MD&A | Multifamily Business | Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk Management
We expect our multifamily credit losses will be higher over the long term as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic as reflected in our increased allowance for loan losses since the inception of the pandemic. See “Risk Factors” for additional information on the potential credit risk impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Multifamily Loss Reserves
Our multifamily loss reserves, which include our allowance for loan losses and the related accrued interest receivable, and our reserve for guaranty losses, provide for an estimate of credit losses in our multifamily guaranty book of business. For periods beginning January 1, 2020, our measurement of loss reserves reflects a lifetime credit loss methodology pursuant to our adoption of the CECL standard and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable forecast information to develop credit loss estimates. For prior periods, multifamily loss reserves were measured using an incurred loss methodology. For further details on our previous multifamily loss reserves methodology, refer to “Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”
The table below summarizes the changes in our multifamily loss reserves, excluding credit losses on our AFS securities. For a discussion of changes in our multifamily provision for credit losses, see “Consolidated Results of Operations-Credit-Related Income (Expense).”

(1)Represents the amount of interest income we did not recognize, but would have recognized during the period, for nonaccrual loans and TDRs on accrual status as of the end of each period had the loans performed according to their original contractual terms.
(2)Represents interest income recognized during the period, including the amortization of any deferred cost basis adjustments, for loans classified as TDRs on accrual status or nonaccrual loans held as of the end of each period. Primarily includes amounts accrued while the loans were performing. For 2020, as a result of the update to our application of our nonaccrual policy, cash received on nonaccrual loans in a forbearance plan are applied as a reduction of accrued interest receivable until the receivable has been reduced to zero, and then recognized as interest income.
The decrease in TDRs on accrual status in 2020 compared with prior years was a result of our election to account for eligible COVID-19-related loss mitigation activities as permitted under the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, which provide relief from TDR accounting and disclosure requirements for our forbearance plans and loan modifications.
In the second quarter of 2020, we updated our application of our nonaccrual accounting policy for those loans negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. For loans that were current as of March 1, 2020 and subsequently become delinquent, we continue to accrue interest income for up to six months according to the updated policy. Multifamily loans in a forbearance plan beyond six months past due are placed on nonaccrual status unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection. See “Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for more information on our accounting for TDRs and nonaccrual loans.
The update to the nonaccrual policy, combined with elevated levels of multifamily loans that received a COVID-19 related forbearance during 2020, contributed to an increase in loans accruing on-balance sheet that were past due 90 days or more as of December 31, 2020, to the extent that the loans were not beyond six months past due or both in the process of collection and well secured. Loans that received a COVID-19 forbearance that became more than six months delinquent and were placed on nonaccrual status contributed to the increase in nonaccrual loans as of December 31, 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Management
Liquidity Management
Our business activities require that we maintain adequate liquidity to fund our operations. Our liquidity risk management requirements are designed to address our liquidity and funding risk, which is the risk that we will not be able to meet our obligations when they come due, including the risk associated with the inability to access funding sources or manage fluctuations in funding levels. Liquidity and funding risk management involves forecasting funding requirements,
Fannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 136
MD&A | Liquidity and Capital Management
maintaining sufficient capacity to meet our needs based on our ongoing assessment of financial market liquidity and adhering to our regulatory requirements.
Primary Sources and Uses of Funds
Our liquidity depends largely on our ability to issue debt in the capital markets, including both corporate debt and sales of our MBS securities. Our status as a government-sponsored enterprise and federal government support of our business continue to be essential to maintaining our access to the debt markets.
Our primary sources of cash include:
•issuance of long-term and short-term corporate debt;
•proceeds from the sale of mortgage-related securities, mortgage loans and other investments portfolio, including proceeds from sales of foreclosed real estate assets;
•principal and interest payments received on mortgage loans, mortgage-related securities and non-mortgage investments we own;
•guaranty fees received on Fannie Mae MBS, including the TCCA fees collected by us on behalf of Treasury;
•payments received from mortgage insurance counterparties and other providers of credit enhancement; and
•borrowings we may make under a secured intraday funding line of credit or against mortgage-related securities and other investment securities we hold pursuant to repurchase agreements and loan agreements.
Our primary uses of funds include:
•the repayment of matured, redeemed and repurchased debt;
•the purchase of mortgage loans (including delinquent loans from MBS trusts), mortgage-related securities and other investments;
•interest payments on outstanding debt;
•administrative expenses;
•losses, including advances for past due principal and interest, incurred in connection with our Fannie Mae MBS guaranty obligations;
•payments of federal income taxes;
•payments of TCCA fees to Treasury; and
•payments associated with our credit risk transfer programs.
Liquidity and Funding Risk Management Practices and Contingency Planning
Our liquidity position could be adversely affected by many factors, both internal and external to our business, including:
•actions taken by FHFA, the Federal Reserve, Treasury or other government agencies;
•legislation relating to us or our business;
•a U.S. government payment default on its debt obligations;
•a downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior unsecured debt or the U.S. government’s debt from the major ratings organizations;
•a systemic event leading to the withdrawal of liquidity from the market;
•an extreme market-wide widening of credit spreads;
•public statements by key policy makers;
•a significant decline in our net worth;
•potential investor concerns about the adequacy of funding available to us under or changes to the senior preferred stock purchase agreement;
•loss of demand for our debt, or certain types of our debt from a significant number of investors;
•a significant credit event involving one of our major institutional counterparties;
•a sudden catastrophic operational failure in the financial sector; or
•elimination of our status as a government-sponsored enterprise.
See “Risk Factors” for a discussion of factors that could adversely affect our liquidity.
Fannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 137
MD&A | Liquidity and Capital Management
We maintain a liquidity management framework and conduct liquidity contingency planning to prepare for an event in which our access to the unsecured debt markets becomes limited. In June 2020, FHFA instructed that we update our liquidity management framework to meet prescriptive liquidity requirements. In December 2020, those requirements became effective and FHFA issued a proposed rule in line with the updated requirements. Under the requirements, we must hold more liquid assets than under our previous framework, which we expect will negatively impact our net interest income.
Our liquidity requirements, as revised, have four components we must meet:
•a short-term cash flow metric that requires us to meet our expected cash outflows and continue to provide liquidity to the market over a 30-day period of stress, plus an additional $10 billion buffer;
•an intermediate cash flow metric that requires us to meet our expected cash outflows and continue to provide liquidity to the market over a 365-day period of stress;
•a specified minimum long-term debt to less-liquid asset ratio. Less-liquid assets are those that are not eligible to be pledged as collateral to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation; and
•a requirement that we fund our assets with liabilities that have a specified minimum term relative to the term of the assets.
As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with these requirements.
We run routine operational testing of our ability to rely upon mortgage and U.S. Treasury collateral to obtain financing. We enter into relatively small repurchase agreements in order to confirm that we have the operational and systems capability to do so. In addition, we have provided collateral in advance to clearing banks in the event we seek to enter into repurchase agreements in the future. We do not, however, have committed repurchase agreements with specific counterparties, as historically we have not relied on this form of funding. As a result, our use of such facilities and our ability to enter into them in significant dollar amounts may be challenging in a stressed market environment. See “Other Investments Portfolio” for further discussions of our alternative sources of liquidity if our access to the debt markets were to become limited.
While our liquidity contingency planning attempts to address stressed market conditions and our status in conservatorship, we believe those plans could be difficult or impossible to execute under stressed conditions for a company of our size in our circumstances. See “Risk Factors-Liquidity and Funding Risk” for a description of the risks associated with our ability to fund operations and our liquidity contingency planning.
Debt Funding
We separately present the debt from consolidations (“debt of consolidated trusts”) and the debt issued by us (“debt of Fannie Mae”) in our consolidated balance sheets. This discussion regarding debt funding focuses on the debt of Fannie Mae. In addition to MBS issuances, we fund our business through the issuance of a variety of short-term and long-term debt securities in the domestic and international capital markets. Accordingly, we are subject to “roll over,” or refinancing, risk on our outstanding debt.
Our debt securities are actively traded in the over-the-counter market. We have a diversified funding base of domestic and international investors. Purchasers of our debt securities are geographically diversified and include fund managers, commercial banks, pension funds, insurance companies, foreign central banks, corporations, state and local governments, and other municipal authorities. We compete for low-cost debt funding with institutions that hold mortgage portfolios, including Freddie Mac and the FHLBs.
Our debt funding needs and debt funding activity may vary from period to period depending on market conditions, including refinance volumes, the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our capital and liquidity management, the size of our retained mortgage portfolio, and the impact of business restrictions recently imposed under the terms of our senior preferred stock purchase agreement with Treasury, particularly new volume limits on single-family loans acquired through the whole loan conduit. See “Retained Mortgage Portfolio” for information about our retained mortgage portfolio and limits on its size.
We are currently subject to a $300 billion debt limit under our senior preferred stock purchase agreement with Treasury, which will decrease to $270 billion as of December 31, 2022. The unpaid principal balance of our aggregate indebtedness was $290.0 billion as of December 31, 2020. Pursuant to the terms of the senior preferred stock purchase agreement, we are prohibited from issuing debt without the prior consent of Treasury if it would result in our aggregate indebtedness exceeding our outstanding debt limit. The calculation of our indebtedness for purposes of complying with our debt limit reflects the unpaid principal balance and excludes debt basis adjustments and debt of consolidated trusts. Because of our debt limit, our business activities may be constrained.

Outstanding Debt
Total outstanding debt of Fannie Mae includes short-term and long-term debt and excludes debt of consolidated trusts. Short-term debt of Fannie Mae consists of borrowings with an original contractual maturity of one year or less and, therefore, does not include the current portion of long-term debt. Long-term debt of Fannie Mae consists of borrowings with an original contractual maturity of greater than one year.
The following chart and table display information on our outstanding short-term and long-term debt based on original contractual maturity. The drivers for the increase in long-term debt from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 are discussed below.

For information on the maturity profile of our outstanding long-term debt for each of the years 2021 through 2025 and thereafter, see “Note 7, Short-Term and Long-Term Debt.”
Debt Funding Activity
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significantly higher rates of loan delinquencies, which has increased the relief we are offering impacted borrowers as well as support to our servicers. These factors, combined with low mortgage interest rates, have affected both our debt funding needs and related debt funding activity. We significantly increased our long-term debt issuances in 2020 due to:
•increased volume in the whole loan conduit driven by a significant increase in refinance and purchase activity;
•paying off callable debt;
•preparation for the implementation in December 2020 of the new liquidity risk management requirements issued by FHFA;
•increased payments of, and reimbursements for servicer advances of, principal and interest payments to MBS trusts due to missed borrower payments; and

Adverse market conditions in early 2020 limited our ability to issue debt with a maturity greater than two years. As a result, most of the debt we issued in the first quarter of 2020 had terms from three to twenty-four months. Market conditions improved after the first quarter of 2020 and we were able to issue notes with maturities greater than two years during the remainder of the year. If market conditions deteriorate again such that our ability to issue longer-term debt is limited, we may need to fund longer-term assets with short-term debt, which would increase the roll-over risk on our outstanding debt.

The table below displays activity in debt of Fannie Mae. This activity excludes the debt of consolidated trusts and intraday loans. Activity in short-term debt of Fannie Mae relates to borrowings with an original contractual maturity of one year or less while activity in long-term debt of Fannie Mae relates to borrowings with an original contractual maturity of greater than one year. The reported amounts of debt issued and paid off during each period represent the face amount of the debt at issuance and redemption.
The decrease in short-term debt issued and paid off during 2020 compared with 2019 was primarily driven by a significant reduction in the utilization of short-term notes with overnight maturities throughout 2020 as well as a shift to long-term debt to meet our revised liquidity requirements. The increase in long-term debt issued during 2020 compared with the 2019 was primarily driven by the funding needs discussed above.

Repurchases of debt and early retirements of zero-coupon debt are reported at original face value, which does not equal the amount of actual cash payment.
Many factors could influence our debt activity, affect the amount, mix and cost of our debt funding, reduce demand for our debt securities, increase our liquidity or roll over risk, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, including:
•changes or perceived changes in federal government support of our business or our debt securities;
•changes in our status as a government-sponsored enterprise;
•future changes or disruptions in the financial markets;
•changes in requirements by FHFA, Treasury or other regulators;
•a change or perceived change in the creditworthiness of the U.S. government, due to our reliance on the U.S. government’s support; or
•a downgrade in our credit ratings.
We believe that continued federal government support of our business, as well as our status as a government-sponsored enterprise, are essential to maintaining our access to debt funding. See “Risk Factors” for a discussion of the risks we face relating to:

Contractual Obligations
The table below displays, by remaining maturity, our future cash obligations related to our long-term debt, including announced calls, operating leases, purchase obligations and other material non-cancelable contractual obligations. This table excludes certain contractual obligation transactions that could significantly affect our short- and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. These transactions, which are listed below, are excluded because they involve future cash payments that are considered uncertain and may vary based upon future conditions.
•Future payments of principal and interest related to debt securities of consolidated trusts;
•Future payments associated with our CIRT, CAS REMIC, MCAS, and CAS CLN transactions, because the amount and timing of such payments are contingent upon the occurrence of future credit and prepayment events on the related reference pool of mortgage loans and are therefore uncertain;
•Future payments related to our interest-rate risk management derivatives that may require cash settlement in future periods, because the amount and timing of such payments are dependent upon items such as changes in interest rates; and
•Future payments on our obligations to stand ready to perform under our guarantees relating to Fannie Mae MBS and other financial guarantees, including Fannie Mae commingled structured securities, because the amount and timing of payments under these arrangements are generally contingent upon the occurrence of future events. For a description of the amount of our on- and off-balance sheet Fannie Mae MBS and other financial guarantees as of December 31, 2020, see “Guaranty Book of Business” and “Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.”

Equity Funding
At this time, as a result of the covenants under the senior preferred stock purchase agreement, Treasury’s ownership of the warrant to purchase up to 79.9% of the total shares of our common stock outstanding and the uncertainty regarding our future, we do not have access to equity funding except through draws under the senior preferred stock purchase agreement. For a description of the funding available and the covenants under the senior preferred stock purchase agreement, see “Business-Conservatorship, Treasury Agreements and Housing Finance Reform-Treasury Agreements.”

Other Investments Portfolio
The chart below displays information on the composition of our other investments portfolio. The balance of our other investments portfolio fluctuates as a result of changes in our cash flows, liquidity in the fixed-income markets, and our liquidity risk management framework and practices.
Our other investments portfolio increased significantly during 2020 primarily due to an increase in our investment in U.S. Treasury securities and in cash and cash equivalents driven by proceeds from significantly increased debt issuances as well as proceeds from loan payoffs.
Other Investments Portfolio
(Dollars in billions)
(1)Cash equivalents are comprised of overnight repurchase agreements and U.S. Treasuries that have a maturity at the date of acquisition of three months or less.
Credit Ratings
Our credit ratings from the major credit ratings organizations, as well as the credit ratings of the U.S. government, are primary factors that could affect our ability to access the capital markets and our cost of funds. In addition, our credit ratings are important when we seek to engage in certain long-term transactions, such as derivative transactions. Standard & Poor’s Global Ratings (“S&P”), Moody’s Investors Services (“Moody’s”) and Fitch Ratings Limited (“Fitch”) have all indicated that, if they were to lower the sovereign credit ratings on the U.S., they would likely lower their ratings on the debt of Fannie Mae and certain other government-related entities. In addition, actions by governmental entities impacting Treasury’s support for our business or our debt securities could adversely affect the credit ratings of our senior unsecured debt. See “Risk Factors-Liquidity and Funding Risk” for a discussion of the risks to our business relating to a decrease in our credit ratings, which could include an increase in our borrowing costs, limits on our ability to issue debt, and additional collateral requirements under our derivatives contracts.
The table below displays the credit ratings issued by the three major credit rating agencies.

Fannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 144
MD&A | Liquidity and Capital Management
In August 2020, Fitch affirmed our “AAA” long-term issuer default rating, but lowered our rating outlook from stable to negative, following its affirmation of the United States’ “AAA” issuer default rating and revision of the United States’ rating outlook from stable to negative. Fitch noted that Fannie Mae’s long-term issuer default rating is directly linked to the United States’ long-term issuer default rating, based on Fitch’s view of the U.S. government’s direct financial support of Fannie Mae. We have no covenants in our existing debt agreements that would be violated by a downgrade in our credit ratings. However, in connection with certain derivatives counterparties, we could be required to provide additional collateral to or terminate transactions with certain counterparties in the event that our senior unsecured debt ratings are downgraded.
Cash Flows
Year Ended December 31, 2020. Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash increased from $61.4 billion as of December 31, 2019 to $115.6 billion as of December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by cash inflows from (1) proceeds from repayments and sales of loans, (2) the sale of Fannie Mae MBS to third parties, and (3) the issuance of funding debt, which outpaced redemptions, primarily for the reasons described above.
Partially offsetting these cash inflows were cash outflows primarily from (1) payments on outstanding debt of consolidated trusts, (2) purchases of loans held for investment, and (3) an increase in our investment in U.S. Treasury securities.
Year Ended December 31, 2019. Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash increased from $49.4 billion as of December 31, 2018 to $61.4 billion as of December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily driven by cash inflows from (1) proceeds from repayments and sales of loans, (2) the sale of Fannie Mae MBS to third parties, and (3) the net decrease in federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell or similar agreements.
Partially offsetting these cash inflows were cash outflows primarily from (1) payments on outstanding debt of consolidated trusts, (2) purchases of loans held for investment, and (3) the redemption of funding debt, which outpaced issuances due to lower funding needs.
Capital Management
Regulatory Capital
FHFA stated that, during conservatorship, our existing statutory and FHFA-directed regulatory capital requirements will not be binding and that FHFA will not issue quarterly capital classifications. We report GAAP net worth and the deficit of our core capital over statutory minimum capital in our periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K. As we discuss in “Business-Legislation and Regulation-GSE Act and Other Legislative and Regulatory Matters-Capital,” FHFA, in its capacity as our regulator, has issued a new rule finalizing the enterprise regulatory capital framework. We estimate that, had the new framework been applicable to us as of December 31, 2020, we would have been required to hold approximately $185 billion in adjusted total capital, of which approximately $135 billion must be in the form of common equity tier 1 capital. Prescribed buffers drive approximately $75 billion of the total requirements.
Capital Activity
Under the terms governing the senior preferred stock, no dividends were payable to Treasury for the fourth quarter of 2020 and none are payable for the first quarter of 2021. Also, the aggregate liquidation preference of the senior preferred stock increased to $142.2 billion as of December 31, 2020 and will further increase to $146.8 billion as of March 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2020, our net worth was $25.3 billion.
See “Business-Conservatorship, Treasury Agreements and Housing Finance Reform-Treasury Agreements” for more information on the terms of our senior preferred stock.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We enter into certain business arrangements to facilitate our statutory purpose of providing liquidity to the secondary mortgage market and to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Some of these arrangements are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheets or may be recorded in amounts different from the full contract or notional amount of the transaction, depending on the nature or structure of, and the accounting required to be applied to, the arrangement. These arrangements are commonly referred to as “off-balance sheet arrangements” and expose us to potential losses in excess of the amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets.
Our off-balance sheet arrangements result primarily from the following:
•our guaranty of mortgage loan securitization and resecuritization transactions, and other guaranty commitments, over which we do not have control;
Fannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 145
MD&A | Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
•liquidity support transactions; and
•partnership interests.
Since we began issuing UMBS in June 2019, some of the securities we issue are structured securities backed, in whole or in part, by Freddie Mac securities. When we issue a structured security, we provide a guaranty that we will supplement amounts received from the underlying mortgage-related security as required to permit timely payment of principal and interest on the certificates related to the resecuritization trust. Accordingly, when we issue structured securities backed in whole or in part by Freddie Mac securities, we extend our guaranty to the underlying Freddie Mac security included in the structured security. Our issuance of structured securities backed in whole or in part by Freddie Mac securities creates additional off-balance sheet exposure as we do not have control over the Freddie Mac mortgage loan securitizations. Because we do not have the power to direct matters (primarily the servicing of mortgage loans) that impact the credit risk to which we are exposed, which constitute control of these securitization trusts, we do not consolidate these trusts in our consolidated balance sheet, giving rise to off-balance sheet exposure.
The total amount of our off-balance sheet exposure related to unconsolidated Fannie Mae MBS net of any beneficial interest that we retain, and other financial guarantees was $153.6 billion as of December 31, 2020. Approximately $110.7 billion of this amount consisted of the unpaid principal balance of Freddie Mac-issued UMBS backing Fannie Mae-issued Supers. Additionally, off-balance sheet exposure includes approximately $26.6 billion of the unpaid principal balance of Freddie Mac securities backing Fannie Mae-issued REMICs. We expect our off-balance sheet exposure to Freddie Mac securities to increase as we issue more structured securities backed by Freddie Mac securities in the future. The total amount of our off-balance sheet exposure related to unconsolidated Fannie Mae MBS and other financial guarantees was $68.6 billion as of December 31, 2019. Approximately $37.8 billion of this amount consisted of the unpaid principal balance of Freddie Mac-issued UMBS backing Fannie Mae-issued Supers and $12.3 billion of this amount consisted of the unpaid principal balance of Freddie Mac securities backing Fannie Mae-issued REMICs. Our total exposure as of December 31, 2019 to Freddie Mac securities backing Fannie Mae-issued REMICs may have been lower than the amount disclosed because a portion of the Freddie Mac securities backing these Fannie Mae-issued REMICs may have been backed by Fannie Mae MBS. See “Note 6, Financial Guarantees” for more information regarding our maximum exposure to loss on unconsolidated Fannie Mae MBS and Freddie Mac securities.
We also have off-balance sheet exposure to losses from liquidity support transactions and partnership interests.
•Our total outstanding liquidity commitments to advance funds for securities backed by multifamily housing revenue bonds totaled $6.4 billion as of December 31, 2020 and $7.2 billion as of December 31, 2019. These commitments require us to advance funds to third parties that enable them to repurchase tendered bonds or securities that are unable to be remarketed. We hold cash and cash equivalents in our other investments portfolio in excess of these commitments to advance funds.
•We make investments in various limited partnerships and similar legal entities, which consist of low-income housing tax credit investments, community investments and other entities. When we do not have a controlling financial interest in those entities, our consolidated balance sheets reflect only our investment rather than the full amount of the partnership’s assets and liabilities. See “Note 2, Consolidations and Transfers of Financial Assets- Unconsolidated VIEs” for information regarding our limited partnerships and similar legal entities.

MD&A | Risk Management
Risk Management
We manage the risks that arise from our business activities through our enterprise risk management program. Our risk management activities are based on principles aligned with the principles set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission’s (“COSO”) Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”): Integrating with Strategy and Performance framework.
We are exposed to the following major risk categories:
•Credit Risk. Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from another party’s failure to meet its contractual obligations. For financial securities or instruments, credit risk is the risk of not receiving principal, interest or other financial obligation on a timely basis. Our credit risk exposure exists primarily in connection with our guaranty book of business and our institutional counterparties.
•Market Risk. Market risk is the risk of loss resulting from changes in the economic environment. Market risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates, exchange rates and other market rates and prices. Market risk includes interest-rate risk, which is the risk that movements in interest rates will adversely affect the value of our assets or liabilities or our future earnings. Market risk also includes spread risk, which can result in losses from changes in the spreads between our mortgage assets and our debt and derivatives we use to hedge our position.
•Liquidity and Funding Risk. Liquidity and funding risk is the risk to our financial condition and resilience arising from an inability to meet obligations when they come due, including the risk associated with the inability to access funding sources or manage fluctuations in funding levels.
•Operational Risk. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or disruptions from external events. Operational risk includes cyber/information security risk, third-party risk and model risk.
We are also exposed to these additional risk categories:
•Strategic Risk. Strategic risk is the risk of loss resulting from poor business decisions, poor implementation of business decisions or the failure to respond appropriately to changes in the industry or external environment.
•Compliance Risk. Compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, damage to current or projected financial condition, damage to business resilience or damage to reputation resulting from nonconformance with compliance obligations. These obligations include laws or regulations, prescribed practices, MBS trust agreements, supervisory guidance, conservator instruction, internal policies and procedures or ethical standards governing how we operate. Compliance risk exposes us to adverse actions by regulators, law enforcement or other government agencies, or private civil action, and financial losses incurred through fines, legal judgments, voiding of contracts or civil penalties. Compliance risk can result in damaged or diminished reputation, limited business opportunities and lessened expansion potential.
•Reputational Risk. Reputational risk is the risk that substantial negative publicity may cause a decline in public perception of us, a decline in our customer base, costly litigation, revenue reductions or losses.
For a more detailed discussion of these and other risks that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and net worth, see “Risk Factors.”

Risk Management Governance
We manage risk by using the industry standard “three lines of defense” structure. Our Board of Directors and management-level risk committees are also integral to our risk management program.
Mortgage Credit Risk Management
Overview
Mortgage credit risk arises from the risk of loss resulting from the failure of a borrower to make required mortgage payments. We are exposed to credit risk on our book of business because we either hold mortgage assets, have issued a guaranty in connection with the creation of Fannie Mae MBS backed by mortgage assets or have provided other credit enhancements on mortgage assets. For more information on how we manage mortgage credit risk, see “Business-Managing Mortgage Credit Risk,” “Single-Family Business-Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management,” and “Multifamily Business-Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk Management.”
Natural Disaster and Climate Risk Management
Major weather events or other natural disasters expose us to credit risk in a variety of ways, including by damaging properties that secure mortgage loans in our book of business and by negatively impacting the ability of borrowers to make payments on their mortgage loans. The amount of losses we incur as a result of a major weather event or natural disaster depends significantly on the extent to which the resulting property damage is covered by hazard or flood insurance and whether borrowers are able and willing to continue making payments on their mortgages. The amount of losses we incur can also be affected by the extent that a disaster impacts the region, especially if it depresses the local economy, and by the availability of federal, state, or local assistance to borrowers affected by a disaster. To date, our losses from natural disasters have been limited by geographic diversity in our book of business, the availability of insurance coverage for damages sustained and borrowers with equity in their homes continuing to pay their mortgages.
Fannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 149
MD&A | Risk Management | Mortgage Credit Risk Management
For our multifamily loans, our multifamily lenders typically share with us approximately one-third of the credit risk through our DUS program. For single-family and multifamily loans covered in back-end credit risk transfer transactions, we retain a portion of the risk of future losses, including all or a portion of the first loss risk in most transactions. To the extent weather and disaster-related losses on loans covered by these transactions were to exceed the amount of first loss we retain, a portion of those losses would be covered by the transactions. Mortgage insurance does not protect us from default risk for properties that suffer damages not covered by the hazard or flood insurance we require. For more information on our single-family credit risk transfer transactions, see “Single-Family Business-Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management-Single-Family Credit Enhancement and Transfer of Mortgage Credit Risk-Credit Risk Transfer Transactions” and for more information on our multifamily credit risk transfer transactions and our DUS program, see “Multifamily Business-Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk Management-Transfer of Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk.”
In general, we require borrowers to obtain property insurance to cover the risk of damage to their property resulting from hazards such as fire, wind and, for properties in areas identified by FEMA as Special Flood Hazard Areas, flooding. At the time of origination, a borrower is required to provide proof of such insurance, and our servicers have the right and the obligation to obtain such insurance, at the borrower’s cost, if the borrower allows the policy to lapse. We do not generally require property insurance to cover damages from flooding in areas outside a Special Flood Hazard Area, or to cover earthquake damage to single-family properties and to multifamily properties unless required by a seismic-risk assessment.
In the event of a natural or other disaster, our servicers work with affected borrowers to develop a plan that addresses the borrower’s specific situation. Depending on the circumstances, the plan may include one or more of the following: a payment forbearance plan; a repayment or reinstatement plan; a payment deferral; loan modification; coordination with insurance companies and administration of insurance proceeds; and, if necessary, foreclosure alternatives such as short sales and deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure, or foreclosure. We have also established Fannie Mae’s Disaster Response NetworkTM to offer our eligible single-family borrowers free support from HUD-approved housing advisors, including help in developing a recovery assessment and action plan, filing claims, working with mortgage servicers, and identifying and navigating sources of federal, state and local assistance. These activities are designed to assist borrowers affected by disasters and thereby help reduce our losses, and we continue to evaluate their impact and seek new options and resources to deploy in response to disasters.
Recent years have seen frequent and severe natural disasters in the U.S., including hurricanes, wildfires and floods. There are concerns that the frequency and intensity of major weather-related events is indicative of the impact of climate change and that this change will persist and intensify in the future. Population growth and an increase in people living in high-risk areas, such as coastal areas vulnerable to severe storms and flooding, has also increased the impact of these events. Low- and moderate-income and minority households are disproportionately exposed to risks from severe weather events and low- and moderate-income households have limited financial resources to withstand the economic impact.
We recognize that the increased frequency, intensity and unpredictability of major natural disasters poses risks for all stakeholders in the housing system, including borrowers, renters, lenders, investors, insurers and us. In the first half of 2020, we established a dedicated team within Fannie Mae to work on climate risk. Our Climate Impact team is focused on the physical and transition risks associated with climate change, as defined by the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, to better understand our future exposure and to develop strategies to help manage and mitigate our climate risk.
We are exploring the role we, along with FHFA and others, can play in helping to address some of these risks. For example, we are currently examining flood risk and insurance beyond our current requirements and considering how we can help develop solutions to address this risk, especially solutions that would not merely transfer risk away from us, but that would reduce the risks for all involved. Developing solutions to these challenges is complicated by the range and diversity of affected stakeholders, the possible need for legislative or regulatory action, industry insurance capacity, and the need to balance risk mitigation, affordability and sustainability.
See “Risk Factors-Credit Risk” for additional information on the risks we face from the occurrence of major natural or other disasters, including additional ways that such events could negatively impact our business, results and liquidity.

MD&A | Risk Management | Institutional Counterparty Credit Risk Management
Institutional Counterparty Credit Risk Management
Overview
Institutional counterparty credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the failure of an institutional counterparty to fulfill its contractual obligations to us. Our primary exposure to institutional counterparty credit risk exists with our:
•credit guarantors, including mortgage insurers, reinsurers and multifamily lenders with risk sharing arrangements;
•mortgage sellers and servicers;
•financial institutions that issue investments included in our other investments portfolio; and
•derivatives counterparties.
We routinely enter into a high volume of transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry resulting in a significant credit concentration with respect to this industry. We also may have multiple exposures to particular counterparties, as many of our institutional counterparties perform several types of services for us. Accordingly, if one of these counterparties were to default on its obligations to us, it could harm our business and financial results in a variety of ways. Our overall objective in managing institutional counterparty credit risk is to maintain individual and portfolio-level counterparty exposures within acceptable ranges based on our risk-based rating system. We achieve this objective through the following:
•establishment and observance of counterparty eligibility standards appropriate to each exposure type and level;
•establishment of risk limits;
•requiring collateralization of exposures where appropriate; and
•exposure monitoring and management.
See “Risk Factors-Credit Risk” for additional discussion of the risks to our business if one or more of our institutional counterparties fails to fulfill their contractual obligations to us.
Establishment and Observance of Counterparty Eligibility Standards
The institutions with which we do business vary in size, complexity and geographic footprint. Because of this, counterparty eligibility criteria vary depending upon the type and magnitude of the risk exposure incurred. We use a risk-based approach to assess the credit risk of our counterparties through regular examination of their financial statements, confidential communication with the management of those counterparties and regular monitoring of publicly available credit rating information. This and other information is used to develop proprietary credit rating metrics that we use to assess credit quality. Factors including corporate or third-party support or guaranties, our knowledge of the counterparty and its management, reputation, quality of operations and experience are also important in determining the initial and continuing eligibility of a counterparty.
Establishment of Risk Limits
Institutions are assigned a risk limit to ensure that our risk exposure is maintained at a level appropriate for the institution’s credit assessment and the time horizon for the exposure, as well as to diversify exposure so that we adequately manage our concentration risk. A corporate risk limit is first established at the counterparty level for the aggregate of all activity and then is divided among our individual business units. Our business units may further subdivide limits among products or activities.
Collateralization of Exposures
We may require collateral, letters of credit or investment agreements as a condition to approving exposure to a counterparty. Collateral requirements are determined after a comprehensive review of the credit quality and the level of risk exposure of each counterparty. We may require that a counterparty post collateral in the event of an adverse event such as a ratings downgrade. Collateral requirements are monitored and adjusted daily.
Exposure Monitoring and Management
The risk management functions of the individual business units are responsible for managing the counterparty exposures associated with their activities within risk limits. An oversight team that reports to our Chief Risk Officer is responsible for establishing and enforcing corporate policies and procedures regarding counterparties, establishing corporate limits and aggregating and reporting institutional counterparty exposure. We regularly update exposure limits for individual institutions and communicate changes to the relevant business units. We regularly report exposures against the risk limits to the Risk Policy and Capital Committee of the Board of Directors.

Mortgage Insurers
We are generally required, pursuant to our charter, to obtain credit enhancements on single-family conventional mortgage loans that we purchase or securitize with LTV ratios over 80% at the time of purchase. We use several types of credit enhancements to manage our single-family mortgage credit risk, including primary and pool mortgage insurance coverage. Our primary exposure associated with mortgage insurers is that they will fail to fulfill their obligations to reimburse us for claims under our insurance policies.
Actions we take to manage this risk include:
•maintaining financial and operational eligibility requirements that an insurer must meet to become and remain a qualified mortgage insurer;
•regularly monitoring our exposure to individual mortgage insurers and mortgage insurer credit ratings, including in-depth financial reviews and analyses of the insurers’ portfolios and capital adequacy under hypothetical stress scenarios;
•requiring certification and supporting documentation annually from each mortgage insurer; and
•performing periodic reviews of mortgage insurers to confirm compliance with eligibility requirements and to evaluate their management, control and underwriting practices.
The master policies issued by our primary mortgage insurers govern their claim-paying obligations to us, including circumstances in which significant underwriting or servicing defects might permit the mortgage insurer to rescind coverage or deny a claim. Where a claim has not been properly paid as a result of lender non-compliance with their obligation to maintain coverage, the lender is required to make us whole for losses not covered by the insurer. In recent years, the risk of coverage rescission has been mitigated both by the quality control standards required by private mortgage insurer eligibility requirements (“PMIERs”), which have helped reduce the number of significant underwriting defects, and also by rescission relief principles we require in mortgage insurer master policies. Generally, the rescission relief principles align with our representations and warranties framework and require our primary mortgage insurers to waive their rescission rights after a mortgage has performed for at least 36 months or if they have completed a full review of the loan and found no significant defects. See below for a discussion of the PMIERs.
In describing our mortgage insurance coverage, “insurance in force” refers to the unpaid principal balance of single-family loans in our conventional guaranty book of business covered under the applicable mortgage insurance policies. Our total mortgage insurance in force was $675.0 billion, or 21% of our single-family conventional guaranty book of business, as of December 31, 2020, compared with $638.8 billion, or 22% of our single-family conventional guaranty book of business, as of December 31, 2019.
“Risk in force” refers to the maximum potential loss recovery under the applicable mortgage insurance policies in force and is generally based on the loan-level insurance coverage percentage and, if applicable, any aggregate pool loss limit, as specified in the policy. As of December 31, 2020, our total mortgage insurance risk in force was $171.2 billion, or 5% of our single-family conventional guaranty book of business, compared with $163.2 billion, or 6% of our single-family conventional guaranty book of business, as of December 31, 2019.
Our total mortgage insurance in force and risk in force excludes insurance coverage provided by federal government entities and credit insurance obtained through CIRT deals.

Mortgage Insurer Concentration(1)
(1)Insurance coverage amounts provided for each counterparty may include coverage provided by affiliates and subsidiaries of the counterparty.
Of our total risk-in-force coverage, 1% as of December 31, 2020, compared with 2% as of December 31, 2019, was held with three mortgage insurers that are in run-off, and therefore are no longer approved to write new insurance with us. See “Risk Factors-Credit Risk” for a discussion of the risks to our business of claims under our mortgage insurance policies not being paid in full or at all, including the risks associated with our three mortgage insurance counterparties that are in run-off.
Mortgage insurers must meet and maintain compliance with the PMIERs to be eligible to write mortgage insurance on loans acquired by Fannie Mae. The PMIERs are designed to ensure that mortgage insurers have sufficient liquid assets to pay all claims under a hypothetical future stress scenario. Under FHFA guidance, we and Freddie Mac published several revisions to the PMIERs in 2020, which initially became effective June 30, 2020. The revisions include (1) a temporary adjustment when calculating risk-based required assets for nonperforming mortgage loans that became newly delinquent after the onset of the COVID-19 crisis or that are subject to a forbearance plan granted in response to a financial hardship related to COVID-19, and (2) through June 30, 2021, a requirement for private mortgage insurers to secure prior approval from Fannie Mae to enable payment of dividends or certain new transfers of cash. The adjustment provides partial relief to mortgage insurers’ capital requirements under the PMIERs for the impacted loans.
Reinsurers
We use CIRT deals to transfer credit risk on a pool of loans to an insurance provider that retains the risk, or to an insurance provider that simultaneously cedes all of its risk to one or more reinsurers. In CIRT transactions, we select the insurance providers and approve the allocation of coverage that may be simultaneously transferred to reinsurers by a direct provider of our CIRT insurance coverage. We take certain steps to increase the likelihood that we will recover on the claims we file with the insurers, including the following:
•In our approval and selection of CIRT insurers and reinsurers, we take into account the financial strength of those companies and the concentration risk that we have with those counterparties.
•We monitor the financial strength of CIRT insurers and reinsurers to confirm compliance with our requirements and to minimize potential exposure. Changes in the financial strength of an insurer or reinsurer may impact our future allocation of new CIRT insurance coverage to those providers. In addition, a material deterioration of the financial strength of a CIRT insurer or reinsurer may permit us to terminate existing CIRT coverage pursuant to terms of the CIRT insurance policy.

MD&A | Risk Management | Institutional Counterparty Credit Risk Management
•We require a portion of the insurers’ or reinsurers’ obligations in a CIRT transaction to be collateralized with highly-rated liquid assets held in a trust account. The required amount of collateral is initially determined according to the ratings of the insurer or reinsurer. Contractual provisions require additional collateral to be posted in the event of adverse developments with the counterparty, such as a ratings downgrade.
The charts below display the concentration of our credit risk exposure to our top five CIRT counterparties, measured by maximum liability to us, excluding the benefit of collateral we hold to secure the counterparties’ obligations.
CIRT Counterparty Concentration
•As of December 31, 2020, our CIRT counterparties had a maximum liability to us of $11.5 billion.
•As of December 31, 2020, $3.3 billion in liquid assets securing CIRT counterparties’ obligations were held in trust accounts.
•Our top five CIRT counterparties had a maximum liability to us of $4.9 billion as of December 31, 2020, compared with $4.1 billion as of December 31, 2019.
For information on our credit risk transfer transactions, see “Single-Family Business-Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management-Single-Family Credit Enhancement and Transfer of Mortgage Credit Risk-Credit Risk Transfer Transactions” and “Multifamily Business-Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk Management-Transfer of Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk.”
Multifamily Lenders with Risk Sharing
We enter into risk sharing agreements with multifamily lenders, primarily through the DUS program, pursuant to which the lenders agree to bear all or some portion of the credit losses on the covered loans. Our maximum potential loss recovery from lenders under risk sharing agreements on multifamily loans was $92.9 billion as of December 31, 2020, compared with $81.4 billion as of December 31, 2019. As of both December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, 51% of our maximum potential loss recovery on multifamily loans was from five DUS lenders.
As noted above in “Multifamily Business-Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk Management-Transfer of Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk,” our primary multifamily delivery channel is our DUS program, which is comprised of lenders that range from large depositories to independent non-bank financial institutions. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 35% of the unpaid principal balance of loans in our multifamily guaranty book of business serviced by our DUS lenders was from institutions with an external investment grade credit rating or a guaranty from an affiliate with an external investment grade credit rating, compared with approximately 37% as of December 31, 2019. Given the recourse nature of the DUS program, DUS lenders are bound by eligibility standards that dictate, among other items, minimum capital and liquidity levels, and the posting of collateral at a highly rated custodian to secure a portion of the lenders’ future obligations. We actively monitor the financial condition of these lenders to help ensure the level of risk remains within our standards and to ensure required capital levels are maintained and are in alignment with actual and modeled loss projections.

Mortgage Servicers and Sellers
Mortgage Servicers
The primary risk associated with mortgage servicers that service the loans in our guaranty book of business is that they will fail to fulfill their servicing obligations. See “Single-Family Business-Single-Family Primary Business Activities-Single-Family Mortgage Servicing” and “Multifamily Business-Multifamily Primary Business Activities-Multifamily Mortgage Servicing” for more discussion on the services performed by our mortgage servicers.
A servicing contract breach could result in credit losses for us or could cause us to incur the cost of finding a replacement servicer. We likely would incur costs and potential increases in servicing fees and could also face operational risks if we replace a mortgage servicer. If a mortgage servicer defaults, it could result in a temporary disruption in servicing and loss mitigation activities relating to the loans serviced by that mortgage servicer, particularly if there is a loss of experienced servicing personnel. See “Risk Factors-Credit Risk” for a discussion of additional risks to our business and financial results associated with mortgage servicers.
We mitigate these risks in several ways, including:
•establishing minimum standards and financial requirements for our servicers;
•monitoring financial and portfolio performance as compared with peers and internal benchmarks; and
•for our largest mortgage servicers, conducting periodic financial reviews to confirm compliance with servicing guidelines and servicing performance expectations.
We may take one or more of the following actions to mitigate our credit exposure to mortgage servicers that present a higher risk:
•require a guaranty of obligations by higher-rated entities;
•transfer exposure to third parties;
•require collateral;
•establish more stringent financial requirements;
•work with underperforming major servicers to improve operational processes; and
•suspend or terminate the selling and servicing relationship if deemed necessary.
A large portion of our single-family guaranty book is serviced by non-depository servicers, particularly our delinquent single-family loans. Compared with depository financial institutions, these institutions pose additional risks to us because they may not have the same financial strength or operational capacity, or be subject to the same level of regulatory oversight, as our largest mortgage servicer counterparties, which are mostly depository institutions.
We have previously established minimum liquidity requirements for single-family non-depository servicers to maintain eligibility with Fannie Mae. With the increase in delinquent loans in forbearance plans as a result of the unprecedented circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic and the CARES Act, we temporarily modified our minimum liquidity requirements for single-family non-depository servicers to maintain eligibility with Fannie Mae. Beginning with the second quarter of 2020, when calculating the minimum liquidity requirement for seriously delinquent mortgage loans for non-depository servicers, an adjustment is included for mortgage loans in a COVID-19-related forbearance plan that are 90 days or more delinquent and were current at the inception of the plan. The adjustment provides partial relief of the minimum liquidity requirements for the servicers of these impacted loans.
In June 2020, FHFA announced that it would re-propose the minimum financial eligibility requirements for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac sellers and servicers due to market volatility driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. In January 2021, FHFA issued its re-proposal which, if adopted as proposed, may increase capital and liquidity requirements for our single family non-depository sellers and servicers. FHFA has indicated the new requirements are expected to become effective December 31, 2021.

Counterparty Credit Exposure of Investments Held in our Other Investments Portfolio
The primary credit exposure associated with investments held in our other investments portfolio is that issuers will not repay principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms. If one of these counterparties fails to meet its obligations to us under the terms of the investments, it could result in financial losses to us and have a material adverse effect on our earnings, liquidity, financial condition and net worth. We believe the risk of default is low because our other investments portfolio consists of instruments broadly traded in the financial markets, including cash and cash equivalents, securities purchased under agreements to resell or similar arrangements and U.S. Treasury securities.
As of December 31, 2020, our other investments portfolio totaled $197.0 billion and included $130.5 billion of U.S. Treasury securities. As of December 31, 2019, our other investments portfolio totaled $74.3 billion and included $39.5 billion of U.S. Treasury securities. We mitigate our risk by monitoring the credit risk position of our other investments portfolio. As of December 31, 2020, we held $8.1 billion in overnight unsecured deposits with four financial institutions, compared with $8.7 billion held with seven financial institutions as of December 31, 2019. The short-term credit ratings for each of these financial institutions by S&P, Moody’s and Fitch were at least A-1 or the Moody’s or Fitch equivalent of A-1.
See “Liquidity and Capital Management-Liquidity Management-Other Investments Portfolio” for more information on our other investments portfolio.
Derivative Counterparty Credit Exposure
The primary credit exposure that we have on a derivative transaction is that a counterparty will default on payments due, which could result in us having to acquire a replacement derivative from a different counterparty at a higher cost or we may be unable to find a suitable replacement. Our derivative counterparty credit exposure relates principally to interest-rate derivative contracts.
Historically, our risk management derivative transactions have been made pursuant to bilateral contracts with a specific counterparty governed by the terms of an International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc. master agreement. Pursuant to regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act, we are required to submit certain categories of interest-rate swaps to a derivatives clearing organization. We refer to our derivative transactions made pursuant to bilateral contracts as our OTC derivative transactions and our derivative transactions accepted for clearing by a derivatives clearing organization as our cleared derivative transactions.
Actions we take to manage our derivative counterparty credit exposure relating to our OTC derivative transactions include:
•entering into enforceable master netting arrangements with these counterparties, which allow us to net derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty; and
•requiring counterparties to post collateral, which includes cash, U.S. Treasury securities, agency debt and agency mortgage-related securities.
We manage our credit exposure relating to our cleared derivative transactions through enforceable master netting arrangements. These arrangements allow us to net our exposure to cleared derivatives by clearing organization and by clearing member.
Our cleared derivative transactions are submitted to a derivatives clearing organization on our behalf through a clearing member of the organization. A contract accepted by a derivatives clearing organization is governed by the terms of the clearing organization’s rules and arrangements between us and the clearing member of the clearing organization. As a result, we are exposed to the institutional credit risk of both the derivatives clearing organization and the member who is acting on our behalf.
We estimate our exposure to credit loss on derivative instruments by calculating the replacement cost, on a present value basis, to settle at current market prices all outstanding derivative contracts in a net gain position at the counterparty level where the right of legal offset exists.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had thirteen counterparties with which we may transact OTC derivative transactions, all of which were subject to enforceable master netting arrangements. We had outstanding notional amounts with all of these OTC counterparties, and the highest concentration by total outstanding notional amount was approximately 4% as of December 31, 2020 compared with 7% as of December 31, 2019, measured based on all derivatives outstanding.
Total exposure represents our exposure to credit loss on derivative instruments less the cash and non-cash collateral posted by our counterparties to us. This does not include collateral held in excess of exposure. Our total exposure to
Fannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 157
MD&A | Risk Management | Institutional Counterparty Credit Risk Management
credit loss on derivative instruments was $179 million as of December 31, 2020 and $40 million as of December 31, 2019.
See “Note 8, Derivative Instruments” and “Note 14, Netting Arrangements” for additional information on our derivative contracts as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Other Counterparties
Counterparty Credit Risk Exposure Arising from the Resecuritization of Freddie Mac-Issued Securities
We began resecuritizing Freddie Mac-issued securities in June 2019 when we began issuing UMBS, which has increased our credit risk exposure and operational risk exposure to Freddie Mac, and our risk exposure to Freddie Mac is expected to increase as we issue more structured securities backed by Freddie Mac securities going forward. Our inclusion of Freddie Mac securities as collateral for the structured securities that we issue increases our counterparty credit risk exposure to Freddie Mac. In the event Freddie Mac were to fail (for credit or operational reasons) to make a payment on a payment date on Freddie Mac securities that we had resecuritized in a Fannie Mae-issued structured security, we would be responsible for making the entire payment on the Freddie Mac securities included in that structured security in order to make payments on any of our outstanding single-family Fannie Mae MBS to be paid on that payment date. Accordingly, as the amount of structured securities we issue that are backed by Freddie Mac securities grows, if Freddie Mac were to fail to meet its obligations to us under the terms of these securities, it could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and financial condition. We believe the risk of default by Freddie Mac is negligible because of the funding commitment available to Freddie Mac through its senior preferred stock purchase agreement with Treasury.
As of December 31, 2020, approximately $137.3 billion in Freddie Mac securities were backing Fannie Mae-issued structured securities. As of December 31, 2019, approximately $50.1 billion in Freddie Mac securities were backing Fannie Mae-issued structured securities. See “Business-Mortgage Securitizations-Uniform Mortgage-Backed Securities, or UMBS” and “Risk Factors-GSE and Conservatorship Risk” for more information on risks associated with our issuance of UMBS.
Central Counterparty Clearing Institutions
Fannie Mae is a clearing member of two divisions of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”), a central counterparty (“CCP”). One FICC division clears our trades involving securities purchased under agreements to resell, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and other non-mortgage related securities. The other division clears our forward purchase and sale commitments of mortgage-related securities, including dollar roll transactions. As a result of these trades , we are required to post initial and variation margin payments and are exposed to the risk that FICC fails to perform. As a clearing member of FICC, we are exposed to the risk that the CCP or one or more of the CCP’s clearing members fails to perform its obligations as described below.
•A default by or the financial or operational failure of FICC would require us to replace contracts cleared through FICC, thereby increasing operational costs and potentially resulting in losses.
•We may also be exposed to losses if a clearing member of FICC defaults on its obligations as each clearing member is required to absorb a portion of those fellow-clearing member losses. As a result, we could lose the margin that we have posted to FICC. Moreover, our exposure could exceed the amount of margin that we previously posted to FICC, since FICC’s rules require non-defaulting clearing members to cover, on a pro rata basis, losses caused by a clearing member’s default.
We are unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make to FICC under these arrangements as our exposure is dependent on the volume of trades FICC clearing members execute now and in the future, which varies daily. Although we are unable to develop an estimate of our maximum exposure, we expect that losses caused by any clearing member would be partially offset by the fair value of margin posted by the defaulting clearing member and any other available assets of the CCP for those purposes. We believe that the risk of loss is remote due to the FICC's initial and daily mark-to-market margin requirements, guarantee funds and other resources that are available in the event of a default.
We actively monitor the risks associated FICC in order to effectively manage this counterparty risk and our associated liquidity exposure
Custodial Depository Institutions
Our mortgage servicer counterparties are required by our Servicing Guide to use custodial depository institutions to hold remittances of borrower payments of principal and interest on our behalf. If a custodial depository institution were to fail while holding such remittances, we would be exposed to risk for balances in excess of the deposit insurance protection and might not be able to recover all of the principal and interest payments being held by the depository on our behalf, or
Fannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 158
MD&A | Risk Management | Institutional Counterparty Credit Risk Management
there might be a substantial delay in receiving these amounts. If this were to occur, we would be required to replace these amounts with our own funds to make payments that are due to Fannie Mae MBS certificateholders. Accordingly, the insolvency of one of our principal custodial depository institutions could result in significant financial losses to us. To mitigate these risks, our Servicing Guide requires our mortgage servicer counterparties to use custodial depository institutions that are insured, that are rated as “well capitalized” by their regulator and that meet certain minimum financial ratings from third-party agencies.
Mortgage Originators, Investors and Dealers
We are routinely exposed to pre-settlement risk through the purchase or sale of mortgage loans and mortgage-related securities with mortgage originators, mortgage investors and mortgage dealers. The risk is the possibility that the counterparty will be unable or unwilling to either deliver mortgage assets or compensate us for the cost to cancel or replace the transaction. We manage this risk by determining position limits with these counterparties, based upon our assessment of their creditworthiness, and by monitoring and managing these exposures.
Debt Security Dealers
The credit risk associated with dealers that commit to place our debt securities is that they will fail to honor their contracts to take delivery of the debt, which could result in delayed issuance of the debt through another dealer. We manage these risks by establishing approval standards, monitoring our exposure positions and monitoring changes in the credit quality of dealers.
Document Custodians
We use third-party document custodians to provide loan document certification and custody services for some of the loans that we purchase and securitize. In many cases, our lender customers or their affiliates also serve as document custodians for us. Our ownership rights to the mortgage loans that we own or that back our Fannie Mae MBS could be challenged if a lender intentionally or negligently pledges or sells the loans that we purchased or fails to obtain a release of prior liens on the loans that we purchased, which could result in financial losses to us. When a lender or one of its affiliates acts as a document custodian for us, the risk that our ownership interest in the loans may be adversely affected is increased, particularly in the event the lender were to become insolvent. We mitigate these risks through legal and contractual arrangements with these custodians that identify our ownership interest, as well as by establishing qualifying standards for document custodians and requiring removal of the documents to our possession or to an independent third-party document custodian if we have concerns about the solvency or competency of the document custodian.
The MERS System
The MERS® System is an electronic registry owned by Intercontinental Exchange that is widely used by participants in the mortgage finance industry to track servicing rights and ownership of loans in the United States. A large portion of the loans we own or guarantee are registered and tracked in the MERS System. Though we believe it is unlikely, if we are unable to use the MERS System, or if our use of the MERS System adversely affects our ability to enforce our rights with respect to our loans registered and tracked in the MERS System, it could create operational and legal risks for us and increase the costs and time it takes to record loans or foreclose on loans.
Market Risk Management, including Interest-Rate Risk Management
We are subject to market risk, which includes interest-rate risk and spread risk. These risks arise from our mortgage asset investments. Interest-rate risk is the risk that movements in interest rates will adversely affect the value of our assets or liabilities or our future earnings. Spread risk can result from changes in the spread between our mortgage assets and our debt and derivatives we use to hedge our position. As described in “Risk Factors” in this report, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased our market risk.
Interest-Rate Risk Management
Our goal is to manage market risk to be neutral to movements in interest rates and volatility, subject to model constraints and prevailing market conditions. We employ an integrated interest-rate risk management strategy that allows for informed risk taking within pre-defined corporate risk limits. Decisions regarding our strategy in managing interest-rate risk are based upon our corporate market risk policy and limits that are approved by our Board of Directors.
We have actively managed the interest-rate risk of our “net portfolio”, which is defined below, through the following techniques:
•asset selection and structuring (that is, by identifying or structuring mortgage assets with attractive prepayment and other risk characteristics);
•issuing a broad range of both callable and non-callable debt instruments; and
Fannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 159
MD&A | Risk Management | Market Risk Management, including Interest-Rate Risk Management
•using interest-rate derivatives.
We have not actively managed or hedged our spread risk, which would include the impact of changes in the spread between our mortgage assets and debt (referred to as mortgage-to-debt spreads) after we purchase mortgage assets, other than through asset monitoring and disposition. For mortgage assets in our portfolio that we intend to hold to maturity to realize the contractual cash flows, we accept period-to-period volatility in our financial performance attributable to changes in mortgage-to-debt spreads that occur after our purchase of mortgage assets. See “Risk Factors-Market and Industry Risk” for a discussion of the risks to our business posed by changes in interest rates and changes in spreads.
We monitor current market conditions, including the interest-rate environment, to assess the impact of these conditions on individual positions and our interest-rate risk profile. In addition to qualitative factors, we use various quantitative risk metrics in determining the appropriate composition of our retained mortgage portfolio, our investments in non-mortgage securities and relative mix of debt and derivatives positions in order to remain within pre-defined risk tolerance levels that we consider acceptable. We regularly disclose two interest-rate risk metrics that estimate our interest-rate exposure: (1) fair value sensitivity to changes in interest-rate levels and the slope of the yield curve and (2) duration gap.
The metrics used to measure our interest-rate exposure are generated using internal models. Our internal models, consistent with standard practice for models used in our industry, require numerous assumptions. There are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates. The reliability of our prepayment estimates and interest-rate risk metrics depends on the availability and quality of historical data for each of the types of securities in our net portfolio. When market conditions change rapidly and dramatically, the assumptions of our models may no longer accurately capture or reflect the changing conditions. On a continuous basis, management makes judgments about the appropriateness of the risk assessments indicated by the models. See “Risk Factors-Market and Industry Risk” for a discussion of the risks associated with our reliance on models to manage risk.
Sources of Interest-Rate Risk Exposure
The primary source of our interest-rate risk is the composition of our net portfolio. Our net portfolio consists of our retained mortgage portfolio assets; other investments portfolio; our outstanding debt of Fannie Mae that is used to fund the retained mortgage portfolio assets and other investments portfolio; mortgage commitments and risk management derivatives. Risk management derivatives along with our debt instruments are used to manage interest-rate risk.
Our mortgage assets consist mainly of single-family and multifamily mortgage loans. For single-family loans, borrowers have the option to prepay at any time before the scheduled maturity date or continue paying until the stated maturity. Given this prepayment option held by the borrower, we are exposed to uncertainty as to when or at what rate prepayments will occur, which affects the length of time our mortgage assets will remain outstanding and the timing of the cash flows related to these assets. This prepayment uncertainty results in a potential mismatch between the timing of receipt of cash flows related to our assets and the timing of payment of cash flows related to our liabilities.
Changes in interest rates, as well as other factors, influence mortgage prepayment rates and duration and also affect the value of our mortgage assets. When interest rates decrease, prepayment rates on fixed-rate mortgages generally accelerate because borrowers usually can pay off their existing mortgages and refinance at lower rates. Accelerated prepayment rates have the effect of shortening the duration and average life of the fixed-rate mortgage assets we hold in our net portfolio. In a declining interest-rate environment, existing mortgage assets held in our net portfolio tend to increase in value or price because these mortgages are likely to have higher interest rates than new mortgages, which are being originated at the then-current lower interest rates. Conversely, when interest rates increase, prepayment rates generally slow, which extends the duration and average life of our mortgage assets and results in a decrease in value.
Interest-Rate Risk Management Strategy
Our goal for managing the interest-rate risk of our net portfolio is to be neutral to movements in interest rates and volatility. This involves asset selection and structuring of our liabilities to match and offset the interest-rate characteristics of our retained mortgage portfolio and our investments in non-mortgage securities. Our strategy consists of the following principal elements:
•Debt Instruments. We issue a broad range of both callable and non-callable debt instruments to manage the duration and prepayment risk of expected cash flows of the mortgage assets we own.
•Derivative Instruments. We supplement our issuance of debt with derivative instruments to further reduce duration and prepayment risks.
•Monitoring and Active Portfolio Rebalancing. We continually monitor our risk positions and actively rebalance our portfolio of interest rate-sensitive financial instruments to maintain a close match between the duration of our assets and liabilities.
Fannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 160
MD&A | Risk Management | Market Risk Management, including Interest-Rate Risk Management
Debt Instruments
Historically, the primary tool we have used to fund the purchase of mortgage assets and manage the interest-rate risk implicit in our mortgage assets is the variety of debt instruments we issue. The debt we issue is a mix that typically consists of short- and long-term, non-callable and callable debt. The varied maturities and flexibility of these debt combinations help us in reducing the mismatch of cash flows between assets and liabilities in order to manage the duration risk associated with an investment in long-term fixed-rate assets. Callable debt helps us manage the prepayment risk associated with fixed-rate mortgage assets because the duration of callable debt changes when interest rates change in a manner similar to changes in the duration of mortgage assets. See “Liquidity and Capital Management-Liquidity Management-Debt Funding” for additional information on our debt activity.
Derivative Instruments
Derivative instruments also are an integral part of our strategy in managing interest-rate risk. Derivative instruments may be privately negotiated contracts, which are often referred to as over-the-counter derivatives, or they may be listed and traded on an exchange. When deciding whether to use derivatives, we consider a number of factors, such as cost, efficiency, the effect on our liquidity and results of operations, and our interest-rate risk management strategy.
The derivatives we use for interest-rate risk management purposes fall into these broad categories:
•Interest-rate swap contracts. An interest-rate swap is a transaction between two parties in which each agrees to exchange, or swap, interest payments. The interest payment amounts are tied to different interest rates or indices for a specified period of time and are generally based on a notional amount of principal. The types of interest-rate swaps we use include pay-fixed swaps, receive-fixed swaps and basis swaps.
•Interest-rate option contracts. These contracts primarily include pay-fixed swaptions, receive-fixed swaptions, cancellable swaps and interest-rate caps. A swaption is an option contract that allows us or a counterparty to enter into a pay-fixed or receive-fixed swap at some point in the future.
•Foreign currency swaps. These swaps convert debt that we issue in foreign denominated currencies into U.S. dollars. We enter into foreign currency swaps only to the extent that we hold foreign currency debt.
•Futures. These are standardized exchange-traded contracts that either obligate a buyer to buy an asset or a seller to sell an asset, in each case at a predetermined date and price. The types of futures contracts we enter into include SOFR and U.S. Treasuries.
We use interest-rate swaps, interest-rate options and futures, in combination with our issuance of debt securities, to better match the duration of our assets with the duration of our liabilities. We are generally an end-user of derivatives; our principal purpose in using derivatives is to manage our aggregate interest-rate risk profile within prescribed risk parameters. We generally only use derivatives that are relatively liquid and straightforward to value. We use derivatives for four primary purposes:
•as a substitute for notes and bonds that we issue in the debt markets;
•to achieve risk management objectives not obtainable with debt market securities;
•to quickly and efficiently rebalance our portfolio; and
•to hedge foreign currency exposure.
Decisions regarding the repositioning of our derivatives portfolio are based upon current assessments of our interest-rate risk profile and economic conditions, including the composition of our retained mortgage portfolio, our investments in non-mortgage securities and relative mix of our debt and derivative positions, the interest-rate environment and expected trends.
Expected Impact of Hedge Accounting
We implemented fair value hedge accounting in January 2021 to reduce the impact of interest-rate volatility on our financial results. Under this hedge program, fair value gains and losses attributable to changes in certain benchmark interest rates, such as LIBOR or SOFR, for derivatives that are in a designated hedge relationship may be reduced by offsetting gains and losses in the fair value of designated hedged mortgage loans or debt. Therefore, we expect the volatility of our financial results associated with changes in fair value due to interest rates will be reduced substantially going forward.
Measurement of Interest-Rate Risk
Below we present two quantitative metrics that provide estimates of our interest-rate risk exposure: (1) fair value sensitivity of our net portfolio to changes in interest-rate levels and slope of yield curve; and (2) duration gap. The metrics presented are calculated using internal models that require standard assumptions regarding interest rates and
Fannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 161
MD&A | Risk Management | Market Risk Management, including Interest-Rate Risk Management
future prepayments of principal over the remaining life of our securities. These assumptions are derived based on the characteristics of the underlying structure of the securities and historical prepayment rates experienced at specified interest-rate levels, taking into account current market conditions, the current mortgage rates of our existing outstanding loans, loan age and other factors. On a continuous basis, management makes judgments about the appropriateness of the risk assessments and will make adjustments as necessary to properly assess our interest-rate exposure and manage our interest-rate risk. The methodologies used to calculate risk estimates are periodically changed on a prospective basis to reflect improvements in the underlying estimation process.
Interest-Rate Sensitivity to Changes in Interest-Rate Level and Slope of Yield Curve
Pursuant to a disclosure commitment with FHFA, we disclose on a monthly basis the estimated adverse impact on the fair value of our net portfolio that would result from the following hypothetical situations:
• a 50 basis point shift in interest rates; and
• a 25 basis point change in the slope of the yield curve.
In measuring the estimated impact of changes in the level of interest rates, we assume a parallel shift in all maturities of the U.S. LIBOR interest-rate swap curve.
In measuring the estimated impact of changes in the slope of the yield curve, we assume a constant 7-year rate and a shift of 16.7 basis points for the 1-year rate and shorter tenors and an opposite shift of 8.3 basis points for the 30-year rate. Rate shocks for remaining maturity points are interpolated. Our practice is to allow interest rates to go below zero in the downward shock models unless otherwise prevented through contractual floors. We believe the aforementioned interest-rate shocks for our monthly disclosures represent moderate movements in interest rates over a one-month period.
Duration Gap
Duration gap measures the price sensitivity of our assets and liabilities in our net portfolio to changes in interest rates by quantifying the difference between the estimated durations of our assets and liabilities. Our duration gap analysis reflects the extent to which the estimated maturity and repricing cash flows for our assets are matched, on average, over time and across interest-rate scenarios to those of our liabilities. A positive duration gap indicates that the duration of our assets exceeds the duration of our liabilities. We disclose duration gap on a monthly basis under the caption “Interest-Rate Risk Disclosures” in our Monthly Summary, which is available on our website and announced in a press release.
While our goal is to reduce the price sensitivity of our net portfolio to movements in interest rates, various factors can contribute to a duration gap that is either positive or negative. For example, changes in the market environment can increase or decrease the price sensitivity of our mortgage assets relative to the price sensitivity of our liabilities because of prepayment uncertainty associated with our assets. In a declining interest-rate environment, prepayment rates tend to accelerate, thereby shortening the duration and average life of the fixed-rate mortgage assets we hold in our net portfolio. Conversely, when interest rates increase, prepayment rates generally slow, which extends the duration and average life of our mortgage assets. Our debt and derivative instrument positions are used to manage the interest-rate sensitivity of our retained mortgage portfolio and our investments in non-mortgage securities. As a result, the degree to which the interest-rate sensitivity of our retained mortgage portfolio and our investments in non-mortgage securities is offset will be dependent upon, among other factors, the mix of funding and other risk management derivative instruments we use at any given point in time.
The market value sensitivities of our net portfolio are a function of both the duration and the convexity of our net portfolio. Duration provides a measure of the price sensitivity of a financial instrument to changes in interest rates while convexity reflects the degree to which the duration of the assets and liabilities in our net portfolio changes in response to a given change in interest rates. We use convexity measures to provide us with information about how quickly and by how much our net portfolio’s duration may change in different interest-rate environments. The market value sensitivity of our net portfolio will depend on a number of factors, including the interest-rate environment, modeling assumptions and the composition of assets and liabilities in our net portfolio, which vary over time.
Results of Interest-Rate Sensitivity Measures
The interest-rate risk measures discussed below exclude the impact of changes in the fair value of our guaranty assets and liabilities resulting from changes in interest rates. We exclude our guaranty business from these sensitivity measures based on our current assumption that the guaranty fee income generated from future business activity will largely replace guaranty fee income lost due to mortgage prepayments.

The table below displays the pre-tax market value sensitivity of our net portfolio to changes in the level of interest rates and the slope of the yield curve as measured on the last day of each period presented. The table below also provides the daily average, minimum, maximum and standard deviation values for duration gap and for the most adverse market value impact on the net portfolio to changes in the level of interest rates and the slope of the yield curve for the three months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
The sensitivity measures displayed in the table below, which we disclose on a quarterly basis pursuant to a disclosure commitment with FHFA, are an extension of our monthly sensitivity measures. There are three primary differences between our monthly sensitivity disclosure and the quarterly sensitivity disclosure presented below:
•the quarterly disclosure is expanded to include the sensitivity results for larger rate level shocks of positive or negative 100 basis points;
•the monthly disclosure reflects the estimated pre-tax impact on the market value of our net portfolio calculated based on a daily average, while the quarterly disclosure reflects the estimated pre-tax impact calculated based on the estimated financial position of our net portfolio and the market environment as of the last business day of the quarter; and
•the monthly disclosure shows the most adverse pre-tax impact on the market value of our net portfolio from the hypothetical interest-rate shocks, while the quarterly disclosure includes the estimated pre-tax impact of both up and down interest-rate shocks.

The market value sensitivity of our net portfolio varies across a range of interest-rate shocks depending upon the duration and convexity profile of our net portfolio. Because the effective duration gap of our net portfolio was close to zero years in the periods presented, the convexity exposure was the primary driver of the market value sensitivity of our net portfolio as of December 31, 2020. In addition, the convexity exposure may result in similar market value sensitivities for positive and negative interest-rate shocks of the same magnitude.

We use derivatives to help manage the residual interest-rate risk exposure between our assets and liabilities. Derivatives have enabled us to keep our interest-rate risk exposure at consistently low levels in a wide range of interest-rate environments. The table below displays an example of how derivatives impacted the net market value exposure for a 50 basis point parallel interest-rate shock.

Liquidity and Funding Risk Management
See “Liquidity and Capital Management” for a discussion of how we manage liquidity and funding risk.
Operational Risk Management
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people or systems, or from external events. Our corporate operational risk framework aligns with our Enterprise Risk policy, as well as the COSO Enterprise Risk Management framework, and has evolved based on the changing needs of our businesses and FHFA regulatory guidance. The Operational Risk Management group is responsible for overseeing and monitoring compliance with our operational risk program’s requirements. Operational Risk Management works in conjunction with other second line of defense teams, such as Compliance and Ethics, to oversee and aggregate the full range of operational risks, including fraud, resiliency, business interruptions, processing errors, damage to physical assets, workplace safety and employment practices. To quantify our operational risk exposure, we rely on the Basel Standardized Approach, which is based on a percentage of gross income. In addition, where appropriate, we purchase insurance policies to mitigate the impact of operational losses.
See “Risk Factors-Operational Risk” for more information regarding our operational risk and “Risk Management” for more information regarding our governance of operational risk management.
Cybersecurity Risk Management
Our operations rely on the secure receipt, processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks and with our business partners, including proprietary, confidential or personal information that is subject to privacy laws, regulations or contractual obligations. Information security risks for large institutions like us have significantly increased in recent years and from time to time we have been, and likely will continue to be, the target of attempted cyber attacks and other information security threats. These risks are an unavoidable result of being in business, and managing these risks is part of our business activities.
We have developed and continue to enhance our cybersecurity risk management program to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets against unauthorized attempts to access confidential information or to disrupt or degrade business operations. Our cybersecurity risk management program aligns to the COSO Enterprise Risk Management framework and the National Institute of Standards and Technology Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, and has evolved based on the changing needs of our business, the evolving threat environment and FHFA regulatory guidance. Our cybersecurity risk management program extends to oversight of third parties that could be a source of cybersecurity risk, including customers that use our systems and third-party service providers. We examine the effectiveness and maturity of our cyber defenses through various means, including internal audits, targeted testing, incident response exercises, maturity assessments and industry benchmarking. We continue to strengthen our partnerships with the appropriate government and law enforcement agencies and with other businesses and cybersecurity services in order to understand the full spectrum of cybersecurity risks in the environment, enhance our defenses and improve our resiliency against cybersecurity threats. We also have obtained insurance coverage relating to cybersecurity risks. To date, we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks. For a discussion of our Board of Directors’ role in overseeing the company’s cybersecurity risk management, see “Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance-Corporate Governance-Risk Management Oversight-Board's Role in Cybersecurity Risk Oversight.”
Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our software, computers, systems and information, we may not be able to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to our systems and assets, or to implement effective preventive measures against
Fannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 164
MD&A | Risk Management | Operational Risk Management
all cyber threats, especially because the techniques used are increasingly sophisticated, change frequently, are complex and are often not recognized until launched. In addition, we have discussed and worked with customers, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other third parties to develop secure transmission capabilities and protect against cyber attacks, but we do not have, and may be unable to put in place, secure capabilities with all of our clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other third parties, and we may not be able to ensure that these third parties have appropriate controls in place to prevent cyber attacks. See “Risk Factors-Operational Risk” for additional discussion of cybersecurity risks to our business.
Model Risk Management
Our internal models require numerous assumptions and there are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate macroeconomic factors such as home prices, unemployment and interest rates, and their impact on borrower behavior. When market conditions change rapidly and dramatically, the assumptions of our models may no longer accurately capture or reflect the changing conditions. Management periodically makes judgments about the appropriateness of the risk assessments indicated by the models. See “Risk Factors-Operational Risk” for a discussion of the risks associated with our use of models.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make a number of judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses in our consolidated financial statements. Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We describe our most significant accounting policies in “Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”
We evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments required by our policies on an ongoing basis and update them as necessary based on changing conditions. Management has discussed any significant changes in judgments and assumptions in applying our critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. See “Risk Factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with the need for management to make judgments and estimates in applying our accounting policies and methods. We have identified one of our accounting policies, allowance for loan losses, as critical because it involves significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters, and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our reported results of operations or financial condition.
Allowance for Loan Losses
Our allowance for loan losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of HFI loans to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans. The allowance for loan losses reflects an estimate of expected credit losses on single-family and multifamily HFI loans held by Fannie Mae and by consolidated Fannie Mae MBS trusts. We used a discounted cash flow method to measure expected credit losses on our single-family mortgage loans and an undiscounted loss method to measure expected credit losses on our multifamily mortgage loans. The models use reasonable and supportable forecasts for key economic drivers, such as home prices (single-family), rental income (multifamily) and capitalization rates (multifamily). Our modeled loan performance is based on our historical experience of loans with similar risk characteristics adjusted to reflect current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Our historical loss experience and our credit loss estimates capture the possibility of remote events that could result in credit losses on loans that are considered low risk. Our credit loss models, including the forecast data used as key inputs, are subject to our model oversight and review processes as well as other established governance and controls.
Changes to our estimate of expected credit losses, including changes due to the passage of time, are recorded through the benefit (provision) for credit losses. When calculating our allowance for loan losses, we consider only our amortized cost in the loans at the balance sheet date. We record write-offs as a reduction to the allowance for loan losses when losses are confirmed through the receipt of assets in satisfaction of a loan, such as the underlying collateral upon foreclosure or cash upon completion of a short sale. Additionally, we record write-offs as a reduction to our allowance for loan losses when a loan is determined to be uncollectible and upon the redesignation of a nonperforming and reperforming loan from HFI to HFS. We include expected recoveries of amounts previously written off and expected to be written off in determining our allowance for loan losses.
Our process for determining the measurement of expected credit losses for the period under the expected credit loss model is complex and involves significant management judgment, including a reliance on historical loss information and current economic forecasts that may not be representative of credit losses we ultimately realize. For example,
Fannie Mae 2020 Form 10-K 165
MD&A | Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
uncertainty regarding the expected impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic required significant management judgment in assessing our allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2020.
We provide more detailed information on our accounting for the allowance for loan losses in “Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” See “Note 4, Allowance for Loan Losses” for additional information about our current-period provision for loan losses, including a discussion of the estimates used in measuring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our allowance. See “Risk Factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with the need for management to make judgments and estimates in applying our accounting policies and methods.
Impact of Future Adoption of New Accounting Guidance
We identify and discuss the expected impact on our consolidated financial statements of recently issued accounting guidance in “Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”
Glossary of Terms Used in This Report
Terms used in this report have the following meanings, unless the context indicates otherwise.
“Acquired credit-impaired loans” refers to loans we have acquired for which there is evidence of credit deterioration since origination and for which it is probable we will not be able to collect all of the contractually due cash flows. We record our net investment in such loans at the lower of the acquisition cost of the loan or the estimated fair value of the loan at the date of acquisition. Typically, loans we acquire from our unconsolidated MBS trusts pursuant to our option to purchase upon default meet these criteria. Because we acquire these loans from our MBS trusts at par value plus accrued interest, to the extent the par value of a loan exceeds the estimated fair value at the time we acquire the loan, we record the related fair value loss as a charge against the “Reserve for guaranty losses.”
“Advisory Bulletin” refers to FHFA’s Advisory Bulletin AB 2012-02, “Framework for Adversely Classifying Loans, Other Real Estate Owned, and Other Assets and Listing Assets for Special Mention.”
“Agency mortgage-related securities” refers to mortgage-related securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae.
“Alt-A mortgage loan” or “Alt-A loan” generally refers to a mortgage loan originated under a lender’s program offering reduced or alternative documentation than that required for a full documentation mortgage loan but may also include other alternative product features. As a result, Alt-A mortgage loans have a higher risk of default than non-Alt-A mortgage loans. We classify certain loans as Alt-A so that we can discuss our exposure to Alt-A loans in this report and elsewhere. However, there is no universally accepted definition of Alt-A loans. In reporting our Alt-A exposure, we have classified mortgage loans as Alt-A if and only if the lenders that delivered the mortgage loans to us classified the loans as Alt-A, based on documentation or other product features. We have loans with some features that are similar to Alt-A mortgage loans that we have not classified as Alt-A because they do not meet our classification criteria. We do not rely solely on our classifications of loans as Alt-A to evaluate the credit risk exposure relating to these loans in our single-family conventional guaranty book of business. For more information about the credit risk characteristics of loans in our single-family guaranty book of business, see “Single-Family Business-Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management,” “Note 3, Mortgage Loans.” We have classified private-label mortgage-related securities held in our retained mortgage portfolio as Alt-A if the securities were labeled as such when issued.
“Amortization income” refers to income resulting from the amortization of cost basis adjustments, including premiums and discounts on mortgage loans and securities, as a yield adjustment over the contractual life of the loan or security. These basis adjustments often result from upfront fees that we receive at the time of loan acquisition primarily related to single-family loan-level pricing adjustments or other fees we receive from lenders, which are amortized over the contractual life of the loan.
“Business volume” refers to the sum in any given period of the unpaid principal balance of: (1) the mortgage loans and mortgage-related securities we purchase for our retained mortgage portfolio; (2) the mortgage loans we securitize into Fannie Mae MBS that are acquired by third parties; and (3) credit enhancements that we provide on our mortgage assets. It excludes mortgage loans we securitize from our portfolio and the purchase of Fannie Mae MBS for our retained mortgage portfolio.
“CECL standard” refers to Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments and related amendments.
“Connecticut Avenue Securities” or “CAS” refers to a type of security that allows Fannie Mae to transfer a portion of the credit risk from loan reference pools, consisting of certain mortgage loans in our guaranty book of business, to third-party investors.

“Connecticut Avenue Securities REMICs” or “CAS REMICs” refers to Connecticut Avenue Securities that are structured as notes issued by trusts that qualify as REMICs.
“Conventional mortgage” refers to a mortgage loan that is not guaranteed or insured by the U.S. government or its agencies, such as the VA, the FHA or the Rural Development Housing and Community Facilities Program of the Department of Agriculture.
“Credit enhancement” refers to an agreement used to reduce credit risk by requiring collateral, letters of credit, mortgage insurance, corporate guarantees, inclusion in a credit risk transfer transaction reference pool, or other agreements to provide an entity with some assurance that it will be compensated to some degree in the event of a financial loss.
“FHFA” refers to the Federal Housing Finance Agency. FHFA is an independent agency of the federal government with general supervisory and regulatory authority over Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks. FHFA is our safety and soundness regulator and our mission regulator. FHFA also has been acting as our conservator since September 6, 2008. For more information on FHFA’s authority as our conservator and as our regulator, see “Business-Conservatorship, Treasury Agreements and Housing Finance Reform” and “Business-Legislation and Regulation-GSE Act and Other Legislative and Regulatory Matters.”
“GSE Act” refers to the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992, as amended, including by the Federal Housing Finance Regulatory Reform Act of 2008. We are subject to regulation applicable to us pursuant to the GSE Act, as described in “Business-Legislation and Regulation.”
“Guaranty book of business” refers to the sum of the unpaid principal balance of: (1) Fannie Mae MBS outstanding (excluding the portions of any structured securities Fannie Mae issues that are backed by Freddie Mac securities); (2) mortgage loans of Fannie Mae held in our retained mortgage portfolio; and (3) other credit enhancements that we provide on mortgage assets. It also excludes non-Fannie Mae mortgage-related securities held in our retained mortgage portfolio for which we do not provide a guaranty.
“HFI loans” or “held-for-investment loans” refer to mortgage loans we acquire for which we have the ability and intent to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity.
“HFS loans” or “held-for-sale loans” refer to mortgage loans we acquire that we intend to sell or securitize via trusts that will not be consolidated.
“Loans,” “mortgage loans” and “mortgages” refer to both whole loans and loan participations, secured by residential real estate, cooperative shares or by manufactured housing units.
“Loss reserves” consists of our allowance for loan losses and our reserve for guaranty losses. Through December 31, 2019, loss reserves reflect our estimate of the probable losses we have incurred in our guaranty book of business, including concessions we granted borrowers upon modification of their loans. Since our adoption of the CECL standard on January 1, 2020, our loss reserves reflect our estimate of lifetime expected credit losses rather than solely incurred losses.
“Mortgage assets,” when referring to our assets, refers to both mortgage loans and mortgage-related securities we hold in our retained mortgage portfolio. For purposes of the senior preferred stock purchase agreement, the definition of mortgage assets is based on the unpaid principal balance of such assets and does not reflect market valuation adjustments, allowance for loan losses, impairments, unamortized premiums and discounts and the impact of our consolidation of variable interest entities. Our mortgage asset calculation also includes 10% of the notional value of interest-only securities we hold. We disclose the amount of our mortgage assets for purposes of the senior preferred stock purchase agreement on a monthly basis in the “Endnotes” to our Monthly Summaries, which are available on our website and announced in a press release.
“Mortgage-backed securities” or “MBS” refers generally to securities that represent beneficial interests in pools of mortgage loans or other mortgage-related securities. These securities may be issued by Fannie Mae or by others.
“Multifamily Connecticut Avenue Securities” or “MCAS” refers to Connecticut Avenue Securities that are structured as notes issued by trusts to transfer credit risk on our multifamily guaranty book of business to third-party investors.
“Multifamily mortgage loan” refers to a mortgage loan secured by a property containing five or more residential dwelling units.

“Notional amount” refers to the hypothetical dollar amount in an interest rate swap transaction on which exchanged payments are based. The notional amount in an interest rate swap transaction generally is not paid or received by either party to the transaction, or generally perceived as being at risk. The notional amount is typically significantly greater than the potential market or credit loss that could result from such transaction.
“Outstanding Fannie Mae MBS” refers to the total unpaid principal balance of any type of mortgage-backed security that we issue, including UMBS, Supers, REMICs and other types of single-family or multifamily mortgage-backed securities that are held by third-party investors or in our retained mortgage portfolio. For securities held by third-party investors, it excludes the portions of any structured securities Fannie Mae issues that are backed by Freddie Mac-issued securities.
“Private-label securities” refers to mortgage-related securities issued by entities other than agency issuers Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae.
“Refi Plus loans” refers to loans we acquired under our Refi Plus initiative, which offered refinancing flexibility to eligible Fannie Mae borrowers who were current on their loans and who applied prior to the initiative’s December 31, 2018 sunset date. Refi Plus had no limits on maximum LTV ratio and provided mortgage insurance flexibilities for loans with LTV ratios greater than 80%.
“REMIC” or “Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit” refers to a type of mortgage-related security in which interest and principal payments from mortgages or mortgage-related securities are structured into separately traded securities.
“REO” refers to real-estate owned by Fannie Mae because we have foreclosed on the property or obtained the property through a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure.
“Representations and warranties” refers to a lender’s assurance that a mortgage loan sold to us complies with the standards outlined in our Mortgage Selling and Servicing Contract, which incorporates the Selling and Servicing Guides, including underwriting and documentation. Violation of any representation or warranty is a breach of the lender contract, including the warranty that the loan complies with all applicable requirements of the contract, which provides us with certain rights and remedies.
“Retained mortgage portfolio” refers to the mortgage-related assets we own (excluding the portion of assets that back mortgage-related securities owned by third parties).
“Single-family mortgage loan” refers to a mortgage loan secured by a property containing four or fewer residential dwelling units.
“Structured Fannie Mae MBS” refers to Fannie Mae securitizations that are resecuritizations of UMBS or previously-issued structured securities. As described in “Business-Mortgage Securitizations-Uniform Mortgage-Backed Securities, or UMBS,” structured securities can be commingled-that is, they can include both Fannie Mae securities and Freddie Mac securities as the underlying collateral for the security.
“Subprime private-label securities” generally refers to private-label mortgage-related securities held in our retained mortgage portfolio that were labeled as subprime when issued.
“TCCA fees” refers to the expense recognized as a result of the 10 basis point increase in guaranty fees on all single-family residential mortgages delivered to us on or after April 1, 2012 pursuant to the Temporary Payroll Tax Cut Continuation Act of 2011, which we remit to Treasury on a quarterly basis.
“TDR” or “troubled debt restructuring” refers to a modification to the contractual terms of a loan that results in granting a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties.
“Uniform Mortgage-Backed Securities” or “UMBS” refers to the securities each of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac issues and guarantees that are directly backed by mortgage loans it has acquired as described in “Business-Mortgage Securitizations-Uniform Mortgage-Backed Securities, or UMBS.”
