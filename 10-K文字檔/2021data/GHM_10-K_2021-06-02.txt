Item 7.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Amounts in thousands, except per share data)
Overview
We are a global business that designs, manufactures and sells critical equipment for the energy, defense and chemical/petrochemical industries. Our energy markets include oil refining, cogeneration, and alternative power. For the defense industry, our equipment is used in nuclear propulsion power systems for the U.S. Navy. For the chemical and petrochemical industries, our equipment is used in fertilizer, ethylene, methanol and downstream chemical facilities.
Graham's global brand is built upon our world-renowned engineering expertise in vacuum and heat transfer technology, responsive and flexible service and high quality standards. We design and manufacture custom-engineered ejectors, vacuum pumping systems, surface condensers and vacuum systems. Our equipment can also be found in other diverse applications such as metal refining, pulp and paper processing, water heating, refrigeration, desalination, food processing, pharmaceutical, and heating, ventilating and air conditioning.
Our corporate headquarters are located in Batavia, New York. We have production facilities co-located with our headquarters in Batavia. We also have wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries, Graham Vacuum and Heat Transfer Technology (Suzhou) Co., Ltd. ("GVHTT"), located in Suzhou, China and Graham India Private Limited ("GIPL"), located in Ahmedabad, India. GVHTT provides sales and engineering support for us in the People's Republic of China and management oversight throughout Southeast Asia. GIPL serves as a sales and market development office focusing on the refining, petrochemical and fertilizer markets.
On June 1, 2021, we entered into a stock purchase agreement to acquire Barber-Nichols, Inc. ("BNI"), a privately-owned designer and manufacturer of turbomachinery products for the aerospace, cryogenic, defense and energy markets, located in Arvada, Colorado. We believe that this acquisition will further our growth strategy through market and product diversification, broaden our offerings to the defense and energy markets and strengthen our presence in the defense sector.
This management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 omits a comparative discussion regarding the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. Such information is located in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020.

Current Market Conditions
The ongoing slowdown in our energy and petrochemical markets (which we refer to as our "commercial markets") began during the latter part of fiscal 2020 and was caused primarily by an excess supply of crude oil, which had a negative impact on commodity pricing. This caused more measured investment in maintenance and capital projects within our commercial markets. The economic slowdown and corresponding reductions in demand for transportation fuel and petrochemical products caused by the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic further adversely affected our commercial markets. As a result of these combined adverse supply-side and demand-side disruptions, our commercial customers have significantly reduced their operating budgets for the types of products and services we provide. The timing and catalyst for a recovery in our commercial markets remains uncertain. Accordingly, we believe that in the near term the quantity of projects available for us to compete for will be fewer and that the pricing environment will remain challenging.
We believe chemical and petrochemical capital investment will continue to decouple from energy investment. Over the long term, we expect that population growth, an expanding global middle class and an increasing desire for improved quality of life and access to consumer products will drive increased demand for industrial goods within the plastics and resins value chain along with fertilizers or related products. Consequently, when global economies return to stable growth, we expect investment in new global chemical and petrochemical capacity will resume and that such investments will drive growth in demand for our products and services.
Energy markets, in particular crude oil refining, simultaneous with the above-described slowdown, are undergoing a more fundamental evolution. We believe that systemic changes in the energy markets are occurring and that such changes are being driven, in part, by the increasing use by consumers of alternative fuels in lieu of fossil fuels. As a result, we anticipate demand growth for fossil-based fuels will be less than the global GDP growth rate. Accordingly, we expect that crude oil refiners will focus new investments toward the installed base, and that inefficient refineries will close and new refining capacity will be co-located where fuels and petrochemicals are produced. We also anticipate that future investment by refiners in renewable fuels (e.g., renewable diesel), in existing refineries (e.g., to expand feedstock processing flexibility and to improve conversion of oil to refined products), to gain greater throughput, or to build new capacity (e.g., integrated refineries with petrochemical products capabilities) will continue to drive demand for our products and services.
Demand for our products in the defense industry is related to the naval nuclear propulsion market which is tied to aircraft carrier and submarine vessel construction schedules of the primary shipyards contracted by the U.S. Navy. We expect growth in our naval nuclear propulsion business will result from our strategic actions to increase our market share, our successful performance, and expected demand increases. The economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has not adversely affected demand for our products or services in the defense market.
The chart below shows the impact of our successful diversification strategy into multiple U.S. Navy defense platforms. Our U.S. Navy defense business began with our entry into the nuclear carrier program. We subsequently expanded into both the Virginia and Columbia class nuclear submarine programs. The defense market made up 76% of our total backlog at March 31, 2021. Each vessel platform has made up at least 10% of our total backlog for the past three years. We believe this diversification is especially beneficial when our commercial markets are weak, as is presently the case.
Results of Operations
For an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods indicated:
(1)
Selling, general and administrative expense is referred to as "SG&A."
Fiscal 2021 Compared with Fiscal 2020
Sales for fiscal 2021 were $97,489, up 8% as compared with sales of $90,604 for fiscal 2021. Domestic sales were $52,724 or 54% of total sales, down from $58,042 or 64% of total sales in fiscal 2020. Domestic sales decreased $5,318, or 9%, compared with fiscal year 2020. International sales accounted for $44,765, or 46% of total sales, for fiscal 2021, up from $32,562 or 36% of total sales in fiscal 2020. International sales increased $12,203, or 37% compared with fiscal 2020. By market, sales for fiscal 2021 were 41% to the refining industry (up from 37% in fiscal 2020), 24% to the chemical and petrochemical industries (down from 34% in fiscal 2020), 25% from the defense industry (U.S. Navy) (up from 16% in fiscal 2020), and 10% to other commercial and industrial markets (down from 13% in fiscal 2020).
The COVID-19 pandemic impacted our financial results in fiscal 2021. We estimated that revenue was adversely impacted by COVID-19 by approximately $5,500. This included the benefit of approximately $5,000 which moved into fiscal 2021 from fiscal 2020 related to a project fabricated in China which was delayed in late fiscal 2020. Across fiscal 2021, especially in the first quarter, we had production capacity impacted at our Batavia, New York facility. In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we limited production at our production facility in Batavia, New York and averaged approximately 50% of capacity during that quarter. We had additional impacts across all quarters, although not to the extent we saw in the first quarter. We are committed to diligently protecting our workforce while endeavoring to minimize any unfavorable impact to our business and our customers.
Our gross margin for fiscal 2021 was 21.0% compared with 20.0% for fiscal 2020. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to lower production costs. Gross profit for fiscal 2021 increased $2,321, or 13%, compared with fiscal 2020 on higher volume and higher gross margin as noted above, compared with fiscal 2020.
SG&A expense for fiscal 2021 was $17,471, up 4%, or $592, compared with $16,879 in fiscal 2020. SG&A as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2021 was 17.9% of sales compared with 18.6% of sales in fiscal 2020. SG&A increases were primarily due to increased variable compensation and outside sales agent commissions, partly offset by lower selling overhead expenses and internal sales agent commission costs.
Interest income for fiscal 2021 was $167, down from $1,324 in fiscal 2020. Interest expense in fiscal 2021 was $11 compared with $12 in fiscal 2020.
Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2021 was 27% compared with 19% in fiscal 2020. The increase in tax rate was primarily due to the mix of earnings by geography, which were in higher tax cost areas as compared with the prior year.
Net income and income per diluted share for fiscal 2021, were $2,374 and $0.24, respectively, compared with net income and income per diluted share of $1,872 and $0.19, respectively, for fiscal 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated statements of cash flows and consolidated balance sheets appearing in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K:
(1) Working capital equals current assets minus current liabilities.
(2) Working capital ratio equals current assets divided by current liabilities.
We use the above ratios to assess our liquidity and overall financial strength.
Net cash used by operating activities for fiscal 2021 was $1,722, compared with cash generated of $1,239 for fiscal 2020. The $2,961 decrease in cash generated was due to a large cash usage from customer deposits. These were partly offset by cash generations for inventory and accrued compensation.
Capital spending in fiscal 2021 was $2,158, compared with $2,417 in fiscal 2020. Capital expenditures in each of fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 were approximately 80% for facilities along with machinery and equipment and the remaining 20% for all other items.
Dividend payments were $4,391 in fiscal 2021, compared with $4,250 in fiscal 2020.
Cash and investments were $65,032 at March 31, 2021, compared with $73,003 at March 31, 2020, down $7,971 or 11%.
We invest net cash generated from operations in excess of cash held for near-term needs in short-term, less than 365 days, certificates of deposit, money market accounts or U.S. government instruments, generally with maturity periods of up to 180 days. Our certificates of deposit are used to securitize our outstanding letters of credit, which reduces our cost on those letters of credit. Approximately 90% of our cash and investments are held in the U.S. The remaining 10% is invested in our China operations.
Capital expenditures for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022, which we refer to as "fiscal 2022," are expected to be between approximately $2,800 and $3,000. Approximately 90% of our fiscal 2022 capital expenditures are expected to be for machinery and equipment, with the remaining amounts expected to be used for other items.
Our revolving credit facility with JP Morgan Chase, N.A. ("JP Morgan Chase") provides us with a line of credit of $22,000, which includes a separate line of $7,000 for letters of credit and bank guarantees. In addition, our JP Morgan Chase agreement allows us to increase the line of credit, at our discretion, up to another $15,000, for total availability of $37,000. Borrowings under this credit facility are secured by all of our assets. We also had a $15,000 letter of credit facility with HSBC, N.A. ("HSBC") at March 31, 2021 secured by certain of our deposit accounts with HSBC. Letters of credit outstanding on March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020 were $11,567 and $13,328, respectively. The outstanding letters of credit as of March 31, 2021 were issued by JP Morgan Chase and HSBC. There were no other amounts outstanding on our credit facilities at March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020. The borrowing rate under our JP Morgan Chase facility as of March 31, 2021 was the bank’s prime rate, or 3.25%. Availability under the JP Morgan Chase and HSBC lines of credit was $25,433 and $21,672 at March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020, respectively.
We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, other than letters of credit incurred in the ordinary course of business.
We believe that cash generated from operations, combined with the liquidity provided by our investments and available financing capacity under our credit facility, will be adequate both to meet our cash needs for the immediate future and to support our growth strategies.
Stockholders' Equity
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated statements of changes in stockholders' equity that can be found in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following table shows the balance of stockholders' equity on the dates indicated:
March 31, 2021
March 31, 2020
$
97,929
$
96,724
Fiscal 2021 Compared with Fiscal 2020
Stockholders' equity increased $1,205 or 1%, at March 31, 2021 compared with March 31, 2020.
On March 31, 2021, our net book value per share was $9.83, up from $9.79 at March 31, 2020.
Contractual Obligations
As of March 31, 2021, our contractual and commercial obligations for the next five fiscal years ending March 31 and thereafter were as follows:
(1)
For additional information, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
(2) Amounts represent anticipated contributions during fiscal 2022 to our postretirement medical benefit plan, which provides healthcare benefits for eligible retirees and eligible survivors of retirees. On February 4, 2003, we terminated postretirement healthcare benefits for our U.S. employees. Benefits payable to retirees of record on April 1, 2003 remained unchanged. We expect to be required to make cash contributions in connection with these plans beyond one year, but such amounts cannot be estimated. No contributions are expected to be made to our defined benefit pension plans for fiscal 2022.
Orders and Backlog
Management uses orders and backlog as measures of our current and future business and financial performance. Orders in fiscal 2021 increased 52% to $121,619 from $80,034 in fiscal 2020. Orders represent communications received from customers requesting us to supply products and services. Revenue is recognized on orders received in accordance with our revenue recognition policy described in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Domestic orders were 73%, or $89,283, and international orders were 27%, or $32,336, of our total orders in fiscal 2021. This compared with domestic orders of $43,045, or 54% of total orders, and international orders of $36,989, or 46% of our total orders in fiscal 2020. Domestic orders increased by $46,238, or 107%. This increase was due to a large increase in defense (U.S. Navy) orders, partly offset by lower domestic commercial orders. Net international orders decreased by $4,653, or 13% in fiscal 2021.
Backlog was $137,567 at March 31, 2021, up 22% compared with $112,389 at March 31, 2020. Backlog is defined by us as the total dollar value of orders received for which revenue has not yet been recognized. All orders in backlog represent orders from our traditional markets in established product lines. We had no projects cancelled in fiscal 2021. Approximately 40% to 45% of orders currently in our backlog are expected to be converted to sales within one year. At March 31, 2021, approximately 16% of our backlog was attributed to equipment for refinery project work, 6% for chemical and petrochemical projects, 76% for U.S. Navy projects and 2% for other industrial or commercial applications. At March 31, 2020, approximately 27% of our backlog was attributed to equipment for refinery project work, 17% for chemical and petrochemical projects, 52% for U.S. Navy projects and 4% for other commercial nuclear energy, other industrial or commercial applications. At March 31, 2021, we had no projects on hold. At March 31, 2020, we had two projects totaling $562 on hold.
Recent Developments
On June 1, 2021, we acquired Barber-Nichols, Inc. ("BNI"), a privately-owned designer and manufacturer of turbomachinery products for the aerospace, cryogenic, defense and energy markets and is located in Arvada, Colorado. We believe that this acquisition furthers our growth strategy through market and product diversification, broadens its offerings to the defense and energy markets and strengthens its presence in the defense sector.
Under the terms of the stock purchase agreement, the purchase price of $70,113 is comprised of 610 shares of our common stock, representing a value of approximately $8,963, and cash consideration of $61,150, subject to certain potential adjustments, including a customary working capital adjustment. The stock purchase agreement also includes a contingent earn-out dependent upon certain financial measures of BNI post-acquisition, in which the sellers are eligible to receive up to $14,000 in additional cash consideration.
On June 1, 2021, we entered into a $20,000 five-year term loan with Bank of America. The term loan requires monthly principal payments of $167 through June 1, 2026, with the remaining principal amount due on the maturity date. The interest rate on the term loan is the applicable Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index ("BSBY") plus 1.50%, subject to a 0.00% floor. In addition, on June 1, 2021, we entered into a revolving credit facility with Bank of America that provides a $30,000 line of credit, including letters of credit and bank guarantees, expandable at our option and the bank’s approval at any time up to $40,000. The agreement has a five-year term. Amounts outstanding under the facility agreement will bear interest at a rate equal to BSBY plus 1.50%, subject to a 0.00% floor. Outstanding letters of credit under the agreement are subject to a fee of 1.50%. The upfront fee for each of the term loan and revolving credit facility is .20% of the committed facilities and amounts available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility are subject to an unused commitment fee of .25% Under the term loan agreement and revolving credit facility, we covenant to maintain a maximum total leverage ratio, as defined in such agreements, of 3.0 to 1.0, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, as defined in such agreements, of 1.20 to 1.0 and minimum margined assets, as defined in such agreements, of 100% of total amounts outstanding on the revolving credit facility, including letters of credit.
On June, 1, 2021, we entered into an agreement to amend the letter of credit facility agreement with HSBC Bank USA, N.A. and decreased our line of credit from $15,000 to $7,500. Under the amended agreement, we incur an annual facility fee of $5 and outstanding letters of credit are subject to a fee of between .75% and .85%, depending on the term of the letter of credit. Interest is payable on the principal amounts of unreimbursed letter of credit draws under the facility at a rate of 3% plus the bank’s prime rate.
Outlook
Capital spending in the commercial markets we serve began to decrease during the second half of fiscal 2020 and the pace of activity further materially contracted as COVID-19 became a global pandemic in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Our weak commercial markets continued into fiscal 2021 and we are not seeing a recovery as we enter fiscal 2022. This is particularly evident in North America. As a result, our overall bidding activity has slowed. There has also been a shift toward more opportunities in emerging markets. Our strong order level from the defense industry (U.S. Navy) increased our backlog for defense projects to $104,127 on March 31, 2021 from $58,843 on March 31, 2020. At March 31, 2021, 76% of our backlog was for the defense industry, specifically the U.S. Navy. Defense programs in backlog are planned to deliver $25,000 to $30,000 of revenue in fiscal 2022. The sales to the defense industry were $23,939 in fiscal 2021. We expect that our successful acquisition of BNI will increase and diversify our market presence, including enhancing our concentration on the defense markets, and will be accretive to our financial results in fiscal 2022.
Near term opportunities in the global energy and petrochemical markets have slowed significantly due to the combined impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the geopolitical imbalance of supply, as previously discussed. Although we do not know when the COVID-19 pandemic will end or when the supply imbalance will subside, we continue to believe the energy markets will improve. In addition, we believe the petrochemical markets provide long-term growth opportunities for our products and services. Coupled with our diversification strategy into the defense industry, we remain confident in our ability to achieve the long-term goal of significantly growing our business. We have invested in capacity to serve our customers in our commercial markets as well as to expand the work we do for the U.S. Navy, including through our acquisition of BNI. We intend to continue to look for organic growth opportunities as well as acquisitions or other business combinations that we believe will allow us to expand our presence in both our existing and ancillary markets.
Our expectations for sales and profitability assume that we are able to operate our production facility in Batavia, New York at or near normal ("pre-COVID-19") capacity throughout fiscal 2022. We project that approximately 40% to 45% of our $137,567 March 31, 2021 backlog will convert to sales in fiscal 2022. We expect the remaining backlog will convert beyond fiscal 2022, which includes a combination of U.S. Navy orders that have a long conversion cycle (up to five years) as well as certain commercial orders, the conversion of which has been extended by our customers. We had no projects cancelled in fiscal 2021. At March 31, 2021, we had no projects put on hold by our customers.
Revenue in fiscal 2022 is expected to be $130,000 to $140,000, inclusive of BNI’s revenue for the ten-month period which is expected to be $45,000 to $48,000. Adjusted earnings before net interest income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization for the combined business is expected to be approximately $7,000 to $9,000.
Contingencies and Commitments
We have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos allegedly contained in, or accompanying, our products. We are a co-defendant with numerous other defendants in these lawsuits and intend to vigorously defend ourselves against these claims. The claims are similar to previous asbestos lawsuits that named us as a defendant. Such previous lawsuits either were dismissed when it was shown that we had not supplied products to the plaintiffs’ places of work or were settled by us for immaterial amounts. We cannot provide any assurances that any pending or future matters will be resolved in the same manner as previous lawsuits.
As of March 31, 2021, we are subject to the claims noted above, as well as other legal proceedings and potential claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. Although the outcome of the lawsuits to which we are, or may become, a party to cannot be determined and an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be made for the majority of claims, we do not believe that the outcomes, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Critical Accounting Policies
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.
Critical accounting policies are defined as those that reflect significant judgments and uncertainties and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions.
Revenue Recognition. The Company accounts for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification 606, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" ("ASC 606").
We recognize revenue on all contracts when control of the product is transferred to the customer. Control is generally transferred when products are shipped, title is transferred, significant risks of ownership have transferred, we have rights to payment, and rewards of ownership pass to the customer. Customer acceptance may also be a factor in determining whether control of the product has transferred. Although revenue on the majority of our contracts, as measured by number of contracts, is recognized upon shipment to the customer, revenue on larger contracts, which are fewer in number but generally represent the majority of revenue, is recognized over time as these contracts meet specific criteria in ASC 606. Revenue from contracts that is recognized upon shipment accounted for approximately 40% of revenue in fiscal 2021. Revenue from contracts that is recognized over time accounted for approximately 60% of revenue in fiscal 2021. We recognize revenue over time when contract performance results in the creation of a product for which we do not have an alternative use and the contract includes an enforceable right to payment in an amount that corresponds directly with the value of the performance completed. To measure progress towards completion on performance obligations for which revenue is recognized over time we utilize an input method based upon a ratio of direct labor hours incurred to date to management’s estimate of the total labor hours to be incurred on each contract or an output method based upon completion of operational milestones, depending upon the nature of the contract.
Pension and Postretirement Benefits. Defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts. These assumptions are reviewed annually and include the discount rate, long-term expected rate of return on plan assets, salary growth, healthcare cost trend rate and other economic and demographic factors. We base the discount rate assumption for our plans on the FTSE Pension Liability Above-Median AA-Index. The long-term expected rate of return on plan assets is based on the plan’s asset allocation, historical returns and expectations as to future returns that are expected to be realized over the estimated remaining life of the plan liabilities that will be funded with the plan assets. The salary growth assumptions are determined based on long-term actual experience and future and near-term outlook. The healthcare cost trend rate assumptions are based on historical cost and payment data, the near-term outlook, and an assessment of likely long-term trends.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments
We have evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and believe those policies to be reasonable and appropriate.
We believe that the most critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements relate to labor hour estimates and establishment of operational milestones which are used to recognize revenue over time, accounting for contingencies, under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated, and accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits.
As discussed above under the heading "Critical Accounting Policies," we recognize a majority of our revenue using an over-time recognition method. The key estimate for the over-time recognition model is total labor to be incurred on each contract and to the extent that this estimate changes, it may significantly impact revenue recognized in each period.
Contingencies, by their nature, relate to uncertainties that require us to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss. For more information on these matters, see the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works. To accomplish this, extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation, investment returns, mortality, turnover, medical costs and discount rates. These assumptions are reviewed annually.
The discount rate used in accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits expense (income) is determined in conjunction with our actuary by reference to a current yield curve and by considering the timing and amount of projected future benefit payments. The discount rate assumption for fiscal 2021 was 3.44% for our defined benefit pension plans and 3.01% for our other postretirement benefit plan. A reduction in the discount rate of 50 basis points, with all other assumptions held constant, would have increased fiscal 2021 net periodic benefit expense for our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plan by approximately $352 and $0, respectively.
The expected return on plan assets assumption of 6.5% used in accounting for our pension plan is determined by evaluating the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and external forecasts of future long-term investment returns. A reduction in the rate of return of 50 basis points, with other assumptions held constant, would have increased fiscal 2021 net periodic pension expense by approximately $193.
During fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, the pension plan released liabilities for vested benefits of certain participants through the purchase of nonparticipating annuity contracts with a third-party insurance company. As a result of these transactions, in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, the projected benefit obligation and plan assets each decreased $1,477 and $1,420, respectively.
As part of our ongoing financial reporting process, a collaborative effort is undertaken involving our managers with functional responsibilities for financial, credit, tax, engineering, manufacturing and benefit matters, and outside advisors such as lawyers, consultants and actuaries. We believe that the results of this effort provide management with the necessary information on which to base their judgments and to develop the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the financial statements.
We believe that the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K related to revenue, contingencies, pensions, other postretirement benefits and other matters requiring the use of estimates and judgments are reasonable, although actual outcomes could differ materially from our estimates.
New Accounting Pronouncements
In the normal course of business, management evaluates all new accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC, the Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants or any other authoritative accounting body to determine the potential impact they may have on our consolidated financial statements. For discussion of the newly issued accounting pronouncements see ''Accounting and reporting changes'' in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
