ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion on the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020. This means that our auditors believe there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have generated little revenue although revenue is anticipated to grow as we have completed the development of our website, sourced out suppliers for products to sell and sourced out customers to buy our products. Accordingly, we must raise cash from sources other than operations. Our only other source for cash at this time is investments by others in our company and the revenue we generate from the sales of our products. We must raise cash to continue our project and build our operations.
Plan of Operation - Milestones
We are at an early stage of our new business operations. Over the next twelve months, our primary target milestones include:
Continue to achieve substantial growth within our Minecraft division. This is a profitable center for us and we expect the continued growth of our existing server, good-gaming.com as well.
Continue to evaluate opportunities which have synergies to our existing business line.
Anticipate sustainable financial profitability in 2021.
Limited operating history and need for additional capital
There is limited historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance relating to our new business direction. We have generated little revenue. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products.
Results of Operations
December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019
● Working Capital
● Operating Revenues
We have generated $26,215 in revenue in 2020 and $49,519 in revenue in the fiscal year of 2019, which reflects a decrease of $23,304 or 47%. The decrease in revenue was attributed to the issues the Company had with the servers when they launched the new version of the game modes.
● Operating Expenses and Net Loss
Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $417,704 compared with $905,442 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in operating expenses in the amount of $487,738 or 53.8% was attributable to decrease in professional fees for day to day operations and the complete amortization of the assets purchased during the acquisition of Good Gaming, Inc. in 2020.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a net loss of $965,885 compared with a net loss of $1,130,769 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in net loss in the amount of $164,884 or 14.6% was attributed to the decrease in revenues and the change in value of the Company’s derivative liabilities.
● Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s cash balance consisted of $2,305 compared to cash balance of $2,022 as of December 31, 2019. The increase in the cash balance was attributed to the financing that we received for day-to-day activities. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $16,305 in assets compared to total assets of $15,952 as at December 31, 2019. The increase in assets was attributable to the purchase of a new asset offset by the complete amortization of assets acquired during the acquisition of Good Gaming, Inc.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had total liabilities of $3,645,590 compared with total liabilities of $2,762,373 as of December 31, 2019. The increase in liabilities was attributable to increase in financing and in derivative liabilities.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company has a working capital deficit of $3,635,160 compared with a working capital deficit of $2,751,601 as of December 31, 2019 with the increase in the working capital deficit attributed to an increase in financing the Company received for general working capital purposes.
Cash flow from Operating Activities

The decrease of $30,160 or 6.9% was attributed to the net decrease in derivative liabilities.
Cash flow from Investing Activities
During the years ended December 31, 2020, the Company had $5,335 in cash used in investing activities compared to $478 in cash provided for the year ended December 31, 2019.

The decrease of $13,637 or 3.2% in proceeds from financing activities was due to the decrease in financing that we received for day-to-day activities.
Going Concern
We have not attained profitable operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to pursue any extensive acquisitions and activities. For these reasons, our auditors stated in their report on our audited financial statements that they have substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the issuance of these financial statements without further financing.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2020, we have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.
Future Financings
We will continue to rely on equity sales of our preferred shares in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuance of additional shares will result in dilution to existing stockholders.
There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of the equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our operations and other activities.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements. Management’s estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
We have implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and we do not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.
