MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis includes certain forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. You should review the Risk Factors section of this Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by such forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking Information” at the beginning of this Form 10-K.
All warrants, option, share and per share information in this report gives retroactive effect to a one-for-forty reverse stock split that was effective on November 1, 2019.
Introduction
We develop and market DNA-based technology solutions utilizing our LinearDNATM large-scale PCR based manufacturing platform. Our proprietary platform produces large quantities of DNA for use in the nucleic acid-based in vitro diagnostics and preclinical nucleic-acid based drug development and manufacturing markets (“Biotherapeutic Contract Research and Manufacturing”) and for supply chain security, anti-counterfeiting and anti-theft technology purposes (“Non-Biologic Tagging”). In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed a PCR-based molecular diagnostic test for COVID-19, which was granted EUA by the FDA in May 2020. We currently manufacture and sell our EUA authorized COVID-19 molecular diagnostic test kit under the LineaTM COVID-19 Assay Kit trademark (“COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Kit”). In addition, and in further response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed and are currently offering, COVID-19 testing services under ADCL. ADCL holds a New York CLIA certification for COVID-19 testing using EUA authorized methods and devices (“Clinical Testing Laboratory”). ADCL’s high throughput pooled testing program, known as safeCircle™, utilizes frequent, high-sensitivity pooled testing to help prevent virus spread by quickly identifying infections within a community, school, or workplace. safeCircle provides rapid results using real-time PCR (RT-PCR) testing. Unlike diagnostic testing, which looks for the occurrence of COVID-19 at the individual level, pooled testing looks for infections within a defined population or community and can be used for making health management decisions at the population level. We also are developing an iCTC Technology which uses a patented functional assay to capture live invasive circulating tumor cell and associated lymphocytes that can be identified and expanded for further analysis, including genetic sequencing.
Applied DNA’s LinearDNATM PCR platform is capable of producing large scale DNA, which we believe offers many benefits over the limitations of other large-scale DNA manufacturing systems, including:
• Speed - Production of DNA via the LinearDNATM platform can be measured in terms of hours, not days and weeks like other large-scale DNA manufacturing platforms.
• Scale - The LinearDNATM platform is flexible and can be adapted to encompass large quantity production.
• Purity - DNA produced via PCR is pure, resulting in only large quantities of the target DNA sequence. Unwanted DNA sequences such as bacterially derived DNA are not present.
• Customization - DNA produced via PCR can be easily chemically modified to suit specific customer applications.
General
Historically, the substantial portion of our revenues has been generated from sales of our SigNature® and SigNature® T molecular tags, our principal supply chain security and product authentication solutions. However, most of our near-term growth in revenues has been derived from sales of our Linea™ COVID-19 Assay Kit, our validated COVID-19 pooled testing under review by NYSDOH, and our COVID-19 Surveillance Testing. We also expect future growth in revenues to be derived from the manufacturing of DNA products for the biotechnology and in vitro diagnostic markets. To a lesser extent, we expect to grow revenues from the sale of SigNature® molecular tags, SigNature® T molecular tags, SigNify® and CertainT® offerings as we work with companies and governments to secure supply chains for various types of products and product labeling throughout the world, although we have seen a decrease in such revenues principally due to the impact of COVID-19. We are also seeking to establish a revenue stream from our iCTC Technology. We have continued to incur expenses in expanding our business to meet current and anticipated future demand. We have limited sources of liquidity.
Critical Accounting Policies
Financial Reporting Release No. 60, published by the SEC, recommends that all companies include a discussion of critical accounting policies used in the preparation of their financial statements. While all these significant accounting policies impact our financial condition and results of operations, we view certain of these policies as critical. Policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
We believe that given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would cause a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report.
The accounting policies identified as critical are as follows:
·
Revenue recognition; and
·
Equity based compensation.
Revenue Recognition
We follow Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued accounting standard updates which clarify the principles for recognizing revenue arising from contracts with customers (“ASC 606” or “Topic 606”).
The Company measures revenue at the amounts that reflect the consideration to which it is expected to be entitled in exchange for transferring control of goods and services to customers. The Company recognizes revenue either at the point in time or over the period of time that performance obligations to customers are satisfied. The Company’s contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations (e.g. taggants, maintenance, authentication services, research and development services, etc.). For such arrangements, the Company allocates revenues to each performance obligation based on their relative standalone selling price.
The Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive for those goods or services, including any variable consideration.
Due to the short-term nature of the Company’s contracts with customers, it has elected to apply the practical expedients under Topic 606 to: (1) expense as incurred, incremental costs of obtaining a contract and (2) not adjust the consideration for the effects of a significant financing component for contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less.
Product Revenues and Authentication Services
The Company’s PCR-produced linear DNA products are manufactured in accordance with contracts with customers. The Company recognizes revenue upon satisfying its promises to transfer goods or services to customers under the terms of its contracts. These performance obligations are satisfied at the point in time the Company transfers control of the goods to the customer, which in nearly
all cases is when title to and risk of loss of the goods transfer to the customer. The timing of transfer of title and risk of loss is dictated by customary or explicitly stated contract terms. The Company invoices customers upon shipment, and its collection terms range, on average, from 30 to 60 days.
Authentication Services
The Company recognizes revenue for authentication services upon satisfying its promises to provide services to customers under the terms of its contracts. These performance obligations are satisfied at the point in time the Company services are complete, which in nearly all cases is when the authentication report is released to the customer.
Clinical Laboratory Testing Services
The Company records revenue for its clinical laboratory testing service contracts, which includes its COVID-19 Testing Services, upon satisfying its promise to provide services to customers under the terms of its contracts. These performance obligations are satisfied at the point in time that Company services are complete, which in nearly all cases is when the testing results are released to the customer.
Research and Development Services
The Company records revenue for its research and development contracts using the over-time revenue recognition model. Revenue is primarily measured using the cost-to-cost method, which the Company believes best depicts the transfer of control to the customer. Under the cost-to-cost method, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to the total estimated costs expected upon satisfying the identified performance obligation.
Revenues are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. For contracts where the total costs cannot be estimated, revenues are recognized for the actual costs incurred during a period until the remaining costs to complete a contract can be estimated. The Company has elected not to disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less.
Equity Based Compensation
We account for stock-based compensation for employees, directors and nonemployees in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation (“ASC 718”). ASC 718 requires all share-based payments, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values. Under the provisions of ASC 718, stock-based compensation costs are measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and are recognized as expense over the requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the equity grant). The fair value of our common stock options are estimated using the Black Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: expected volatility, dividend rate, risk free interest rate and the expected life. We expense stock-based compensation by using the straight-line method. In accordance with ASC 740, excess tax benefits realized from the exercise of stock-based awards are classified as cash flows from operating activities. All excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies (including tax benefits of dividends on share-based payment awards) are recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statements of operations.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The most complex and subjective estimates include revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, recoverability of long-lived assets, including the values assigned to goodwill, intangible assets and property and equipment, fair value calculations for stock-based compensation and warrants, contingencies, and management’s anticipated liquidity. Management reviews its estimates on a regular basis and the effects of any material revisions are reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements in the period they are deemed necessary. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.
Comparison of the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2021 to the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2020
Revenues
Product revenues
For the twelve-month periods ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, we generated $3,295,849 and $615,430 in revenues from product sales, respectively. Product revenue increased by $2,680,419 or 436% for the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year. Revenues increased by $1,951,895 in sales of our LineaTM COVID-19 Assay Kit, of which approximately $1,898,000 was attributable to sales pursuant to our contract with Stony Brook University Hospital. Further increases include approximately $810,000 in Textiles related to the shipment of DNA concentrate to protect the supply chain. There were no shipments for cotton during the prior fiscal year due to the global shut down related to the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacting the textile industry.
Service revenues
For the twelve-month periods ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, we generated $937,735 and $1,238,517 in service revenues, respectively. Service revenue decreased by $300,782 or 24% for the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year. The decrease in service revenues is related to a decrease of approximately $285,000 relating to the expiration of a contract in the synthetic textiles industry. Further decreases include $183,455 in cannabis due to the completion of a research pilot, $79,137 in Pharmaceuticals due to a decrease in R&D projects relating to commercialization of a product line and $48,080 in cash and valuables in transit due to a fee reduction to one customer. These decreases were offset by an increase of $226,523 in our biopharmaceutical market.
Clinical laboratory service revenues
For the twelve-month periods ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, we generated $4,794,154 and $77,550 in revenues from clinical laboratory testing services, respectively. Clinical laboratory service revenue increased by $4,716,604 or 6,082% for the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year. During the second half of the prior fiscal year, we developed our COVID-19 testing services. The increase in revenue is primarily due to a full twelve months of our COVID-19 testing services during fiscal 2021 compared to only one month of testing during fiscal 2020. Of this increase, $1,181,376 in testing services relating to our contract with the City University of New York.
Costs and Expenses
Cost of Revenues
Cost of revenues for the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2021 increased by $775,759 or 108% from $720,900 for the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2020 to $1,496,659 for the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2021. Cost of revenues as a percentage of product revenues was 45% and 117% for the twelve-month periods ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. This decrease in cost of revenues as a percentage of product revenues is due to product sales mix, as sales during the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2021 included diagnostic kit sales, as well as DNA concentrate to protect a cotton supply chain, which are at a higher gross margin as compared to the products sold during the prior fiscal year. This decrease was also the result of certain costs of revenues being fixed costs such as payroll and rent, which were not fully absorbed with the low level of product revenues during the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2020 as compared to fiscal 2021.
Selling, General and Administrative
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2021 increased by $2,579,372 or 26% to $12,610,552 from $10,031,180 in the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2020. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $666,923 relating to officer and employee stock option grants that vested immediately and an increase in payroll of approximately $1,135,000. The increase in payroll relates to increased headcount, as well as an increase of approximately $550,000 for CEO bonuses, which includes an accrued bonus of $300,000, which was subsequently paid by the issuance of stock options.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses for the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2021 increased by $443,677 or 13% to $3,765,440 from $3,321,763 in the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2020. This increase is primarily due to increased purchases relating to our clinical laboratory build out as well as for research projects related to genetic sequencing and isotopic research analysis projects. These increases were offset by a reduction of approximately $37,000 relating to a government award.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization expenses for the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2021 increased by $558,708 or 196% to $844,438 from $285,730 in the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2020. This increase is related primarily to assets purchased to support our COVID-19 testing services, as well the production of our LineaTM COVID-19 Assay Kit.
Impairment losses
Impairment losses for the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2021 was $821,741. This relates to the impairment of intellectual property, customer lists and goodwill relating to a 2015 asset purchase.
Interest (expense) income
Interest (expense) income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, decreased to income of $13,675 from expense of $115,830 in the same period of 2020. The decrease in interest expense was due to the repayment of the July 2019 Notes during October 2020.
Other (expense) income
Other income (expense) for the twelve-month periods ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, was expense of $243,576 and $378,075, respectively. The decrease of $134,499 is due to an increase in franchise taxes during the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2020.
Loss on extinguishment of debt
Loss on extinguishment of convertible notes payable of $1,774,662 for the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2021 relates to the repayment of the July 2019 Notes. The loss on extinguishment represents the difference between the fair value of the July 2019 Notes, including the fair value of the Replacement Warrants issued, on the repayment date compared to its carrying value.
Gain on change in fair value of secured convertible notes payable
Gain on extinguishment of notes payable for the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2021 of $839,945 relates to the full forgiveness of the Company’s PPP loan. The gain on extinguishment represents the difference between the fair value of the PPP loan on the forgiveness date compared to their carrying value.
Net Loss
Net loss increased $1,249,535, or 10% to $14,278,439 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 compared to $13,028,904 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, due to the factors noted above.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
See Note C, “Recent Accounting Standards,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of accounting standards which may impact our consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our liquidity needs consist of our working capital requirements and research and development expenditure funding. As of September 30, 2021, we had working capital of $8,025,458. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, we used cash in operating activities of $13,387,955 consisting primarily of our loss of $14,278,439 net with non-cash adjustments of $844,438 in depreciation and amortization charges, writeoff of property and equipment of $208,782 $1,668,003 in stock-based compensation expense, $821,741 for the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, the loss on extinguishment of convertible notes payable of $1,774,662, the gain on extinguishment of notes payable of $839,945 and $28,629 of bad debt expense. Additionally, we had a net increase in operating assets of $3,480,501 and a net decrease in operating liabilities of $135,325. Cash used in investing activities was $2,548,695, for the purchase of property and equipment. Cash provided by financing activities was $14,704,855, which included net proceeds from a registered direct public offering of 13,756,507, warrant exercises of $2,613,929, and the repayment of convertible notes payable of $1,665,581.
We have recurring net losses. We have incurred a net loss of $14,278,439 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the issuance of the financial statements. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company’s ability to further implement its business plan, raise capital, and generate revenues. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.
Our current capital resources include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and inventories. Historically, we have financed our operations principally from the sale of equity and equity-linked securities.
We expect capital expenditures to be less than $1,200,000 in fiscal 2022. Our primary investments are expected to be in laboratory equipment related to our biotherapeutic research and development activities.
Substantially all of the real property used in our business is leased under operating lease agreements.
Recent Debt and Equity Financing Transactions
Fiscal 2021
Entry into Warrant Exercise Agreement
On October 7, 2020, we entered into Warrant Exercise Agreements (each, a “Warrant Exercise Agreement”) with Dillon Hill Capital, LLC and its affiliate, Dillon Hill Investment Company LLC (together, the “Investors”), whereby 318,000 of our 2019 Warrants were exercised. The 2019 Warrants were issued as part of the Company’s November 15, 2019 underwritten public offering. The gross proceeds to the Company from this partial exercise of the 2019 Warrants was $1,669,500.
In consideration of this partial exercise of the 2019 Warrants and of the consent to repayment of the Notes, as described below, the Company agreed to issue, in addition to the 318,000 shares of common stock issued upon exercise of the 2019 Warrants (the “Warrant Shares”), 159,000 replacement warrants (the “Replacement Warrants”) to the Investors, which is an amount equal to one-half the amount of the 2019 Warrants exercised pursuant to the Warrant Exercise Agreements. The Replacement Warrants have an exercise price of $7.54, the closing price on The Nasdaq Capital Market of the Company’s common stock on October 7, 2020. In addition, until January 5, 2021, if the Investors exercised additional 2019 Warrants, the Company agreed to issue to the applicable Investor additional Replacement Warrants in an amount equal to one-half the amount of such exercised 2019 Warrants with each such Replacement Warrant having an exercise price equal to the closing price on The Nasdaq Capital Market of the Company’s common stock on such date that the related 2019 Warrants are exercised. No additional warrants were exercised.
Each Replacement Warrant will be exercisable beginning on the date of issuance thereof and ending on the five year anniversary of such date. The exercise price and number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Replacement Warrants will be subject to adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, split, recapitalization, reorganization or similar transaction, as described in the Replacement Warrant. Subject to limited exceptions, a holder of a Replacement Warrant will not have the right to exercise any portion of its Replacement Warrant if the holder, together with its affiliates, would beneficially own in excess of 9.99% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise (the “Beneficial Ownership Limitation”); provided that upon 61 days’ prior notice to the Company, the holder may elect to increase or decrease the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, although
in no event may the Beneficial Ownership Limitation exceed 9.99%. Each Replacement Warrant includes an adjustment provision that, subject to certain exceptions, reduces its exercise price if the Company issues common stock or common stock equivalents at a price lower than the then-current exercise price of such Replacement Warrant, subject to a minimum exercise price of 21% of such Replacement Warrant’s initial exercise price per share. Under certain limited circumstances, including that the daily volume weighted average price of the common stock for each of 20 consecutive trading days has exceeded three times the exercise price of such Replacement Warrant, the Company may call for cancellation of all or any portion of such Replacement Warrant for which a notice of exercise has not yet been delivered for consideration equal to $0.001 per Warrant Share.
The Replacement Warrants will not be registered nor listed on any exchange but are the subject of registration rights agreements (each, a “Registration Rights Agreement”), entered into with each Investor concurrently with the respective Warrant Exercise Agreement, pursuant to which the Company agrees to file a registration statement by January 20, 2021 with respect to the common stock underlying the Replacement Warrants. If at the time of exercise of the Replacement Warrants there is no effective registration statement registering, or the prospectus contained therein is not available for the issuance of the Warrant Shares to the applicable Investor, then such Replacement Warrant may also be exercised, in whole or in part, at such time by means of a “cashless exercise” in which the Investor will be entitled to receive a number of Warrant Shares as determined by the terms of the Replacement Warrant. A registration statement was filed and went effective on February 2,2021.
The private placement of the Replacement Warrants was completed in reliance upon the exemption from registration provided for by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and by Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. Each Investor represented to the Company in its Warrant Exercise Agreement that it is an “accredited investor” as that term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D.
On each of December 9 and 10, 2020, the Investors exercised 100,000 of their 2019 Warrants, for an aggregate exercise of 200,000 of their 2019 Warrants, resulting in total net proceeds to the Company of approximately $1.1 million. As a result of these exercises, we issued to the Investors an aggregate of 100,000 additional replacement warrants, which are substantially similar to the Replacement Warrants described above except that 50,000 of the newly-issued replacement warrants have an exercise price of $6.57 and 50,000 of such replacement warrants have an exercise price of $6.46.
Repayment of secured convertible notes
On October 9, 2020, the Company entered into a letter agreement (the “Letter Agreement”) with Dillon Hill Capital, LLC (the “Noteholder”) as sole holder of the secured convertible notes (the “Notes”) for the repayment in full of the Notes, in an aggregate amount of $1,665,581 (the “Payoff Amount”), representing the outstanding principal amount of the Notes plus accrued but unpaid interest through the scheduled maturity of the Notes. The Company paid the Payoff Amount to the Noteholder on October 9, 2020. Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, upon the Noteholder’s receipt of the Payoff Amount, the Notes and any other related documents and instruments automatically terminated. Moreover, all of the obligations and liabilities of the Company and its affiliates under the Notes, the Purchase Agreement, and the Security Agreements, and any other related documents and instruments, were automatically satisfied in full, and all related liens, mortgages or other security interests were automatically released.
Registered Direct Public Offering
On January 13, 2021, we closed on a registered direct public offering (the “Offering) of 1,810,000 shares (the “Shares”) of our common stock, pursuant to (i) the securities purchase agreement, dated January 10, 2021, by and between the Company and certain institutional investors(the “Purchasers”) whereby we agreed to issue and sell the Shares directly to the Purchasers at a price of $8.30 per share of Common Stock and (ii) the placement agency agreement, dated January 10, 2021, by and between the Company and Roth Capital Partners, LLC (the “Placement Agent”). Net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, and other offering expenses, were approximately $13.8 million.
Fiscal 2020
Reverse Stock Split. On October 31, 2019, we filed a Certificate of Amendment of our Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware that effected a one-for-forty (1:40) reverse stock split of our common stock, effective November 1, 2019.
Underwritten Public Offering. On November 15, 2019, we closed an underwritten public offering where we issued and sold 2,285,000 shares of our common stock and 2,285,000 accompanying common warrants (the “2019 Warrants”) each with the right to purchase one share of our common stock at an exercise price of $5.25 per share. The shares of common stock and accompanying 2019 Warrants were sold at a combined offering price of $5.25 before underwriting discounts. The common warrants have an exercise price of $5.25 per share.
After deducting underwriter discounts and commissions and other estimated expenses related to the underwritten public offering, the aggregate net proceeds were approximately $10.8 million.
We also granted the underwriter in the underwritten offering an option to purchase an additional 342,750 shares of our common stock and/or additional 2019 Warrants to purchase 342,750 shares of our common stock to cover any over-allotments made by the underwriters in the sale and distribution of the securities.
The 2019 Warrants include an adjustment provision that, subject to certain exceptions, reduces its exercise price if we issue common stock or common stock equivalents at a price lower than the then-current exercise price of the 2019 Warrants, subject to a minimum exercise price of $1.47 per share.
Subject to limited exceptions, a holder of the 2019 Warrants will not have the right to exercise any portion of its warrant if the holder, together with its affiliates, would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% (or, at the election of the holder, 9.99%) of the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise (the “Beneficial Ownership Limitation”); provided, however, that upon 61 days’ prior notice to us, the holder may increase the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, provided that in no event shall the Beneficial Ownership Limitation exceed 9.99%.
The exercise price and number of the shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the 2019 Warrants will be subject to adjustment in the event of any stock dividends and splits, reverse stock split, recapitalization, reorganization or similar transaction, as described in the related warrant agreement.
Product Research and Development
We anticipate spending approximately $3,500,000 for product research and development activities during the next twelve months.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
Inflation
The effect of inflation on our revenue and operating results was not significant during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020.
