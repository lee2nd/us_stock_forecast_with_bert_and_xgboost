BUSINESS OVERVIEW
Our Business
We are a financial
holding company headquartered in Tallahassee,
Florida, and we are the parent of our wholly owned subsidiary,
Capital City Bank (the “Bank” or “CCB”).
We offer
a broad array of products and services, including commercial
and retail
banking services, trust and asset management, and retail securities
brokerage through a total of 57 banking offices
and 86
ATMs/ITMs
located in Florida, Georgia, and Alabama.
Please see the section captioned “About Us” beginning
on page 4 for
more detailed information about our business.
Our profitability,
like most financial institutions, is dependent to a large
extent upon net interest income, which is the difference
between the interest and fees received on interest earning
assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest paid on
interest-
bearing liabilities, principally deposits and borrowings.
Results of operations are also affected by the provision
for credit losses,
operating expenses such as salaries and employee benefits,
occupancy and other operating expenses including income taxes,
and
noninterest income such as mortgage banking revenues,
wealth management fees, deposit fees, and bank card fees.
Strategic Review
Operating Philosophy
.
Our philosophy is to build long-term client relationships based
on quality service, high ethical standards,
and safe and sound banking practices.
We maintain a
locally oriented, community-based focus, which is augmented
by
experienced, centralized support in select specialized areas.
Our local market orientation is reflected in our network of
banking
office locations, experienced community executives
with a dedicated President for each market, and community
boards which
support our focus on responding to local banking needs.
We strive to offer
a broad array of sophisticated products and to provide
quality service by empowering associates to make decisions
in their local markets.
Strategic Initiatives
.
In 2020, we celebrated
our 125
th
anniversary and reflected on our past history and what has fostered
our
longevity - client relationships, community service,
and our people have allowed us to evolve, change,
and thrive over time.
In
2020, we completed a five year strategic plan “Vision
2020” and initiated a new five year strategic plan “2025 In
Focus” that will
guide us in the areas of client experience, channel optimization,
market expansion, and culture.
As part of 2025 In Focus, we will
aim to take our brand of relationship banking to the
next level, further deepen relationships within our communities,
expand into
new higher growth markets, diversify our revenue
sources, invest in new technology that will support the expansion
of client
relationships and scale within our lines of business and
drive higher profitability.
Markets
.
We maintain a
blend of large and small markets in Florida
and Georgia all in close proximity to major interstate
thoroughfares such as Interstates I-10 and I-75.
Our larger markets include Tallahassee
(Leon County, Florida),
Gainesville
(Alachua County,
Florida), Macon (Bibb County,
Georgia),
and Seacoast (Hernando/Pasco/Citrus, Florida).
The larger
employers in these markets are state and local governments,
healthcare providers, educational institutions, and small
businesses,
providing stability and good growth dynamics that have
historically grown in excess of the national average.
We serve an
additional fifteen smaller, less competitive,
rural markets located on the outskirts of and centered between
our larger markets
where we are positioned as a market leader.
In 12 of 18 markets in Florida and two of four Georgia
markets, we frequently rank
within the top four banks in terms of deposit market
share.
Furthermore, in the counties in which we operate, we maintain
an
8.3%
deposit market share in the Florida counties and 2.4%
in the Georgia counties.
Our markets provide for a strong core
deposit funding base, a key differentiator
and driver of our profitability and franchise value.
Acquisitions/Expansion Focus
.
Prior to 2005, we were an active acquirer of banks which
is reflected in the strong core deposit
franchise we enjoy today.
During the Great Recession, we navigated this historical period
in our industry focused on protecting
shareowner value and resolved our problem assets without
raising capital.
We also pivoted to
an intense focus on organic growth
and operational improvements.
While we have not completed a whole bank transaction since 2005,
we have completed a total of
nine whole bank acquisitions and this component
of our strategy is still in place.
The focus of potential acquisition opportunities
(including management lift-outs) will be in Florida, Georgia,
and Alabama with a particular focus on financial institutions
located
in markets on the outskirts of larger,
metropolitan areas, including Alachua, Marion, Hernando/Pasco counties
in Florida, the
western panhandle of Florida, Bibb and surrounding
counties in central Georgia and the northern arc of
Atlanta, leveraging the
presence of our recent strategic alliance with CCHL.
Our focus on some of these markets may change as we
continue to evaluate
our strategy and the economic conditions and demographics
of any individual market.
We will also continue
to evaluate de novo
banking office expansion opportunities in attractive
new markets where acquisition opportunities are not feasible
,
and expansion
opportunities in asset management, insurance, mortgage
banking, and other financial businesses that are closely aligned with
the
business of banking.
Embedded in our acquisition and expansion strategy is our desire
to partner with institutions that are
culturally similar, have experienced
management and possess either established market presence
or have potential for improved
profitability through growth, economies of scale, or
expanded services.
Generally, these potential target
institutions will range in
asset size from
$100 million to $600 million.
Recent Acquisition/Expansion Activity
.
In 2020 we began our expansion into the western panhandle
area of Florida by opening a
full-service banking office in Bay County,
Florida and a loan production office in Walton
County with plans to open a full-service
banking office in Walton
County in late 2021.
Further, we will expand our presence and
commitment to our Gainesville market,
opening a third full-service banking office in late
2021 to early 2022.
On March 1, 2020, CCB completed its acquisition of
a 51% membership interest in Brand Mortgage Group, LLC (“Brand”)
which is now operated as a Capital City Home Loans
(“CCHL”) - Refer to Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies/Business
Combination for additional information on this transaction.
The primary reasons for the strategic alliance with Brand
were to
scale our mortgage banking business, gain access to an expanded
residential mortgage product line-up and investor base
(including mandatory delivery channel for loan sales),
to hedge our net interest income business and to generate
other operational
synergies and cost savings.
We realized
significant benefits from this transaction in 2020.
The strategic alliance with CCHL and
its strong presence and leadership within the Northern Arc
area (Gwinnett and Cobb counties) of Atlanta positions us to
further
evaluate expansion of our traditional banking services to
this area via de-novo banking office expansion
,
whole bank acquisition,
or the recruitment/hiring of banking teams
in the area as opportunities arise.
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
For 2020, we realized net income of $31.6 million,
or $1.88 per diluted share, compared to $30.8 million, or $1.83
per diluted
share for 2019.
The increase in net income for 2020 was attributable
to higher noninterest income of $58.1 million, partially
offset by higher
noninterest expense of $36.4 million, a $7.6 million
increase in the provision for credit losses, lower net interest income
of $2.0
million, and higher income taxes of $0.2 million.
For reporting purposes, CCHL is fully consolidated in CCBG’s
financial
statements and, for the full year 2020,
net income included an $11.1 million deduction
to record the 49% non-controlling interest
in the earnings of CCHL.
Below are summary highlights that impacted our performance
for the year:
●
Operating revenues (excluding mortgage
fees) held firm as unfavorable asset re-pricing
was offset by SBA PPP loan fees
and higher other fee revenues
●
Loan balances buoyed by SBA PPP
loan originations which totaled $190 million
-
Core loan balances (excluding SBA
PPP) held firm due to stronger loan production
in the fourth quarter
●
Reserve build of $6.6 million (loan HFI provision
of $9.0 million less net charge-offs of $2.4 million)
in response to potential
credit losses related
to the pandemic
-
Allowance coverage ratio (excluding SBA PPP) was 1.30%
at year-end
●
Deposits grew $572 million (period-end)
and $307 million (average) and reflected
stimulus inflows as well as strong core
deposit growth
●
Acquired 51% ownership in Brand
Mortgage, LLC on March 1, 2020 (renamed
CCHL) - contributed $0.52 per share
In 2020,
despite pressure from the economic effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic and a 150 basis point emergency
Federal Open
Market Committee rate reduction in March, our earnings
held firm and came in slightly above 2019.
Our strategic alliance with
CCHL was timely and those earnings provided a hedge
against our net interest income.
Period-end loans grew $170 million, or 9.3%, in 2020 aided
by our involvement in the SBA PPP loan program as we
generated
$190 million in loans ($178 million balance at December
31, 2020) to support our clients during this unprecedented
time.
Core
loan balances held firm despite the stressed economy buoyed
by our relationship with CCHL and the larger
pool of loan purchase
opportunities that strategic alliance provides us.
We also generated
a total of $5.0 million in net SBA PPP loan fees of which $1.8
million was recognized in 2020.
Our deposit balances saw unprecedented growth in
2020 as average balances grew $307 million, or 12% driven
by the stimulus
provided by various government programs throughout
the year as well as core deposit growth as our clients
sought a flight to
safety.
2020 continued our seventh consecutive year of deposit growth
which has averaged 4.1% per year.
Noninterest income was very strong in 2020 driven by higher
mortgage banking revenues attributable to the strategic alliance
with CCHL, and a very robust mortgage market.
Other fee revenues held firm despite pressure on our deposit
fees attributable to
the pandemic.
Wealth management
fees and bank card fees grew 4.5%
and 8.3%, respectively in 2020.
Expenses at our core bank (excluding CCHL) declined
by $3.6 million in 2020,
primarily attributable to lower pension plan
expense.
We continued
our ongoing commitment to expense management as a component
of improving our efficiency ratio and
elevated our commitment in 2020 by allocating dedicated
resources focused on identifying opportunities to reduce
the cost of our
banking office network and occupancy costs.
In 2020, we continued our multi-year investment in ITM/SATM
technology and
enhancements to our electronic banking platform which
greatly benefited our ability to improve service quality
for our clients
during the pandemic.
The pandemic provided significant challenges on the credit
front in 2020.
We supported
our clients, providing short-term loan
extensions for loan balances totaling $333 million, of
which $324 million had returned to normal scheduled payments by year-
end.
Despite the stressed environment for our borrowers, our credit quality
metrics remained very stable throughout the year with
minimal defaults and credit losses of 12 basis points of
average loans held for investment (“HFI”).
In response to the great
uncertainty regarding potential loan defaults related to the
stressed economy, we built
significant credit loss reserves in response
during 2020,
and continued to carry those reserves through year-end.
Key components of our 2020 financial performance are
summarized below:
Results of Operations
Net Interest Income.
For 2020, tax-equivalent net interest income totaled $101.8
million,
a $2.1 million, or 2.0%, decrease from
2019 driven primarily by lower rates for most of the
year, which negatively impacted
our variable and adjustable rate earning
assets. Partially offsetting this decline was a lower
cost of funds.
Provision and Allowance for Credit
Losses.
For 2020, our provision for credit losses was $9.6
million compared to $2.0 million
for 2019.
The higher provision in 2020 reflected expected potential losses due
to deterioration in economic conditions related to
the COVID-19 pandemic.
Net loan losses for 2020 totaled $2.4 million, or 0.12% of average loans
held for investment compared
to $2.3 million, or 0.13%, in 2019.
At December 31, 2020, excluding SBA PPP loans (100% government
guaranteed),
the
allowance represented 1.30% of loans held for investment.
Noninterest Income and Noninterest
Expense
.
The consolidation of CCHL’s
mortgage banking operations on March 1, 2020
impacted our noninterest income and noninterest expense
comparisons for 2020 versus 2019.
To better understand the
impact, we
provide an analysis of Noninterest Income and Noninterest
Expense for CCBG excluding CCHL (“Core CCBG”) and
CCHL
under those respective headings below (Pages 39 and
41).
CCHL operations contributed $8.7 million, or $0.52 per
diluted share,
to our earnings for 2020 driven by robust mortgage production
and efficiencies gained with the strategic alliance
.
At Core CCBG, deposit fees declined $1.7 million
in 2020 primarily due to the impact of government stimulus in
the second
quarter related to the COVID-19 pandemic, but increased
for the second half of the year as the economy and consumer
spending
improved.
Strong debit card fee growth
of $1.0 million and a $0.6 million increase in wealth management
fees substantially
offset the aforementioned decline in deposit fees.
Core CCBG noninterest expense decreased $3.6 million and
reflected lower
compensation expense of $2.5 million, ORE expense
of $0.4 million, and other expense of $2.2 million, partially
offset by higher
occupancy expense of $1.5 million.
Financial Condition
Earning Assets
.
Average earning
assets were $3.391 billion for 2020, an increase of $404.0 million,
or 13.5%, over 2019.
The
increase was primarily driven by higher deposit balances
and reflected strong core deposit growth and funding retained
at the
bank from SBA PPP loans and various other government
stimulus programs.
Loans
.
In 2020, average loans HFI totaled $1.993 billion, an increase
of $159.4 million, or 8.0% over 2019 and reflected growth
in all loan categories except institutional loans, home
equity loans, and consumer loans.
During 2020, we originated SBA PPP
loans which averaged $128 million in 2020 and totaled
$178 million at December 31, 2020.
SBA PPP loan fees totaled
approximately $1.8 million in 2020.
At December 31, 2020 we had $3.2 million (net) in deferred
SBA PPP loan fees.
Credit Quality
.
Nonaccrual loans totaled $5.9 million (0.29% of HFI loans)
at December 31, 2020 compared to $4.5 million
(0.24% of HFI loans) at December 31, 2019.
Classified loans totaled $17.6 million and $20.8 million at the
same respective
periods.
We continue to
closely monitor borrowers and loan portfolio segments impacted
by the pandemic.
Of the $333 million
in loans extended in 2020, approximately $9 million was
still on extension at December 31, 2020, none of which were
classified.
Of the $324 million in loans extended in 2020, that have
resumed payments, loan balances totaling $3.5 million
were over 30
days delinquent and an additional $0.4 million was on
nonaccrual status at December 31, 2020.
Deposits
.
Average total
deposits for 2020 were $2.844 billion, an increase of $306.9
million, or 12.1%, over 2019.
We realized
increases in all
deposit types except certificates of deposit, with the largest
increases occurring in noninterest bearing and savings
accounts.
The strong deposit growth that
occurred during the year reflected inflows from various government
stimulus programs
as well as strong core deposit growth.
Capital
.
At December 31, 2020, we were well-capitalized with a total risk-based
capital ratio of 17.30% and a tangible common
equity ratio (a non-GAAP financial measure) of 6.25
%
compared to 17.90% and 8.06%, respectively,
at December 31, 2019.
At
December 31, 2020, all of our regulatory capital ratios
exceeded the threshold to be well-capitalized under the Basel III
capital
standards.
Our tangible common equity ratio was unfavorably impacted
at December 31, 2020 by the annual adjustment to the
other comprehensive loss for our pension plan, which
was negatively impacted due to the lower discount rate used to
calculate the
present value of the pension obligation.
The lower discount rate reflected the significant decline in long-term
interest rates in
2020.
The pension plan, on an actuarial basis, continues to be sufficiently
funded in accordance with IRS regulation.

Net Interest Income
Net interest income represents our single largest
source of earnings and is equal to interest income and fees
generated by earning
assets, less interest expense paid on interest bearing
liabilities.
We provide
an analysis of our net interest income, including
average yields and rates in Tables
2 and 3 below.
We provide this
information on a "taxable equivalent" basis to reflect the
tax-
exempt status of income earned on certain loans and
investments.
For 2020, our taxable equivalent net interest income
decreased $2.1 million, or 2.0%. This follows an increase of $10.7
million, or
11.5%
in 2019.
The decrease in 2020 was driven primarily by lower rates for most of
the year, which negatively impacted our
variable and adjustable rate earning assets.
Partially offsetting this decline was a lower
cost of funds.
The increase in 2019 was
due to generally higher rates which continued to
migrate through the earning asset portfolios.
For 2020, taxable equivalent interest income decreased
$6.7 million, or 5.9%, from 2019.
For 2019, taxable equivalent interest
income increased $13.3 million, or 13.3%, over 2018.
The decline in 2020 was primarily due to lower rates on earning
assets.
The increase for 2019 was primarily due to higher
loan balances coupled with higher interest rates.
For 2020, interest expense decreased $4.6 million, or
48.7%, from 2019.
For 2019, interest expense increased $2.6 million, or
37.8%, over 2018.
The decline in 2020 was primarily due to lower rates on our negotiated
rate deposits which are tied to an
adjustable rate index, whereas the increase for 2019 primarily
reflected increases to our negotiated rate deposits.
Our cost of
funds decreased 19 basis points to 16 basis points in 2020,
and increased eight basis points to 35 basis points in 2019.
The
decrease in 2020 was primarily due to lower interest
rates paid on our negotiated rate products.
The increase in 2019 was
primarily due to higher interest rates paid on our
negotiated rate products due to the average increase in interest rates
over the
period.
Our interest rate spread (defined as the taxable-equivalent
yield on average earning assets less the average rate
paid on interest
bearing liabilities) decreased 43 basis points in 2020 and
increased 15 basis points in 2019.
Our net interest margin (defined as
taxable-equivalent interest income less interest expense divided
by average earning assets) of 3.30%
in 2020 was a 55 basis point
decrease from 2019.
The net interest margin of 3.85%
in 2019 was a 21 basis point increase over 2018.
The decline in the
interest rate spread and net interest margin
in 2020 was primarily due to lower yielding earning assets due
to lower rates, in
addition to strong growth in lower yielding overnight funds.
The increase in the interest rate spread and net interest margin
in
2019 was attributable to rising rates and an improving
mix of earning assets driven by loan growth.
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decreased the
federal funds target rate 150 basis points in March
2020 to a target
rate in the range of 0.00%-0.25%, resulting in lower yields
as our variable and adjustable rate earning assets reprice.
As we
continue to closely monitor and manage our net interest
margin,
we review and implement various loan strategies that align with
our overall risk appetite to enhance our performance
on an ongoing basis.
We continue
to maintain relatively short duration
portfolios on both sides of the balance sheet and
believe we are well positioned to respond to changing market
conditions.

Provision for Credit Losses
The provision for credit losses for 2020 was $9.6 million
($9.0 million for loans HFI and $0.6 million for unfunded loan
commitments) compared to $2.0 million for 2019 and
$2.9 million for 2018.
Prior to 2020,
the provision for unfunded loan
commitments was recorded in other expense.
The higher provision in 2020 reflected expected losses due to deterioration
in
economic conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic
.
We further
discuss the various factors that have impacted our provision
expense for 2020 below under the heading Allowance
for Credit Losses.
Noninterest Income
For 2020, noninterest income totaled $111.2
million, a $58.1 million increase over 2019 primarily attributable
to higher mortgage
banking revenues of $58.0 million added through the
strategic alliance with CCHL.
Deposit fees declined $1.7 million primarily
due to the impact of government stimulus in the second
quarter related to the COVID-19 pandemic,
but improved for the second
half of the year due to higher utilization of our overdraft
product.
Strong debit card fee growth of $1.0 million and a $0.6 million
increase in wealth management fees significantly offset
the aforementioned decline in deposit fees.
For 2019, noninterest income totaled $53.1 million, a $1.5
million, or 2.9%, increase over 2018, and reflected higher
wealth
management fees of $1.8 million, mortgage banking
revenues of $0.6 million, and bank card fees of $0.6 million,
partially offset
by lower deposit fees of $0.6 million and other income
of $0.9 million.
Noninterest income as a percent of total operating revenues
(net interest income plus noninterest income) was 52.32
%
in 2020,
33.92%
in 2019, and 35.79% in 2018.
The addition of CCHL mortgage banking revenues drove
the improvement in this metric in
2020.
The decline in this metric in 2019 was attributable to growth
in net interest income as a component of operating revenues.
CCHL’s
mortgage banking operations impacted our
noninterest income for 2020 and thus, the year over year comparisons
reflect
the impact of the CCHL consolidation, which occurred
on March 1, 2020.
The table below reflects the major components of
noninterest income for Core CCBG and CCHL to help
facilitate a better understanding of the 2020 versus 2019
comparison.

Significant components of noninterest income are
discussed in more detail below.
Deposit Fees
.
For 2020, deposit fees (service charge fees,
insufficient fund/overdraft fees (“NSF/OD”), and business account
analysis fees) totaled $17.8 million compared to $19.5 million
in 2019 and $20.1 million in 2018.
The $1.7 million, or 8.6%,
decrease in 2020 was attributable to lower NSF/OD fees and reflected
the impact of significant government stimulus in the second
quarter related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
For the second quarter of 2020, fees were down $1.3 million
compared to the first
quarter of 2020 and reflected lower utilization of our overdraft
product as consumer and business demand for this service
was
reduced by the impact of the significant cash stimulus provided
by the economic impact payments (EIP) and small business loans
(SBA PPP).
The decline in fees realized in the second quarter reversed
in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 as employment
conditions and economic activity began to recover resulting
in higher utilization of our overdraft product.
The $0.6 million, or
3.1%, decrease in 2019 reflected lower NSF/OD fees and
higher overdraft losses that were partially offset
by higher service
charge fees.
Bank Card Fees
.
Bank card fees totaled $13.0 million in 2020 compared
to $12.0 million in 2019 and $11.4
million in 2018.
Bank card fees in 2020 benefited from the effects
of the pandemic and increased on-line spending by our
clients.
An account
acquisition initiative that began in early 2019 and various
debit and credit card promotions contributed to the increases in both
2019 and 2020.
Wealth
Management Fees
.
Wealth management
fees including both trust fees (i.e., managed accounts and
trusts/estates) and
retail brokerage fees (i.e., investment, insurance products,
and retirement accounts) totaled $11.0 million in 2020 compared
to
$10.5 million in 2019 and $8.7 million in 2018.
The increase in fees for 2020 was attributable to a $0.3 million
increase in retail
brokerage fees and a $0.2 million increase in trust fees.
The growth in fees for 2019 reflected a $1.3 million
increase in retail
brokerage fees and $0.5 million increase in trust fees.
Higher transactions volumes and the addition of new investment
advisors
drove the increase in retail brokerage fees in 2019 and
2020.
Growth in assets under management contributed to the
growth in
trust fees in 2019 and 2020.
At December 31, 2020,
total assets under management were approximately $1.979 billion
compared
to $1.774 billion at December 31, 2019 and $1.500 billion
at December 31, 2018.
Mortgage Banking Revenues
.
Mortgage banking revenues totaled $63.3 million in 2020
compared to $5.3 million in 2019 and
$4.7 million in 2018.
The increase in 2020 reflected revenues added from the strategic
alliance with CCHL and the favorable
impact that the lower residential mortgage rate environment
had on home purchase,
construction, and refinancing activity in our
combined markets.
The increase in 2019 was attributable to higher production sold
into the secondary market at our legacy
residential mortgage operation versus loans retained
and held in the bank’s loan portfolio
.
We provide
a detailed overview of our
mortgage banking operation, including a detailed break-down
of mortgage banking revenues, mortgage servicing activity,
and
warehouse funding within Note 4 in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.
To date, the strategic
alliance has
significantly exceeded our pro forma expectations and served
as a hedge to the pressure on our net interest income
in 2020.
Refinancing activity represented 40% of loan production
at CCHL in 2020.
Other
.
Other noninterest income totaled $5.9 million in 2020 compared
to $5.8 million in 2019
and $6.6
million in 2018.
The
$0.1 million favorable variance in 2020 reflected higher
loan servicing fees added by CCHL substantially offset
by lower loan
related activity based fees.
The $0.9 million, or 13.0%, decrease in 2019 was primarily
due to a miscellaneous recovery in 2018
and lower miscellaneous loan fees.
Noninterest Expense
For 2020, noninterest expense totaled $150.0 million,
an increase of $36.4 million over 2019 primarily attributable to the addition
of expenses at CCHL, including compensation expense of
$32.4 million, occupancy expense of $2.8 million, and other
expense of
$4.8 million.
Core CCBG noninterest expense decreased $3.6 million and
reflected lower compensation expense of $2.5 million,
ORE expense of $0.4 million, and other expense of $2.2 million,
partially offset by higher occupancy expense of
$1.5 million.
The decrease in compensation expense was primarily
attributable to lower commission expense of $2.2 million related
to the
transfer of our legacy mortgage production division
to CCHL and, to a lesser extent, higher realized loan cost of $0.4 million
related to the aforementioned increase in SBA PPP loan originations.
A $1.0 million gain from the sale of a banking office
in the
first quarter of 2020 drove the reduction in ORE expense.
The decline in other expense was primarily attributable to lower
service cost expense for our pension plan.
Higher expense for FF&E depreciation and maintenance agreements
(related to
technology investment and upgrades), higher than normal
premises maintenance, and pandemic related cleaning/supply
costs
drove the increase in occupancy.
For 2019, noninterest expense totaled $113.6
million, an increase of $2.1 million, or 1.9%, over 2018 attributable
to higher
compensation expense of $2.4 million that was partially
offset by a $0.3 million decrease in other expense.
The increase in
compensation expense was attributable to salary
expense (primarily merit raises) and commission expense (related
to residential
mortgage originations and retail brokerage transactions).
The decrease in other expense was primarily due to lower
professional
fees and insurance-other expense (primarily FDIC premiums)
that was partially offset by higher expense
for other real estate
(“OREO”) properties.
The increase in OREO was due to lower net gains from property sales in
2019.
Our operating efficiency ratio (expressed
as noninterest expense as a percent of taxable equivalent net
interest income plus
noninterest income) was 70.43%, 72.40%
and 77.05%
in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The improvement in this metric was
primarily attributable to higher noninterest income driven
by our strategic alliance with CCHL.
Improved operating leverage
primarily attributable to growth in net interest income was the primary
driver of improvement in 2019.
Expense management is an important part of our culture
and strategic focus.
We will continue
to review and evaluate
opportunities to optimize our delivery operations
and invest in technology that provides
favorable returns/scale and/or mitigates
risk.
CCHL’s
mortgage banking operations impacted our
noninterest expense for 2020 and thus, the year over year comparisons
reflect
the impact of the CCHL consolidation, which occurred
on March 1, 2020.

noninterest expense for Core CCBG and CCHL to help facilitate

Significant components of noninterest expense are
discussed in more detail below.
Compensation
.
Compensation expense totaled $96.3 million in 2020,
$66.4 million in 2019, and $63.9 million in 2018.
For
2020, the $29.9 million, or 45.1%, increase in consolidated
compensation expense reflected the addition of $32.4 million
in
compensation expense from CCHL.
Core CCBG compensation expense declined by $2.5
million,
primarily attributable to lower
commission expense of $2.2 million (transfer of residential
mortgage operations to CCHL), higher realized loan cost
(credit offset
to salary expense) of $0.4
million and lower associate benefit expense
of $0.9 million (primarily stock compensation and to a
lesser extent associate insurance), partially offset
by higher cash incentives of $0.2 million, base salaries of $0.3
million, and
contractual employment of $0.3 million (tax advisory services for
CCHL transaction).
For 2019, the $2.4 million, or 3.8%, increase over 2018
was attributable to higher salary expense of $2.6 million, partially offset
by lower associate benefit expense of $0.2 million.
Higher base salary expense and commission expense drove
the increase.
The
increase in base salaries primarily reflected merit raises and
the increase in commissions was related to the residential mortgage
and retail securities brokerage businesses.
Occupancy
.
Occupancy expense (including premises and equipment) totaled
$22.7 million for 2020, $18.4 million for 2019, and
$18.5 million for 2018.
For 2020, the $4.3 million, or 23.4%, increase in consolidated
occupancy expense reflected the addition
of $2.8 million in occupancy expense from CCHL.
Core CCBG occupancy expense increased $1.5 million
primarily due to
higher FF&E depreciation and maintenance agreement
expense (related to technology investment and upgrades), maintenance
for
premises, and pandemic related cleaning/supply costs.
Pandemic related costs reflected in occupancy expense for 2020
at Core
CCBG totaled approximately $0.3 million and will phase
out over a period of time as the pandemic subsides.
For 2019, the $0.1 million, or 0.4%, decrease from
2018 generally reflected the closing of two offices
in 2019.
Other
.
Other noninterest expense totaled $31.0 million in 2020
,
$28.8 million in 2019, and $29.1 million in 2018.
For 2020,
the
$2.2 million, or 7.6%, increase in consolidated
other expense reflected the addition of $4.8 million in expenses
from CCHL
partially offset by a $2.6 million decrease
in other expenses at Core CCBG.
Lower pension plan expense of $1.9 million (higher
unrealized gain amortization due to a lower discount
rate for pension liability),
ORE expense of $0.4 million (primarily due to a
$1.0 million gain from the sale of a banking office)
,
and travel/entertainment expense of $0.4 million (partially due
to lower travel
during pandemic) drove the decrease in other expenses
at Core CCBG.
For 2019, the $0.3 million, or 0.9%, decrease was primarily
attributable to lower professional fees of $0.7 million and
insurance-
other expense of $0.6 million,
partially offset by higher OREO expense of
$1.0 million.
The reduction in professional fees
reflected the completion of several consulting projects in
the second half of 2018.
Lower FDIC insurance premiums drove the
reduction in insurance-other expense as we used the bulk
of our premium credits in the third and fourth quarters of
2019.
The
increase in OREO expense was due to a lower
level of net gains from the sale of properties in 2019.
Income Taxes
For 2020, we realized income tax expense of $10.2
million (effective rate of 19%) compared to
$9.9 million (effective rate of
24%) for 2019 and $3.4 million (effective
rate of 12%) for 2018.
The decrease in our effective tax rate in 2020
reflected the
impact of converting CCHL to a partnership for tax purposes in
the second quarter of 2020.
In addition, 2020 income taxes
reflected net discrete tax expense items totaling $0.3 million.
Excluding discrete items, our effective tax rate was 19%
for 2020,
23% for 2019 and 24% for 2018.
Absent discrete items, we expect our annual effective
tax rate to approximate 18% to 19% in
2021.
In September 2019, Florida enacted a corporate tax
rate reduction from 5.5% to 4.5% retroactive to January 1,
2019.
As a result,
our deferred tax accounts were re-measured resulting in
a discrete tax expense of $0.4 million.
Further, our 2019 state tax rate
was adjusted to reflect the one percentage point reduction
which will be in effect through the end of 2021 at which
time it will
revert back to 5.5%.
On December 22, 2017, the Tax
Act was signed into law.
Among other things, the Tax
Act reduced our corporate federal tax rate
from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018.
During 2018, income tax expense included four discrete tax
benefit items totaling
$3.6 million resulting from the effect of the Tax
Act.
Three discrete items totaling $3.3 million related to pension
plan
contributions made in 2018 for the plan year 2017.
In addition, we realized a discrete tax item for $0.3 million related
to a tax
accounting method change for a cost segregation and depreciation
analysis for various properties we own which was filed with
the extended 2017 tax return.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Average assets totaled
approximately $3.391 billion for 2020, an increase
of $404.0 million, or 13.5%, over 2019.
Average
earning assets were approximately $3.084 billion for 2020
,
an increase of $386.6 million, or 14.3%, over 2019.
Compared to
2019, average overnight funds increased $227.7 million,
while investment securities decreased $57.7 million and average
loans
were higher by $145.8 million.
We discuss these variances
in more detail below.
Table 2 provides
information on average balances and rates, Table
3 provides an analysis of rate and volume variances and Table
4 highlights the changing mix of our interest earning assets over
the last three years.
Loans
In 2020,
average loans HFI increased $145.8 million, or 8.1%, compared to
an increase of $100.1 million, or 5.8%, in 2019.
Compared to 2019, we realized average growth in all categories
except institutional loans, home equity loans, and consumer
loans.
During 2020, we originated PPP loans which averaged $128
million for the year.
In 2020, average loans held for sale (“HFS”) increased $70.8
million over 2019 due to the addition of loans from our
strategic
alliance with CCHL and the robust residential mortgage
market in 2020.
Loans HFI and HFS as a percentage of average earning
assets decreased to 66.1% in 2020 compared to 67.6% in
2019 and 67.1%
in 2018, primarily attributable to higher levels of overnight
funds due to growth in deposits.
We continue
to make minor modifications on some of our lending
programs to try and mitigate the impact that consumer
and
business deleveraging has had on our portfolio.
These programs, coupled with economic improvements in our
anchor markets
and loan purchases, have helped to increase overall loan growth.
We will periodically
purchase newly originated 1-4 family real estate secured adjustable
rate loans from CCHL.
Loan purchases
totaled $48.4 million and $25.2 million for the years ended
December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.
The
strategic alliance with CCHL provides us a larger
pool of loan purchase opportunities, including participation
loans for
construction/perm product.

Our average total loans (HFS and HFI)-to-deposit
ratio was 71.7% in 2020, 71.8% in 2019, and 70.9% in
2018.
The composition of our HFI loan portfolio at December

Table 6 arrays
our HFI loan portfolio at December 31, 2020,
by maturity period.
As a percentage of the HFI loan portfolio, loans with fixed
interest rates represented 42.4% at December 31, 2020
compared to 38.2% at December 31, 2019.
Stronger growth occurred in
our fixed rate loans, primarily due to the addition of
the PPP loans, which are short-term in nature.

and $2.6 million are included in
NALs at December 31, 2020,
December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.
Nonaccrual Loans
.
Nonaccrual loans totaled $5.9 million at December 31, 2020
,
an increase of $1.4 million over December 31,
2019.
Gross additions to nonaccrual status during 2020 totaled $11.4
million compared to $9.2 million in 2019.
Generally, loans
are placed on nonaccrual status if principal or interest payments
become 90 days past due or management deems
the collectability of the principal and interest to be doubtful.
Once a loan is placed in nonaccrual status, all previously
accrued
and uncollected interest is reversed against interest income.
Interest income on nonaccrual loans is recognized when
the ultimate
collectability is no longer considered doubtful.
Loans are returned to accrual status when the principal
and interest amounts
contractually due are brought current or when future
payments are reasonably assured.
If interest on our loans classified as
nonaccrual during 2020 had been recognized on a fully
accruing basis, we would have recorded an additional $0.4 million
of
interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Other Real Estate Owned
.
OREO represents property acquired as the result of
borrower defaults on loans or by receiving a deed
in lieu of foreclosure.
OREO is recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value,
less estimated selling costs, at the time of
foreclosure.
Write-downs occurring at foreclosure
are charged against the allowance for loan losses.
On an ongoing basis,
properties are either revalued internally or by a third
party appraiser as required by applicable regulations.
Subsequent declines in
value are reflected as other noninterest expense.
Carrying costs related to maintaining the OREO properties are expensed
as
incurred and are also reflected as other noninterest expense.
OREO totaled $0.8 million at December 31, 2020
versus $1.0 million at December 31, 2019.
During 2020,
we added properties
totaling $2.3 million, sold properties totaling $1.7 million,
and recorded valuation adjustments totaling $0.8 million.
For 2019,
we added properties totaling $1.3 million, sold properties
totaling $2.3 million, and recorded valuation adjustments totaling
$0.3
million.
The composition of our OREO portfolio as of December
31 is provided in the table below.

Troubled
Debt Restructurings.
TDRs are loans on which, due to the deterioration in the
borrower’s financial condition, the
original terms have been modified and deemed
a concession to the borrower.
From time to time we will modify a loan as a
workout alternative.
Most of these instances involve an extension of the loan term, an
interest rate reduction, or a principal
moratorium.
A TDR classification can be removed if the borrower’s
financial condition improves such that the borrower is no
longer in financial difficulty,
the loan has not had any forgiveness of principal
or interest, and the loan is subsequently refinanced
or restructured at market terms and qualifies as a new
loan in calendar years after the year in which the restructuring took
place.
Loans classified as TDRs at December 31, 2020 totaled $14.3
million compared to $17.6 million at December 31,
2019.
Accruing TDRs made up approximately $13.9 million of our
TDR portfolio at December 31, 2020 of which $0.7 million
was over
30 days past due.
The weighted average rate for the loans within the accruing
TDR portfolio was 5.21%.
During 2020, we
modified three loan contracts totaling approximately $0.2
million.
Our TDR default rate (default balance as a percentage
of
average TDRs) in 2020 and 2019 was 2.9% and 3.0%,
respectively.
COVID Loan Extensions
.
To assist our clients
during the COVID-19 pandemic, beginning in March
2020, we began allowing
short term 60 to 90 day loan extensions for affected
borrowers.
We have extended
loans totaling $333 million of which
approximately 75% were for commercial borrowers
and 25% were for consumer borrowers.
Approximately $324 million, or 97%
of the loan balances associated with these borrowers
have resumed making regularly scheduled payments.
Of the $9 million in
loans that remain on extension, no loans were classified at December
31, 2020.
Of the $324 million in loans where the borrowers
have resumed payments, loan balances totaling $3.5
million were over 30 days delinquent and an additional $0.4 million
was on
nonaccrual status at December 31, 2020.
Under the applicable regulatory guidance, none of these loans were
considered
restructured at December 31, 2020.
We continue
to analyze our loan portfolio for segments that have been affected
by the stressed economic and business conditions
caused by the pandemic.
Certain at-risk segments total 8% of our loan balances at December 31,
2020, including hotel (3%),
restaurant (1%), retail and shopping centers (3%),
and other (1%).
The other segment includes churches, non-profits, education,
and recreational.

Past Due Loans
.
A loan is defined as a past due loan when one full payment is past
due or a contractual maturity is over 30 days
past due.
Past due loans at December 31, 2020 totaled $4.6 million compared
to $4.9
million at December 31, 2019.
Potential Problem Loans
.
Potential problem loans are defined as those loans which are now current
but where management has
doubt as to the borrower’s ability to comply
with present loan repayment terms.
At December 31, 2020,
we had $2.3
million in
loans of this type which were not included in either of
the nonaccrual, TDR or 90 day past due loan categories compared
to $2.5
million at December 31, 2019.
Management monitors these loans closely and reviews their
performance on a regular basis.
Loan Concentrations
.
Loan concentrations exist when there are amounts loaned
to multiple borrowers engaged in similar
activities which cause them to be similarly impacted by
economic or other conditions and such amount exceeds
10% of total
loans.
Due to the lack of diversified industry within our markets and
the relatively close proximity of the markets, we have both
geographic concentrations as well as concentrations in
the types of loans funded.
Specifically, due to the
nature of our markets, a
significant portion of our HFI loan portfolio has historically
been secured with real estate, approximately 67
%
at December 31,
2020 and 71% at December 31, 2019.
This percentage declined in 2020 due to the higher allocation
in the commercial loan
category which reflected $178 million in SBA PPP loans at December
31, 2020.
The primary types of real estate collateral are
commercial properties and 1-4 family residential properties.
The following table summarizes our real estate loan
portfolio as segregated by the type of property.
Property type concentrations
are stated as a percentage of December 31
st

A major portion of our real estate loan portfolio is centered
in the owner occupied category which carries a lower risk of
non-
collection than certain segments of the investor category.
Approximately 35%
of the investor real estate category was secured by
residential real estate at December 31, 2020.
Allowance for Credit Losses
The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that
is deducted from the loans’ amortized cost basis to present
the net
amount expected to be collected on the loans.
The allowance for credit losses is adjusted by a credit loss provision
which is
reported in earnings, and reduced by the charge
-off of loan amounts, net of recoveries.
Loans are charged off against the
allowance when management believes the uncollectability
of a loan balance is confirmed.
Expected recoveries do not exceed the
aggregate of amounts previously charged
-off and expected to be charged-off.
Expected credit loss inherent in non-cancellable
off-balance sheet credit exposures is provided
through the credit loss provision, but recorded as a separate
liability included in
other liabilities.
Management estimates the allowance balance using
relevant available information, from internal and external
sources, relating to
past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable
forecasts.
Historical loan default and loss experience provides the
basis for the estimation of expected credit losses.
Adjustments to historical loss information incorporate management’s
view of
current conditions and forecasts.
Detailed information regarding the methodology for
estimating the amount reported in the allowance for credit
losses is provided
in Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies/Allowance for
Credit Losses in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Table 9 analyzes
the activity in the allowance over the past five years.
For 2020, our net loan charge-offs
totaled $2.4 million, or 0.12%, of average HFI loans, compared
to $2.3 million, or 0.13%, for
2019, and $2.0 million, or 0.12%, for 2018.
At December 31, 2020, the allowance represented 1.19% of
HFI loans and provided
coverage of 406% of nonperforming loans compared to
0.75% and 311%, respectively,
at December 31, 2019 and 0.80% and
207%, respectively,
at December 31, 2018.
At December 31, 2020, excluding SBA PPP loans (100% government
guaranteed),
the allowance represented 1.30% of loans held for investment.
Table 10 provides
an allocation of the allowance for loan losses to specific loan
types for each of the past five years.
At December 31, 2020, the allowance for credit losses totaled
$23.8 million compared to $13.9 million at December
31, 2019 and
$14.2 million at December 31, 2018.
The adoption of ASC 326 (“CECL”) on January 1, 2020 had an
impact of $4.0 million ($3.3
million increase in the allowance for credit losses and
$0.7 million increase in the allowance for unfunded loan commitments
(other liability account)).
The $6.6 million build (provision of $9.0 million less net
charge-offs of $2.4 million) in the allowance
for credit losses in 2020 was attributable to stressed economic
conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic and
its potential
effect on rates of default.
For 2019, the slight decrease generally reflected improvement
in overall credit quality metrics.

Investment Securities
Our average investment portfolio balance decreased
$57.7 million, or 9.1%, in 2020 and decreased $71.1 million,
or 10.1%, in
2019.
As a percentage of average earning assets, our investment portfolio
represented 18.8% in 2020, compared to 23.8% in
2019.
In 2020,
the reduction in the investment portfolio was primarily attributable
to the inability to find compelling investments.
We currently
believe a relatively short duration investment portfolio offers
the flexibility to provide additional liquidity from
maturing bonds, if necessary.
In addition, we continue to review various investment
strategies to prudently deploy at least a
portion of our excess overnight funds.
In 2020, average taxable
investments decreased $38.3 million, or 6.3%, while tax-exempt
investments decreased $19.3 million, or
79.1%.
Taxable bonds declined
as part of our overall investment strategy,
and non-taxable investments decreased as the tax-
equivalent yield was generally unattractive throughout
2020 compared to taxable investments. At December 31, 2020,
municipal
securities (taxable and non-taxable) comprised 0.7%
of the portfolio.
We may consider
the purchase of municipal issues if the
yields become more attractive compared to taxable
securities, or if they are CRA-eligible investments.
Our investment portfolio is a significant component of
our operations and, as such, it functions as a key element
of liquidity and
asset/liability management.
Two types of classifications
are approved for investment securities which are Available
-for-Sale
(“AFS”) and Held-for-Maturity (“HTM”).
In 2019 and 2020, we purchased securities under both
the AFS and HTM designations.
At December 31, 2020, $324.9 million, or 65.7% of
our investment portfolio was classified as AFS, with the remaining
$169.9
million, or 34.3%, classified as HTM. At December 31,
2019, the AFS and HTM portfolio comprised 62.8%
and 37.2%,
respectively.

The classification of a security is determined upon acquisition
based on how the purchase will affect our asset/liability
strategy
and future business plans and opportunities.
Classification determinations will also factor in regulatory capital requiremen
ts,
volatility in earnings or other comprehensive income, and
liquidity needs.
Securities in the AFS portfolio are recorded at fair
value with unrealized gains and losses associated with these securities
recorded net of tax, in the accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) component of shareowners’
equity.
Securities designated as HTM are those acquired or owned with
the intent of holding them to maturity (final payment date).
HTM investments are measured at amortized cost.
It is neither
management’s current
intent nor practice to participate in the trading of investment securities for
the purpose of recognizing gains
and therefore we do not maintain a trading portfolio.
At December 31, 2020, there were 47 positions (combined
AFS and HTM) with unrealized losses totaling $0.2
million.
GNMA
mortgage-backed securities, U.S. Treasuries,
and SBA securities carry the full faith and credit guarantee
of the U.S. Government,
and are 0% risk-weighted assets.
SBA securities float monthly or quarterly with the prime
rate and are uncapped. None of these
positions with unrealized losses are considered credit impaired,
and all are expected to mature at par.

The average maturity of our investment portfolio at
December 31, 2020 was 2.09 years compared to 2.11
years at December 31,
2019.
Balances of U.S. Treasuries,
GNMA securities, and municipal bonds declined compared
to the prior year, and were
partially offset by increases in SBA securities.
The average life of our investment portfolio declined
slightly as the balance of the
overall portfolio declined, with the existing portfolio rolling
down the curve. See Table
12 for a break-down of maturities by
investment type.
The weighted average taxable equivalent yield of our
investment portfolio at December 31, 2020 was 1.78% versus
2.23% in
2019.
This decrease in yield reflected lower reinvestment rates during
most of 2020. Our bond portfolio contained no investments
in obligations, other than U.S. Governments, of any state,
municipality, political
subdivision or any other issuer that exceeded
10% of our shareowners’ equity at December 31, 2020.

Deposits and Short Term
Borrowings
Average total
deposits for 2020 were $2.844 billion, an increase of $306.9
million, or 12.1%, over 2019.
Average deposits
increased $114.5 million, or 4.7%, from
2018 to 2019.
The increase in 2020 occurred in all deposit types except
certificates of
deposit, with the largest increases occurring
in noninterest bearing and savings accounts.
The increase in 2019 occurred in
noninterest bearing deposits, negotiated NOW accounts,
and savings accounts, partially offset by declines
in money market
accounts and certificates of deposit.
Strong deposit growth occurred during the year reflecting
federal stimulus inflows as well as strong core deposit growth.
In
addition, the seasonal growth of public funds occurred
in the fourth quarter of 2020 and is expected to continue into
the first
quarter of 2021. Deposit levels remain strong as we continue to
see growth in our non-maturity deposits. Our mix of deposits
continues to improve as certificates of deposit are
replaced with noninterest bearing demand accounts.
We continue
to closely monitor several metrics such as the sensitivity of our
deposit rates, our overall liquidity position, and
competitor rates when pricing deposits. This strategy is consistent
with previous rate cycles, and allows us to manage
the mix of
our deposits rather than compete on rate. We
believe this enabled us to maintain a low cost of funds of
16 basis points for 2020
and 35 basis points for 2019.
Table 2 provides
an analysis of our average deposits, by category,
and average rates paid thereon for each of the last three years.
Table 13 reflects the
shift in our deposit mix over the last year and Table
14 provides a maturity distribution of time deposits in
denominations of $100,000 and over at December
31, 2020.
Average short
-term borrowings increased $59.8 million in 2020 due to the addition
of warehouse line borrowings of CCHL that
are used to support our held for sale loan portfolio.
See Note 11 in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional
information on short-term borrowings.
We continue
to focus on the value of our deposit franchise, which produces
a strong base of core deposits with minimal reliance
on wholesale funding.

Market Risk and Interest Rate Sensitivity
Overview.
Market risk arises from changes in interest rates, exchange
rates, commodity prices, and equity prices.
We have risk
management policies designed to monitor and limit exposure
to market risk and we do not participate in activities that give rise
to
significant market risk involving exchange rates, commodity
prices, or equity prices.
In asset and liability management activities,
our policies are designed to minimize structural intere
st rate risk.
Interest Rate Risk Management.
Our net income is largely dependent on net interest
income.
Net interest income is susceptible to
interest rate risk to the degree that interest-bearing
liabilities mature or reprice on a different basis than interest-earning
assets.
When interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice
more quickly than interest-earning assets in a given period, a
significant
increase in market rates of interest could adversely affect
net interest income.
Similarly, when interest
-earning assets mature or
reprice more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities, falling
market interest rates could result in a decrease in
net interest
income.
Net interest income is also affected by changes in the portion
of interest-earning assets that are funded by interest-
bearing liabilities rather than by other sources of
funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and shareowners’
equity.
We have established
what we believe to be a comprehensive interest rate risk
management policy,
which is administered by
management’s Asset Liability
Management Committee (“ALCO”).
The policy establishes limits of risk, which are quantitative
measures of the percentage change in net interest income
(a measure of net interest income at risk) and the fair value
of equity
capital (a measure of economic value of equity (“EVE”)
at risk) resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for
maturities from one day to 30 years.
We measure the
potential adverse impacts that changing interest rates may have on
our
short-term earnings, long-term value, and liquidity by
employing simulation analysis through the use of computer
modeling.
The
simulation model captures optionality factors such
as call features and interest rate caps and floors imbedded in investment
and
loan portfolio contracts.
As with any method of gauging interest rate risk, there are
certain shortcomings inherent in the interest
rate modeling methodology used by us.
When interest rates change, actual movements in different
categories of interest-earning
assets and interest-bearing liabilities, loan prepayments,
and withdrawals of time and other deposits, may deviate
significantly
from assumptions used in the model.
Finally, the methodology
does not measure or reflect the impact that higher rates may have
on adjustable-rate loan clients’ ability to service their debts,
or the impact of rate changes on demand for loan and
deposit
products.
The balance sheet is subject to testing for interest rate
shock possibilities to indicate the inherent interest rate risk.
We prepare a
current base case and several alternative interest rate simulations
(-100,+100, +200, +300, and +400 basis points (bp)), at least
once per quarter, and report the analysis
to ALCO, our Market Risk Oversight Committee (“MROC”), our
Enterprise Risk
Oversight Committee (“EROC”) and the Board of Directors.
(The -200bp rate scenario was not modeled starting in the second
half of 2019 due to the low interest rate environment below
2.00%). We
augment our interest rate shock analysis with alternative
interest rate scenarios on a quarterly basis that may include
ramps, parallel shifts, and a flattening or steepening of
the yield curve
(non-parallel shift).
In addition, more frequent forecasts may be produced when
interest rates are particularly uncertain or when
other business conditions so dictate.
Our goal is to structure the balance sheet so that net
interest earnings at risk over 12-month and 24-month periods
and the
economic value of equity at risk do not exceed policy
guidelines at the various interest rate shock levels. We
attempt to achieve
this goal by balancing, within policy limits, the volume
of floating-rate liabilities with a similar volume of floating-rate assets, by
keeping the average maturity of fixed-rate asset and liability contracts
reasonably matched, by managing the mix of our core
deposits, and by adjusting our rates to market conditions
on a continuing basis. At December 31, 2019, the instantaneous rate
shock of down 100 bp over 24-months was slightly outside
of desired parameters due to limited repricing of deposits relative
to
the decline in rates.
Analysis.
Measures of net interest income at risk produced by simulation
analysis are indicators of an institution’s
short-term
performance in alternative rate environments.
These measures are typically based upon a relatively brief
period, and do not
necessarily indicate the long-term prospects or economic
value of the institution.

The Net Interest Income (“NII”) at Risk position was more
favorable at December 31, 2020 compared to December
31, 2019 for
the 12-month shock for all rate scenarios. The year-over-year
favorable changes were primarily driven by growth in our
noninterest bearing deposits, which have a positive impact
on our NII. The model indicates that in the short-term,
all rising rate
environments will positively impact the net interest margin
of the Company,
while a declining rate environment of 100 bp will
have a negative impact on the net interest margin.
All measures of Net Interest Income at Risk are within
our prescribed policy limits over both the 12-month and 24-month periods,
with the exception of rates down 100 bp over 24-months.
We are slightly out
of compliance in this rates down 100 bp scenario as
we have a limited ability to lower our deposit rates the
full 100 bp relative to the decline in market rate.
In addition, this analysis
incorporates an instantaneous, parallel shock and assumes
we move with market rates and do not lag our deposit rates.
The measures of equity value at risk indicate our ongoing
economic value by considering the effects of changes
in interest rates
on all of our cash flows by discounting the cash flows
to estimate the present value of assets and liabilities. The difference
between these discounted values of the assets and liabilities is
the economic value of equity,
which in theory approximates the fair
value of our net assets.

At December 31, 2020,
the economic value of equity was more favorable in all up-rate scenarios
and is within prescribed
tolerance levels, but is less favorable and out of policy
in the down 100 basis point EVE scenario.
The year-over-year favorable
changes were primarily driven by growth in our
noninterest bearing deposits compared to the prior year.
EVE became less
favorable in rates down 100bp compared to the
prior year as we have limited ability to lower our deposit
rates relative to the
decline in market rates.
EVE output is extreme given the historically low rate environment,
in conjunction with the high
overnight funds sold balance when compared to December
31, 2019.
Given the current interest rate environment and the
historically high levels of liquidity,
management is monitoring the EVE analysis in light of the economic
recovery, but has chosen
not to institute immediate balance sheet changes to address
the down 100 basis point scenario.
In an alternate EVE scenario
where the value of our nonmaturity deposits are capped
at their book value, we are within policy guidelines.
As the interest rate environment and the dynamics of the
economy continue to change, additional simulations will be analyzed
to
address not only the changing rate environment, but also
the changing balance sheet mix, measured over multiple
years, to help
assess the risk to the Company.
(1)
Down 200, 300 and 400 bp rate scenarios have been excluded
due to the current interest
rate environment.
(2)
For the rates down 100 bp scenario, the high negative
percentage change is due to a negative value
assigned to our
nonmaturity deposits.
Since we believe our nonmaturity deposits are
highly valued core franchise deposits,
we run an
alternate EVE calculation which caps the projected
value of our nonmaturity deposits at their book value.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL
RESOURCES
Liquidity
In general terms, liquidity is a measurement of our ability
to meet our cash needs.
Our objective in managing our liquidity is to
maintain our ability to fund loan commitments, purchase
securities, accommodate deposit withdrawals or repay other liabilities in
accordance with their terms, without an adverse impact
on our current or future earnings.
Our liquidity strategy is guided by
policies that are formulated and monitored by our
ALCO and senior management, and which take into account
the marketability
of assets, the sources and stability of funding and the level
of unfunded commitments.
We regularly evaluate
all of our various
funding sources with an emphasis on accessibility,
stability, reliability
and cost-effectiveness.
For 2020 and 2019, our principal
source of funding was client deposits, supplemented
by our short-term and long-term borrowings, primarily from our trust-
preferred securities, securities sold under repurchase agreements,
federal funds purchased and FHLB borrowings.
We believe that
the cash generated from operations, our borrowing capacity
and our access to capital resources are sufficient
to meet our future
operating capital and funding requirements.
At December 31, 2020, we had the ability to generate
approximately $1.198 billion in additional liquidity through all of
our
available resources beyond our overnight funds sold
position.
In addition to the primary borrowing outlets mentioned above,
we
also have the ability to generate liquidity by borrowing
from the Federal Reserve Discount Window and
through brokered
deposits.
We recognize
the importance of maintaining liquidity and have developed a Contingent
Liquidity Plan, which addresses
various liquidity stress levels and our response and
action based on the level of severity.
We periodically
test our credit facilities
for access to the funds, but also understand that as the
severity of the liquidity level increases certain credit facilities may
no
longer be available.
We conduct quarterly
liquidity stress tests and the results are reported to ALCO, MROC, EROC and
the
Board of Directors.
We believe the
liquidity available to us is sufficient to meet our
ongoing needs.
We also view our
investment portfolio as a liquidity source and have the option
to pledge securities in our portfolio as collateral
for borrowings or deposits, and/or sell selected securities.
Our portfolio consists of debt issued by the U.S. Treasury,
U.S.
governmental agencies, and municipal governments.
The weighted-average maturity of our portfolio was 2.09
years at December
31, 2020 and had a net unrealized pre-tax gain of $3.7
million in the AFS portfolio.
Our average net overnight funds sold position (defined
as funds sold plus interest-bearing deposits with other banks less funds
purchased) was $465.7 million in 2020 compared to
an average net overnight funds sold position of $238.0 million
in 2019.
The
increase in this position in 2020 reflected strong deposit
growth, primarily related to government stimulus program
inflows
(primarily noninterest bearing deposits)
and runoff from the investment portfolio,
partially offset by higher growth in the loan
portfolio.
We expect
capital expenditures over the next 12 months to be approximately
$7.0 million, which will consist primarily of
technology purchases for banking offices,
business applications, and information technology security
needs as well as furniture
and fixtures and banking office remodels.
We expect that these capital
expenditures will be funded with existing resources
without impairing our ability to meet our ongoing obligations.
Long-Term
Borrowings
At December 31, 2020,
total advances from the FHLB consisted of $2.2 million
in outstanding debt comprised of seven notes.
In
2020,
the Bank made FHLB advance payments totaling $3.2 million.
One advance matured, and one was paid off, with no
new
fixed rate advances obtained in 2020. The FHLB notes are
collateralized by a blanket floating lien on all of our 1-4
family
residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate mortgage
loans, and home equity mortgage loans.
We have issued
two junior subordinated deferrable interest notes to wholly
owned Delaware statutory
trusts.
The first note for
$30.9 million was issued to CCBG Capital Trust
I in November 2004.
The second note for $32.0 million was issued to CCBG
Capital Trust II in May 2005.
During the second quarter of 2020 we entered into a
derivative cash flow hedge of our interest rate risk related to
our
subordinated debt.
The notional amount of the derivative is $30 million ($10
million of the CCBG Capital Trust I borrowing
and
$20 million of the CCBG Capital Trust II
borrowing).
The interest rate swap agreement requires CCBG to pay fixed and receive
variable (Libor plus spread) and has an average all-in
fixed rate of 2.50% for 10 years.
Additional detail on the interest rate swap
agreement is provided in Note 5 - Derivatives in the Consolidated
Financial Statements.
See Note 12 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information on long-term borrowings.

gain on
investment securities, net adjustments totaling $1.4
million related to transactions under our stock compensation
plans, stock
compensation accretion of $0.9 million, and a $0.4 million
increase in fair value of the interest rate swap related to subordinated
debt.
Shareowners’ equity was reduced by an $18.2 million increase in the
accumulated other comprehensive loss for our pension
plan, common stock dividends of $9.6 million ($0.57 per
share), a $3.1 million (net of tax) adjustment to retained earnings for
the
adoption of CECL, reclassification of $9.4 million to
temporary equity to increase the redemption value of the non-controlling
interest in CCHL, and share repurchases of $2.0 million
(99,952 shares).

We continue
to maintain a strong capital position.
The ratio of shareowners' equity to total assets at year-end was 8.45
%, 10.59%,
and 10.23%, in 2019, 2018, and 2018, respectively.
Further, our tangible common equity,
was 6.25% at December 31, 2020
compared to 8.06% at December 31, 2019, respectively.
The reduction in ratios in 2020 primarily reflected the significant growth
in assets during the year.
We are subject
to regulatory risk-based capital requirements that measure
capital relative to risk-weighted assets and off-balance
sheet financial instruments.
At December 31, 2020, our total risk-based capital ratio
was 17.30% compared to 17.90% at
December 31, 2019.
Our common equity tier 1 capital ratio was 13.71% and 14.47%,
respectively, on these dates.
Our leverage
ratio was 9.33% and 11.25%, respectively,
on these dates.
For a detailed discussion of our regulatory capital requirements,
refer
to the “Regulatory Considerations - Capital Regulations”
section on page 14.
See Note 17 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information as to our capital
adequacy.
At December 31, 2020,
our common stock had a book value of $19.05 per diluted share
compared to $19.40 at December 31,
2019.
Book value is impacted by the net unrealized gains and losses on
investment securities.
At December 31, 2020,
the net
unrealized gain was $2.7 million compared to $0.9
million at December 31, 2019.
Book value is also impacted by the recording
of our unfunded pension liability through other comprehensive
income in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification
Topic 715.
At December 31, 2020,
the net pension liability reflected in accumulated other comprehensive
loss was $47.3 million
compared to $29.0 million at December 31, 2019.
The unfavorable adjustment to our unfunded pension
liability was attributable
to the lower discount rate used to calculate the present
value of the pension obligation.
The lower discount rate reflected the
significant decline in long-term interest rates in 2020.
This adjustment also unfavorably impacted our tangible capital ratio.
Further, book value is impacted by
the periodic adjustment made to record temporary equity at redemption
value.
At December
31, 2020, $9.4 million had been reclassified from retained
earnings to temporary equity during 2020 to increase the redemption
value of the non-controlling interest in CCHL.
In February 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the
repurchase of up to 1,500,000 shares of our outstanding
common stock
over a five-year period.
Repurchases may be made in the open market or in privately
negotiated transactions; however,
we are
not obligated to repurchase any specified number of shares.
In January, 2019, the
2014 plan was terminated and our Board of
Directors approved a new share repurchase plan that
authorizes the repurchase of up to 750,000 shares of our outstanding
common stock over a five-year period.
Terms of this plan
are substantially similar to the 2014 plan.
99,952 shares were
repurchased in 2020 at an average price of $20.39 and 77,000
shares were repurchased in 2019 at an average price of $23.40.
Since 2014, a total of 1,361,682 shares of our outstanding
common stock have been repurchased at an average price of
$17.93
under our stock repurchase plans.
Dividends
Adequate capital and financial strength is paramount
to our stability and the stability of our subsidiary bank.
Cash dividends
declared and paid should not place unnecessary strain
on our capital levels.
When determining the level of dividends the
following factors are considered:
●
Compliance with state and federal laws and regulations;
●
Our capital position and our ability to meet our financial obligations;
●
Projected earnings and asset levels; and
●
The ability of the Bank and us to fund dividends.
Inflation
The impact of inflation on the banking industry differs
significantly from that of other industries in which a large
portion of total
resources are invested in fixed assets such as property,
plant and equipment.
Assets and liabilities of financial institutions are
virtually all monetary in nature, and therefore are primarily
impacted by interest rates rather than changing prices.
While the
general level of inflation underlies most interest rates, interest rates
react more to changes in the expected rate of inflation
and to
changes in monetary and fiscal policy.
Net interest income and the interest rate spread are good measures
of our ability to react to
changing interest rates and are discussed in further detail
in the section entitled “Results of Operations.”
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
We are a party
to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risks in the
normal course of business to meet the financing needs
of our clients.
See Note 19 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
At December 31, 2020,
we had $756.9 million in commitments to extend credit and $6.5 million
in standby letters of credit.
Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend
to a client so long as there is no violation of any condition established in
the
contract.
Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other
termination clauses and may require payment of a fee.
Since many of the commitments may expire without being
drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily
represent future cash requirements.
The increase in commitments to extend credit in 2020 reflected
the addition of interest rate
lock commitments for CCHL which are funded through
warehouse lines of credit.
Standby letters of credit are conditional
commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of
a client to a third party.
We use the same credit
policies in
establishing commitments and issuing letters of credit
as we do for on-balance sheet instruments.
If commitments arising from these financial instruments
continue to require funding at historical levels, management does not
anticipate that such funding will adversely impact our ability to
meet on-going obligations.
In the event these commitments
require funding in excess of historical levels, management
believes current liquidity,
investment security maturities, available
advances from the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank, and
warehouse lines of credit provide a sufficient source
of funds to meet
these commitments.
In conjunction with the sale and securitization of loans
held for sale and their related servicing rights, we may be
exposed to
liability resulting from recourse, repurchase and
make-whole agreements.
If it is determined subsequent to our sale of a loan or
its related servicing rights that a breach of the representatio
ns or warranties made in the applicable sale agreement
has occurred,
which may include guarantees that prepayments will not
occur within a specified and customary time frame, we
may have an
obligation to either (a) repurchase the loan for the unpaid
principal balance, accrued interest and related advances,
(b) indemnify
the purchaser against any loss it suffers or
(c) make the purchaser whole for the economic benefits of the
loan and its related
servicing rights.
Our repurchase, indemnification and make-whole obligations vary
based upon the terms of the applicable agreements, the nature
of the asserted breach and the status of the mortgage
loan at the time a claim is made. We
establish reserves for estimated losses
of this nature inherent in the origination of mortgage loans by
estimating the losses inherent in the population of all loans sold
based on trends in claims and actual loss severities experienced.
The reserve will include accruals for probable contingent losses
in addition to those identified in the pipeline of claims received.
The estimation process is designed to include amounts based on
actual losses experienced from actual activity.
FOURTH QUARTER,
2020 FINANCIAL RESULTS
Results of Operations
We realized net
income of $7.7 million, or $0.46 per diluted share for the fourth
quarter of 2020 compared to $10.4 million, or
$0.62 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2020.
The decrease in earnings reflected a $4.5 million decrease in
noninterest
income, a $1.0 million increase in noninterest expense,
and a $0.1 million
decrease in net interest income, partially offset by a
$2.6
million decrease in the non-controlling interest in earnings
from CCHL, and lower income taxes of $0.3 million.
Tax-equivalent
net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $25.1
million compared to $25.2 million for the third quarter
of 2020.
The decrease reflected lower rates earned on investment securities and
variable/adjustable rate loans.
Our net interest
margin for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 3.00%,
a decrease of 12 basis points from the third quarter of 2020.
Our net interest margin for the fourth quarter
of 2020 was 3.00%, a decrease of 12 basis points from
the third quarter of 2020
driven by a higher level of overnight funds reflective of
seasonal public fund inflows and continued growth in core deposits.
Our
net interest margin for the fourth quarter of 2020,
excluding the impact of overnight funds in excess of $200 million,
was 3.50%.
The provision for credit losses was $1.3 million
for both the third and fourth quarters of 2020.
The provision for the fourth
quarter reflected a slight build in additional reserves held
for COVID-19 exposure.
Noninterest income for the fourth quarter of 2020
totaled $30.5 million compared to $35.0 million for the third quarter
of 2020
with the decrease attributable to lower mortgage
banking revenues of $5.3 million, partially offset by
higher deposit activity fees
of $0.5 million and wealth management fees of $0.3
million.
The decline in mortgage banking revenues reflected a seasonal
slowdown in loan production and a lower gain on sale margin.
Noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2020
totaled $41.3 million compared to $40.3 million for the third quarter
of 2020
with the increase primarily attributable to higher compensation
expense of $0.6 million and other real estate expense of $0.3
million.
The increase in compensation reflected higher commission expense
of $0.2 million, salary expense of $0.2 million, and
cash incentive expense of $0.2 million.
Valuation
adjustments totaling $0.5 million for two properties drove the increase
in other
real estate expense.
In addition, we recognized $0.4 million in expenses during
the fourth quarter of 2020 related to additional
funding of our foundation and consulting/legal costs for
a strategic initiative.
We realized income
tax expense of $2.8 million (effective rate of 22%)
for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $3.2 million
(effective rate of 17%) for the third quarter
of 2020.
Tax expense for
the fourth quarter of 2020 was unfavorably impacted by a
$0.3 million discrete tax expense.
Discussion of Financial Condition
Average earning
assets were $3.337 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020, an
increase of $113.6 million, or 3.5%, over the third
quarter of 2020 attributable to a higher level of
deposits primarily seasonal public fund inflows and growth
in core deposits.
Average loans
HFI decreased $11.7 million, or 0.6%, from
the third quarter of 2020,
partially due to SBA PPP loan pay-offs.
Period-end HFI loans increased $8.3 million, or 0.4%, over
the third quarter of 2020 and reflected higher home equity,
construction, and residential loan balances.
At December 31, 2020, SBA PPP loans of $150,000 or less totaled
$69 million.
SBA
PPP loan fees totaled approximately $0.8 million for the
fourth quarter of 2020 and $0.6 million for the third
quarter of 2020.
At
December 31, 2020 we had $3.2 million (net) in deferred
SBA PPP loan fees.
Nonperforming assets (nonaccrual loans and OREO) totaled
$6.7 million at December 31, 2020, comparable
to September 30,
2020.
Nonaccrual loans totaled $5.9 million at December 31, 2020, a
$0.4 million increase over September 30, 2020.
The
balance of OREO totaled $0.8 million at December
31, 2020, a decrease of $0.4 million from September 30,
2020.
We continue
to analyze our loan portfolio for segments that have been affected
by the stressed economic and business conditions
caused by the pandemic.
To assist our clients, in
mid-March of 2020, we began allowing short term 60 to 90
day loan extensions
for affected borrowers.
We have extended
loans totaling $333 million of which 75% were for commercial borrowers
and 25%
were for consumer borrowers.
At December 31, 2020, approximately $324 million,
or 97% of the loan balances associated with
these borrowers have resumed making regularly scheduled
payments compared to $285 million, or 88% of the loan
balances at
September 30, 2020.
Average total
deposits were $3.066 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020, an
increase of $94.9 million, or 3.2%, over the third
quarter of 2020 and reflected growth in core deposits of
$64.9 million and higher public fund balances of $30 million.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Critical Accounting Policies
The consolidated financial statements and accompanying
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in
accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America, which require us to make various estimates and
assumptions (see Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements).
We believe that,
of our significant accounting
policies, the following may involve a higher degree of
judgment and complexity.
Allowance for Credit Losses
.
The amount of the allowance for credit losses represents
management's best estimate of current
expected credit losses considering available information,
from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing exposure
to
credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument.
Relevant available information includes historical credit
loss experience,
current conditions,
and reasonable and supportable forecasts.
While historical credit loss experience
provides
the basis for the
estimation of expected credit losses, adjustments to historical
loss information may be made for changes in loan risk
grades, loss
experience trends, loan prepayment trends, differences
in current portfolio-specific risk characteristics, environmental
conditions,
future expectations, or other relevant factors.
While management utilizes its best judgment and information available,
the
ultimate adequacy of our allowance accounts is dependent
upon a variety of factors beyond our control, including the
performance of our portfolios, the economy,
changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward
classification of assets.
Goodwill
.
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over
the fair market value of their identifiable net
assets.
We perform
an impairment review on an annual basis or more frequently
if events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Adverse changes in the economic environment, declining operations,
or other
factors could result in a decline in the estimated implied
fair value of goodwill.
If the estimated implied fair value of goodwill is
less than the carrying amount, a loss would be recognized
to reduce the carrying amount to the estimated implied fair
value.
We evaluate
goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and in 2017
adopted ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other
(Topic 350):
Simplifying Accounting for Goodwill Impairment which allows for
a qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment
indicators.
If the assessment indicates that impairment has more than likely
occurred, the Company must compare the estimated
fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount.
If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair
value,
an impairment charge is recorded equal to
the excess.
During the fourth quarter, we
performed our annual impairment testing.
We proceeded
with qualitative assessment by evaluating
impairment indicators and concluded there were none
that indicated that goodwill impairment had occurred.
Pension Assumptions
.
We have a defined
benefit pension plan for the benefit of substantially all of our associates.
Our funding
policy with respect to the pension plan is to contribute,
at a minimum, amounts sufficient to meet minimum
funding requirements
as set by law.
Pension expense is determined by an external actuarial valuation
based on assumptions that are evaluated annually
as of December 31, the measurement date for the pension
obligation.
The service cost component of pension expense is reflected
as “Compensation Expense” in the Consolidated Statements
of Income.
All other components of pension expense are reflected as
“Other Expense”.
The Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition
reflect an accrued pension benefit cost due to funding levels
and
unrecognized actuarial amounts.
The most significant assumptions used in calculating
the pension obligation are the weighted-
average discount rate used to determine the present value
of the pension obligation, the weighted-average expected
long-term rate
of return on plan assets, and the assumed rate of
annual compensation increases.
These assumptions are re-evaluated annually
with the external actuaries, taking into consideration both
current market conditions and anticipated long-term market conditions.
The discount rate is determined by matching the anticipated
defined pension plan cash flows to the spot rates of
a corporate Aa-
rated bond index/yield curve and solving for the single
equivalent discount rate which would produce the same present
value.
This methodology is applied consistently from year-to-year.
The discount rate utilized in 2020 was 3.53%.
The estimated impact
to 2020 pension expense of a 25 basis point increase or
decrease in the discount rate would have been a decrease and increase of
approximately $934,000 and $907,000,
respectively.
We anticipate using
a 2.88%
discount rate in 2021.
Based on the balances at the December 31, 2020
measurement date, the estimated impact in accumulated other
comprehensive
income of a 25 basis point increase or decrease in
the discount rate is a decrease or increase of approximately $6.6
million (after-
tax).
The weighted-average expected long-term rate of return
on plan assets is determined based on the current
and anticipated future
mix of assets in the plan.
The assets currently consist of equity securities, U.S. Government
and Government agency debt
securities, and other securities (typically temporary liquid
funds awaiting investment).
The weighted-average expected long-term
rate of return on plan assets utilized for 2020 was 7.00%.
The estimated impact to 2020 pension expense of a 25 basis point
increase or decrease in the rate of return would have been
an approximate $393,000 increase or decrease, respectively.
We
anticipate using a rate of return on plan assets of 6.75% for
2021.
The assumed rate of annual compensation increases of
4.00%
in 2020 reflected expected trends in salaries and the
employee
base.
We anticipate using
a compensation increase of 4.00% for 2021 reflecting current
market trends.
Detailed information on the pension plan, the actuarially
determined disclosures, and the assumptions used are
provided in Note
13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Income Taxes
.
Income tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due
or refundable and the change in deferred tax
assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future
tax amounts for the temporary differences between
carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, computed
using enacted tax rates.
A valuation allowance, if needed,
reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is “more
likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in a
tax
examination, with a tax examination being presumed
to occur.
The amount recognized is the largest amount of
tax benefit that is
greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination.
For tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not” test,
no tax
benefit is recorded.
We recognize
interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in other
expenses.
