Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
GENERAL
The following discussion and analysis by management focuses on those factors that, in management's view, had a material effect on the consolidated financial position of Union Bankshares, Inc. ("the Company," "our," "we," "us") and its subsidiary, Union Bank ("Union"), as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and its consolidated results of operations for the years then ended. The Company is considered a "smaller reporting company" under the disclosure rules of the SEC. Accordingly, the Company has elected to provide its audited statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in stockholders' equity for a two year, rather than a three year, period and intends to provide smaller reporting company scaled disclosures where management deems appropriate.
This discussion is being presented to provide a narrative explanation of the consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes and with other financial data contained in Item 8, Part II of this Annual Report. The purpose of this presentation is to enhance overall financial disclosures and to provide information about historical financial performance and developing trends as a means to assess to what extent past performance can be used to evaluate the prospects for future performance. Management is not aware of the occurrence of any events after December 31, 2020 which would materially affect the information presented.
CERTAIN DEFINITIONS
Capitalized terms used in the following discussion and not otherwise defined below have the meanings assigned to them in Note 1 to the Company's audited consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, item 8, page 53 of this Annual Report.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
The following discussion contains certain non-GAAP financial measures in addition to results presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures are intended to provide the reader with additional supplemental perspectives on operating results, performance trends, and financial condition. Non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for GAAP measures; they should be read and used in conjunction with the Company’s GAAP financial information. The Company’s non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP information which may be presented by other companies. In all cases, it should be understood that non-GAAP operating measures do not depict amounts that accrue directly to the benefit of shareholders. An item that management excludes when computing non-GAAP adjusted earnings can be of substantial importance to the Company’s results and condition for any particular year. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures is provided below.
The SEC has exempted from the definition of non-GAAP financial measures certain commonly used financial measures that are not based on GAAP. However, two non-GAAP financial measures commonly used by financial institutions, namely tax-equivalent net interest income and tax-equivalent net interest margin (as presented in the tables in the section labeled Yields Earned and Rates Paid), have not been specifically exempted by the SEC, and may therefore constitute non-GAAP financial measures under Regulation G. We are unable to state with certainty whether the SEC would regard those measures as subject to Regulation G. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and facilitate comparisons with the performance of other financial institutions. However, that information should be considered supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Company has established various accounting policies which govern the application of GAAP in the preparation of the Company's financial statements. Certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management which have a material impact on the reported amount of assets, liabilities, capital, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company's critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require management to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates on matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, management has identified the accounting policies and judgments most critical to the Company. The judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors, which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Nevertheless, because the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management is inherently subject to a degree of uncertainty, actual results could differ from estimates and have a material impact on the carrying value of assets, liabilities, capital, or the results of operations of the Company.
Allowance for loan losses
The Company believes the ALL is a critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. The amount of the ALL is based on management's periodic evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio, including the nature, volume and risk characteristics of the portfolio, credit concentrations, trends in historical loss experience, estimated value of any underlying collateral, specific impaired loans and economic conditions. Changes in these qualitative factors may cause management's estimate of the ALL to increase or decrease and result in adjustments to the Company's provision for loan losses in future periods. For additional information, see FINANCIAL CONDITION- Allowance for Loan Losses and Credit Quality below.
Other than temporary impairment of securities
The OTTI decision is a critical accounting policy for the Company. Accounting guidance requires a company to perform periodic reviews of individual debt securities in its investment portfolio to determine whether a decline in the value of a security is OTT. A review of OTTI requires management to make certain judgments regarding the cause and materiality of the decline, its effect on the financial statements and the probability, extent and timing of a valuation recovery, the Company's intent and ability to continue to hold the security, and, with respect to debt securities, the likelihood that the Company will have to sell the security before its value recovers. Pursuant to these requirements, management assesses valuation declines to determine the extent to which such changes are attributable to (1) fundamental factors specific to the issuer, such as the nature of the issuer and its financial condition, business prospects or other issuer-specific factors or (2) market-related factors, such as interest rates or equity market declines. Declines in the fair value of debt securities below their costs that are deemed by management to be OTT are recorded in earnings as realized losses to the extent they are deemed credit losses, with noncredit losses recorded in OCI (loss). Once an OTT loss on a debt security is realized, subsequent gains in the value of the security may not be recognized in income until the security is sold.
Mortgage servicing rights
MSRs associated with loans originated and sold, where servicing is retained, are required to be capitalized and initially recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and are subsequently accounted for using the “amortization method”. Mortgage servicing rights are amortized against non-interest income in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated future net servicing income of the underlying financial assets. The value of capitalized servicing rights represents the estimated present value of the future servicing fees arising from the right to service loans for third parties. The carrying value of the mortgage servicing rights is periodically reviewed for impairment based on a determination of estimated fair value compared to amortized cost, and impairment, if any, is recognized through a valuation allowance and is recorded as a reduction of non-interest income. Subsequent improvement (if any) in the estimated fair value of impaired mortgage servicing rights is reflected in a positive valuation adjustment and is recognized in non-interest income up to (but not in excess of) the amount of the prior impairment. Critical accounting policies for mortgage servicing rights relate to the initial valuation and subsequent impairment tests. The methodology used to determine the valuation of mortgage servicing rights requires the development and use of a number of estimates, including anticipated principal amortization and prepayments. Factors that may significantly affect the estimates used are changes in interest rates and the payment performance of the underlying loans. The Company analyzes and accounts for the value of its servicing rights with the assistance of a third party consultant.
Intangible assets
The Company's intangible assets include goodwill, which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in the 2011 Branch Acquisition, as well as a core deposit intangible related to the deposits acquired. The core deposit intangible is amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated average life of the acquired core deposit base of 10 years. The Company evaluates the valuation and amortization of the core deposit intangible if events occur that could result in possible impairment. With respect to goodwill, in accordance with current authoritative guidance, the Company assesses qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Company is less than its carrying amount, which could result in goodwill impairment.
Other
The Company also has other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions, that are significant to understanding the Company's financial condition and results of operations, including investment securities. The most significant accounting policies followed by the Company are presented in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements and in the section below under the caption “FINANCIAL CONDITION” and the subcaptions “Allowance for Loan Losses and Credit Quality” and ”Investment Activities”. Although management believes that its estimates, assumptions and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information available when such estimates, assumptions and judgments are made and can be impacted by future events and events outside the control of the Company. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions.
OVERVIEW
By most measures, 2020 has been a difficult year for our nation and the world at large. The low interest rate environment has continued to pressure the Company's net interest spread, but also has precipitated a surge in residential refinances and increased the already strong real estate purchase market fueled by increased migration into the market areas served by the Company. Despite the economic disruption caused by the pandemic, many segments of the economy have survived allowing us to be cautiously optimistic for the future. The financial results for the Company are better than expected given the pandemic, which could not have been accomplished without a strong team of dedicated professionals.
On March 3, 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) reduced the target federal funds rate by 50 basis points to a range of 1.00% to 1.25%. This rate was further reduced to a target range of 0% to 0.25% on March 16, 2020. Recent FOMC meetings indicate this low target range will remain in effect until members of the FOMC are confident the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals, which may not be until late in 2021 or beyond. Prolonged reductions in interest rates and other effects of the COVID-19 outbreak may continue to adversely affect the Company’s net interest income.
The Company's consolidated net income was $12.8 million, or $2.86 per share, for 2020 compared to $10.6 million, or $2.38 per share for 2019. The increase in net income reflects the combined effect of increases in net interest income of $1.3 million or 4.4%, and in noninterest income of $5.5 million, or 53.1%, partially offset by increases in noninterest expenses of $2.7 million, or 9.9%, the provision for loan losses of $1.4 million, or 183.9%, and the provision for income taxes of $589 thousand, or 32.2%.
Union originated $69.8 million in PPP loans as of December 31, 2020 to assist customers during the economic disruption caused by COVID-19. PPP loans in the amount of $3.6 million had been forgiven as of December 31, 2020. Interest income and origination fees from PPP loans were $481 thousand and $953 thousand, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Additionally, sales of qualifying residential loans to the secondary market for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $263.1 million resulting in gain on sales of $8.2 million, compared to sales of $158.0 million and gain on sales of $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increased volume of loan sales reflects an increase in residential mortgage financing activity likely due to the drop in interest rates.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had total consolidated assets of $1.1 billion, an increase of 25.3% compared to December 31, 2019. Net loans and loans held for sale increased $122.3 million or 18.2%, to $794.9 million, or 72.7% of total assets, at December 31, 2020, compared to $672.6 million, or 77.1% of total assets, at December 31, 2019.
The Company's primary source of funding, customer deposits, increased $250.3 million, or 33.6%, to reach $994.3 million at December 31, 2020. The increase was attributable to proceeds from PPP loans deposited into customer accounts at Union, customers' receipt of government stimulus payments, and the general lack of spending due to the economic disruption caused by COVID-19.
The Company's total capital increased from $71.8 million at December 31, 2019 to $80.9 million at December 31, 2020. This increase reflects net income of $12.8 million for 2020, less regular cash dividends paid of $5.7 million, and a $1.7 million increase in accumulated OCI resulting primarily from increases in the fair market value of the Company's investment portfolio. (See Capital Resources on page 44.)
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
For the year ended December 31, 2020, net income was $12.8 million compared to $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The primary components of these results, which include net interest income, provision for loan losses, noninterest income, noninterest expenses, and provision for income taxes, are discussed below:
Net Interest Income. The largest component of the Company’s operating income is net interest income, which is the difference between interest and dividend income received from interest earning assets and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities. Net interest income is affected by various factors, including but not limited to: changes in interest rates, loan and deposit pricing strategies, the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, and the level of nonperforming assets. The net interest margin is calculated as net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis as a percentage of average interest earning assets.
Net interest income was $31.6 million on a fully tax equivalent basis for 2020, compared to $30.3 million for 2019, an increase of $1.3 million, or 4.4%. The net interest spread decreased 45 bps to 3.40% for the year ended December 31, 2020, from 3.85% for the year ended December 31, 2019, reflecting the net effect of the 18 bps decrease in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities and the 63 bps decrease in the average yield earned on interest earning assets between periods. The net
interest margin decreased 47 bps to 3.57% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 4.04% for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The average yield on average earning assets was 4.14% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 4.77% for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of 63 bps despite an increase in average earning assets of $135.9 million. Interest income on investment securities decreased $169 thousand year over year due to a decrease of 38 bps in the average yield even though an increase in average balances of $6.4 million occurred between the comparison periods. Interest income on loans increased $1.2 million between comparison periods due to an increase in the average volume of loans outstanding of $96.8 million, despite a decrease in the average yield of 50 bps. The current interest rate environment and competition for quality loans continues to put downward pressure on loan yields. The decrease in the average yield between the comparison periods also reflects the lower yield on the PPP loans originated during the second quarter of 2020. The average balance of PPP loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $48.3 million with an average yield of 2.97%, which takes into account the interest income and origination fees earned on the loans in addition to the mandated 1.0% annual interest rate.
The average cost of funding, which is tied primarily to our customer deposits, decreased 18 bps to 0.74% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 0.92% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Interest expense decreased $453 thousand to $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower rates paid on interest bearing liabilities, partially offset by an increase in average balances of $87.6 million between periods. Management expects further reduction in the average cost of funds in future periods due to lowering of interest rates on time deposit and savings account products, and has no plans at this time to offer any time deposit specials. Interest expense on borrowed funds decreased $504 thousand year over year due to a decrease in the average balance of borrowed funds of $15.3 million, or 38.8%, and a decrease in the average rate paid of 68 bps, to 1.52%, for the year ended December 31, 2020. See the following tables for details.
The following table shows for the periods indicated the total amount of tax equivalent interest income from average interest earning assets, the related average tax equivalent yields, the tax equivalent interest expense associated with average interest bearing liabilities, the related tax equivalent average rates paid, and the resulting tax equivalent net interest spread and margin:

Provision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses was $2.2 million and $775 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in the provision resulted from management's adjustment to the economic qualitative factors utilized to estimate the allowance for loan losses due to the economic disruption related to the COVID-19 pandemic impacting Union's borrowers. The provision for 2020 was deemed appropriate by management based on the size and mix of the loan portfolio, the level of nonperforming loans, the results of the qualitative factor review and prevailing economic conditions. For further details, see FINANCIAL CONDITION Asset Quality and Allowance for Loan Losses below.

Total noninterest income $ 16,003 $ 10,455 $ 5,548 53.1
The significant changes in noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 are described below:
•Service fees. The Company's service fee income has been reduced as customers have managed account balances due to receipt of government stimulus money and general lack of spending opportunities due to the economic disruption caused by COVID-19. Service fees decreased $184 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to reductions in service charge and overdraft fee income on customer accounts of $316 thousand and a decrease of $48 thousand in other fee income. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in loan servicing fees of $93 thousand due to the increase in our serviced loan portfolio from $579.9 million at December 31, 2019 to $629.5 million at December 31, 2020, or an increase of 8.5%, and an increase of $86 thousand in ATM network income.
•Net gains on sales of loans held for sale. Continuing the Company's strategy to mitigate long-term interest rate risk, residential and commercial loans totaling $263.2 million were sold to the secondary market during 2020, versus residential and commercial loan sales of $158.3 million during 2019. The increase in net gains on sales of real estate loans reflects both an increase in the volume of sold loans and higher premiums on those sales.
•Net gain on other investments. Participants in the 2020 Amended and Restated Executive Nonqualified Excess Plan elect to defer receipt of current compensation from the Company or its subsidiary and select designated reference investments consisting of investment funds. The performance of those funds, over which the Company has no control, resulted in net gains of $240 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to net gains of $132 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019.
•Income from mortgage servicing. Income from mortgage servicing rights is derived from servicing rights acquired through the sale of loans where servicing is retained. Capitalized servicing rights are initially recorded at fair value and amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, the future estimate of servicing the underlying mortgages. The increase in the volume of sales of residential loans as discussed above resulted in increased income from mortgage servicing rights for 2020 compared to 2019.
•Income from Company-owned life insurance. The Company purchased $3.0 million of company owned life insurance covering select officers of Union during the third quarter of 2019, resulting in increased income for the year ended December 31, 2020.
•Other income. Other income for 2019 included $131 thousand in prepayment penalties from the early payoff of commercial loans and $50 thousand related to oil and gas income, which were not repeated in 2020.
Noninterest Expense. The following table sets forth the components of noninterest expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
For The Years Ended December 31,

Other expenses 4,358 4,281 77 1.8
Total noninterest expense $ 30,182 $ 27,472 $ 2,710 9.9
The significant changes in noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 are described below:
•Salaries and wages. The $1.4 million increase in salaries and wages was due to increases in commissions earned by mortgage loan originators, annual salary adjustments, and an increase in accrual amounts for the annual incentive plan payments to select officers of Union. Additionally, a one-time holiday gift was paid to all full and part-time employees totaling $192 thousand and a one-time payout of unused employee earned time off of $142 thousand occurred during 2020. Salaries and wages are reduced by deferred loan origination costs at the time of origination. Deferred loan origination costs reduced salaries and wages by $430 thousand at December 31, 2020 compared to $109 thousand at December 31, 2019. The increased deferred loan origination costs in 2020 was primarily attributable to the origination of PPP loans.
•Employee benefits. Employee benefit expense increased $370 thousand due to increases of $100 thousand in payroll taxes, $153 thousand in 401k plan contributions and $128 thousand in employee benefits related to the Company's deferred compensation plans, partially offset by a decrease in the cost of group health insurance of $12 thousand.
•Occupancy expense, net. In May 2020, the Company moved forward with the planned closure of two full service branches. These closures were not a result of COVID-19. One of the branch closures was a leased property with respect to which a loss on the disposal of leasehold improvements of $34 thousand was recorded during 2020. Property tax expense increased $21 thousand primarily due to the two new full service branches that opened in 2019. These increases were offset by reductions of $37 thousand in lease expense and $21 thousand in utilities.
•Equipment expense. Equipment expense increased by $582 thousand primarily due to increases of $333 thousand in depreciation expense, $172 thousand in software license and maintenance costs, $96 thousand in equipment rental and service contracts, partially offset by a decrease of $19 thousand in equipment repairs and operation expense.
•Other loan related expenses. Other loan related expenses consist of other costs incurred for originating and servicing loans such as insurance and property tax tracking expenses, credit report fees and other real estate closing costs. These expenses increased in 2020 compared to 2019 due to the increase in loan volumes throughout the Company's market areas.
•Vermont franchise taxes. The Vermont franchise tax is determined based on a quarterly tax rate applied to the Company's average balance of Vermont customer deposit balances. The tax rate remained unchanged throughout 2020 and 2019; however, the average balances in Vermont deposit accounts increased for the year ended December 31, 2020, resulting in an increase in expense.
•FDIC insurance assessment. Union was awarded a one-time assessment credit of $179 thousand by the FDIC to offset the deposit insurance assessment, which was utilized during 2019.
•Professional fees. During 2020, additional consultants were engaged to assist with employment searches and other advisory services that were not utilized in 2019, resulting in a $73 thousand increase between periods.
•Supplies and printing. Supplies and printing expense decreased $58 thousand primarily due to the economic disruption caused by COVID-19. Branch lobbies were closed to customers for approximately three months during 2020 and several employees were working remotely, resulting in less demand for operational supplies.
•Donations. As part of the Company's commitment to continually help to enhance the economic vitality and social welfare of our communities, charitable donations for 2020 increased $82 thousand compared to 2019.
•Training and development. Due to the economic disruption caused by COVID-19, training and development expenses have decreased during 2020 as the majority of in-person training opportunities were replaced with virtual options offered at lower costs.
•Travel and entertainment. Travel and entertainment expenses decreased primarily due to the economic disruption caused by COVID-19. The Company suspended business travel and intercompany travel between locations for the majority of the second quarter of 2020 and thereafter limited employee travel only for essential purposes.
•Other expenses. Other expenses increased $77 thousand during 2020 primarily due to prepayment penalties on the early payoff of FHLB advances of $66 thousand and increases of $40 thousand in electronic banking expenses and $29 thousand in new ICS account fees. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $34 thousand in postage expense and $21 thousand in losses on deposit accounts. The remaining variances between the comparison periods was comprised of changes in various other expense categories.
Provision for Income Taxes. The Company has provided for current and deferred federal income taxes for the current and prior periods presented. The Company's net provision for income taxes was $2.4 million for 2020 and $1.8 million for 2019. The Company’s effective federal corporate income tax rate was 15.5% and 14.4% for 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Amortization expense related to limited partnership investments included as a component of tax expense amounted to $935 thousand and $745 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These investments provide tax benefits, including tax credits. Low income housing tax credits with respect to limited partnership investments are also included as a component of income tax expense and amounted to $987 thousand and $803 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. See Note 11 to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
At December 31, 2020, the Company had total consolidated assets of $1.1 billion, including gross loans and loans held for sale (total loans) of $803.4 million, deposits of $994.3 million and stockholders' equity of $80.9 million. The Company’s total assets increased $220.6 million, or 25.3%, from $872.9 million at December 31, 2019.
Net loans and loans held for sale increased $122.3 million, or 18.2%, to $794.9 million, or 72.7% of total assets, at December 31, 2020, compared to $672.6 million, or 77.1% of total assets, at December 31, 2019. (See Loan Portfolio below.)
Total deposits increased $250.3 million, or 33.6% to $994.3 million at December 31, 2020, from $744.0 million at December 31, 2019. There were increases in interest bearing deposits of $178.4 million, or 38.9%, and noninterest bearing deposits of $78.8 million, or 57.8%, which were partially offset by a decrease in time deposits of $7.0 million, or 4.7%. (See average balances and rates in the Yields Earned and Rates Paid table on page 29.)
Total borrowed funds decreased $40.0 million, or 84.8%, from $47.2 million at December 31, 2019 to $7.2 million at December 31, 2020. (See Borrowings on page 42.)
Total stockholders’ equity increased $9.0 million, or 12.6%, from $71.8 million at December 31, 2019 to $80.9 million at December 31, 2020. (See Capital Resources on page 44.)
Loan Portfolio. The Company's gross loan portfolio (including loans held for sale) increased $125.7 million, or 18.5%, to $803.4 million, representing 73.5% of assets at December 31, 2020, from $677.7 million, representing 77.6% of assets at December 31, 2019. The Company's loans consist primarily of adjustable-rate and fixed-rate mortgage loans secured by one-to-four family, multi-family residential or commercial real estate. Real estate secured loans represented $593.4 million, or 73.9% of total loans, at December 31, 2020 compared to $559.1 million, or 82.5% of total loans, at December 31, 2019. The Company had 679 PPP loans totaling $66.2 million classified as commercial loans as of December 31, 2020. Changes in the composition of the Company's loan portfolio from December 31, 2019 (see table below) resulted from the increase in the commercial portfolio related to PPP loan originations, an increase in the volume of residential loans originated for sale to the secondary
market, a decrease in the outstanding balance of construction loans and an increase in the municipal portfolio. There was no material change in the Company's lending programs or terms during 2020, other than its participation in the PPP.
The composition of the Company's loan portfolio at year-end for each of the last five years was as follows:
2020 2019 2018 2017 2016

The Company originates and sells qualified residential mortgage loans in various secondary market avenues, with a majority of sales made to the FHLMC/Freddie Mac, generally with servicing rights retained. At December 31, 2020, the Company serviced an $819.6 million residential real estate mortgage portfolio, of which $32.2 million was held for sale and approximately $604.2 million was serviced for unaffiliated third parties. This compares to a residential real estate mortgage servicing portfolio of $754.7 million at December 31, 2019, of which $7.4 million was held for sale and approximately $555.1 million was serviced for unaffiliated third parties. Loans held for sale are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value and are reviewed by management at least quarterly based on current market pricing.
The Company sold $263.1 million of qualified residential real estate loans originated during 2020 to the secondary market to mitigate long-term interest rate risk and to generate fee income, compared to sales of $158.0 million during 2019. Residential mortgage loan origination activity was strong during 2020, reflecting the low interest rate environment resulting from the FOMC target rate reductions beginning in March in response to the COVID-19 emergency. The Company originates and sells FHA, VA, and RD residential mortgage loans, and also has an Unconditional Direct Endorsement Approval from HUD which allows the Company to approve FHA loans originated in any of its Vermont or New Hampshire locations without needing prior HUD underwriting approval. The Company sells FHA, VA and RD loans as originated with servicing released. Some of the government backed loans qualify for zero down payments without geographic or income restrictions. These loan products increase the Company's ability to serve the borrowing needs of residents in the communities served, including low and moderate income borrowers, while the government guaranty mitigates the Company's exposure to credit risk.
The Company also originates commercial real estate and commercial loans under various SBA, USDA and State sponsored programs which provide a government agency guaranty for a portion of the loan amount. There was $70.2 million and $4.0 million guaranteed under these various programs at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, on aggregate balances of $71.5 million and $5.1 million in subject loans for the same time periods. The December 31, 2020 amounts include the $66.2 million of PPP loans that are guaranteed 100% by SBA. The Company occasionally sells the guaranteed portion of a loan to other financial concerns and retains servicing rights, which generates fee income. There were $131 thousand and $315 thousand in commercial real estate or commercial loans sold during 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company recognizes gains and losses on the sale of the principal portion of these loans as they occur.
The Company serviced $25.2 million and $24.8 million of commercial and commercial real estate loans for unaffiliated third parties as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. This includes $23.7 million and $23.1 million of commercial or commercial real estate loans the Company had participated out to other financial institutions at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These loans were participated in the ordinary course of business on a nonrecourse basis, for liquidity or credit concentration management purposes.
As of December 31, 2020, total loans serviced had grown to $1.4 billion, which includes total loans on the balance sheet of $803.4 million as well as total loans sold with servicing retained of $629.5 million, compared to total loans serviced of $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2019.
The Company capitalizes MSRs for all loans sold with servicing retained and recognizes gains and losses on the sale of the principal portion of these loans as they occur. The unamortized balance of MSRs on loans sold with servicing retained was $2.3 million and $1.7 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, with an estimated market value in excess of the carrying value at both year ends. Management periodically evaluates and measures the servicing assets for impairment.
Qualifying residential first mortgage loans and certain commercial real estate loans with a carrying value of $210.0 million and $207.7 million were pledged as collateral for borrowings from the FHLB under a blanket lien at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Asset Quality. The Company, like all financial institutions, is exposed to certain credit risks, including those related to the value of the collateral that secures its loans and the ability of borrowers to repay their loans. Consistent application of the Company’s conservative loan policies has helped to mitigate this risk and has been prudent for both the Company and its customers. The Company's Board has set forth well-defined lending policies (which are periodically reviewed and revised as appropriate) that include conservative individual lending limits for officers, aggregate and advisory board approval levels, Board approval for large credit relationships, a quality control program, a loan review program and other limits or standards deemed necessary and prudent. The Company's loan review program encompasses a review process for loan documentation and underwriting for select loans as well as a monitoring process for credit extensions to assess the credit quality and degree of risk in the loan portfolio. Management performs, and shares with the Board, periodic concentration analyses based on various factors such as industries, collateral types, location, large credit sizes and officer portfolio loads. Board approved policies set forth portfolio diversification levels to mitigate concentration risk and the Company participates large credits out to other financial institutions to further mitigate that risk. The Company has established underwriting guidelines to be followed by its officers; material exceptions are required to be approved by a senior loan officer, the President or the Board.
The Company does not make loans that are interest only, have teaser rates or that result in negative amortization of the principal, except for construction, lines of credit and other short-term loans for either commercial or consumer purposes where the credit risk is evaluated on a borrower-by-borrower basis. The Company evaluates the borrower's ability to pay on variable-rate loans over a variety of interest rate scenarios, not only the rate at origination.
The majority of the Company's loan portfolio is secured by real estate located throughout the Company's primary market area of northern Vermont and New Hampshire. For residential loans, the Company generally does not lend more than 80% of the appraised value of the home without a government guaranty or the borrower purchasing private mortgage insurance. Although the Company lends up to 80% of the collateral value on commercial real estate loans to strong borrowers, the majority of commercial real estate loans do not exceed 75% of the appraised collateral value. Rarely, the loan to value may go up to 100% on loans with government guarantees or other mitigating circumstances. Although the Company's loan portfolio consists of
different business segments, there is a portion of the loan portfolio centered in tourism related loans. The Company has implemented risk management strategies to mitigate exposure to this industry through utilizing government guaranty programs as well as participations with other financial institutions as discussed above. Additionally, the loan portfolio contains many loans to seasoned and well established businesses and/or well secured loans which further reduce the Company's risk. Management closely follows the local and national economies and their impact on the local businesses, especially on the tourism industry, as part of the Company's risk management program.
As a result of the current economic environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous industries and individuals have and will continue to experience adverse impacts which may affect our borrowers’ ability to make their loan payments on a timely basis. The Company’s management is focused on the impact that the COVID-19 economic disruption is having on its borrowers and closely monitors industry and geographic concentrations, specifically the impact on the region's tourist and restaurant industries. As a result of the economic disruption including government mandated business shutdowns and curtailed re-openings, the nationwide unemployment rate was reported at 6.7% for December 2020 compared to 3.5% for December 2019. The Vermont unemployment rate was reported at 3.1% for December 2020 compared to 2.2% for December 2019 and the New Hampshire unemployment rate was 4.0% for December 2020 compared to 2.5% for December 2019. Management will continue to monitor the national, regional and local economic environment in relation to the COVID-19 crisis and its impact on unemployment, business outlook and real estate values in the Company’s market area.
The Company also monitors its delinquency levels for any adverse trends. Management closely monitors the Company’s loan and investment portfolios, OREO and OAO for potential problems and reports to the Boards of the Company and Union at regularly scheduled meetings. Repossessed assets and loans or investments that are 90 days or more past due or in nonaccrual status are considered to be nonperforming assets.
TDR loans involve one or more of the following: forgiving a portion of interest or principal, refinancing at a rate materially less than the market rate, rescheduling loan payments, or granting other concessions to a borrower due to financial or economic reasons related to the debtor's financial difficulties that the Company would not ordinarily grant. When evaluating the ALL, management makes a specific allocation for TDR loans as they are considered impaired.
In March 2020, the federal banking agencies issued guidance, confirmed by the FASB, that certain short-term modifications made to loans to borrowers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and government shutdown orders would not be considered TDRs under specified circumstances (See Note 1). During 2020, the Company executed modifications under this guidance on outstanding loan balances of $175.5 million that carried accrued interest of $1.2 million. Of the total modifications executed, outstanding loan balances of $37.6 million remained subject to modification terms and carried accrued interest of $352 thousand as of December 31, 2020. The Company intends to continue to follow the guidance of the banking regulators in making TDR determinations.

The following table shows trends of certain asset quality ratios monitored by Company's management at December 31:
2020 2019 2018 2017 2016
Allowance for loan losses to loans not held for sale 1.07 % 0.91 % 0.89 % 0.92 % 0.98 %
Allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans 283.16 % 174.81 % 293.40 % 320.95 % 119.66 %
Nonperforming loans to total loans 0.36 % 0.52 % 0.30 % 0.28 % 0.81 %
Nonperforming assets to total assets 0.27 % 0.40 % 0.24 % 0.23 % 0.63 %
Delinquent loans (30 days to nonaccruing) to total loans 0.83 % 1.35 % 1.41 % 1.05 % 1.55 %
Net charge-offs to average loans not held for sale 0.01 % 0.06 % 0.02 % 0.01 % 0.02 %
Nonperforming loans at December 31, 2020 decreased $581 thousand, or 16.6%, and decreased as a percentage of assets from 0.40% at December 31, 2019 to 0.27% at December 31, 2020, with the ALL as a percentage of nonperforming loans increasing from 174.81% to 283.16%. Management considers the asset quality ratios to be at favorable levels. The Company's success at keeping the ratios at favorable levels is the result of continued focus on maintaining strict underwriting standards, as well as our practice, as a community bank, of actively working with troubled borrowers to resolve the borrower's delinquency, while maintaining the safe and sound credit practices of Union and safeguarding our strong capital position. There were no residential real estate loans in process of foreclosure at December 31, 2020, as a state-mandated moratorium on foreclosures related to the COVID-19 emergency remained in effect as of year end. The aggregate interest on nonaccrual loans not recognized was $420 thousand and $271 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The Company had loans rated substandard that were on a performing status totaling $2.2 million at December 31, 2020 and $1.7 million at December 31, 2019. In management's view, such loans represent a higher degree of risk of becoming nonperforming loans in the future. While still on a performing status, in accordance with the Company's credit policy, loans are internally classified when a review indicates the existence of any of the following conditions, making the likelihood of collection questionable:
•the financial condition of the borrower is unsatisfactory;
•repayment terms have not been met;
•the borrower has sustained losses that are sizable, either in absolute terms or relative to net worth;
•confidence in the borrower's ability to repay is diminished;
•loan covenants have been violated;
•collateral is inadequate; or
•other unfavorable factors are present.
Although management believes that the Company's nonperforming and internally classified loans are generally well-secured and that probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio are provided for in the Company's ALL, there can be no assurance that future deterioration in economic conditions and/or collateral values, or changes in other relevant factors will not result in future credit losses. The Company’s management is focused on the impact that the economy may have on its borrowers and closely monitors industry and geographic concentrations for evidence of financial problems. Management will continue to monitor the national, regional and local economic environment, particularly as it relates to the COVID-19 crisis and its impact on unemployment, business failures and real estate values in the Company’s market area.
On occasion, the Company acquires residential or commercial real estate properties through or in lieu of loan foreclosure. These properties are held for sale and are initially recorded as OREO at fair value less estimated selling costs at the date of the Company’s acquisition of the property, with fair value based on an appraisal for more significant properties and on a broker’s price opinion for less significant properties. Holding costs and declines in fair value of properties acquired are expensed as incurred. Declines in the fair value after acquisition of the property result in charges against income before tax. There were no such declines during 2020 and 2019. The Company evaluates each OREO property at least quarterly for changes in the fair value. The Company had one residential real estate property valued at $50 thousand classified as OREO at December 31, 2020 and no properties classified as OREO at December 31, 2019.
Allowance for Loan Losses. Some of the Company’s loan customers ultimately do not make all of their contractually scheduled payments, requiring the Company to charge off a portion or all of the remaining principal balance due. The Company maintains an ALL to absorb such losses. The ALL is maintained at a level believed by management to be appropriate to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the evaluation date; however, actual loan losses may vary from management's current estimates.
The ALL is evaluated quarterly using a consistent, systematic methodology, which analyzes the risk inherent in the loan portfolio. In addition to evaluating the collectability of specific loans when determining the appropriate level of the ALL,
management also takes into consideration other qualitative factors such as changes in the mix and size of the loan portfolio, credit concentrations, historic loss experience, the amount of delinquencies and loans adversely classified, industry trends, and the impact of the local and regional economy on the Company's borrowers as well as the estimated value of any underlying collateral. The appropriate level of the ALL is assessed by an allocation process whereby specific loss allocations are made against impaired loans and general loss allocations are made against segments of the loan portfolio that have similar attributes. Although the ALL is assessed by allocating reserves by loan category, the total ALL is available to absorb losses that may occur within any loan category.
The ALL is increased by a provision for loan losses charged to earnings, and reduced by charge-offs, net of recoveries. The provision for loan losses represents management's estimate of the current period credit cost associated with maintaining an appropriate ALL. Based on an evaluation of the loan portfolio and other relevant qualitative factors, management presents a quarterly analysis of the appropriate level of the ALL to the Board, indicating any changes in the ALL since the last review and any recommendations as to adjustments in the ALL and the level of future provisions.
Credit quality of the commercial portfolio is quantified by a credit risk rating system designed to parallel regulatory criteria and categories of loan risk and has historically been well received by the various regulatory authorities. Individual loan officers and credit department personnel monitor loans to ensure appropriate rating assignments are made on a timely basis. Risk ratings and quality of commercial and retail credit portfolios are also assessed on a regular basis by an independent loan review function.
The level of ALL allocable to each loan portfolio category with similar risk characteristics is determined based on historical charge-offs, adjusted for qualitative risk factors. A quarterly analysis of various qualitative factors, including portfolio characteristics, national and local economic trends, overall market conditions, and levels of, and trends in, delinquencies and nonperforming loans, helps to ensure that areas with the potential risk for loss are considered in management's ALL estimate. Due to the economic disruption currently impacting our borrowers, the economic qualitative reserve factor assigned to each loan portfolio in the ALL estimate was increased during 2020 to incorporate the current economic implications and rising unemployment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The economic qualitative reserve factor was increased 25 bps for the residential real estate, construction real estate, commercial real estate and commercial and consumer loan portfolios and 10 bps for the municipal loan portfolio. In addition to the qualitative risk factor analysis of each loan portfolio, loans meeting specified criteria are also evaluated for specific impairment and may be classified as impaired when management believes it is probable that the Company will not collect all the contractual interest and principal payments as scheduled in the loan agreement. Commercial loans with balances greater than $500 thousand was established by management as the threshold for individual impairment evaluation with a specific reserve allocated when warranted. Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment. Accordingly, the Company does not separately identify individual consumer, real estate or small balance commercial loans for impairment evaluation, unless such loans are subject to a restructuring agreement or have been identified as impaired as part of a larger customer relationship. A specific reserve amount is allocated to the ALL for individual loans that have been classified as impaired on the basis of the fair value of the collateral for collateral dependent loans, an observable market price, or the present value of anticipated future cash flows.
Impaired loans, including $2.9 million of TDR loans, were $4.6 million at December 31, 2020, with government guaranties of $514 thousand and a specific reserve amount allocated of $58 thousand. Impaired loans, including $2.9 million of TDR loans, were $5.2 million at December 31, 2019, with government guaranties of $587 thousand and a specific reserve amount allocated of $196 thousand. The specific reserve amount allocated to individually identified impaired loans decreased $138 thousand as a result of the December 31, 2020 impairment evaluation.

Management of the Company believes, in its best estimate, that the ALL at December 31, 2020 is appropriate to cover probable credit losses inherent in the Company’s loan portfolio as of such date. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will not sustain losses in future periods which could be greater than the size of the ALL at December 31, 2020. In addition, our banking regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our ALL. Such agencies may require us to recognize adjustments to the ALL based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. A large adjustment to the ALL for losses in future periods may require increased provisions to replenish the ALL, which could negatively affect earnings.
Investment Activities. The investment portfolio is used to generate interest and dividend income, manage liquidity and mitigate interest rate sensitivity. At December 31, 2020, the fair value of investment securities AFS was $105.8 million, or 9.7% of total assets, compared to $87.4 million, or 10.0% of total assets, at December 31, 2019. There were no investment securities classified as HTM or as trading at December 31, 2020 or 2019. Investment securities classified as AFS are marked-to-market, with any unrealized gain or loss after estimated taxes charged to the equity portion of the balance sheet through the accumulated OCI component of stockholders' equity. The fair value of investment securities AFS at December 31, 2020 reflects a net unrealized gain of $3.3 million, compared to a net unrealized gain of $1.2 million at December 31, 2019.
At December 31, 2020, 46 debt securities had unrealized losses of $207 thousand, with aggregate depreciation of 0.20% from the Company's amortized cost basis. Securities are evaluated at least quarterly for OTTI and at December 31, 2020, in management's estimation, no security was OTTI. Management's evaluation of OTTI is subject to risks and uncertainties and is intended to determine the appropriate amount and timing of recognition of any impairment charge. The assessment of whether such impairment for debt securities has occurred is based on management's best estimate of the cash flows expected to be collected at the individual security level. We regularly monitor our investment portfolio to ensure securities that may be OTTI are identified in a timely manner and that any impairment charge is recognized in the proper period and, with respect to debt securities, that the impairment is properly allocated between credit losses recognized in earnings and noncredit unrealized losses recognized in OCI. Further deterioration in credit quality, imbalances in liquidity in the financial marketplace or a quick rise in interest rates might adversely affect the fair value of the Company's investment portfolio and may increase the potential that certain unrealized losses will be designated as OTT in future periods, resulting in write-downs and related charges to earnings.
At December 31, 2020, the Company had no investments in a single company or entity (other than U.S. Government-sponsored enterprise securities) that had an aggregate book value in excess of 2% of our stockholders' equity. As of December 31, 2020, all MBS the Company owned were issued by the Government National Mortgage Association, Fannie Mae or the FHLMC/Freddie Mac. Although the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debt securities are not explicitly guaranteed by the federal government, one of the stated purposes of the U.S. Treasury's September, 2008 conservatorship and capital support of the two institutions was to stabilize the market in their debt securities, and that purpose was again evident in legislation passed by Congress in late 2009 which effectively lifted any dollar ceiling on the implicit U.S. Treasury guaranty of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debt securities.

Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston Stock. Union is a member of the FHLB, with an investment of $1.0 million and $2.5 million in its Class B common stock at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Union is required to invest in $100 par value stock of the FHLB in an amount tied to the unpaid principal balances on qualifying loans, plus an amount to satisfy an activity based requirement. The stock is nonmarketable, and is redeemable by the FHLB at par value. Although the FHLB was in compliance with all regulatory capital ratios as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there is the possibility of future capital calls by the FHLB on member banks to ensure compliance with its capital plan. Union's investment in FHLB stock is carried at cost in Other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Similar to evaluating investment securities for OTTI, the Company has evaluated its investment in the FHLB. Management's most recent evaluation of the Company's holdings of FHLB common stock concluded that the investment was not impaired at December 31, 2020.

Deposits grew $250.3 million, or 33.6%, from $744.0 million at December 31, 2019 to $994.3 million at December 31, 2020. Total average deposits grew $150.3 million, or 21.5%, between years, with average nontime deposits growing $151.4 million, or 27.3%, and average time deposits decreasing $1.1 million, or 0.7%, during the same time frame. The increase in average nontime deposits was attributable to proceeds from PPP loans deposited into customer accounts at Union, customers' receipt of government stimulus payments, and the general lack of spending due to the economic disruption caused by COVID-19.
The Company participates in CDARS, which permits the Company to offer full deposit insurance coverage to its customers by exchanging deposit balances with other CDARS participants. CDARS also provides the Company with an additional source of funding and liquidity through the purchase of deposits. There were no purchased deposits as of December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019. There were $14.2 million of time deposits of $250,000 or less on the balance sheet at December 31, 2020 and $12.0 million at December 31, 2019, which were exchanged with other CDARS participants.
The Company also participates in the ICS program, a service through which Union can offer its customers demand or savings products with access to unlimited FDIC insurance, while receiving reciprocal deposits from other FDIC-insured banks. Like the exchange of certificate of deposit accounts through CDARS, exchange of demand or savings deposits through ICS provides a depositor with full deposit insurance coverage of excess balances, thereby helping the Company retain the full amount of the deposit on its balance sheet. As with the CDARS program, in addition to reciprocal deposits, participating banks may also purchase one-way ICS deposits. There were $146.2 million and $115.3 million in exchanged ICS demand and money market deposits on the balance sheet at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. There were no purchased ICS deposits at December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019.
The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 allows the Company to hold reciprocal deposits up to 20 percent of total liabilities without those deposits being treated as brokered for regulatory purposes.
At December 31, 2020, there were $15.0 million in retail brokered deposits issued under a master certificate of deposit program with a deposit broker for the purpose of providing a supplemental source of funding and liquidity. These deposits mature in February and May 2021. There were $12.0 million of retail brokered deposits at December 31, 2019.
A provision of the Dodd-Frank Act permanently raised FDIC deposit insurance coverage to $250 thousand per depositor per insured depository institution for each account ownership category. At December 31, 2020, the Company had deposit accounts with less than the maximum FDIC insured deposit amount of $250 thousand totaling $700.9 million, or 70.5% of total deposits. An additional $23.0 million of municipal deposits were over the FDIC insurance coverage limit at December 31, 2020 and were collateralized under applicable state regulations by letters of credit issued by the FHLB.
The following table provides a maturity distribution of the Company’s time deposits in amounts of $100 thousand and over at December 31:
2020 2019
(Dollars in thousands)
Three months or less $ 22,722 $ 27,376
Over three months through six months 15,828 7,351
Over six months through twelve months 22,629 20,160
Over twelve months 9,194 18,161
$ 70,373 $ 73,048
The Company's time deposits in amounts of $100 thousand and over decreased $2.7 million, or 3.7%, between December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020, resulting primarily from the maturity, without renewal, of customer time deposits originated during 2019 when promotions were offered.
Borrowings. Advances from the FHLB are another key source of funds to support earning assets. These funds are also used to manage the Bank's interest rate and liquidity risk exposures. The Company's borrowed funds at December 31, 2020 were comprised of borrowings from the FHLB of $7.2 million, at a weighted average rate of 3.07%. At December 31, 2019, borrowed funds were comprised of FHLB advances of $47.2 million, at a weighted average rate of 2.01%. The Company had no overnight federal funds purchased on December 31, 2020 or 2019. Average borrowings outstanding for 2020 were $24.0 million, compared to average borrowings outstanding for 2019 of $39.3 million, with the weighted average interest rate on the Company's borrowings decreasing from 2.20% for 2019 to 1.52% for 2020. The decrease in FHLB borrowings reflects the net maturity of $40.0 million in advances during 2020. In anticipation of cash flow needs resulting from COVID-19, $30.0 million in advances were taken at the end of the first quarter of 2020. Due to excess liquidity on hand from customer deposits of PPP loan proceeds and stimulus payments, these advances were prepaid during the second quarter of 2020, resulting in penalties paid of $66 thousand which are included in Other expenses on the Company's consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The Company has the authority, up to its available borrowing capacity with the FHLB, to collateralize public unit deposits with letters of credit issued by the FHLB. FHLB letters of credit in the amount of $23.6 million and $24.8 million were utilized as collateral for these deposits at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Total fees paid by the Company in connection with the issuance of these letters of credit were $30 thousand and $27 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Commitments, Contingent Liabilities, and Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements. The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers, to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, and to implement its strategic objectives. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, interest rate caps and floors written on adjustable-rate loans, commitments to participate in or sell loans, commitments to buy or sell securities, certificates of deposit or other investment instruments and risk-sharing commitments or guarantees on certain sold loans. Such instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized on the balance sheet. The contractual or notional amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of involvement the Company has in a particular class of financial instrument.
The Company's maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual or notional amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments. For interest rate caps and floors written on adjustable-rate loans, the contractual or notional amounts do not represent the Company’s exposure to credit loss. The Company controls the risk of interest rate cap agreements through credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. The Company generally requires collateral or other security to support financial instruments with credit risk.
The following table details the contractual or notional amount of financial instruments that represented credit risk at December 31, 2020:

Commitments to originate loans are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have a fixed expiration date or other termination clause and may require payment of a fee. The unused lines of credit total includes $12.5 million of lines available under the overdraft privilege program and is included in the 2020 funding period. Approximately $38.6 million of the unused lines of credit relate to real estate construction loans that are expected to fund within the next twelve months. The remaining lines primarily relate to revolving lines of credit for other real estate or commercial loans. Since many of the loan commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon and not all credit lines will be utilized, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Lines of credit incur seasonal volume fluctuations due to the nature of some customers' businesses, such as tourism and maple syrup products production.
Unused lines of credit increased $28.9 million, or 27.9%, from $103.6 million at December 31, 2019 to $132.5 million at December 31, 2020. Some of the larger lines have underlying participation agreements in place with other financial institutions in order to permit the Company to support the credit needs of larger dollar borrowers without bearing all the credit risk in the Company's balance sheet. Commitments to originate loans increased $25.7 million, or 72.1%, from $35.7 million at December 31, 2019 to $61.4 million at December 31, 2020.
The Company may, from time-to-time, enter into commitments to purchase, participate or sell loans, securities, certificates of deposit, or other investment instruments which involve market and interest rate risk. At December 31, 2020, the Company had binding commitments to sell residential mortgage loans at fixed rates totaling $18.3 million.
The Company sells 1-4 family residential mortgage loans under the MPF loss-sharing program with FHLB, when management believes it is economically advantageous to do so. Under this program the Company shares in the credit risk of each mortgage, while receiving fee income in return. The Company is responsible for a Credit Enhancement Obligation based on the credit quality of these loans. FHLB funds a first loss account based on the Company's outstanding MPF mortgage balances. This creates a laddered approach to sharing in any losses. In the event of default, homeowner's equity and private mortgage insurance, if any, are the first sources of repayment; the FHLB first loss account funds are then utilized, followed by the member's Credit Enhancement Obligation, with the balance the responsibility of FHLB. These loans must meet specific underwriting standards of the FHLB. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $31.6 million in loans sold through the MPF program with an outstanding balance of $10.4 million and a contract for the potential delivery of an additional $9.0 million of future loan sales. The volume of loans sold to the MPF program and the corresponding Credit Enhancement Obligation are closely monitored by management. As of December 31, 2020, the notional amount of the maximum contingent contractual liability related to this program was $747 thousand, of which $19 thousand was recorded as a reserve through Other liabilities. Since inception of the Company's MPF participation in 2015, the Company has not experienced any losses under this program.
Liquidity. Liquidity is a measurement of the Company’s ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to fund deposit withdrawals, repay borrowings, fund investment and lending activities, and for other general business purposes. The primary objective of liquidity management is to maintain a balance between sources and uses of funds to meet our cash flow needs in the most economical and expedient manner. The Company’s principal sources of funds are deposits; wholesale funding options including purchased deposits, amortization, prepayment and maturity of loans, investment securities, interest bearing deposits and other short-term investments; sales of securities AFS and loans; earnings; and funds provided from operations. Contractual principal repayments on loans are a relatively predictable source of funds; however, deposit flows and loan and investment prepayments are less predictable and can be significantly influenced by market interest
rates, economic conditions, and rates offered by our competitors. Managing liquidity risk is essential to maintaining both depositor confidence and earnings stability.
At December 31, 2020, Union, as a member of FHLB, had access to unused lines of credit of $112.2 million, over and above the $21.9 million in combined outstanding borrowings and other credit subject to collateralization, subject to the purchase of required FHLB Class B common stock and evaluation by the FHLB of the underlying collateral available. This line of credit can be used for either short-term or long-term liquidity or other funding needs.
Union also maintains an IDEAL Way Line of Credit with the FHLB. The total line available was $551 thousand at December 31, 2020. There were no borrowings against this line of credit as of such date. Interest on this line is chargeable at a rate determined by the FHLB and payable monthly. Should Union utilize this line of credit, qualified portions of the loan and investment portfolios would collateralize these borrowings.
In addition to its borrowing arrangements with the FHLB, Union maintains a pre-approved Federal Funds line of credit totaling $15.0 million with an upstream correspondent bank, a master brokered deposit agreement with a brokerage firm, one-way buy options with CDARS and ICS as well as access to the FRB discount window, which would require pledging of qualified assets. In addition to the funding sources available to Union, the Company maintains a $5.0 million revolving line of credit with a correspondent bank. At December 31, 2020 there were no purchased CDARS or ICS deposits, $15.0 million in retail brokered deposits issued under a master certificate of deposit program with a deposit broker, and no outstanding advances on the Federal Funds line or at the FRB discount window, or under the Company's $5.0 million line of credit.
Additionally, during 2020 Congress authorized the PPPLF, which provides funding through the FRB to facilitate lending by eligible borrowers to small businesses under the PPP. Under the PPPLF, the FRB lends to banks and other eligible institutional borrowers on a non-recourse basis, taking PPP loans, including purchased loans, as collateral. Union was approved by the FRB to participate in the PPPLF and, as of December 31, 2020, there were no outstanding advances under this program. Union also has qualifying investment securities that are available to be pledged as collateral to the FRB to have access to the discount window borrowing facility. As of December 31, 2020, there were no outstanding advances from the discount window.
Union's investment and residential loan portfolios provide a significant amount of contingent liquidity that could be accessed in a reasonable time period through sales of those portfolios. We also have additional contingent liquidity sources with access to the brokered deposit market, the FRB discount window and the PPPLF. These sources are considered as liquidity alternatives in our contingent liquidity plan. Management believes the Company has sufficient liquidity to meet all reasonable borrower, depositor, and creditor needs in the present economic environment. However, any projections of future cash needs and flows are subject to substantial uncertainty, including due to factors outside the Company's control.
Capital Resources. Capital management is designed to maintain an optimum level of capital in a cost-effective structure that meets target regulatory ratios, supports management’s internal assessment of economic capital, funds the Company’s business strategies and builds long-term stockholder value. Dividends are generally in line with long-term trends in earnings per share and conservative earnings projections, while sufficient profits are retained to support anticipated business growth, fund strategic investments, maintain required regulatory capital levels and provide continued support for deposits. The Company and Union continue to satisfy all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject and Union is considered well capitalized under the FDIC's Prompt Corrective Action framework. The Company continues to evaluate growth opportunities both through internal growth or potential acquisitions. The dividend payouts and stock repurchases during the last few years reflect the Board’s desire to utilize our capital for the benefit of the stockholders.
Stockholders’ equity increased from $71.8 million at December 31, 2019 to $80.9 million at December 31, 2020, reflecting net income of $12.8 million for 2020, an increase of $1.7 million in accumulated OCI due to an increase in the fair market value of the Company's AFS securities, an increase of $236 thousand from stock based compensation, a $22 thousand increase due to the issuance of 1,000 shares of common stock from the exercise of incentive stock options and a $38 thousand increase due to the issuance of common stock under the DRIP. These increases were partially offset by cash dividends declared of $5.7 million. There were no stock repurchases during 2020.
The Company has 7,500,000 shares of $2.00 par value common stock authorized. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had 4,954,732 shares issued, of which 4,480,100 were outstanding and 474,632 were held in treasury. Following stockholder approval in 2014, the Company adopted the 2014 Equity Plan which replaced the 2008 ISO Plan. As of December 31, 2020, there were outstanding employee incentive stock options with respect to 4,500 shares, all of which were issued under the 2014 Equity Plan and exercisable. Also as of December 31, 2020, there were outstanding RSUs issued under the 2014 Equity Plan with respect to 500 shares granted in 2019 and 5,139 shares granted in 2020 as to which vesting requirements had not yet been met.
In January 2020, the Company's Board reauthorized for 2020 the limited stock repurchase plan that was initially established in May of 2010. The limited stock repurchase plan allows the repurchase of up to a fixed number of shares of the Company's common stock each calendar quarter in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, as management may deem advisable and as market conditions may warrant. The repurchase authorization for a calendar quarter (currently 2,500 shares) expires at the end of that quarter to the extent it has not been exercised, and is not carried forward into future quarters. The Company had no repurchases under this program during 2020. Since inception, as of December 31, 2020, the Company had repurchased 17,693 shares under the program, for a total cost of $472 thousand.
The Company maintains a DRIP whereby registered stockholders may elect to reinvest cash dividends and optional cash contributions to purchase additional shares of the Company's common stock. The Company has reserved 200,000 shares of its common stock for issuance and sale under the DRIP. As of December 31, 2020, 4,139 shares of stock had been issued from treasury stock since inception of the DRIP, including 1,636 shares in 2020.
The Company's total capital to risk weighted assets increased to 13.9% at December 31, 2020, from 13.0% at December 31, 2019.

Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices. The Company's consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which allows for the measurement of financial position and results of operations in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Banks have asset and liability structures that are essentially monetary in nature, and their general and administrative costs constitute relatively small percentages of total expenses. Thus, increases in the general price levels for goods and services have a relatively minor effect on the Company's total expenses but could have an impact on our loan customers' financial condition. Interest rates have a more significant impact on the Company's financial performance than the effect of general inflation. On March 3, 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) reduced the target federal funds rate by 50 basis points to a range of 1.00% to 1.25%. This rate was further reduced to a target range of 0% to 0.25% on March 16, 2020. Recent FOMC meetings indicate this low target range will remain in effect until members of the FOMC are confident the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals, which may not be until late in 2021 or beyond. Prolonged reductions in interest rates and other effects of the COVID-19 outbreak may continue to adversely affect the Company’s net interest income. Through December 31, 2020 the decreases in the target federal funds rate have also had a direct impact on the rates paid on customer deposit accounts. Customer deposit balances have increased as spending habits changed due to COVID-19 resulting in excess levels of on balance sheet liquidity. Further decreases in the target federal funds rate in 2021 may result in less than expected interest income on loans and investments. Further relief on the Company's cost of funds is expected to occur in 2021 as high rate paying time deposit accounts renew into lower rate instruments. Market rates are out of the Company's control but can have a dramatic impact on net interest income.
Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or change in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services, although periods of increased inflation may accompany a rising interest rate environment. Inflation in the price of goods and services, while not having a substantial impact on the operating results of the Company, does affect all customers and therefore may impact their ability to keep funds on deposit or make timely loan payments. The Company is aware of and evaluates this risk along with others in making business decisions. The levels of deficit spending by federal, state and local governments and control of the money supply by the FRB including further quantitative easing of the money supply, may have unanticipated impacts on interest rates or inflation in future periods that could have an unfavorable impact on the future operating results of the Company.
