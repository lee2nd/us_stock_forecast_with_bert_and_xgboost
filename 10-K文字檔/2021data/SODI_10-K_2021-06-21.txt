MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
You should read the following discussion in conjunction with the “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. You also should review and consider the risks relating to the Company’s business, operations, financial performance, and cash flows presented earlier under “Risk Factors.”
INTRODUCTION
The Company designs, develops, manufactures and markets solid-state semiconductor components and related devices primarily for the military and aerospace markets. The Company manufactures a large variety of bipolar and MOS power transistors, power and control hybrids, junction and power MOFSETs, field effect transistors and other related products. Most of the Company’s products are custom made pursuant to contracts with customers whose end products are sold to the United States government. Other products, such as JAN transistors, diodes and SMD voltage regulators, are sold as standard or catalog items.
The following table is included solely for use in comparative analysis to complement Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations:
The following table sets forth our statements of operations for the fiscal year periods indicated (in 000’s):
The following table sets forth our statements of operations as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated:
TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES:
During the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021, the Company’s book-to-bill ratio was approximately 1.12 to 1 as compared to approximately 1.22 to 1 for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020, reflecting an increase in the volume of orders booked. Historically, the Company has experienced seasonality in its bookings, with the fiscal fourth quarter experiencing the highest level of bookings. Going forward we expect more variability in bookings.
The Company has been seeking out additional revenue sources, which may involve new products and/or products the Company has not manufactured in recent years, or before. The Company may incur difficulty manufacturing those products, which could result in decreased margins.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Comparison of Fiscal Year Ended February 28, 2021 vs. Fiscal Year Ended February 29, 2020
Revenue. Net sales for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 increased by approximately 14% to $10,534,000 versus $9,237,000 for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020.
Net bookings for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 were greater than net sales by approximately 12%. Backlog increased by approximately 11% to $9,150,000 as of February 28, 2021 from $8,223,000 as of February 29, 2020. The increase was due to the development of new products and an increase in the dollar value of new orders by key customers.
During the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021, the Company shipped 78,811units as compared with 75,313 units shipped during the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020. It should be noted that since the Company manufactures a wide variety of products with an average sales price ranging from a few dollars to several hundred dollars, such periodic variations in the Company’s volume of units shipped might not be a reliable indicator of the Company’s performance.
Cost of Sales. Cost of sales for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 decreased to $7,257,000 from $7,762,000 for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020. Expressed as a percentage of sales, cost of sales decreased to 69% for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 as compared to 84% for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020.
Gross Profit. Gross profit for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 increased to $3,277,000 from $1,475,000 for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020 due primarily to a decrease in materials and labor. Expressed as a percentage of sales, gross profit for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 increased to 31% as compared to 16% for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020.
Selling, General & Administrative Expenses. During the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021, selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, decreased to approximately 20% as compared to 23% for the year ended February 29, 2020. In terms of dollars, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 0.2% to $2,108,000 for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 from $2,104,000 for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020. This increase is primarily due to an increase in professional fees of $25,000 and sales commissions of $42,000, partially offset by a $207,000 decrease in stock based compensation.
Operating Income (Loss). Operating income for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 was $1,169,000 as compared to an operating loss of ($629,000) for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020. The decrease in operating loss was mainly attributable to the increase in net sales and decrease in materials and labor costs noted above.
Total Other Income. Interest income and dividend income were $0 and $7,000, respectively for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021, compared to $1,000 and $9,000, respectively for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020. Interest expense was ($5,000) for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021, compared to $0 for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020. Realized gains on investments for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 were $98,000 compared to a loss of ($28,000) for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020. Unrealized gains on investments for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 decreased to $36,000 from $41,000 for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020. Other income consisting primarily of scrap income was $76,000 in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 as compared to $0 in the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020.
Net Income (Loss). Net income for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 was $1,381,000 as compared to a net loss of ($606,000) for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020. The increase in net income was mainly attributable to the increase in net sales and decrease in labor and materials discussed above.

The Company expects its sole source of liquidity over the next twelve months to be cash from operations and cash and cash equivalents, if necessary. The Company anticipates that its capital expenditures required to sustain operations will be approximately $500,000 during the next twelve months and will be funded from operations and cash and cash equivalents, if necessary.
At February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $3,785,000 and $1,332,000, respectively. The cash increase for the year ended February 28, 2021 was primarily due to income from operations and proceeds from SBA Paycheck Protection Program loan.
At February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020, the Company had investments in securities of approximately $248,000 and $164,000, respectively.
At February 28, 2021, the Company had working capital of $7,049,000 as compared with working capital at February 29, 2020 of $4,687,000. The increase for the year ended February 29, 2020 was due primarily to income from operations and the SBA Paycheck Protection Program loan.
Stock Repurchase Program:
On January 15, 2016, the Board of Directors amended the Company’s previously authorized stock repurchase program to permit the Company to acquire up to $1,000,000 of its outstanding common stock from time to time, increasing the Company’s authorization from the $720,000 remaining at that time and eliminating the expiration date of February 29, 2016. Purchases under the amended stock repurchase program may be made through the open market or privately negotiated transactions as determined by the Company’s management, and in accordance with the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price, corporate and regulatory requirements and other conditions.
The Company repurchased 2,493 shares for $5,734, or $2.30 per share, under the stock repurchase program during the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021, and 10 shares for $25, or $2.50 per share during the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
See Note 2 in the financial statements for the Company’s accounting policies. Of the Company’s accounting policies, the following are considered to be critical - Inventories.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
The Company has not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements.
BOOKINGS AND BACKLOG
During the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021, the Company’s net bookings were $11,827,000 in new orders as compared with $11,224,000 for the year ended February 29, 2020, reflecting an increase in bookings of approximately 5%. The Company’s backlog increased to $9,150,000 at February 28, 2021 as compared with $8,223,000 as of February 29, 2020, reflecting an increase of approximately 11% in backlog.
In the event that bookings in the long-term decline significantly below the level experienced in the last fiscal year, the Company may be required to implement cost-cutting or other downsizing measures to continue its business operations. Such cost-cutting measures could inhibit future growth prospects. For the years ended February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020, the entire backlog consisted of orders for electronic components.
See Part I, Item 1, “Business - Marketing and Customers” and “Backlog.”
FUTURE PLANS
The Company plans to continue its efforts in selling commercial semiconductors and power modules and to develop appropriate strategic alliance arrangements. If these plans are successful, the Company intends to aggressively pursue sales of these products which could require the Company to invest in the building up of inventories of finished goods and invest in capital equipment (assembly and test) to replace older generation equipment and to support new product manufacturing. Any financing necessary to fund these initiatives could come from equipment leasing, among other financing alternatives. Despite its intentions, the Company cannot assure you that any of the above-described plans will be successful in increasing liquidity, reducing costs or improving sales.
On April 16, 2021, Solitron Devices, Inc. (the "Company") closed on the acquisition of a facility and real estate located in West Palm Beach, Florida for a purchase price of $4,200,000 pursuant to the Commercial Contract entered into on March 1, 2021. In connection with the acquisition, the Company obtained mortgage financing from Bank of America, N.A. in the amount of $2,940,000 to fund that portion of the total purchase price. The Company expects to begin making the necessary improvements to the property acquired in order to completely relocate its manufacturing operations and corporate headquarters later in the calendar year.
INFLATION
The rate of inflation has not had a material effect on the Company’s revenues and costs and expenses, and it is not anticipated that inflation will have a material effect on the Company in the near future.
SEASONALITY
The Company’s bookings of new orders and sales are largely dependent on congressional budgeting and appropriation activities and the cycles associated therewith. The Company has historically experienced a decreased level of bookings during the summer months as a result of a slowdown in the level of budgeting and appropriation activities.
