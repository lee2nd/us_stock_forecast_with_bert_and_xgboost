ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes to those statements. In addition to historical information, the following discussion and other parts of this annual report contain forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties.
Overview and Outlook
Effective January 21, 2021, we changed our name from Black Ridge Oil & Gas, Inc. to Sow Good Inc. Our common stock is quoted on the OTCQB under the trading symbol “SOWG”.
We intend to launch our line of freeze-dried snacks, smoothies and soups, and our direct-to-consumer focused website, to coincide with initial production from our state-of-the-art facility located in Irving, Texas in the first half of 2021.
Our business will operate under two distinct brands, Sow Good and Sustain Us. Our unique food products are targeting the large, and growing, freeze-dried food products market. The global freeze-dried food products market is estimated by Technavio to total nearly $60B in 2020, with the United States representing almost 30% of the total. Technavio further projects market growth to continue at over 8% per year through 2024.
On March 20, 2021, our first freeze drier successfully completed its production testing. In addition, we completed the build-out of our production facility in March, and have finalized products and packaging, while delivering samples to potential B2B customers.
With the extensive freeze-dried manufacturing and food product-focused business development experience of our senior management team, including recent additions, we believe we are well positioned to lead the Company's growth and development in the freeze-dried food industry.
S-FDF Business Combination
On October 1, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of S-FDF, LLC (the "Seller"), a Texas limited liability company, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement, between the Company and the Seller, dated June 9, 2020, as subsequently amended effective October 1, 2020. In connection with the closing of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company acquired approximately $2.2 million in cash and certain assets and agreements related to the Seller’s freeze-dried fruits and vegetables business for human consumption and entered into certain employment and registration rights agreements. The Company did not assume any liabilities of Seller or any liabilities, liens, or encumbrances pertaining to or encumbering the Purchased Assets, except for those related to agreements or arrangements specified in the Asset Purchase Agreement. The Seller transferred the Purchased Assets to the Company in exchange for the issuance of 1,120,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to the Seller. The number of shares to be issued to Seller was subject to adjustment, as specified in the Asset Purchase Agreement, as amended, based on the extent to which the amount of cash proceeds held by the Company, as derived from the sale of the Company’s holdings of AESE Shares, were less than $5 million or greater than $6 million on the date specified in the Asset Purchase Agreement, which resulted in the issuance of an additional 500,973 Seller Shares that were issued on January 4, 2021. The combined issuances represented approximately 46% of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock, on a fully diluted basis. Black Ridge Oil & Gas, Inc. was determined to be the acquiror of the business combination.
Pursuant to its obligations under the Asset Purchase Agreement, on the Closing Date the Company, (a) created three new seats on the Company’s Board of Directors and appointed the Seller’s principals, Ira Goldfarb and Claudia Goldfarb, and a third person designated by the Goldfarbs, Greg Creed, as directors, (b) entered into employment agreements with Ira Goldfarb and Claudia Goldfarb, (c) delivered a registration rights agreement with respect to the shares to be issued to Seller and any shares of common stock delivered as part of the employment compensation for Ira Goldfarb or Claudia Goldfarb, and (d) amended the Company’s 2020 Stock Incentive Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock reserved thereunder. At closing, the Company also assumed the Seller’s obligations under a real property lease for its facility in Irving, Texas under which an entity owned entirely by Ira Goldfarb is the landlord.
BRAC Business Combination
On October 10, 2017, the Company’s sponsored special purpose acquisition company, Black Ridge Acquisition Corp. (“BRAC”), completed an IPO raising $138,000,000 of gross proceeds (including proceeds from the exercise of an over-allotment option by the underwriters on October 18, 2017). In addition, the Company purchased 445,000 BRAC units at $10.00 per unit in a private placement transaction for a total contribution of $4,450,000 in order to fulfill its obligations in sponsoring BRAC, a blank check company formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. BRAC’s efforts to identify a prospective target business were not limited to a particular industry or geographic region. Following the IPO and over-allotment, BROG owned 22% of the outstanding common stock of BRAC and managed BRAC’s operations via a management services agreement through December 31, 2019. On December 19, 2018, BRAC entered into a business combination agreement, which subsequently closed on August 9, 2019. BRAC was renamed Allied Esports Entertainment, Inc. following the merger, or “AESE”, and referred to herein, as such.
Going Concern Uncertainty
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had a cash balance of $1,912,729 and total working capital of $1,768,153. Based on projections of cash expenditures in the Company’s current business plan, the cash on hand would be insufficient to sustain operations over the next year. On February 5, 2021, we raised $2.525 million from the sale of an aggregate 631,250 shares of the Company’s common stock at $4.00 per share, resulting in approximately $2.7 million of cash on hand and $650,000 of liquid securities for a combined liquidity of $3.35 million as of March 19, 2021.
We continue to pursue sources of additional capital through various financing transactions or arrangements, including equity financing or other means. We may not be successful in identifying suitable funding transactions in a sufficient time period or at all, and we may not obtain the capital we require by other means. If we do not succeed in raising additional capital, our resources may not be sufficient to fund our business. Our ability to scale production and distribution capabilities and further increase the value of our brands, is largely dependent on our success in raising additional capital.
The report of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm that accompanies its audited financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains an explanatory paragraph regarding the substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of the going concern uncertainty.
Overview of 2020 results
Our 2020 results were largely dominated by managing, searching for potential business combination candidates and ultimately closing the business combination with S-FDF, LLC to enter into the freeze-dried foods business. We did not earn any revenues in 2020, compared to earning $466,595 in management fees for the year ended December 31, 2019, from our management agreement with BRAC subsequent to the AESE transaction. We anticipate generating revenues from our freeze-dried foods business in 2021.
Our general and administrative expenses remained relatively consistent throughout 2020, driven primarily by salaries and benefits amounting to $1,477,124. Our stock-based compensation of $1,104,096 consisted of $268,608 of stock issued to officers and directors, $458,048 of expense related to the amortization of stock options and $377,440 of expense related to warrants issued to officers and directors as a debt discount for their personal guarantee on a line of credit.
Application of Critical Accounting Policies
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, deferred tax assets and fair value computation using the Black Scholes option pricing model. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions, such as the trading value of our common stock and estimated future undiscounted cash flows, that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that our estimates, including those for the above-described items, are reasonable.
Critical Accounting Policies
The establishment and consistent application of accounting policies is a vital component of accurately and fairly presenting our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), as well as ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing financial reporting. While there are rarely alternative methods or rules from which to select in establishing accounting and financial reporting policies, proper application often involves significant judgment regarding a given set of facts and circumstances and a complex series of decisions.
Income Taxes
Deferred tax assets are recognized for temporary differences in financial statement and tax basis amounts that will result in deductible amounts and carry-forwards in future years. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for temporary differences that will result in taxable amounts in future years. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax law and tax rate(s) for the year in which we expect the temporary differences to be deducted or settled. The effect of a change in tax law or rates on the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period of enactment. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Significant future taxable income would be required to realize this net tax asset.
Estimating the amount of the valuation allowance is dependent on estimates of future taxable income, alternative minimum tax income, and changes in shareholder ownership that would trigger limits on use of net operating losses under Internal Revenue Code Section 382.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Our cash and cash equivalents, investments, accounts receivable and accounts payable are stated at cost which approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. In January 2010, the FASB issued an amendment to the accounting standards related to the disclosures about an entity’s use of fair value measurements. Among these amendments, entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about transfers into and out of the Level 1 (fair value determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities) and Level 2 (fair value determined based on significant other observable inputs) classifications, provide separate disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements relating to the tabular reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of the Level 3 (fair value determined based on significant unobservable inputs) classification and provide greater disaggregation for each class of assets and liabilities that use fair value measurements.
Use of Estimates
In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, management utilizes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
The following table summarizes selected items from the statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Management Fee Revenue
The Company earned $466,595 in management fees for the year ended December 31, 2019, from its management agreement with BRAC subsequent to the Mergers. The Company did not earn any management fees during the year ended December 31, 2020.
General and Administrative Expenses
Salaries and Benefits
Salaries and benefits for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $1,477,124, compared to $1,172,745 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $304,379, or 26%. The increase in salaries and benefits was primarily due to severance pay accrued pursuant to the separation agreements for the former management team, as we transitioned to our new line of business.
Stock-based Compensation
Stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $726,656, compared to $100,526 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $626,130, or 623%. Stock-based compensation consisted of stock options expense in both periods, in addition to $268,608 of expense related to the issuance of common stock to officers and directors incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020. Amortization of stock options increased as new options were granted toward the end of February 2020, with a five-year vesting period, and the vesting period was accelerated pursuant to separation agreements entered into on September 30, 2020.
Deferred Compensation
Deferred compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $1,396,460, consisting of expense related to the 2018 Management Incentive Plan (the “2018 Plan”). There was no deferred compensation expense in the current period.
Professional Services
General and administrative expenses related to professional services were $451,125 for the 2020 period, compared to $132,505 for the 2019 period, an increase of $318,620, or 240%. The increase was primarily due to legal costs related to our asset purchase agreement with S-FDF, LLC.
Other General and Administrative Expenses
Other general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $350,875, compared to $259,968 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $90,907, or 35%. The increase is attributable to increased administrative activity in the fourth quarter pursuant to the development of our freeze-dried foods business.
Depreciation
Depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $3,642, compared to $872 for year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is attributable to the significant increase in capital expenditures incurred as we developed our freeze-dried foods production facility.
Other Income (Expense)
In the year ended December 31, 2020, other expense was $2,311,517, consisting of $386,164 of interest expense derived from operating loans, including $377,440 of warrants issued as consideration to officers and directors in exchange for their personal guarantees, a loss on the disposal of equipment of $5,369, and a net loss on investments in Allied Esports Entertainment, Inc. securities of $1,925,029, as offset by a $5,000 grant from the Small Business Administration under their EIDL program and $45 of interest income.
In the year ended December 31, 2019, other income was $15,480,563, consisting of the gain upon deconsolidation of BRAC of $26,322,687 and an offsetting merger incentive expense of $5,874,000 to recognize the cost related to transferring shares of AESE stock to the former owners of Allied Esports and WPT and other investors as incentive to participate in the merger, and $51 of interest income, as offset by a net loss on investments in Allied Esports Entertainment, Inc. securities of $4,968,175.
Provision for Income Taxes
The Company had no income tax expense in the 2020 or 2019 periods, as the Company continues to reserve against any deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of realization of any benefit.
Net Loss from Discontinued Operations
Net loss from discontinued operations relates to the income and expenses of BRAC during the periods prior to deconsolidation. Net loss from discontinued operations consisted of a loss of $7,421,050 during the year ended December 31, 2019. During the 2019 period, there were contingent closing costs from BRAC’s underwriter and other investment bankers involved in the merger of $7,917,500. Interest from investments in the trust account for the benefit of potential redeeming shareholders was $1,780,992 in 2019, due to trust account redemptions and the withdrawal of the remaining assets at the time of the Mergers.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The following table summarizes our total current assets, liabilities and working capital at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
As of December 31, 2020, we had working capital of $1,768,153.
The following table summarizes our cash flows during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Net cash used in operating activities was $1,743,409 and $9,709,780 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, a year over year decreased use of $7,966,371. The decreased use was primarily due to a decrease of $8,618,568 in net losses in discontinued operations of BRAC due primarily to the recognition of $7,917,500 of contingent fees upon BRAC’s business combination. Changes in working capital from continuing operating activities resulted in an increase in cash of $340,735 during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to an increase in cash of $7,360 for the same period in the previous year.
Net cash provided by investing activities was $3,284,457 and $6,883,062 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by investing activities consisted of $1,154,459 of cash received pursuant to our business combination with S-FDF, LLC, and $3,181,735 of proceeds received from the sale of AESE securities, as offset by $257,626 of equipment purchases and $794,111 paid on construction projects still in progress. In the comparative period, virtually all the cash was provided from discontinued operations and was the result of transfers and withdrawals from the Trust Account, other than $6,046 of equipment purchases during 2019.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $262,925 and $1,431,974 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities consisted of $802,025 of proceeds received from debt financing, including $112,925 of proceeds received under the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) that were forgiven in January of 2021, as offset by $539,100 of debt repayments in 2020. All of the 2019 activity was the result of activities in the discontinued operations of BRAC.
Satisfaction of our cash obligations for the next 12 months
As of December 31, 2020, our balance of cash and cash equivalents was $1,912,729 and we had total working capital of $1,768,153. Based on projections of cash expenditures in the Company’s current business plan, the cash on hand as of December 31, 2020 would be insufficient to sustain operations over the next year.
We expect to incur significant costs related to the development and operation of our freeze-dried foods business which will put a strain on our cash resources. Should the Company be successful in launching its products, we may pursue the expansion of our production capabilities through the construction of a second freeze drier. Adding a second freeze drier would require approximately $1 million of incremental capital and would likely require the Company to identify additional sources of funding.
Our plan for satisfying our cash requirements for the next twelve months is through cash on hand and additional financing in the form of equity or debt as needed. On February 5, 2021, we raised $2.525 million from the sale of an aggregate 631,250 shares of the Company’s common stock at $4.00 per share, resulting in approximately $2.7 million of cash on hand and $650,000 of liquid securities for a combined liquidity of $3.35 million as of March 19, 2021. Our ability to scale production and distribution capabilities and further increase the value of our brands, is largely dependent on our success in raising additional capital.
Effects of inflation and pricing
We do not expect any significant effects from inflation and pricing.
Contractual obligations and commitments
Upon closing of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company assumed the Seller’s obligations under a real property lease for its 20,945 square foot facility at 1440 N. Union Bower Rd. Irving, TX 75061, under which an entity owned entirely by Ira Goldfarb is the landlord. The lease term is through September 15, 2025, with two five-year options to extend, at a monthly lease term of $10,036, with approximately a 3% annual escalation of lease payments commencing September 15, 2021.
Summary of product and research and development that we will perform for the term of our plan
We anticipate performing product research and development as required for our products and distribution under our new plan of operation. The Company currently has one full-time employee dedicated to product research and development. The Company’s research and development activities primarily consist of product formulation, nutritional analysis, and taste analysis.
Expected purchase or sale of plant and significant equipment
We anticipate the purchase of significant property and equipment in 2021 as we complete our freeze-dried production facility.
Significant changes in the number of employees
As of December 31, 2020, we had eighteen employees, our chief executive officer, Claudia Goldfarb, our Executive Chairman, Ira Goldfarb, our chief financial officer, Brad Burke and fifteen other employees. We expect a significant change in the number of full-time employees over the next 12 months based upon our currently-projected business plan, as we commence production. We are using and will continue to use the services of independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services for us or on behalf of our partners. We believe that this use of third-party service providers enhances our ability to contain general and administrative expenses. Currently, there are no organized labor agreements or union agreements and we do not anticipate any in the future.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
