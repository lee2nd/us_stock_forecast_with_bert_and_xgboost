Company Overview
Arcosa, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, (“Arcosa,” “Company,” “we,” or “our”) headquartered in Dallas, Texas, is a provider of infrastructure-related products and solutions with leading brands serving construction, engineered structures, and transportation markets in North America. Arcosa is a Delaware corporation and was incorporated in 2018 in connection with the separation (the “Separation”) of Arcosa from Trinity Industries, Inc. (“Trinity” or “Former Parent”) on November 1, 2018 as an independent, publicly-traded company, listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
Basis of Historical Presentation
The accompanying Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements present our historical financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income/loss, and cash flows in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). The combined financial statements for periods prior to the Separation were derived from Trinity’s consolidated financial statements and accounting records and prepared in accordance with GAAP for the preparation of carved-out combined financial statements. Through the date of the Separation, all revenues and costs as well as assets and liabilities directly associated with Arcosa have been included in the combined financial statements. Prior to the Separation, the combined financial statements also included allocations of certain selling, general, and administrative expenses provided by Trinity to Arcosa and allocations of related assets, liabilities, and the Former Parent’s net investment, as applicable. The allocations were determined on a reasonable basis; however, the amounts are not necessarily representative of the amounts that would have been reflected in the financial statements had the Company been an entity that operated independently of Trinity during the applicable periods. Related party allocations prior to the Separation, including the method for such allocation, are described further in Note 1, “Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.
Following the Separation, the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Arcosa and those of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and no longer include any allocations from Trinity.
We have renamed our Engineered Structures segment, previously named Energy Equipment, as of December 31, 2020 to better reflect the products delivered. There have been no changes to the businesses that have historically comprised this segment.
Potential Impact of COVID-19 On Our Business
Our highest priority is the health and safety of our employees and communities. Our businesses support critical infrastructure sectors, pursuant to the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency standards. Our plants have continued to operate throughout the COVID-19 crisis. However, as of the date of this filing, uncertainty exists concerning the potential magnitude of the impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. The following possible events related to the COVID-19 pandemic may potentially adversely impact our business, liquidity and financial condition, or results of operations: customer demand for our products and services may decrease; reductions in our customers' capex spending; our supply chain may have disruption preventing us from obtaining the necessary materials and equipment to manufacture our
products and provide services; our employees’ ability to continue to work may be impacted because of COVID-19 related illness or local, state, or federal orders requiring them to stay at home; the effect of governmental regulations imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may result in shutdowns of our operations; limitations on the ability of our customers to conduct their business and purchase our products and services; disruptions to our customers’ supply chains or purchasing patterns; and limitations on the ability of our customers to pay us on a timely basis.
We believe that, based on the various standards published to date, our employees are part of the Essential Critical Infrastructure Workforce, and the work they perform is critical, essential, and life-sustaining. We will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers and shareholders.
In addition to the extensive health and safety protocols already in place across our plants, we estimate that we incurred $4.0-5.0 million of incremental costs related to COVID-19 during the year ended December 31, 2020 for personal protective equipment, health screenings, deep cleaning services, and facilities re-configurations. We do not anticipate that the enhanced health and safety protocols will have a material impact on the productivity of our plants.
The preparation of the Company's Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. At this time, we have not observed any material impairments of our assets or a significant change in the fair value of assets due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, due to the factors discussed above, we are unable to determine or predict the overall impact the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.
Market Outlook
•Within our Construction Products segment, we have experienced better than anticipated construction demand since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in March as construction activity in Texas has remained resilient and other states have reopened for business. However, we did experience a softening of demand for our specialty materials and shoring products businesses following the outbreak that has recently shown signs of improvement but remains below pre-pandemic levels. The outlook for public and private construction activity has improved as expectations for U.S. economic growth have increased following the roll-out of vaccines and associated re-opening of the economy, but the environment continues to be uncertain. Our Construction Products segment has the largest exposure to Texas, where construction demand is expected to be more favorable than national averages.
•Within our Engineered Structures segment, our backlog as of December 31, 2020 provides a healthy level of production visibility for 2021, but at a lower level than at the beginning of 2020. Our customers remain committed to taking delivery of these orders. In utility structures, order and inquiry activity continues to be strong, as customers remain focused on grid hardening and reliability initiatives. We continue to actively work with our wind tower customers on new order inquiries; however, we expect a lower level of wind tower production in 2021 as the wind industry continues to transition from 100% PTC support. In 2021, we will benefit from a full-year of revenues from the newly acquired traffic and telecom structures businesses, where demand conditions are very favorable. Order and inquiry activity in the storage tank business has improved since the onset of COVID-19 after taking a pause initially, as certain customers deferred new tank installations.
•Within our Transportation Products segment, our backlog for inland barges as of December 31, 2020 provides a base level of production visibility for 2021, but at a significantly lower level than we had at the beginning of 2020. Our customers remain committed to taking delivery of these orders. Barge order levels fell sharply in the second and third quarters of 2020, as barge utilization declined from the COVID-19 related economic slowdown. Lower demand for refined products, including gasoline and jet fuel, and low, but increasing, oil prices negatively impacted order quantities for liquid barges in 2020 and inquiries remain very low thus far in 2021. On a more positive note, the underlying fundamentals for a dry barge replacement cycle remain in place, and we received a higher level of orders in the fourth quarter, consistent with pre-pandemic demand. However, a sharp acceleration in steel prices occurring at the end of 2020 has negatively impacted the near-term outlook for hopper demand. We have reduced our capacity in all three barge operating plants to align with lower production levels in 2021, while remaining flexible to allow time for fundamentals to recover. We are evaluating additional cost reduction alternatives and if demand does not improve in the near term, we will take additional actions to reduce our cost structure. Demand for steel components continues to decline as the outlook for the North American rail transportation market, which was softening pre-COVID-19, remains uncertain.
The February 2021 winter storm in Texas and the broader Southern United States will impact our Q1 performance, as we lost more than one week of production across a significant part of our operating footprint. As of the date of this release, we have restored operations in most of our facilities but may experience continuing impacts in our supply chain, particularly for steel mill production that was impacted by the storm.
Executive Overview
Financial Operations and Highlights
•Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased 11.4% to $1.9 billion compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the impact of the Cherry acquisition in our Construction Products segment, higher unit volumes in our Engineered Structures segment, and increased hopper barge deliveries in our Transportation Products segment.
•Operating profit for year ended December 31, 2020 of $151.8 million was flat compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 as increased operating profit in the Construction Product and Transportation Products segments were offset by increased costs in the Engineered Structures segment and corporate.
•Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased by 24.3% for the year ended December 31, 2020, when compared to the prior year largely due to additional costs from the acquired Cherry business and other current year acquisitions, as well as increased corporate costs.
•The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 22.9% compared to 22.8% for the year ended December 31, 2019. See Note 10, “Income Taxes” to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.
•Net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $106.6 million compared with $113.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Unsatisfied Performance Obligations (Backlog)

For a further discussion of revenues, costs, and the operating results of individual segments, see Segment Discussion below.
Other Income and Expense
Other, net (income) expense consists of the following items:
2020 versus 2019
•Other, net expense due to foreign currency exchange transactions increased by $2.1 million primarily driven by the volatility in the U.S. dollar to Mexican peso exchange rate throughout 2020. This incremental expense resulted in a foreign income tax benefit, which had a favorable impact on our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Income Taxes
The income tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $31.6 million, $33.5 million, and $19.3 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was 22.9%, 22.8%, and 20.3%, respectively. The effective tax rates differ from the federal tax rate of 21.0% due to the impact of state income taxes, excess tax benefits related to equity compensation, and the impact of foreign tax benefits.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 27, 2020 the U.S. Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), which includes certain tax relief and benefits that may impact the Company. Approximately $15 million of federal and state income tax payments deferred during the first half of the year were paid during the third quarter of 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has deferred $9.7 million in payroll-related taxes in accordance with the provisions of the CARES Act. We expect to pay $4.9 million during the year ending December 31, 2021, with the remainder to be paid during 2022.
See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for a further discussion of income taxes.
Segment Discussion
Construction Products
2020 versus 2019
•Revenues increased 35.0%, driven by the acquisition of Cherry, which increased segment revenues by approximately 40%. This was partially offset by a decrease of 14.4% in revenues in our trench shoring business as a result of lower volumes as customers reduced capital expenditures during the COVID-19 crisis. In our legacy aggregates and specialty materials businesses, revenues were mostly flat as reduced volumes in plants serving oil and gas markets and from COVID-19 related construction delays were mostly offset by increased aggregates volumes serving other markets.
•Cost of revenues increased 31.4%, primarily due to higher volumes from the acquired Cherry business. As a percent of revenues, cost of revenues decreased to 75.8% compared to 77.8%.
•Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 52.7% primarily due to additional costs from the acquired Cherry business. Selling, general, and administrative costs in the legacy businesses were lower than the previous period.
•Operating profit increased by 41.7%, outpacing the increase in revenues.
•Depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense increased primarily due to the acquired Cherry business.
2019 versus 2018
•Revenues increased 50.4%, driven by the acquisition of ACG Materials (“ACG”), which increased revenues by approximately 50%. In our legacy aggregates and specialty materials businesses, increased volumes were substantially offset by lower average selling prices, largely in our natural aggregates business in the Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas market area.
•Cost of revenues increased 61.0%, primarily due to the acquired ACG business as well as increased volumes in our legacy aggregates and specialty materials businesses.
•Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 52.9% primarily due to additional costs from the acquired ACG business.
•Operating profit increased primarily due to the acquired ACG business. Operating margin decreased reflecting the change in product mix as a result of the addition of the ACG business, which has lower margins than the segment, as well as lower average selling prices in the legacy natural aggregates business.
•Depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense increased primarily due to the acquired ACG business.
Engineered Structures
2020 versus 2019
•Revenues increased 4.9% driven primarily by higher volumes in utility structures and sales from our acquired traffic and telecom structures businesses, partially offset by lower steel prices in utility structures and reduced volumes and pricing in our wind towers and storage tank businesses. The lower volumes in our wind towers business was partially due to a temporary idling of one of our facilities in the fourth quarter to invest in a planned product changeover.
•Cost of revenues increased 7.6% driven by the acquired traffic and telecom structures businesses, higher volumes in utility structures, product changeover costs in wind towers, and operational challenges in our utility structures business primarily related to COVID-19. This increase was partially offset by lower volumes in our storage tank business.
•Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 13.9% primarily due to additional costs from acquired businesses.
•Operating profit decreased by 20.4% primarily due to the temporary idling of a wind tower facility and operational challenges in our utility structures business related to COVID-19.
2019 versus 2018
•Revenues increased 7.2%, driven primarily by higher unit volumes in wind towers and higher pricing levels in utility structures. Revenues from other product lines also increased due to higher volumes and pricing levels, partially offset by the elimination of revenues from businesses divested in 2018.
•Cost of revenues increased 1.9%, due primarily to higher overall volumes. The increase was partially offset by the elimination of costs from divested businesses, as well as a $6.1 million finished goods inventory write-off recognized in 2018 related to an order for a single customer in our utility structures business.
•Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased 6.7% primarily due to the elimination of costs from divested businesses and a $2.9 million recovery of bad debt related to a single customer in our utility structures business.
Unsatisfied Performance Obligations (Backlog)
As of December 31, 2020, the backlog for utility, wind, and related structures was $334.0 million compared to $596.8 million as of December 31, 2019. Substantially all of our utility, wind, and related structures backlog is expected to be delivered during the year ending December 31, 2021. Future wind tower orders are subject to uncertainty as PTC eligibility for new wind farm projects is currently in a phase-out period that extends until 2025. Pricing of orders and individual order quantities reflect a market transitioning from PTC incentives. As of December 31, 2020, the backlog for our storage tanks in our Engineered Structures segment was $15.6 million, 94.0% of which is expected to be delivered during the year ending December 31, 2021.
Transportation Products
2020 versus 2019
•Revenues were substantially unchanged as higher barge revenues, driven by increased hopper deliveries, were offset by lower steel components revenues due to decreased deliveries and lower contractual pricing.
•Cost of revenues decreased by 3.2%, primarily due to lower steel component volumes and the elimination of $4.0 million of start-up costs incurred in the prior year related to the re-opening of a previously idled barge manufacturing plant. This was partially offset by higher hopper barge volumes. As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues decreased to 82.4% compared to 85.2% in the prior year period primarily due to improved operating efficiencies in our barge business.
•Selling, general, and administrative expenses were substantially unchanged.
•The segment was negatively impacted by a $5.0 million non-cash impairment charge primarily related to unusable non-operating assets that were scrapped from a barge business acquired in 2018.
•Operating profit increased by 16.7%, outpacing the increase in revenues.
2019 versus 2018
•Revenues increased 19.0%, primarily driven by higher tank barge volumes but partially offset by lower contractual pricing and decreased volumes in steel components.
•Cost of revenues increased 23.8%, driven by higher tank barge volumes, partially offset by lower steel component volumes. Cost of revenues also increased $2.6 million due to start-up costs related to the re-opening of a previously idled barge manufacturing facility, which began delivering barges in the third quarter of 2019.
•Selling, general, and administrative expenses were substantially unchanged.
Unsatisfied Performance Obligations (Backlog)
As of December 31, 2020, the backlog for inland barges was $175.5 million compared to $346.9 million as of December 31, 2019. All of the backlog for inland barges is expected to be delivered during the year ending December 31, 2021.
Corporate
2020 versus 2019
•Corporate overhead costs increased 22.0% primarily due to higher acquisition-related transaction and integration costs of $4.6 million as well as a non-recurring increase in legal expenses of $2.5 million incurred during the third quarter of 2020.
2019 versus 2018
•Corporate overhead costs increased 47.4% primarily due to incremental standalone costs related to the replacement of services and fees previously provided or incurred by Trinity as well as other standalone public company costs.
•Corporate overhead costs prior to the Separation consist of costs not previously allocated to Trinity’s business units and have been allocated to Arcosa based on an analysis of each cost function and the relative benefits received by Arcosa for each of the periods using methods management believes are consistent and reasonable. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for further information.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Arcosa’s primary liquidity requirement consists of funding our business operations, including capital expenditures, working capital investment, and disciplined acquisitions. Our primary sources of liquidity include cash flow from operations, our existing cash balance, availability under the revolving credit facility, and, as necessary, the issuance of additional long-term debt or equity. To the extent we have available liquidity, we may also consider undertaking new capital investment projects, executing additional strategic acquisitions, returning capital to stockholders, or funding other general corporate purposes.
Cash Flows
The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for each of the last three years:

Other Investing and Financing Activities
Revolving Credit Facility
On November 1, 2018, the Company entered into a $400.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to mature in November 2023. On January 2, 2020, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to increase the revolving credit facility from $400.0 million to $500.0 million and add a term loan facility of $150.0 million, in each case with a maturity date of January 2, 2025.
The interest rates under the revolving credit facility and term loan are variable based on LIBOR or an alternate base rate plus a margin. A commitment fee accrues on the average daily unused portion of the revolving facility. The margin for borrowing and commitment fee rate are determined based on Arcosa’s leverage as measured by a consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA ratio. The margin for borrowing ranges from 1.25% to 2.00% and was set at LIBOR plus 1.25% as of December 31, 2020. The commitment fee rate ranges from 0.20% to 0.35% and was set at 0.20% at December 31, 2020.
In March 2020, as a precautionary measure, the Company borrowed $100.0 million under its revolving credit facility to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility considering the uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company subsequently repaid the $100.0 million during the three months ended June 30, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had $100.0 million of outstanding loans borrowed under the facility and there were approximately $28.6 million in letters of credit issued, leaving $371.4 million available for borrowing.
The entire term loan was advanced on January 2, 2020 in connection with the closing of the acquisition of Cherry.
The Company's revolving credit and term loan facilities require the maintenance of certain ratios related to leverage and interest coverage. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all such financial covenants. Borrowings under the credit agreement are guaranteed by certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company.
We believe, based on our current business plans, that our existing cash, available liquidity, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund necessary capital expenditures and operating cash requirements for the foreseeable future. The Company further believes that its financial resources will allow it to manage the anticipated impact of COVID-19 on the Company's business operations for the foreseeable future. The macroeconomic uncertainties posed by COVID-19 are evolving rapidly. Consequently, the Company will continue to evaluate its financial position in light of future developments, particularly those relating to COVID-19.
Repurchase Program
In December 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a new $50 million share repurchase program effective January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2022. The new program replaced the previous program which expired on December 31, 2020. Under the previous program, the Company repurchased 184,772 shares at a cost of $8.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2020, we had letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $28.6 million, of which $26.1 million are expected to expire in 2021, with the remainder in 2022. The majority of our letters of credit obligations support the Company’s various insurance programs and generally renew by their terms each year. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.
Derivative Instruments
In December 2018, the Company entered into an interest rate swap instrument, effective as of January 2, 2019 and expiring in 2023, to reduce the effect of changes in the variable interest rates associated with borrowings under the revolving credit facility. The instrument carried an initial notional amount of $100.0 million, thereby hedging the first $100.0 million of borrowings under the credit facility. The instrument effectively fixes the LIBOR component of the credit facility borrowings at a monthly rate of 2.71%. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has recorded a liability of $7.3 million for the fair value of the instrument, all of which is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. See Note 3 and Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.
Stock-Based Compensation
We have a stock-based compensation plan for our directors, officers, and employees. See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.
Employee Retirement Plans
In 2020, we sponsored an employee savings plan under the 401(k) plan that covered substantially all employees and included a company matching contribution with the investment of the funds directed by the participants. The Company also contributed to a multiemployer defined benefit pension plan under the terms of a collective-bargaining agreement that covered certain union-represented employees at one of our facilities. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.
Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments
As of December 31, 2020, we had the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments:
See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
MD&A discusses our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
We believe the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is measured based on the allocation of the transaction price in a contract to satisfied performance obligations. The transaction price does not include any amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. The following is a description of principal activities from which the Company generates its revenue, separated by reportable segments. Payments for our products and services are generally due within normal commercial terms.
Construction Products
The Construction Products segment recognizes substantially all revenue when the customer has accepted the product and legal title of the product has passed to the customer.
Engineered Structures
Within the Engineered Structures segment, revenue is recognized for our wind tower, certain utility structure, and certain storage tank product lines over time as the products are manufactured using an input approach based on the costs incurred relative to the total estimated costs of production. We recognize revenue over time for these products as they are highly customized to the needs of an individual customer resulting in no alternative use to the Company if not purchased by the customer after the contract is executed, and we have the right to bill the customer for our work performed to date plus at least a reasonable profit margin for work performed. For all other products, revenue is recognized when the customer has accepted the product and legal title of the product has passed to the customer.
Transportation Products
The Transportation Products segment recognizes revenue when the customer has accepted the product and legal title of the product has passed to the customer.
Inventory
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Our policy related to excess and obsolete inventory requires an analysis of inventory at the business unit level on a quarterly basis and the recording of any required adjustments. In assessing the ultimate realization of inventories, we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with the current or committed inventory levels. It is possible that changes in required inventory reserves may occur in the future due to then current market conditions.
Long-lived Assets
We periodically evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used for potential impairment. The carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used is considered impaired only when the carrying value is not recoverable through undiscounted future cash flows and the fair value of the assets is less than their carrying value. Fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks involved or market quotes as available. Impairment losses on long-lived assets held for sale are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced by the estimated cost to dispose of the assets.
Goodwill
Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually, or on an interim basis whenever events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the goodwill might be impaired. The quantitative goodwill impairment test is assessed at the “reporting unit” level by comparing the reporting unit's estimated fair value with the carrying amount of its net assets. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. The goodwill impairment is measured as the excess of the reporting unit's carrying value over its fair value, not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The estimates and judgments that most significantly affect the fair value calculations are assumptions,
consisting of level three inputs, related to revenue and operating profit growth, discount rates, and exit multiples. Based on the Company's annual goodwill impairment test, performed at the reporting unit level as of December 31, 2020, the Company concluded that no impairment charges were determined to be necessary and that none of the reporting units evaluated were at risk of failing the goodwill impairment test. A reporting unit is considered to be at risk if its estimated fair value does not exceed the carrying value of its net assets by 10% or more. See Note 1 and Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.
Given the uncertainties of the economy and its potential impact on our businesses, there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value of our reporting units, made for the purposes of the long-lived asset and goodwill impairment tests, will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. If our assumptions regarding forecasted cash flows are not achieved, it is possible that impairments of goodwill and long-lived assets may be required.
Warranties
The Company provides various express, limited product warranties that generally range from one to five years depending on the product. The warranty costs are estimated using a two-step approach. First, an engineering estimate is made for the cost of all claims that have been asserted by customers. Second, based on historical, accepted claims experience, a cost is accrued for all products still within a warranty period for which no claims have been filed. The Company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized related to products covered by warranties and assesses the adequacy of the resulting reserves on a quarterly basis.
Workers' Compensation
We are effectively self-insured for workers’ compensation claims. A third-party administrator processes all such claims. We accrue our workers’ compensation liability based upon independent actuarial studies. To the extent actuarial assumptions change and claims experience rates differ from historical rates, our liability may change.
Contingencies and Litigation
The Company is involved in claims and lawsuits incidental to our business. Based on information currently available with respect to such claims and lawsuits, including information on claims and lawsuits as to which the Company is aware but for which the Company has not been served with legal process, it is management’s opinion that the ultimate outcome of all such claims and litigation, including settlements, in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition for purposes of financial reporting. However, resolution of certain claims or lawsuits by settlement or otherwise, could impact the operating results of the reporting period in which such resolution occurs.
Environmental
We are involved in various proceedings related to environmental matters. We have provided reserves to cover probable and estimable liabilities with respect to such proceedings, taking into account currently available information and our contractual recourse. However, estimates of future response costs are inherently imprecise. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will not become involved in future environmental litigation or other proceedings or, if we were found to be responsible or liable in any litigation or proceeding, that such costs would not be material to us.
Income Taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and other tax attributes using currently enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the provision for income taxes in the period that includes the enactment date. Management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets, and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted law and tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. The Company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency, and severity of recent losses; a forecast of future profitability; the duration of statutory carryback and carryforward periods; the Company’s experience with tax attributes expiring unused; and tax planning alternatives.
At December 31, 2020, the Company had $20.8 million federal consolidated net operating loss carryforwards, primarily from businesses acquired, and $0.9 million of tax-effected state loss carryforwards remaining. In addition, the Company had $52.5 million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards that will begin to expire in the year 2022. We have established a valuation allowance for state and foreign tax operating losses and credits that we have estimated may not be realizable.
At times, we may claim tax benefits that may be challenged by a tax authority. We recognize tax benefits only for tax positions more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement. A liability for “unrecognized tax benefits” is recorded for any tax benefits claimed in our tax returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“the Act”) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, and created new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we finalized the accounting for the enactment of the Act and recorded an additional $1.5 million benefit, primarily as a result of the true-up of our deferred taxes.
For periods prior to and including the Separation, income taxes as presented herein attribute current and deferred income taxes of the Company's standalone financial statements in a manner that is systematic, rational, and consistent with the asset and liability method prescribed by the Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740 - Income Taxes (“ASC 740”). Accordingly, Arcosa’s income tax provision has been prepared following the separate return method. The separate return method applies ASC 740 to the standalone financial statements of each member of the consolidated group as if the group member were a separate taxpayer and a standalone enterprise. As a result, actual tax transactions included in the consolidated financial statements of Trinity may not be included in the separate financial statements of Arcosa. Similarly, the tax treatment of certain items reflected in the separate financial statements of Arcosa may not be reflected in the consolidated financial statements and tax returns of Trinity; therefore, such items as net operating losses, credit carryforwards, and valuation allowances may exist in the standalone financial statements that may or may not exist in Trinity’s consolidated financial statements.
