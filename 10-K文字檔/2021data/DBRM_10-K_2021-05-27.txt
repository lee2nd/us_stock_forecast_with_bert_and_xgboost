Introduction and Overview
We are an independent crude oil and natural gas exploration, development and production company. Our basic business model is to increase shareholder value by finding and developing crude oil and natural gas reserves through exploration and development activities, and selling the production from those reserves at a profit. To be successful, we must, over time, be able to find crude oil and natural gas reserves and then sell the resulting production at a price that is sufficient to cover our finding costs, operating expenses, administrative costs and interest expense, plus offer us a return on our capital investment. A secondary means of generating returns can include the sale of either producing or non-producing lease properties.
Our long-term success depends on, among many other factors, the successful acquisition and drilling of commercial grade crude oil and natural gas properties as well as the prevailing sales prices for crude oil and natural gas along with associated operating expenses. The volatile nature of the energy markets makes it difficult to estimate future prices of crude oil and natural gas; however, any prolonged period of depressed prices, such as we are now experiencing, will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
Our operations are focused on identifying and evaluating prospective crude oil and natural gas properties and funding projects that we believe have the potential to produce crude oil or natural gas in commercial quantities. We conduct all of our drilling, exploration and production activities in the United States, and all of our revenues are derived from sales to customers within the United States. We are currently in the process of developing a multi-well oilfield projects in Kern County, California and an exploratory project in Michigan.
Our management cannot provide any assurances that Daybreak will ever operate profitably. While we have positive cash flow from our crude oil operations in California, we have not yet generated sustainable positive cash flow or earnings on a company-wide basis. As a small company, we are more susceptible to the numerous business, investment and industry risks that have been more fully described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021.
Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, crude oil is shown in barrels (“Bbls”); natural gas is shown in thousands of cubic feet (“Mcf”) or British Thermal Units (“BTU”) unless otherwise specified, and hydrocarbon totals are expressed in barrels of oil equivalent (“BOE”).
Year-to-Date Results
Below is brief summary of our crude oil and natural gas projects in California and Michigan. Refer to our discussion in Item 2. Properties, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on our East Slopes Project in Kern County, California.
Kern County, California (East Slopes Project)
The East Slopes Project is located in the southeastern part of the San Joaquin Basin near Bakersfield, California. Drilling targets are porous and permeable sandstone reservoirs that exist at depths of 1,200 feet to 4,500 feet. Since January 2009, we have participated in the drilling of 25 wells in this project. The crude oil produced from our acreage in the Vedder Sand is considered heavy crude oil. The produced crude oil ranges from 14° to 16° API gravity and must be heated to separate and remove water prior to sale. During the twelve months ended February 28, 2021 we had production from 20 vertical crude oil wells. Our average working interest and NRI in these 20 wells is 36.6% and 28.4%, respectively. We have been the Operator at the East Slopes Project since March 2009.
Michigan Acreage Acquisition
In January 2017, we acquired a 30% working interest in 1,400 acres in the Michigan Basin. The leases have been secured and multiple targets were identified through a 2-D seismic interpretation. A 3-D seismic survey was obtained in January and February of 2017 on the first prospect. An analysis of the 3-D seismic survey confirmed the first prospect originally identified on the 2-D seismic, as well as several additional drilling locations. We have plans to obtain an additional 3-D survey on the second prospect after drilling a well on the first prospect, however; the two prospects are independent of each other and the success or failure of either one does not effect the other. The wells will be drilled vertically with conventional completions and no hydraulic fracturing is anticipated. With the settlement of our debt obligations in December 2018 with Maximilian, our former lender, the Company acquired an additional 40% working interest, bringing our aggregate working interest in Michigan to 70%.
Results of Operations - For the years ended February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020
California Crude Oil Prices
The price we receive for crude oil sales in California is based on prices posted for Midway-Sunset crude oil delivery contracts, contracts, less deductions that vary by grade of crude oil sold and transportation costs. The posted Midway-Sunset price generally moves in correlation to, and at a discount to, prices quoted on the New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) for spot West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) Cushing, Oklahoma delivery contracts. We do not have any natural gas revenues in California.
There continues to be a significant amount of volatility in hydrocarbon prices and a dramatic decline in our realized sale price of crude oil since June of 2014, when the monthly average price of WTI oil was $105.79 per barrel and our realized price per barrel of crude oil was $98.78. As an example, for the month of April 2020, the monthly average price of WTI crude oil was $16.55 and our monthly realized price was $16.96 per barrel. This volatility in crude oil prices continued throughout most of the 2020-2021 fiscal year. The volatility and decline in the price of crude oil has had a substantial negative impact on our profitability and cash flow from our producing California properties.
It is beyond our ability to accurately predict how long crude oil prices will continue to remain at these lower price levels; when or at what level they may begin to stabilize; or if they may start to rebound as there are many factors beyond our control such as the current COVID-19 restrictions that influence the price we receive on our crude oil sales.
A comparison of the average WTI price and average realized crude oil sales price at our East Slopes Project in California for the twelve months ended February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020 is shown in the table below:
For the twelve months ended February 28, 2021, the average WTI price was $39.48 and our average realized crude oil sale price was $36.91, representing a discount of $2.57 per barrel or 6.5% lower than the average WTI price. In comparison, for the twelve months ended February 29, 2020, the average WTI price was $57.13 and our average realized sale price was $60.25 representing a premium of $3.12 per barrel or 5.5% higher than the average WTI price.
Historically, the sale price we receive for California heavy crude oil has been less than the quoted WTI price because of the lower API gravity of our California crude oil in comparison to the API gravity of WTI crude oil. It is beyond our control and ability to accurately predict how long hydrocarbon prices will continue to decline; when or at what level they may begin to stabilize; or when they may start to rebound as there are many factors beyond our control that dictate the price we receive on our hydrocarbon sales.
California Crude Oil Revenue and Production
Crude oil sales revenue in California for the twelve months ended February 28, 2021 decreased $258,611 or 39.0% to $404,901 in comparison to revenue of $663,512 for the twelve months ended February 29, 2020. The average sale price of a barrel of crude oil for the twelve months ended February 28, 2021 was $36.91 in comparison to $60.25 for the twelve months ended February 29, 2020. The decrease of $23.34 or 38.7% in the average realized price of a barrel of crude oil accounted for 99.4% of the decrease in crude oil revenue for the twelve months ended February 28, 2021.
Our net sales volume for the twelve months ended February 28, 2021 was 10,970 barrels of crude oil in comparison to 11,013 barrels sold for the twelve months ended February 29, 2020. This decrease in crude oil sales volume of 43 barrels or 0.4% accounted for 0.6% of the decrease in crude oil revenue for the twelve months ended February 28, 2021 and was primarily due to the natural decline in reservoir pressure during the twelve months ended February 28, 2021.
The gravity of our produced oil in California ranges between 14° API and 16° API. Production for the twelve months ended February 28, 2021 was from 20 wells resulting in 7,288 well days of production in comparison to 7,167 well days of production for the twelve months ended February 29, 2020.
Our crude oil sales revenue from California is set forth in the table below:
*Our average realized sale price on a BOE basis for the twelve months ended February 28, 2021 was $36.91 in comparison to $60.25 for the twelve months ended February 29, 2020, representing a decrease of $23.34 or 38.7% per barrel.
Of the $258,611 or 39.0% decrease in revenue for twelve months ended February 28, 2021, approximately $257,007 or 99.4% can be attributed to the decrease in the realized price of crude oil and $1,604 or 0.6% can be attributed to the decline in production volume.
Operating Expenses
Total operating expenses decreased $185,872 or 19.8% to $753,708 for the twelve months ended February 28, 2021 in comparison to $939,580 for the twelve months ended February 29, 2020. Our operating expenses are set forth in the table below:
Production expenses include expenses associated with the production of crude oil and natural gas. These expenses include pumper salaries, electricity, road maintenance, control of well insurance, property taxes and well maintenance and workover expenses; and, relate directly to the number of wells that are on production. For the twelve months ended February 28, 2021, these expenses increased $6,876, or 3.8% to $187,858 in comparison to $180,982 for the twelve months ended February 29, 2020. We had 20 wells on production in California for the twelve months ended February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020. Production expenses on a BOE basis in California for the twelve months ended February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020 were $17.12 and $16.43, respectively. Production expenses represented 24.9% and 19.3% of total operating expenses for the twelve months ended February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020, respectively.
Exploration and drilling expenses include geological and geophysical (“G&G”) expenses as well as leasehold maintenance, plugging and abandonment (“P&A”) expenses and dry hole expenses. These expenses decreased $40 to $83 for the twelve months ended February 28, 2021 in comparison to $123 for the twelve months ended February 29, 2020. Exploration and drilling expenses represented 0.0% and 0.0% of total operating expenses for the twelve months ended February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020, respectively.
Depreciation, Depletion, Amortization (“DD&A”) expense relates to equipment, proven reserves and property costs, and is another component of operating expenses. These expenses increased $4,620 or 8.3% to $60,063 for the twelve months ended February 28, 2021 in comparison to $55,443 for the twelve months ended February 29, 2020. The primary reason for the increase in DD&A expense was due to lower realized crude oil prices thus decreasing the estimated economic life of our reserves in comparison to our reserve report from the prior year. On a BOE basis, DD&A expense in California for the twelve months ended February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020 was $5.48 and $5.03, respectively. DD&A expenses represented 8.0% and 5.9% of total operating expenses for the twelve months ended February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020, respectively.
General and administrative (“G&A”) expenses decreased $197,328 or 28.1% to $505,704 for the twelve months ended February 28, 2021 in comparison to $703,032 for the twelve months ended February 29, 2020. The decline in G&A expenses was primary due to a decrease in the salary expense of management and employees. Due to a decline in cash flow because of lower realized crude oil prices during the twelve months ended February 28, 2021, certain employees of the Company were laid-off, while other employees had their salaries partially reduced or temporarily suspended. Other items included in our G&A expenses are legal and accounting expenses, investor relations fees, travel expenses, insurance, Sarbanes-Oxley (“SOX”) compliance expenses and other administrative expenses necessary for an operator of oil and gas properties as well as for the management a public company. For the year ended February 28, 2021, we received, as Operator of the East Slopes project in California, administrative overhead reimbursement of $53,287, which was used to directly offset certain employee salaries. We are continuing a program of reducing all of our G&A costs wherever possible. G&A expenses represented 67.1% and 74.8% of total operating expenses for the twelve months ended February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020, respectively.
Other expense, net decreased 315,118 or 65.8% to $163,458 for the twelve months ended February 28, 2020 in comparison to $478,576 for the twelve months ended February 29, 2020. The primary reason for the decrease was lower interest expense as well as the recognition of loan forgiveness in relation to the Small Business Administration (SBA) paycheck protection program (PPP) loan that we received during the twelve months ended February 28, 2021 in the amount of $74,355.
Due to the nature of our business, we expect that revenues, as well as all categories of expenses, will continue to fluctuate substantially quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. Our revenues are dependent upon both hydrocarbon production levels and the price we receive for hydrocarbon sales. This revenue is subject to the volatility of hydrocarbon prices and the material adverse impact of lower crude oil prices on our revenues cannot be overstated. For the twelve months ended February 28, 2021 our sales volume of crude oil declined 43 barrels or 0.4% while our crude oil revenues decreased $258,611 or 39.0%. Production costs will fluctuate according to the number and percentage ownership of producing wells, as well as the amount of revenues being contributed by such wells. Exploration and drilling expenses will be dependent upon the amount of capital that we have to invest in future development projects, as well as the success or failure of such projects. Likewise, the amount of DD&A expense will depend upon the factors cited above, plus the size of our proven reserve base and the market price of energy products. G&A expenses will also fluctuate based on our current requirements, but will generally tend to increase as we expand the business operations of the Company. An on-going goal of the Company is to improve cash flow to cover the current level of G&A expenses; to fund our development drilling in California; and, future drilling programs in Michigan and other geographic locations.
Capital Resources and Liquidity
Our primary financial resource is our base of crude oil reserves. Our ability to fund our capital expenditure program is dependent upon the prices we receive from our crude oil and natural gas sales; the success of our exploration program in Michigan; and the availability of capital resource financing. We do not plan to invest any new capital investments within the East Slopes Project area in the 2021-2022 fiscal year if no new financing is in place. If new financing is secured, we plan to drill four development wells for a total of $525,000.
Factors such as changes in operating margins and the availability of capital resources could increase or decrease our ultimate level of expenditures during the next fiscal year.
Changes in our capital resources at February 28, 2021 are set forth in the table below:
Our working capital deficit increased $362,557 or 9.5% from a deficit of approximately $3.8 million at February 29, 2020 to a deficit of approximately $4.2 million at February 28, 2021. The increase in the working capital deficit was due to a decrease in cash offset by an increase in our accounts receivable combined with an increase in accounts payable and accrued interest. While for most of the twelve months ended February 28, 2021, we continued to have ongoing positive cash flow from our crude oil operations in California, we were unable to generate sufficient cash flow to cover all of our general and administrative (“G&A”) and interest expense requirements.
Our business is capital intensive. Our ability to grow is dependent upon favorably obtaining outside capital and generating cash flows from operating activities necessary to fund our investment activities. There is no assurance that we will be able to achieve profitability. Since our future operations will continue to be dependent on successful exploration and development activities and our ability to seek and secure capital from external sources, should we be unable to achieve sustainable profitability this could cause any equity investment in the Company to become worthless.
Major sources of funds in the past for us have included the debt or equity markets. We will have to rely on the capital markets to fund future operations and growth. Our business model is focused on acquiring exploration or development properties as well as existing production. Our ability to generate future revenues and operating cash flow will depend on successful exploration, and/or acquisition of crude oil and natural gas producing properties, which will require us to continue to raise equity or debt capital from outside sources.
Daybreak has ongoing capital commitments to develop certain leases pursuant to their underlying terms. Failure to meet such ongoing commitments may result in the loss of the right to participate in future drilling on certain leases or the loss of the lease itself. These ongoing capital commitments may also cause us to seek additional capital from sources outside of the Company. The current uncertainty in the credit and capital markets, as well as the instability and volatility in crude oil prices since June of 2014 has restricted our ability to obtain needed capital. No assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain funding under any loan commitments or any additional financing on favorable terms, if at all.
The Company’s financial statements for the twelve months ended February 28, 2021 have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have incurred a cumulative net loss since entering the crude oil and natural gas exploration industry in 2005. As of February 28, 2021, we have an accumulated deficit of approximately $29.4 million and a working capital deficit of approximately $4.2 million which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
In this current fiscal year, we will continue to seek additional financing for our planned exploration and development activities in California and Michigan. We could obtain financing through one or more various methods, including issuing debt securities, equity securities, bank debt, or combinations of these instruments which could result in dilution to existing security holders and increased debt and leverage. No assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain funding under any loan commitments or any additional financing on favorable terms, if at all. Sales of interests in our assets may be another source of cash flow.
Cash Flows
Changes in the net funds provided by or (used in) each of our operating, investing and financing activities are set forth in the table below:
Cash Flow Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities
Cash flow from operating activities is derived from the production of our crude oil reserves and changes in the balances of non-cash accounts, receivables, payables or other non-energy property asset account balances. Cash flow used in our operating activities for the twelve months ended February 28, 2021 was $143,526 in comparison to cash flow provided by our operating activities of $41,291 for the twelve months ended February 29, 2020. Changes in our cash flow operating activities for the twelve months ended February 28, 2021 in comparison to the twelve months ended February 29, 2020 were $184,817 and consisted of decreases in our non-cash expenses of $319,101, primarily from amortization of debt discount and the forgiveness of our PPP loan; increases in our accounts receivable balances of $128,145; increases of $43,335 in our prepaid expenses; decreases in our account payable and accrued interest balances of $23,285 and the decrease in our net loss for the year of $242,379. Variations in cash flow from operating activities may impact our level of exploration and development expenditures.
Our expenditures in operating activities consist primarily of exploration and drilling expenses, production expenses, geological, geophysical and engineering services and maintenance of existing mineral leases. Our expenses also consist of consulting and professional services, employee compensation, legal, accounting, travel and other G&A expenses that we have incurred in order to address normal and necessary business activities of a public company in the crude oil exploration and production industry.
Cash Flow Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities
Cash flow from investing activities is derived from changes in oil and gas property balances and any lending activities. We had no cash flow from investing activities for the twelve months ended February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020, respectively.
Cash Flow Provided by Financing Activities
Cash flow from financing activities is derived from changes in long-term liability account balances or in equity account balances excluding retained earnings. Cash flow provided by our financing activities was $83,011 for the twelve months ended February 28, 2021 in comparison to $22,674 for the twelve months ended February 29, 2020. For the twelve months ended February 28, 2021, we received $74,355 under the paycheck protection program (PPP). For the twelve months ended February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020, we made payments of $60,000, respectively, on the UBS Bank line of credit balances. We received advances of $74,000 from our line of credit with UBS Bank during the twelve months ended February 29, 2020. Additionally during the twelve months ended February 28, 2021, we received $144,619 from a related party note payable. During the twelve months ended February 29, 2020, we received $27,835 from a related party in the form of a convertible note payable. Finally, we made insurance premium financing payments of $74,553 and $19,161 during the twelve months ended February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020, respectively. The following is a summary of the Company’s financing activities for the twelve months ended February 28, 2021.
Current debt (short-term borrowings)
Related Party
The Company’s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer had loaned to the Company in previous fiscal years an aggregate $250,100 that was used for a variety of corporate purposes. During the twelve months ended February 29, 2020, in connection with its debt reduction efforts, the Company entered into a Note Payoff Agreement with this related party. Pursuant to the Note Payoff Agreement, the Company issued as payment in full of the Notes, a production payment interest in certain of the Company’s production revenue from the drilling of future wells in California and Michigan. The production payment interest was granted for a deemed consideration amount of the balance of the Notes and made pursuant to a Production Payment Interest Purchase Agreement dated as of August 22, 2019. The grant was made on the same terms as the Company has sold production payment interests to other third parties in the 2018-2019 fiscal year pursuant to its previously disclosed program. For further information on the production revenue program refer to the “Production Revenue Payable” section below.
Convertible Promissory Note
During the twelve months ended February 29, 2020, the Company’s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer loaned the Company $27,835 for general operating expenses under a Convertible Note Purchase Agreement. The Note had a maturity date of 180 days, or July 12, 2020 and carried no interest, fees or penalties. On July 13, 2020, the note payable was converted to 6,958,758 shares of the Company’s common stock. The note payable had a conversion price of $0.004 per share.
12% Subordinated Notes
The Company’s 12% Subordinated Notes (“the Notes”) issued pursuant to a January 2010 private placement offering to accredited investors, resulted in $595,000 in gross proceeds (of which $250,000 was from a related party) to the Company and accrue interest at 12% per annum, payable semi-annually on January 29th and July 29th. On January 29, 2015, the Company and 12 of the 13 holders of the Notes agreed to extend the maturity date of the Notes for an additional two years to January 29, 2017. Effective January 29, 2017, the maturity date of the Notes was extended for an additional two years to January 29, 2019. The 980,000 warrants held by ten noteholders expired on January 29, 2019.
The Company has informed the Note holders that the payment of principal and final interest will be late and is subject to future financing being completed. The Notes principal of $565,000 was payable in full at the amended maturity date of the Notes, and has not been paid. Interest continues to accrue on the unpaid $565,000 principal balance. The terms of the Notes, state that should the Board of Directors, on any future maturity date, decide that the payment of the principal and any unpaid interest would impair the financial condition or operations of the Company, the Company may then elect a mandatory conversion of the unpaid principal and interest into the Company’s common stock at a conversion rate equal to 75% of the average closing price of the Company’s common stock over the 20 consecutive trading days preceding December 31, 2018. The accrued interest on the 12% Notes at February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020 was $340,042 and $272,428, respectively.
12% Note balances at February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020 are set forth in the table below:
The accrued interest owed on the 12% Subordinated Note to the related party is presented on the Company’s Balance Sheets under the caption Accounts payable - related party rather than under the caption Accrued interest.
Line of Credit
The Company has an existing $890,000 line of credit for working capital purposes with UBS Bank USA (“UBS”), established pursuant to a Credit Line Agreement dated October 24, 2011 that is secured by the personal guarantee of our President and Chief Executive Officer. On July 10, 2017, a $700,000 portion of the outstanding credit line balance was converted to a 24-month fixed term annual interest rate of 3.244% with interest payable monthly. On July 10, 2019, the 24-month fixed term loan amount of $700,000 was renewed at the same annual percentage interest rate of 3.244% for an additional 24 months. The remaining balance of the credit line has a stated reference rate of 0.249% + 337.5 basis points with interest payable monthly. The reference rate is based on the 30-day LIBOR (“London Interbank Offered Rate”) and is subject to change from UBS.
During the twelve months ended February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020, we received advances on the line of credit of $-0- and $74,000, respectively. During the twelve months ended February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020, the Company made payments to the line of credit of $60,000 and $60,000, respectively. Interest converted to principal for the twelve months ended February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020 was $28,503 and $31,548, respectively. At February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020, the line of credit had an outstanding balance of $840,904 and $872,401, respectively.
Note Payable
In December 2018, the Company was able to settle an outstanding balance owed to one of its third-party vendors. This settlement resulted in a $120,000 note payable being issued to the vendor. Additionally, the Company agreed to issue 2,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock as a part of the settlement agreement. Based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of the settlement agreement, the value of the common stock transaction was determined to be $6,000. The common stock shares were issued during the twelve months ended February 29, 2020. The note has a maturity date of January 1, 2022 and bears an interest rate of 10% rate per annum. Monthly interest is accrued and payable on January 1st of each anniversary date until maturity of the note. At February 28, 2021, the accrued interest had not been paid and was outstanding. The accrued interest on the Note was $26,000 and $14,000 at February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020, respectively.
Production Revenue Payable
Since December 2018, the Company has been conducting a fundraising program to fund the drilling of future wells in California and Michigan and to settle some of its existing historical debt. The purchasers of production payment interests receive a production revenue payment on future wells to be drilled in California and Michigan in exchange for their purchase. On August 22, 2019, the Company entered into a Note Payoff Agreement with the Company’s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer as payment in full of the $250,100 that had been loaned to the Company during the years ended February 29, 2012 and February 28, 2013. Pursuant to the Note Payoff Agreement, the Company issued a production payment interest in certain of the Company’s production revenue from the drilling of future wells in California and Michigan. The production payment interest was granted for a deemed consideration amount of the balance of the Notes. The grant was made on the same terms as the Company has sold production payment interests to other third parties in the 2018-2019 fiscal year pursuant to its previously disclosed program. As of February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020, the production revenue payment program balance was $950,100, respectively, of which $550,100, respectively, was owed to a related party - the Company’s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.
The production payment interest entitles the purchasers to receive production payments equal to twice their original amount paid, payable from a percentage of the Company’s future net production payments from wells drilled after the date of the purchase and until the Production Payment Target (as described below) is met. The Company shall pay fifty percent (50%) of its net production payments from the relevant wells to the purchasers until each purchaser has received two times the purchase price (the “Production Payment Target”). Once the Company pays the purchasers amounts equal to the Production Payment Target, it shall thereafter pay a pro-rated eight percent (8%) of $1.3 million on its net production payments from the relevant wells to each of the purchasers. However, if the total raised is less than the target $1.3 million, then the payment will be a proportionate amount of the eight percent (8%). Additionally, if the Production Payment Target is not met within the first three years, the Company shall pay seventy-five percent (75%) of its production payments from the relevant wells to the purchasers until the Production Payment Target is met. At February 28, 2021, the Production Payment Target has not been met within the original three years and all future payments will be at the seventy-five percent (75%) rate.
The Company accounted for the amounts received from these sales in accordance with ASC 470-10-25 and 470-10-35 which require amounts recorded as debt to be amortized under the interest method as described in ASC 835-30, Interest Method. Consequently, the program balance of $950,100 has been recognized as a production revenue payable. The Company determined an effective interest rate based on future expected cash flows to be paid to the holders of the production payment interests. This rate represents the discount rate that equates estimated cash flows with the initial proceeds received from the sales and is used to compute the amount of interest to be recognized each period. Estimating the future cash outflows under this agreement requires the Company to make certain estimates and assumptions about future revenues and payments and such estimates are subject to significant variability. Therefore, the estimates are likely to change which may result in future adjustments to the accretion of the interest expense and the amortized cost based carrying value of the related payables.
Accordingly, the Company has estimated the cash flows associated with the production revenue payments and determined a discount of $1,050,158 as of February 28, 2021, which is being accounted as interest expense over the estimated period over which payments will be made based on expected future revenue streams. For the twelve months ended February 28, 2020 and February 29, 2020, amortization of the debt discount on these payables amounted to $115,151 and $361,583, respectively, which has been included in interest expense in the statements of operations.
Production revenue payable balances at February 28, 2020 and February 29, 2020 are set forth in the table below:
Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) Loan
On March 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act commonly referred to as the CARES Act. One component of the CARES Act was the first draw paycheck protection program (“PPP”) which provides small business with the resources needed to maintain their payroll and cover applicable overhead. The PPP is implemented by the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) with support from the Department of the Treasury. The PPP provides funds to pay up to eight weeks of payroll costs including benefits. Funds can also be used to pay interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities. We applied for, and were accepted to participate in this program. On May 11, 2020, we received funding for $74,355. We used all the loan proceeds to partially subsidize direct payroll expenses.
The loan is a two-year loan with a maturity date of May 5, 2022. The loan bears an annual interest rate of 1%. The loan shall be payable monthly with the first six monthly payments deferred. On February 12, 2021, we applied for loan forgiveness under the provisions of Section 1106 of the CARES Act. Loan forgiveness is subject to the sole approval of the SBA. On February 23, 2021, the SBA notified our lender that the loan was forgiven.
On March 4, 2021, we applied for, and were accepted to participate in the SBA Second Draw PPP program. On March 15, 2021, we received funding for $72,800. It is the Company’s intent to apply for loan forgiveness for the Second Draw PPP loan. Loan forgiveness is subject to the sole approval of the SBA. The Company is eligible for loan forgiveness in an amount equal to payments made during the 24-week period beginning on the loan date, with the exception that no more than 25.0% of the amount of loan forgiveness may be for certain expenses other than payroll expenses. We intend to use all the loan proceeds to partially subsidize direct payroll expenses.
Note Payable - Related Party
On December 22, 2020, the Company entered into a Secured Promissory Note (the “Note”), as borrower, with James Forrest Westmoreland and Angela Marie Westmoreland, Co-Trustees of the James and Angela Westmoreland Revocable Trust, or its assigns (the “Noteholder”), as the lender. James F. Westmoreland is the Company’s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Pursuant to the Note, the Noteholder loaned the Company an aggregate principal amount of $155,548. After the deduction of loan fees of $10,929 the net proceeds from the loan were $144,619. The loan fees are being amortized as original issue discount (OID) over the term of the loan. The interest rate of the loan is 2.25%. The Note requires monthly payments on the Note balance until repaid in full. The maturity date of the Note is December 21, 2035. For the twelve months ended February 28, 2021, the Company made principal payments of $1,410 and amortized debt discount of $121. The obligations under the Note are secured by a lien on and security interest in the Company’s oil and gas assets located in Kern County, California, as described in a Deed of Trust entered into by the Company in favor of the Noteholder to secure the obligations under the Note. Such lien shall be a first priority lien, subject only to a pre-existing lien filed by a working interest partner of the Company.
The proceeds of the Note are to be used for general working capital of the Company. The Company may prepay the Note at any time. Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default and expiration of any applicable cure period, and at any time thereafter during the continuance of such Event of Default, the Noteholder may at its option, by written notice to the Company: (a) declare the entire principal amount of the Note, together with all accrued interest thereon and all other amounts payable hereunder, immediately due and payable; (b) exercise any of its remedies with respect to the collateral set forth in the Deed of Trust; and/or (c) exercise any or all of its other rights, powers or remedies under applicable law.

Encumbrances
On October 17, 2018, a working interest partner in California filed a UCC financing statement in regards to payable amounts owed to the partner by the Company. As of February 28, 2021, we had no encumbrances on our crude oil project in Michigan.
Capital Commitments
Daybreak has ongoing capital commitments to develop certain oil and gas leases pursuant to their underlying terms. Failure to meet such ongoing commitments may result in the loss of the right to participate in future drilling on certain leases or the loss of the lease itself. These ongoing capital commitments may also cause us to seek additional capital from sources outside of the Company. The current uncertainty in the credit and capital markets, and the economic downturn, may restrict our ability to obtain needed capital.
Leases
The Company leases approximately 988 rentable square feet of office space from an unaffiliated third party for our corporate office located in Spokane Valley, Washington. Additionally, we lease approximately 416 and 695 rentable square feet from unaffiliated third parties for our regional operations office in Friendswood, Texas and storage and auxiliary office space in Wallace, Idaho, respectively. The lease in Friendswood is a 12-month lease that expires in October 2021 and as such is considered a short-term lease. The Company has elected to not apply the recognition requirements of ASC 842 to this short-term lease. The Spokane Valley and Wallace leases are currently on a month-to-month basis. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees, restrictive covenants or variable lease payments. The Company has not entered into any financing leases.
The Balance Sheet classification of lease assets and liabilities was as follows:
Rent expense for the twelve months ended February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020 was $23,589 and $23,489, respectively.
Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves
Daybreak’s total net proved developed and undeveloped crude oil reserves on a per barrel of oil equivalent (“BOE”) basis decreased by 61,754 BOE, or 12.5%, to 434,223 BOE at February 28, 2021 compared to 495,977 BOE at February 29, 2020. These reserves are all located in our California East Slopes project. The primary reason for the overall decrease in our total proven reserves was primarily due to lower hydrocarbon prices from the past year lowering the economic life our wells. The year-to-year reserve decrease consisted of a 18,659 barrel or 16.4% decrease in our PDP reserves and a 43,095 barrel or 11.3% decrease in our PUD reserves. Our production of PDP reserves for the year ended February 28, 2021 was 10,970 BOE and was a part of the overall decline in PDP reserves. The 43,095 decrease in the PUD reserves was all due to downward revisions again because of lower crude oil prices in the past year. Our reserves were fully engineered by PGH Petroleum and Environmental Engineers, LLC of Austin, Texas in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles and definitions and guidelines established by the SEC. For further information on our reserve report, refer to exhibit 99.1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Changes in Financial Condition
During the year ended February 28, 2021, we received crude oil sales revenue from 20 wells in our East Slopes Project in Kern County, California. Our commitment to improving corporate profitability remains unchanged. Since June 2014, there has been significant volatility and uncertainty in the WTI price of crude oil and correspondently in the realized price we receive from oil sales. This volatility in the price of crude oil has created a substantial negative impact on the cash flow of our producing crude oil properties in California. During the twelve months ended February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020, crude oil revenue from California was $404,901 and $663,512, respectively. Of the $258,611 decrease in revenue during the twelve months ended February 28, 2021, $257,007 or 99.4% can be attributed to the decline in our realized crude oil sales price and $1,604 or 0.6% can be attributed to the decline in our sales volume. For the twelve months ended February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020, we had an operating loss of $348,807 and $276,068, respectively.
Our balance sheet at February 28, 2021 reflects total assets of approximately $0.91 million, a decrease of approximately $5,000 in comparison to approximately $0.92 million at February 29, 2020. This decrease of approximately $5,000 in total assets was due increases in accounts receivable offset by a decrease in cash and lower crude oil property balances in California.
At February 28, 2021, total liabilities were approximately $6.0 million, an increase of approximately $0.4 million in comparison to approximately $5.6 million at February 28, 2019. This increase was primarily due to increases in payables and in debt with related parties.
Common Stock shares issued and outstanding at February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020 were 60,491,122 and 53,532,364. The 6,958,758 share increase in common stock was due to a conversion of debt to common stock from a related party. There was no change in the amount of Series A Preferred Stock shares issued and outstanding of 709,568 for the twelve months ended February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020.
Accumulated Deficit
Our financial statements for the twelve months ended February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020 have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. Our financial statements show that the Company has incurred significant operating losses that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from this uncertainty.
The increase in the accumulated deficit from approximately $28.9 million at February 29, 2020 to $29.4 million at February 28, 2021 was primarily due to the net loss for the year of $0.5 million.
Cash Balance
We maintain our cash balance by increasing or decreasing our exploration and drilling expenditures as limited by availability of cash from operations, investments and capital resource funding. Our cash balances were $33,528 and $94,043 at February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020, respectively.
Crude oil and natural gas revenues
Crude oil revenues decreased $258,611 or 39.0% to $404,901 for the twelve months ended February 28, 2021 in comparison to $663,512 for the twelve months ended February 29, 20209. Of the $258,611 decrease in revenue during the twelve months ended February 28, 2021, $257,007 or 99.4% can be attributed to the decline in our realized crude oil sales price and $1,604 or 0.6% can be attributed to the decline in sales volume.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses for the twelve months ended February 28, 2021 decreased by $185,872 or 19.8% to approximately $754,000 in comparison to approximately $940,000 for the year ended February 29, 2020.
Operating Loss
For the twelve months ended February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020, we reported an operating loss of $348,807 and $276,068, respectively. The increase in the operating loss for the twelve months ended February 28, 2021 of $72,739 was primary due to lower realized sale prices of our crude oil.
Net Loss
Since entering the crude oil and natural gas exploration industry, we have incurred net losses with periodic negative cash flow and have depended on external financing and the sale of crude oil and natural gas assets to sustain our operations. For the twelve months ended February 28, 2021 we reported a net loss of $512,265 in comparison to net loss of $754,644 for the twelve months ended February 29, 2020.
Management Plans to Continue as a Going Concern
We continue to implement plans to enhance Daybreak’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company currently has a net revenue interest in 20 producing crude oil wells in our East Slopes Project located in Kern County, California. The revenue from these wells has created a steady and reliable source of revenue for the Company. Our average working interest in these wells is 36.6% and the average net revenue interest is 28.4%.
We anticipate revenues will continue to increase as the Company participates in the drilling of more wells in the East Slopes Project in California and our project in Michigan. However given the current decline and instability in hydrocarbon prices, the timing of any drilling activity in California will be dependent on a sustained improvement in hydrocarbon prices and a successful refinancing or restructuring of our current credit facility.
We believe that our liquidity will improve when there is a sustained improvement in hydrocarbon prices. Our sources of funds in the past have included the debt or equity markets and the sale of assets. While the Company does have positive cash flow from its crude oil and natural gas properties, it has not yet established a positive cash flow on a company-wide basis. It will be necessary for the Company to obtain additional funding from the private or public debt or equity markets in the future. However, we cannot offer any assurance that we will be successful in executing the aforementioned plans to continue as a going concern.
Summary of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Critical accounting policies are policies that are both most important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and results, and that require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, bad debts, cancellation costs associated with long term commitments, investments, intangible assets, assets subject to disposal, income taxes, service contracts, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates and judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment and available information. These judgments and uncertainties do affect the application of these critical accounting policies. There is a strong likelihood that materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Therefore, actual results could differ from those estimates and could have a material impact on our financial statements, and it is possible that such changes could occur in the near term.
Proved Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves
Proved reserves are defined by the SEC as those quantities of crude oil and natural gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulation before the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether the estimate is a deterministic estimate or probabilistic estimate. Proved developed reserves are proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared with the cost of a new well or through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserve estimates if the extraction is by means not involving a well. Although our external engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves as established by the SEC, the estimation of reserves requires the engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment. Estimated reserves are often subject to future revision, certain of which could be substantial, based on the availability of additional information, including reservoir performance, new geological and geophysical data, additional drilling, technological advancements, price changes and other economic factors. Changes in crude oil and natural gas prices can lead to a decision to start-up or shut-in production, which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities. Reserve revisions inherently lead to adjustments of depreciation rates used by us. We cannot predict the types of reserve revisions that will be required in future periods.
While the estimates of our proved reserves at February 28, 2021 included in this report have been prepared based on what we and our independent reserve engineers believe to be reasonable interpretations of the SEC rules, those estimates could differ materially from our actual results.
Successful Efforts Accounting Method
We use the successful efforts method of accounting for crude oil and natural gas property acquisition, exploration, development, and production activities. Costs to acquire mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas properties, to drill and equip exploratory wells that find proved reserves, and to drill and equip development wells are capitalized as incurred. Costs to drill exploratory wells that are unsuccessful in finding proved reserves are expensed as incurred. In addition, the geological and geophysical costs, and costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties are expensed as incurred. Costs to operate and maintain wells and field equipment are expensed as incurred.
Capitalized proved property acquisition costs are amortized by field using the unit-of-production method based on proved reserves. Capitalized exploration well costs and development costs (plus estimated future dismantlement, surface restoration, and property abandonment costs, net of equipment salvage values) are amortized in a similar fashion (by field) based on their proved developed reserves. Support equipment and other property and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives.
Pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board Codification (“ASC”) Topic 360, “Property, Plant and Equipment,” we review proved oil and natural gas properties and other long-lived assets for impairment. These reviews are predicated by events and circumstances, such as downward revision of the reserve estimates or commodity prices that indicate a decline in the recoverability of the carrying value of such properties. We estimate the future cash flows expected in connection with the properties and compare such future cash flows to the carrying amount of the properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable. When the carrying amounts of the properties exceed their estimated undiscounted future cash flows, the carrying amounts of the properties are reduced to their estimated fair value. The factors used to determine fair value include, but are not limited to, estimates of proved reserves, future commodity prices, the timing of future production, future capital expenditures and a risk-adjusted discount rate. The charge is included in DD&A.
Unproved crude oil and natural gas properties that are individually significant are also periodically assessed for impairment of value. An impairment loss for unproved crude oil and natural gas properties is recognized at the time of impairment by providing an impairment allowance.
On the retirement or sale of a partial unit of proved property, the cost is charged to accumulated DD&A with a resulting gain or loss recognized in income.
Deposits and advances for services expected to be provided for exploration and development or for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas properties are classified as long-term other assets.
Revenue Recognition
Our customer sales contracts include only crude oil sales in California. Each unit (crude oil barrel) of commodity product represents a separate performance obligation which is sold at variable prices, determinable on a monthly basis. The pricing provisions of our crude oil contracts are primarily tied to a market index with certain adjustments based on factors such as delivery, product quality and prevailing supply and demand conditions in the geographic areas in which we operate. We will allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation and recognize revenue upon delivery of the commodity product when the customer obtains control. Control of our produced crude oil volumes passes to our customers when the oil is measured by a trucking oil ticket. The Company has no control over the crude oil after this point and the measurement at this point dictates the amount on which the customer's payment is based. Our crude oil revenue stream includes volumes burdened by royalty and other joint owner working interests. Our revenues are recorded and presented on our financial statements net of the royalty and other joint owner working interests. Our revenue stream does not include any payments for services or ancillary items other than sale of crude oil. We record revenue in the month our crude oil production is delivered to the purchaser.
Suspended Well Costs
We account for any suspended well costs in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 932, “Extractive Activities - Oil and Gas” (“ASC 932”). ASC 932 states that exploratory well costs should continue to be capitalized if: (1) a sufficient quantity of reserves are discovered in the well to justify its completion as a producing well and (2) sufficient progress is made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating feasibility of the well. If the exploratory well costs do not meet both of these criteria, these costs should be expensed, net of any salvage value. Additional annual disclosures are required to provide information about management's evaluation of capitalized exploratory well costs.
In addition, ASC 932 requires annual disclosure of: (1) net changes from period to period of capitalized exploratory well costs for wells that are pending the determination of proved reserves, (2) the amount of exploratory well costs that have been capitalized for a period greater than one year after the completion of drilling and (3) an aging of exploratory well costs suspended for greater than one year, designating the number of wells the aging is related to. Further, the disclosures should describe the activities undertaken to evaluate the reserves and the projects, the information still required to classify the associated reserves as proved and the estimated timing for completing the evaluation.
Share Based Payments
Share based awards are accounted for under FASB Topic ASC 718, “Compensation-Stock Compensation” (“ASC 718”). ASC 718 requires compensation costs for all share-based payments granted to be based on the grant date fair value. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service periods.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of February 28, 2021, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partners, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.
