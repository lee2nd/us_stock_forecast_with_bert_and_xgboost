ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.
Overview
Our products are marketed and available through our website www.gridironMVP.com. We intend to engage a distribution partner that has a sufficient broker network and co-packer/manufacturer in order distribute our products through several channels. We believe there will be an increasing demand for enhanced and functional products in 2021 as consumers look for healthy alternatives to enhance their lifestyle. We expect our brand to capitalize on this and potential consumer demand. We plan to continue to look for opportunities with industrial hemp growers, processors that we can engage in a tolling and/or collaboration agreement. We believe these types of relationships could assist in stabilizing our raw material supply chain as well as give us positive exposure within the marketplace.
Our current business model is in an industry which is highly competitive and most of our competitors are better capitalized than we are and have established markets with greater brand recognition. Our operations do not generate sufficient revenues to pay our operating expenses, and, as discussed below, we do not have ready access to the capital necessary to compete effectively in our segment. While we continue to explore opportunities to expand our current business model, our management has also begun exploring possible opportunities for the Company involving mergers, acquisitions or other business combination transactions in an effort to diversify our business. We are not currently a party to any agreement or understandings with any third parties, and there are no assurances even if our management locates an opportunity which it believes will be in the best interests of our stockholders what we will ever consummate such a transaction. Accordingly, investors should not place undue reliance on these efforts.
Cash Flows
Our financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover our operating costs. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our company obtaining additional capital to fund operating losses until we become profitable. If we are unable to obtain additional capital, we could be forced to significantly curtail or cease operations.
We have only realized nominal revenues from our business. In the next 12 months, we plan to identify business to whom we can license and/or distribute our brand and product(s) as well as seek additional opportunities to continue as a going concern.
COVID-19
In December 2019, a novel strain of COVID-19 was reported in China. Since then, the COVID-19 has spread globally including across North America and the United States. The spread of COVID-19 from China to other countries has resulted in the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring the outbreak of COVID-19 as a “pandemic,” or a worldwide spread of a new disease, on March 11, 2020. Specifically, we caution that our business could be materially and adversely affected by the risks, or the public perception of the risks, related to the outbreak of COVID-19. To date, COVID has directly impacted the ability we have to participate in trade show events and other in-person marketing. The risk of a pandemic, or public perception of the risk, could cause customers to avoid public places, including retail properties, and could cause temporary or long-term disruptions in our supply chains and/or delays in the delivery of our inventory to customers. Further, such risks could also adversely affect retail customers’ financial condition, resulting in reduced spending on premium products.
Critical Accounting Policies
Please refer to Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Results of Operations
Overview. We had revenues of $3,080 and $1,181 for the years ended August 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We incurred a net income (loss) of $1,039,932 and ($2,580,068) for the years ended August 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in net loss of $3,620,000 is attributable to the factors discussed below.
Revenues. We had revenues from operations of $3,080 and $1,181 for the years ended August 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our revenues for the years ended August 31, 2021 and 2020 consisted primarily of our retail line of health water infused with probiotics and minerals and the sale of one liter of T-free distillate. The increase of $1,899 of revenues resulted from the Company selling one liter of T-free distillate during the three months ended November 30, 2020. The extent to which, and the amount of revenues which may be generated from our future business operations and activities is unknown.
Gross Margin. Once cost of revenue and other expenses to generate revenue are considered, we had gross margins of $1,659 and ($1,783) from our operations for the years ended August 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase of $3,442 was a result of the sale of one liter of T-free distillate during the three months ended November 30, 2020.
Expenses. Our operating expenses were $240,650 and $215,094 for the years ended August 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase of $25,556 was primarily attributable to an approximate $54,000 increase professional fees from higher audit fees and legal fees associated with reverse stock split and a potential acquisition and an approximate $10,000 increase in consulting fees due to an agreed upon fee increase for our CEO, offset by an approximate $36,000 decrease in General and Administrative primarily from a $23,000 decrease in insurance cost and an approximate $2,000 decrease in advertising expense.
Other (Income) Expense. Our total other (income) expense was ($1,278,923) and $2,263,191 for the years ended August 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The $3,642,114 decrease in other expenses was attributable to a $1,908,267 decrease in expenses related to our convertible notes payable and preferred stock warrants conversion into Series B preferred stock and interest accretion, a $861,680 decrease in debt/equity issuance costs on no new convertible notes during the years ended August 31, 2021 compared to three new convertible notes payables during the year ended August 31, 2020, a $568,173 decrease in impairment expense from our inventory write-off, a notes receivable and fixed assets during the year ended August 31, 2020, a $336,183 decrease in net interest expense on our notes payable, notes receivable and four convertible notes payable, offset by a $32,189 decrease in other income. As discussed in Note 3 - Exchange Agreement in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company exchanged the preferred stock warrants and convertible notes payable for Series B preferred stock. As a result of the agreement, the derivative liability was reduced to $-0- in other (income) expense.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
For the year ended August 31, 2021, we used net cash of $30,405 for operating activities, primarily attributable to our Participation Agreement with Libertas Funding, LLC. For the year ended August 31, 2021, we were provided $150,000 from financing activities for a short-term promissory note from an investor. We will require additional working capital to continue as a going concern.
Assets
We had total assets of $181,886 as of August 31, 2021, which consisted of $137,476 cash, inventory of $17,000, prepaid expenses of $14,000, equity investment (net of discount) of $11,132, equipment of $598 (net of accumulated depreciation), and trademarks of $1,680. The cash balance includes a short-term promissory note for $150,000 which funded on August 30, 2021.
Liabilities
We had total liabilities of $406,725 as of August 31, 2021 consisting of accounts payable and accrued expenses of $43,930, related party payable of $64,600 due our CEO, note payable, current portion of $160,000, dividends payable of $138,195 for our Series B Convertible Preferred stock issued in April 2021.
As discussed on Note 3 - Exchange Agreement in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in April 2021 we entered into an Exchange Agreement with Calvary Fund I LP (“Calvary Fund”) pursuant to which we agreed to issue Calvary Fund 2,694,514 shares of our newly designated Series B Convertible Preferred Stock in exchange for (i) 8,480,000 shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, (ii) outstanding common stock purchase warrants (the “Warrants”), and (iii) all principal and accrued interest due under outstanding convertible promissory notes. As a result of the agreement, the convertible notes payable, convertible notes payable accrued interest, Series A Preferred stock dividends and derivative liability was reduced to $-0- in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets for an aggregate of $2,588,869.
Cash Requirements
At August 31, 2021, we had a cash balance of $137,476. Such cash amount of $137,476 is not sufficient to continue our 12-month plan of operation. We will need to raise capital to realize our 12-month plan of operation and fund our ongoing operational expenses. Additional funding will likely come from equity financing from the sale of our common stock. If we are successful in completing equity financing, existing shareholders will experience dilution of their interest in our Company. We do not have any financing arranged and we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our common stock to fund our 12-month plan of operation and ongoing operational expenses. In the absence of such financing, our business will likely fail. There are no assurances that we will be able to achieve further sales of our common stock or any other form of additional financing.
Going Concern
To date the Company only generated nominal revenues and consequently has incurred recurring losses from operations. We do not have sufficient funds to support our daily operations for the next twelve (12) months. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising capital to fund our business model and ultimately to attain profitable operations. Accordingly, these factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Company is attempting to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue; however, the Company’s cash position may not be sufficient to support its daily operations. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to further implement its business model and generate sufficient revenue and its ability to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering.
