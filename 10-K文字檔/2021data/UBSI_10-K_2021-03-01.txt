Item 7.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Congress passed the Private Securities Litigation Act of 1995 to encourage corporations to provide investors with information about the company’s anticipated future financial performance, goals, and strategies. The act provides a safe haven for such disclosure; in other words, protection from unwarranted litigation if actual results are not the same as management expectations.
United desires to provide its shareholders with sound information about past performance and future trends. Consequently, any forward-looking statements contained in this report, in a report incorporated by reference to this report, or made by management of United in this report, in any other reports and filings, in press releases and in oral statements, involve numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of the words “expect,” “may,” “could,” “intend,” “project,” “estimate,” “believe,” “anticipate,” and other words of similar meaning. Such forward-looking statements are based on assumptions and estimates, which although believed to be reasonable, may turn out to be incorrect, such as statements about the potential impacts of the COVID-19
pandemic. Therefore, undue reliance should not be placed upon these estimates and statements. United cannot assure that any of these statements, estimates, or beliefs will be realized and actual results may differ from those contemplated in these “forward-looking statements.” United undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
The discussion in Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” lists some of the factors that could cause United’s actual results to vary materially from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements, and such discussion is incorporated into this discussion by reference.
CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC
As of December 31, 2019, there were reported cases of a “pneumonia of unknown cause” that were limited to one region of the world. By January 7, 2020, the exact strain, a new type of coronavirus, was identified, and initially named 2019-nCoV. On January 21, 2020 the first case of the new coronavirus was reported in the U.S. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) declared the outbreak a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern.” In February of 2020, the WHO officially began calling the disease COVID-19.
On March 11, 2020, the WHO characterized the COVID-19
outbreak as a pandemic. In the U.S., President Trump declared the COVID-19
pandemic a national emergency on March 13, 2020.
The COVID-19
pandemic has had a severe disruptive impact on the U.S. and global economy with businesses closing in response to the pandemic. The economic disruption caused by the virus outbreak has caused downturns and increased uncertainty and volatility in financial markets. Individual state governmental responses to the pandemic have included orders closing “non-essential”
businesses temporarily and directing individuals to restrict their movements, observe social distancing and “shelter- in-place.”
These actions, together with responses to the pandemic by businesses and individuals, have resulted in rapid decreases in commercial and consumer activity, temporary closures of many businesses that have led to a loss of revenues and a rapid increase in unemployment, material decreases in oil and gas prices, disrupted global supply chains, changes in consumer behavior because of the potential exposure to the virus, related emergency response legislation and an expectation that Federal Reserve policy will maintain a low interest rate environment for the foreseeable future.
On March 29, 2020, President Trump signed into law the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, which authorized approximately $2 trillion in relief to businesses and workers that have been affected by events related to COVID-19.
The CARES Act includes the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”), a nearly $350 billion program designed to aid small- and medium-sized
businesses through federally guaranteed loans distributed through banks. These loans are intended to guarantee eight weeks of payroll and other costs to help those businesses remain viable and allow their workers to pay their bills. The CARES Act marked the third federal legislative response to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, following the enactment on March 6, 2020 of supplemental appropriations in the “Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2020” and the enactment on March 18, 2020 of provisions relating to, among other things, paid sick leave and COVID-19
testing in the “Families First Coronavirus Response Act.”
On April 16, 2020, the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) announced that all available funds under the PPP had been exhausted and applications were no longer being accepted. In response, President Trump signed into law the “Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act” on April 24, 2020. This legislation provides additional fiscal year (“FY”) 2020 emergency supplemental funding to increase by $310 billion, the amount authorized and appropriated for commitments for the PPP authorized under section 7(a) of the Small Business Act, economic injury disaster loans and emergency grants under the CARES Act, to fund hospital and provider recovery and testing, and for other purposes. On June 5, 2020, President Trump signed into law the “Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act of 2020 (PPPFA),” which amended the PPP to give borrowers more freedom in how and when loan funds are spent while retaining the possibility of full forgiveness. Key components of the PPPFA are summarized below:
•
The PPPFA amended the PPP to give borrowers more time to spend loan funds and still obtain forgiveness.
•
Borrowers now have 24 weeks to spend loan proceeds, up from 8 weeks.
•
The Act also reduces mandatory payroll spending from 75% to 60%.
•
Two new exceptions let borrowers obtain full forgiveness even without fully restoring their workforce.
•
Changes made by the PPPFA have been incorporated in new forgiveness applications released by the SBA.
•
Time to pay off the loan has been extended to five years from the original two.
•
The Act now allows businesses to delay paying payroll taxes even if they took a PPP loan.
New legislation signed by the President on July 4, 2020, extended the deadline to apply for a PPP loan through August 8, 2020. The original application deadline was June 30, 2020. The new legislation involved $134 billion in unspent PPP funds when the application process shut down at the end of June. Those funds were once again available giving Congress time to decide how to re-appropriate
anything left after August 8.
Loans covered by the PPP may be eligible for loan forgiveness for certain costs incurred related to payroll, group health care benefit costs and qualifying mortgage, rent and utility payments. On October 8, 2020, the SBA released a simpler loan forgiveness application for PPP loans of $50,000 or less to streamline the PPP forgiveness process. The remaining loan balance after forgiveness of any amounts is still fully guaranteed by the SBA.
On December 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law the 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act, an approximately $900 billion bill to provide additional COVID-19
relief and among other measures, extended weekly unemployment benefits, provided another round of economic stimulus payments to individuals and families, lengthened temporary suspensions and modifications of several-bank related provisions and provided more aid to small businesses. Most notably, the 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act reauthorized and appropriated up to $284.5 billion for the PPP for both first-time and second-time borrowers to receive loan disbursements for a period ending March 31, 2021, expanded the list of eligible PPP expenses and created a simplified loan forgiveness application for loans under $150 thousand.
In return for processing and booking the loan, the SBA will pay the lender a processing fee tiered by the size of the loan (5% for loans of not more than $350 thousand; 3% for loans of more than $350 thousand and less than $2 million; and 1% for loans of at least $2 million). For the year of 2020, United processed almost 9,000 loans totaling over $1.29 billion under the PPP and recognized $16.26 million of net fee income during the year of 2020 related to the PPP loans.
Impact on our Operations.
In the states where United operates, many jurisdictions have declared health emergencies. The resulting closures of non-essential
businesses and related economic disruption has impacted our operations as well as the operations of our customers. Financial services have been identified as a Critical Infrastructure Sector by the Department of Homeland Security. Accordingly, our business remains open. To address the issues arising as a result of COVID-19,
and in order to facilitate the continued delivery of essential services while maintaining a high level of safety for our customers as well as our employees, United has implemented the following policies:
•
Restricted all non-essential
travel and large external gatherings and have instituted a mandatory quarantine period for anyone that has traveled to an impacted area.
•
Temporarily closed all of our financial center lobbies and other corporate facilities to non-employees,
except for certain limited cases by appointment only. United continues to serve our consumer and business customers through our drive-through facilities, ATMs, internet banking, mobile app and telephone customer service capabilities.
•
Expanded remote-access availability so that our work-force has the capability to work from home or other remote locations. All activities are performed in accordance with our compliance and information security policies designed to ensure customer data and other information is properly safeguarded.
•
Instituted mandatory social distancing policies for those employees not working remotely. Members of certain operations teams have been split into separate buildings or locations to create redundancy for key functions across the organization.
As of December 31, 2020, we do not anticipate significant challenges to our ability to maintain our systems and controls in light of the measures we have taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
The Company does not currently face any material resource constraint through the implementation of our business continuity plans.
United is currently unable to fully assess or predict the extent of the effects of COVID-19
on our operations as the ultimate impact will depend on factors that are currently unknown and/or beyond our control.
Impact on our Financial Position and Results of Operations.
Significant uncertainties as to future economic conditions exist. While some industries have been impacted more severely than others, all businesses have been impacted to some degree. The economic pressures, existing and forecasted, as of end of each quarter during 2020, coupled with the implementation of an expected loss methodology for determining United’s provision for credit losses as required by CECL contributed to an increased provision for credit losses for the year of 2020. Also, in United’s mortgage banking segment, a market disruption caused by the COVID-19
pandemic resulted in significant losses on mortgage banking derivatives in the first quarter of 2020.
The Company’s fee income has been reduced due to COVID-19.
In keeping with guidance from regulators, the Company actively worked with COVID-19
affected customers during 2020 to waive fees from a variety of sources, such as, but not limited to, insufficient funds and overdraft fees, ATM fees, account maintenance fees, etc. Should the pandemic and the global response escalate further, it is possible that the Company could reduce such fees in future periods; however, at this time, the Company is unable to project the materiality of such an impact on the results of operations in future periods.
The Company’s interest income could be reduced due to COVID-19.
In keeping with guidance from regulators, the Company continues to work with COVID-19
affected borrowers to defer their payments, interest, and fees. While interest and fees continue to accrue to income, through normal GAAP accounting, should eventual credit losses on these deferred payments emerge, the related loans would be placed on nonaccrual status and interest income and fees accrued would be reversed. In such a scenario, interest income in future periods could be negatively impacted. At this time, the Company is unable to project the materiality of such an impact on future deferrals to COVID-19
affected borrowers, but recognizes the breadth of the economic impact may affect its borrowers’ ability to repay in future periods.
Capital and liquidity
.
As of December 31, 2020, all of our capital ratios, and our subsidiary bank’s capital ratios, were in excess of all regulatory requirements. While we believe that we have sufficient capital to withstand a second economic recession brought about by COVID-19,
our reported and regulatory capital ratios could be adversely impacted by further credit loss expense. We rely on cash on hand as well as dividends from our subsidiary bank to service our debt. If our capital deteriorates such that our subsidiary bank is unable to pay dividends to us for an extended period of time, we may not be able to service our debt.
We maintain access to multiple sources of liquidity. Wholesale funding markets have remained open to us, but rates for short-term funding have been volatile throughout 2020. If funding costs become elevated for an extended period of time, it could have an adverse effect on our net interest margin. If an extended recession caused large numbers of our deposit customers to withdraw their funds, we might become more reliant on volatile or more expensive sources of funding.
For a discussion of the United’s liquidity and capital resources in light of the COVID-19
pandemic please refer to the sections with the captions of “Liquidity” and “Capital Resources” included in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”).
Lending operations and accommodations to borrowers.
In keeping with regulatory guidance to work with borrowers during this unprecedented situation and as outlined in the CARES Act, the Company is executing a payment deferral program for its customers that are adversely affected by the pandemic. Depending on the demonstrated need of the client and within the guidance of the CARES Act, the Company is deferring either the full loan payment or the principal component of the loan payment for stated period of time. Through December 31, 2020, United has made 5,967 eligible loan modifications on approximately $3.18 billion of loans outstanding under section 4013, “Temporary Relief from Troubled Debt Restructurings,” of the CARES Act. Of those amounts made, 1,002 of eligible loan modifications remain on approximately $399.86 million of loans outstanding as of December 31, 2020. In accordance with the CARES Act, these deferrals are not considered troubled debt restructurings. It is possible that these deferrals could be extended further under the CARES Act; however, the volume of these future potential extensions is unknown. It is also possible that in spite of our best efforts to assist our borrowers and achieve full collection of our investment, these deferred loans could result in future charge-offs with additional credit loss expense charged to earnings; however, the amount of any future charge-offs on deferred loans is unknown.
With the passage of the PPP, administered by the Small Business Administration (“SBA”), the Company has actively participated in assisting its customers with applications for resources through the program. PPP loans generally have a two-year
or five-year term and earn interest at 1%. The Company believes that the majority of these loans will ultimately be forgiven by the SBA in accordance with the terms of the program. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had 8,743 of PPP loans with a balance of approximately $1.18 billion. The Company recognized approximately $16.26 million in net fees on PPP loans during the year ended December 31, 2020. Remaining fees due from the SBA will be amortized and recognized over the life of the associated loans. It is the Company’s understanding that loans funded through the PPP program are fully guaranteed by the U.S. government. Should those circumstances change, the Company could be required to establish an allowance for credit loss through additional credit loss expense charged to earnings.
Retail operations.
The Company is committed to assisting our customers and communities in this time of need. Most branch locations have converted to drive-thru only in order to ensure the health and safety of our customers and team members. We have introduced temporary changes to help with the financial hardship caused by COVID-19
for both our customers and non-customers.
This included waiving select deposit account fees including overdraft fees, ATM fees and excessive withdrawal fees for savings and money market accounts.
We continue to serve our customers that need emergency branch access for account issues, safe deposit access and similar items by appointment. The Company has been able to open and close accounts effectively, through its drive through facility, and our customer service center is successfully managing the volume of incoming calls.
The Company continues to monitor the safety of our staff. With reduced access to the lobby, our staffing is adequate to address the requests for time off by any of our employees who are impacted by health or childcare issues. For our retail staff being asked to work during this event, a temporary bonus was implemented in appreciation for their service.
ADOPTION OF THE CURRENT EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES STANDARD
The Company has adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13,
“Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” as amended, on January 1, 2020, as required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). ASU No. 2016-13
was adopted by United using a modified retrospective approach. At the January 1, 2020 date of adoption, based on forecasts of macroeconomic conditions and exposures at that time, the aggregate impact to United was a net increase to the allowance for credit losses of $57.44 million and a decrease to retained earnings of $44.33 million, with the difference being an adjustment to deferred tax assets. United has elected to phase-in
the impact to retained earnings using a five-year transition provision, allowed by the Federal Reserve Board and other federal banking agencies in response to the COVID-19
pandemic, to delay for two years the full impact of ASU No. 2016-13
on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. The adoption of ASU No. 2016-13
had an insignificant impact on the Company’s held to maturity and available for sale securities portfolios.
ASU 2016-13
requires entities to report “expected” credit losses on financial instruments measured at amortized cost and other commitments to extend credit rather than the prior “incurred loss” model. These expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date are to be based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Based on poor economic conditions at December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020, management recorded $16.75 million, $16.34 million, $16.96 million and $27.12 million in provision for credit losses related to United’s loan portfolio for the fourth quarter, third quarter, second quarter and first quarter of 2020, respectively. In addition, United recorded a provision for loan losses of $28.95 million during the second quarter of 2020 on purchased non-credit
deteriorated (“non-PCD”)
loans and leases from the Carolina Financial acquisition. For a further discussion, see the “Provision for Credit Losses” section in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
ACQUISITION
On May 1, 2020, United acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of Carolina Financial Corporation (“Carolina Financial”), headquartered in Charleston, South Carolina. Immediately following the Merger, CresCom Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Carolina Financial, merged with and into United Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of United (the Bank Merger). United Bank survived the Bank Merger and continues to exist as a Virginia banking corporation. The acquisition of Carolina Financial affords United the opportunity to expand its existing footprint in North Carolina and South Carolina. The merger resulted in a combined company with more than 200 locations in some of the best banking markets in the United States. CresCom Bank owned and operated Crescent Mortgage Company (“Crescent”), which is based in Atlanta. Crescent is approved to originate loans in 48 states partnering with community banks, credit unions and mortgage brokers. As a result of the merger, Crescent became an indirectly-owned subsidiary of United. The Carolina Financial merger was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. At consummation, Carolina Financial had assets of $5.01 billion, loans and leases, net of unearned income of $3.29 billion and deposits of $3.87 billion.
The results of operations of Carolina Financial are included in the consolidated results of operations from its date of acquisition. As a result of the Carolina Financial acquisition, the year of 2020 was impacted by increased levels of average balances, income, and expense as compared to the year of 2019. In addition, the year of 2020 included $54.24 million of merger-related expenses from the Carolina Financial acquisition as compared to $589 thousand for the year of 2019.
TRANSITION FROM THE LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE (LIBOR)
In 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit the rates used to calculate LIBOR after 2021. ICE Benchmark Administration (the publisher of LIBOR) plans to discontinue publication of the one-week
and two-month
LIBOR on December 31, 2021, and to discontinue publication of overnight, one-month,
three-month, six-month,
and twelve-month LIBOR on June 30, 2023. Currently, it is unclear whether these banks, as a group or individually, will continue to submit the rates used to calculate LIBOR after 2021. It is also unclear whether LIBOR will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark, what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, or what the effect of any such changes may be on the markets for LIBOR-indexed financial instruments.
Working groups comprised of various regulators and other industry groups have been formed in the United States and other countries in order to provide guidance on this topic. In particular, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (“ARRC”) has been formed in the United States by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The ARRC has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as its preferred alternative reference rate for U.S. Dollar LIBOR. The ARRC has also published recommended fall-back language for LIBOR-linked financial instruments, among numerous other areas of guidance. At this time, however, it is unclear whether these recommendations will be broadly accepted by industry participants, whether they will continue to evolve, and what impact they will ultimately have on the broader markets that utilize LIBOR as a reference rate.
United has loans, derivative contracts, borrowings, and other financial instruments that are directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. The transition from LIBOR will cause changes to payment calculations for existing contracts that use
LIBOR as the reference rate. These changes will create various risks surrounding the financial, operational, compliance and legal aspects associated with changing certain elements of existing contracts. United will also be subject to risks surrounding changes to models and systems that currently use LIBOR reference rates, as well as market and strategic risks that could arise from the use of alternative reference rates. Additionally, United could face reputational risks if this transition is not managed appropriately with its customers. While the full impact of the transition is not yet known, failure to adequately manage the transition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
INTRODUCTION
The following discussion and analysis presents the more significant changes in financial condition as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and the results of operations of United and its subsidiaries for each of the years then ended. This discussion and the consolidated financial statements and the notes to Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of United Bankshares, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated. Management has evaluated all significant events and transactions that occurred after December 31, 2020, but prior to the date these financial statements were issued, for potential recognition or disclosure required in these financial statements. Refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
filed with the SEC on March 2, 2020 (the 2019 Form 10-K) for a discussion and analysis of the more significant factors that affected periods prior to 2019.
This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes thereto, which are included elsewhere in this document.
USE OF NON-GAAP
FINANCIAL MEASURES
This discussion and analysis contains certain financial measures that are not recognized under GAAP. Under SEC Regulation G, public companies making disclosures containing financial measures that are not in accordance with GAAP must also disclose, along with each “non-GAAP”
financial measure, certain additional information, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP
financial measure to the closest comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as a statement of the company’s reasons for utilizing the non-GAAP
financial measure.
Generally, United has presented a non-GAAP
financial measure because it believes that this measure provides meaningful additional information to assist in the evaluation of United’s results of operations or financial position. Presentation of a non-GAAP
financial measure is consistent with how United’s management evaluates its performance internally and this non-GAAP
financial measure is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in the banking industry. Specifically, this discussion contains certain references to financial measures identified as tax-equivalent
(“FTE”) net interest income and return on average tangible equity. Management believes these non-GAAP
financial measures to be helpful in understanding United’s results of operations or financial position.
Net interest income is presented in this discussion on a tax-equivalent
basis. The tax-equivalent
basis adjusts for the tax-favored
status of income from certain loans and investments. Although this is a non-GAAP
measure, United’s management believes this measure is more widely used within the financial services industry and provides better comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt
sources. United uses this measure to monitor net interest income performance and to manage its balance sheet composition.
Average tangible equity is calculated as GAAP total shareholders’ equity minus total intangible assets. Tangible equity can thus be considered the most conservative valuation of the company. When considering net income, a return on average tangible equity can be calculated. Management provides a return on average equity to facilitate the understanding of as well as to assess the quality and composition of United’s capital structure. By removing the effect of intangible assets that result from merger and acquisition activity, the “permanent” items of shareholders’ equity are presented. This measure, along with others, is used by management to analyze capital adequacy and performance.
However, this non-GAAP
information should be considered supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Where the non-GAAP
financial measure is used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as reconciliation to that comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as a statement of the company’s reasons for utilizing the non-GAAP
financial measure, can be found within this discussion and analysis. Investors should recognize that United’s presentation of this non-GAAP
financial measure might not be comparable to a similarly titled measure at other companies.
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The accounting and reporting policies of United conform with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions and judgments, which are reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates. These policies, along with the disclosures presented in the financial statement notes and in this financial review, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined. Based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, assumptions, and estimates underlying those amounts, management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses, the calculation of the income tax provision, and the use of fair value measurements to account for certain financial instruments to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments, and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available. The most significant accounting policies followed by United are presented in Note A, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses
The allowance for loan and lease losses is an estimate of the expected credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost to present the net amount expected to be collected as of the balance sheet date. Such allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset (contractual term). Determining the allowance for loan losses requires management to make estimates of expected credit losses that are highly uncertain and require a high degree of judgment. At December 31, 2020, the allowance for loan losses was $235.83 million and is subject to periodic adjustment based on management’s assessment of expected credit losses in the loan portfolio. Such adjustment from period to period can have a significant impact on United’s consolidated financial statements. To illustrate the potential effect on the financial statements of our estimates of the allowance for loan losses, a 10% increase in the allowance for loan losses would have required $23.58 million in additional allowance (funded by additional provision for loan losses), which would have negatively impacted the year of 2020 net income by approximately $18.63 million, after-tax
or $0.16 diluted per common share. Management’s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the appropriate provision for loan losses is based upon a quarterly evaluation of the loan portfolio. This evaluation is inherently subjective and requires significant estimates, including estimates related to the amounts and timing of future cash flows, value of collateral, losses on pools of homogeneous loans and leases based on historical loss experience, and consideration of qualitative factors such as current economic trends, all of which are susceptible to constant and significant change. The allowance allocated to specific credits and loan pools grouped by similar risk characteristics is reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted as necessary based upon subsequent changes in circumstances. In determining the components of the allowance for loan losses, management considers the risk arising in part from, but not limited to, qualitative factors which include charge-off
and delinquency trends, current business conditions and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts, lending policies and procedures, the size and risk characteristics of the loan portfolio, concentrations of credit, and other various factors. The methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses is described in Note A, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A discussion of the factors leading to changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included in the Provision for Credit Losses section of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”). For a discussion of concentrations of credit risk, see Item 1, under the caption of Loan Concentrations in this Form 10-K.
Income Taxes
United’s calculation of income tax provision is inherently complex due to the various different tax laws and jurisdictions in which we operate and requires management’s use of estimates and judgments in its determination. The
current income tax liability also includes income tax expense related to our uncertain tax positions as required in ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes.” Changes to the estimated accrued taxes can occur due to changes in tax rates, implementation of new business strategies, resolution of issues with taxing authorities and recently enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance. These changes can be material to the Company’s operating results for any particular reporting period. The analysis of the income tax provision requires the assessments of the relative risks and merits of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions, filing positions, filing methods and taxable income calculations after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent and other information. United strives to keep abreast of changes in the tax laws and the issuance of regulations which may impact tax reporting and provisions for income tax expense. United is also subject to audit by federal and state authorities. Because the application of tax laws is subject to varying interpretations, results of these audits may produce indicated liabilities which differ from United’s estimates and provisions. United continually evaluates its exposure to possible tax assessments arising from audits and records its estimate of probable exposure based on current facts and circumstances. The potential impact to United’s operating results for any of the changes cannot be reasonably estimated. See Note O, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding United’s ASC Topic 740 disclosures.
Use of Fair Value Measurements
United determines the fair value of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established in ASC Topic 820, whereby the fair value of certain assets and liabilities is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. ASC Topic 820 establishes a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. The classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs in the methodology for determining fair value are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market-based information obtained from independent sources (Level 1 or Level 2), while unobservable inputs reflect management’s estimate of market data (Level 3). For assets and liabilities that are actively traded and have quoted prices or observable market data, a minimal amount of subjectivity concerning fair value is needed. Prices and values obtained from third party vendors that do not reflect forced liquidation or distressed sales are not adjusted by management. When quoted prices or observable market data are not available, management’s judgment is necessary to estimate fair value.
At December 31, 2020, approximately 14.54% of total assets, or $3.81 billion, consisted of financial instruments recorded at fair value. Of this total, approximately 80.81% or $3.08 billion of these financial instruments used valuation methodologies involving observable market data, collectively Level 1 and Level 2 measurements, to determine fair value. Approximately 19.19% or $730.73 million of these financial instruments were valued using unobservable market information or Level 3 measurements. Most of these financial instruments valued using unobservable market information were loans held for sale at our mortgage banking segment. At December 31, 2020, only $13.06 million or less than 1% of total liabilities were recorded at fair value. This entire amount was valued using methodologies involving observable market data. United does not believe that any changes in the unobservable inputs used to value the financial instruments mentioned above would have a material impact on United’s results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources. See Note W for additional information regarding ASC Topic 820 and its impact on United’s financial statements.
Any material effect on the financial statements related to these critical accounting areas is further discussed in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
2020 COMPARED TO 2019
United’s total assets as of December 31, 2020 were $26.18 billion, which was an increase of $6.52 billion or 33.17% from December 31, 2019, primarily the result of the acquisition of Carolina Financial on May 1, 2020 and PPP loans. Portfolio loans and leases increased $3.88 billion or 28.29%, cash and cash equivalents increased $1.37 billion or 163.77%, investment securities increased $516.39 million or 19.34%, loans held for sale increased $331.42 million or 85.53%, goodwill increased $318.83 million or 21.57%, other assets increased $142.57 million or 32.26%, bank premises and equipment increased $79.18 million or 81.93%, operating lease right-of-use
assets increased $11.74 million or 20.31%, and interest receivable increased $8.75 million or 15.06%, all due primarily to the Carolina Financial merger. Total liabilities increased $5.59 billion or 34.29% from year-end
2019. This increase in total liabilities was due mainly to increases of $6.73 billion or 48.60% and $32.03 million or 18.80% in deposits and accrued and other liabilities,
respectively, mainly due to the Carolina Financial acquisition. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease of $1.21 billion or 54.50% in borrowings. Shareholders’ equity increased $933.79 million or 27.76% from year-end
2019 due primarily to the acquisition of Carolina Financial.
The following discussion explains in more detail the changes in financial condition by major category.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020 increased $1.37 billion or 163.77% from year-end
2019. In particular, interest-bearing deposits with other banks increased $1.26 billion or 193.33% as United increased its liquidity due to the COVID-19
pandemic by placing excess cash in an interest-bearing account with the Federal Reserve. In addition, cash and due from banks increased $112.13 million or 60.53% due to increases of $73.87 million in cash and $13.52 million in process with the Federal Reserve. Federal funds sold were flat, increasing $3 thousand or less than 1%. During the year of 2020, net cash of $140.45 million and $137.59 million were provided by operating activities and investing activities, respectively, while net cash of $1.09 billion was provided by financing activities. Further details related to changes in cash and cash equivalents are presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Securities
Total investment securities at December 31, 2020 increased $516.39 million or 19.34% from year-end
2019. Carolina Financial added $580.79 million in investment securities, including purchase accounting amounts, upon consummation of the acquisition. Securities available for sale increased $516.06 million or 21.17%. This change in securities available for sale reflects $559.29 million acquired from Carolina Financial, $705.57 million in sales, maturities and calls of securities, $596.92 million in purchases, and an increase of $74.64 million in market value. Securities held to maturity declined $234 thousand or 16.18% from year-end
2019 due to maturities and calls of securities as well as the establishment of a $23 thousand allowance for credit losses. Equity securities were $10.72 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $1.82 million or 20.51% due mainly to net purchases and a change in value. Other investment securities were flat, decreasing $1.27 million or less than 1% from year-end
2019 due to a decrease in Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) stock. Partially offsetting this decrease in FHLB stock were purchases of Federal Reserve Bank (“FRB”) stock and investment tax credits.
The following is a summary of available for sale securities at December 31:
The following is a summary of held to maturity securities at December 31:
Note
: (1) net of allowance for credit losses of $23 thousand.
At December 31, 2020, gross unrealized losses on available for sale securities were $6.16 million. Securities with the most significant gross unrealized losses at December 31, 2020 consisted primarily of asset-backed securities and single issue trust preferred securities. The asset-backed securities relate mainly to securities that are backed by Federal Family Education Loan Program (“FFELP”) student loan collateral which includes a minimum of a 97% government repayment guaranty, as well as additional credit support and subordination in excess of the government guaranteed portion. The single issue trust preferred securities relate to securities of financial institutions.
As of December 31, 2020, United’s available for sale mortgage-backed securities had an amortized cost of $1.57 billion, with an estimated fair value of $1.63 billion. The portfolio consisted primarily of $905.23 million in agency residential mortgage-backed securities with a fair value of $928.89 million, $21.64 million in non-agency
residential mortgage-backed securities with an estimated fair value of $21.78 million, and $644.77 million in commercial agency mortgage-backed securities with an estimated fair value of $675.15 million.
As of December 31, 2020, United’s available for sale corporate securities had an amortized cost of $692.82 million, with an estimated fair value of $696.04 million. The portfolio consisted of $18.23 million in single issue trust preferred securities with an estimated fair value of $17.03 million. In addition to the single issue trust preferred securities, the Company held positions in various other corporate securities, including asset-backed securities with an amortized cost of $297.83 million and a fair value of $294.62 million and other corporate securities, with an amortized cost of $376.75 million and a fair value of $384.39 million.
United’s available for sale single issue trust preferred securities had a fair value of $17.03 million as of December 31, 2020. Of the $17.03 million, $11.23 million or 65.97% were investment grade; $0.93 million or 5.46% were split rated; and $4.87 million or 28.57% were unrated. The two largest exposures accounted for 70.41% of the $17.03 million. These included Truist Bank at $7.12 million and Emigrant Bank at $4.86 million. All single issue trust preferred securities are currently receiving full scheduled principal and interest payments.
During 2020, United did not recognize any credit losses on its available for sale investment securities. Management does not believe that any individual security with an unrealized loss as of December 31, 2020 is impaired. United believes the decline in value resulted from changes in market interest rates, credit spreads and liquidity, not a deterioration of credit. Based on a review of each of the securities in the available for sale investment portfolio, management concluded that it was more likely than not that it would be able to realize the cost basis investment and appropriate interest payments on such securities. United has the intent and the ability to hold these securities until such time as the value recovers or the securities mature. As of December 31, 2020, there was no allowance for credit losses related to the Company’s available for sale securities. However, United acknowledges that any securities in an unrealized loss position may be sold in future periods in response to significant, unanticipated changes in asset/liability management decisions, unanticipated future market movements or business plan changes.
Further information regarding the amortized cost and estimated fair value of investment securities, including remaining maturities as well as a more detailed discussion of management’s impairment analysis, is presented in Note C, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Loans held for sale
Loans held for sale increased $331.42 million or 85.53% from year-end
2019 due mainly to the acquisition of Carolina Financial and its mortgage banking subsidiary, Crescent, and increased production. Carolina Financial added $65.76 million in loans held for sale. In addition, loan originations exceeded loan sales in the secondary market during the year of 2020. Loan originations for the year of 2020 were $6.53 billion while loans sales were $6.26 billion. Loans held for sale were $718.94 million at December 31, 2020 as compared to $387.51 million at year-end
2019.
Portfolio Loans
Loans and leases, net of unearned income, increased $3.88 billion or 28.29% from year-end
2019 mainly as a result of the Carolina Financial acquisition which added $3.29 billion, including purchase accounting amounts, in portfolio loans and leases and the issuance of PPP loans. Since year-end
2019, commercial, financial and agricultural loans and leases increased $3.24 billion or 43.50% as commercial loans and leases (not secured by real estate) increased $1.77 billion or 77.43%, including $1.18 billion in PPP loans, while commercial real estate loans increased $1.47 billion or 28.50%. Consumer loans increased $35.22 million or 3.02% due to an increase in indirect automobile financing in addition to the loans acquired from Carolina Financial. In addition, construction and land development loans increased $418.14 million or 29.69% while residential real estate loans increased $213.48 million or 5.79%. These increases were due primarily to the Carolina Financial acquisition. Otherwise, portfolio loans and leases, net of unearned income, increased $619.98 million from year-end
2019. Unearned income on loans and leases increased $29.75 million from year-end
2019 due mainly to the deferred loan fees on the PPP loans.
A summary of loans outstanding is as follows:
The following table shows the maturity of commercial, financial, and agricultural loans and real estate construction and land development loans as of December 31, 2020:
At December 31, 2020, commercial, financial and agricultural loans and real estate construction and land development loans by maturity are as follows:
More information relating to loans is presented in Note D, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Other Assets
Other assets increased $142.57 million or 32.26% from year-end
2019. The Carolina Financial acquisition added $156.31 million in other assets plus an additional $3.41 million in core deposit intangibles and $196 thousand for the Crescent trade name intangible. The cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance policies increased $75.21 million, of which $71.88 million was acquired from Carolina Financial while the remaining increase was due to an increase in the cash surrender value. Deferred tax assets increased $10.02 million due mainly to the deferred taxes recorded on the purchase accounting adjustments in the Carolina Financial acquisition while income tax receivable increased $12.24 million. The remainder of the increase in other assets is the result of an increase of $38.74 million in derivative assets from mortgage banking operations and Carolina Financial and an increase of $7.08 million in OREO.
Deposits
Deposits represent United’s primary source of funding. Total deposits at December 31, 2020 increased $6.73 billion or 48.60% as the result of the Carolina Financial acquisition and economic stimulus. Carolina Financial added $3.88 billion in deposits, including purchase accounting amounts. In terms of composition, noninterest-bearing deposits increased $2.78 billion or 60.24% ($893.07 million added from Carolina Financial acquisition) while interest-bearing deposits increased $3.95 billion or 42.78% ($2.99 billion added from Carolina Financial acquisition) from December 31, 2019. Organically, deposits grew $2.86 billion from year-end
2019 due to new customers and the economic stimulus, liquidity concerns as well as a volatile stock market as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic.
Noninterest-bearing deposits consist of demand deposit and noninterest bearing money market (“MMDA”) account balances. The $2.78 billion increase in noninterest-bearing deposits was due mainly to increases in commercial noninterest-bearing deposits of $1.67 billion or 69.51% and personal noninterest-bearing deposits of $355.72 million or 47.84% mainly as the result of the Carolina Financial acquisition and the pandemic factors mentioned above. In addition, sweep activity to noninterest bearing MMDAs increased $737.37 million or 59.49%.
Interest-bearing deposits consist of interest-bearing checking (“NOW”), regular savings, interest-bearing MMDA, and time deposit account balances. All major categories of interest-bearing deposits increased from year-end
2019 as the result of the Carolina Financial acquisition. In particular, interest-bearing MMDAs increased $2.54 billion or 44.87% since year-end
2019 as commercial MMDAs increased $1.22 billion, personal MMDAs increased $976.09 million, and public funds MMDAs increased $340.04 million. Brokered MMDAs decreased $3.19 million. NOW accounts increased $427.46 million or 114.85% since year-end
2019. Excluding sweep activity from NOW accounts to interest-bearing MMDAs to reduce United’s reserve requirement at its Federal Reserve Bank, NOW accounts increased $1.28 billion or 70.15% due to a $810.50 million increase in personal NOW accounts, a $273.79 million increase in public NOW accounts, and a $192.59 million increase in commercial NOW accounts.
Regular savings increased $400.93 million or 45.41% from year-end
2019 due to a $367.25 million increase in personal savings accounts and a $33.24 million increase in commercial savings accounts as the result of the Carolina Financial acquisition.
Time deposits under $100,000 increased $256.05 million or 35.37% from year-end
2019 due mainly to an increase in fixed rate certificates of deposits (“CDs”) of $195.95 million and an increase of $50.11 million in listing service CDs due to the Carolina Financial acquisition. Time deposits over $100,000 increased $329.12 million or 20.57% as brokered
deposits increased $94.81 million and fixed rate CDs over $100,000 increased $344.18 million, both as a result of the Carolina Financial acquisition. Partially offsetting these increases in time deposits over $100,000 was a $115.59 million decrease in Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (“CDARS”) balances.
The table below summarizes the changes by deposit category since year-end
2019:

Borrowings
Total borrowings at December 31, 2020 decreased $1.21 billion or 54.50% since year-end
2019. Carolina Financial added $374.74 million, including purchase accounting amounts, upon consummation of the acquisition. During the year of 2020, short-term borrowings decreased $232.35 million or 62.02% due to a $250.00 million decrease in short term FHLB advances while securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased $17.65 million. Carolina Financial added $332.00 million in short-term borrowings, which were repaid by December 31, 2020. Long-term borrowings decreased $973.66 million or 52.97% from year-end
2019 as long-term FHLB advances decreased $1.02 billion as a result of early payoff of long-term FHLB advances while issuances of trust preferred capital securities increased $33.81 million. Including purchase accounting amounts, Carolina Financial added $42.74 million in long-term borrowings, which included subordinated debt of $9.87 million.

Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities
Accrued expenses and other liabilities at December 31, 2020 increased $32.02 million or 18.80% from year-end
2019. Carolina Financial added $33.15 million. In particular, accrued employee expenses increased $21.97 million and derivative liabilities increased $9.99 million. In addition, accrued mortgage escrow liabilities increased $5.57 million and dividends payable increased $9.16 million. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease of $12.46 million in the pension liability due to a $20 million contribution in the third quarter of 2020 and a decrease of $6.72 million in interest payable as result of timing differences.
Shareholders’ Equity
Shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2020 was $4.30 billion, which was an increase of $933.79 million or 27.76% from year-end
2019 mainly as the result of the Carolina Financial acquisition. The Carolina Financial transaction added approximately $817.83 million in shareholders’ equity as 28,031,501 shares were issued from United’s authorized but unissued shares for the merger at a cost of approximately $816.00 million.
Retained earnings increased $72.82 million or 6.43% from year-end
2019. Earnings net of dividends for the year of 2020 were $117.15 million. Amount recognized for the adoption of ASU 2016-13
was a reduction of $44.33 million in retained earnings.
Accumulated other comprehensive income increased $57.24 million or 164.15% from year-end
2019 due mainly to an increase of $57.25 million in United’s available for sale investment portfolio, net of deferred income taxes. The after-tax
accretion of pension costs was $3.95 million for the year of 2020 while the after-tax
pension accounting adjustment at year-end
2020 resulted in a decline of $7.32 million. During the year of 2020, United recognized an upward fair value adjustment of $3.36 million on new cash flow hedges.
During the fourth quarter of 2020, United began repurchasing its common stock on the open market under repurchase plans approved by United’s Board of Directors. United repurchased 660,000 shares in 2020 at a cost of $20.71 million or an average share price of $31.38.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Overview
Net income for the year 2020 was $289.02 million or $2.40 per diluted share, an increase of $28.92 million or 11.12% from $260.10 million or $2.55 per diluted share for the year of 2019. Higher net income for the year 2020 compared to the year of 2019 was primarily due to higher income from mortgage banking activities, driven by an elevated volume of mortgage loan originations and sales in the secondary market, as well as the impact from the Carolina Financial acquisition. Partially offsetting the increase in net income were additional merger-related expenses for the Carolina Financial acquisition, an increase in prepayment penalties on the early payoff of long-term FHLB advances and a higher provision for credit losses resulting from an adverse future macroeconomic forecast as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic under the CECL accounting standard.
As previously mentioned, United completed its acquisition of Carolina Financial on May 1, 2020. The results of operations for Carolina Financial are included in the consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition, May 1, 2020. As a result of the acquisition, the year of 2020 reflected higher average balances, income, and expense as compared to the year of 2019. In addition, the year of 2020 included merger-related expenses of $54.24 million as compared to $589 thousand for the year of 2019.
United’s return on average assets for the year of 2020 was 1.20% and return on average shareholders’ equity was 7.30% as compared to 1.34% and 7.80% for the year of 2019. United’s Federal Reserve peer group’s (bank holding companies with total assets over $10 billion) most recently reported annualized average return on assets and annualized average return on equity were 0.71% and 6.29%, respectively, for the first nine months of 2020. For the year of 2020, United’s return on average tangible equity was 12.90%, as compared to 14.26% the year of 2019.
Net interest income for the year of 2020 was $689.77 million, an increase of $111.85 million or 19.35% from the prior year. The increase in net interest income occurred because total interest income increased $35.82 million while total interest expense decreased $76.03 million from the year of 2019.
The provision for credit losses was $106.56 million for the year 2020 as compared to $21.31 million for the year of 2019. Noninterest income was $354.75 million for the year of 2020 which was an increase of $204.26 million or 135.74% from the year of 2019. Noninterest expense was $578.22 million which was an increase of $195.56 million or 51.11% from the year of 2019.
Income taxes for the year of 2020 were $70.72 million as compared to $64.34 million for the year of 2019. United’s effective tax rate was approximately 19.7% and 19.8% for years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as compared to 21.7% for 2018.
Business Segments
United operates in two business segments: community banking and mortgage banking.
Community Banking
Net income attributable to the community banking segment for the year of 2020 was $190.34 million compared to net income of $258.40 million for the year of 2019. As previously mentioned, the lower amount of net income in 2020 was driven primarily by additional merger-related expenses for the Carolina Financial acquisition, an increase in prepayment penalties on the early payoff of long-term FHLB advances and a higher provision for loan losses resulting from an adverse future macroeconomic forecast as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic under the new CECL accounting standard adopted by United on January 1, 2020. In addition, for the year of 2020, the community banking segment included the provision for loan losses of $28.95 million recorded on purchased non-PCD
loans and leases from Carolina Financial.
Net interest income increased $94.36 million to $677.91 million for the year of 2020, compared to $583.55 million for the same period of 2019, due mainly to an increase in average earning assets as a result of the Carolina Financial acquisition. Provision for credit losses was $106.56 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to a provision of $21.31 million for the same period of 2019. The increase for the year of 2020 was due mainly to the impact from the reasonable and supportable forecasts for future macroeconomic scenarios used in the estimation of expected credit losses adversely impacted by the COVID-19
pandemic and the provision for credit losses of $28.95 million recorded on purchased non-PCD
loans and leases from Carolina Financial.
Noninterest income for the year of 2020 increased $15.14 million to $90.09 million as compared to $74.96 million for the year of 2019. The $15.14 million increase in 2020 was due mainly to increased fees from brokerage services, fees from deposit services, net gains on the sales and calls of investment securities and a net gain of $2.23 million on the sale and subsequent leaseback of a bank premise.
Noninterest expense was $423.93 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $314.71 million for the same period of 2019. The increase of $109.22 million in noninterest expense was primarily attributable to the additional employees and branch offices from the Carolina Financial acquisition as most major categories of noninterest expense showed increases as well as increased merger-related expenses and prepayment penalties on the early payoff of long-term FHLB advances.
Mortgage Banking
The mortgage banking segment reported net income of $116.71 million for the year of 2020 as compared to net income of $10.16 million for the year of 2019. Noninterest income, which consists mainly of realized and unrealized gains associated with the fair value of commitments and loans held for sale, was $276.19 million for the year of 2020 as compared to $83.88 million for the year of 2019. The increase in 2020 was due mainly to increased sales of mortgage loans in the secondary market and the addition of mortgage banking operations from the Carolina Financial acquisition. Noninterest expense was $140.63 million for the year of 2020 as compared to $72.29 million the year of 2019. Noninterest expense consists mainly of salaries, commissions and benefits of mortgage segment employees. The increase in 2020 was due mainly to higher employee incentives and commissions related to the increased mortgage banking production as well as the additional expense associated with the employees added from the Carolina Financial acquisition.
The following discussion explains in more detail the consolidated results of operations by major category.
Net Interest Income
Net interest income represents the primary component of United’s earnings. It is the difference between interest income from earning assets and interest expense incurred to fund these assets. Net interest income is impacted by changes in the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in market interest rates. Such changes, and their impact on net interest income in 2020 and 2019, are presented below.
Net interest income for the year of 2020 was $689.77 million, which was an increase of $111.85 million or 19.35% from the year of 2019. The $111.85 million increase in net interest income occurred because total interest income increased $35.82 million while total interest expense decreased $76.03 million from the year of 2019. Generally, interest income for
the year of 2020 increased from the year of 2019 due to an increase in earning assets, mainly as a result of the Carolina Financial acquisition and PPP loan activity, while interest expense decreased primarily due to a decline in market interest rates which resulted in lower funding costs. For the purpose of this remaining discussion, net interest income is presented on a tax-equivalent
basis to provide a comparison among all types of interest earning assets. The tax-equivalent
basis adjusts for the tax-favored
status of income from certain loans and investments. Although this is a non-GAAP
measure, United’s management believes this measure is more widely used within the financial services industry and provides better comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt
sources. United uses this measure to monitor net interest income performance and to manage its balance sheet composition.
Tax-equivalent
net interest income for the year of 2020 was $693.66 million, an increase of $112.00 million or 19.26% from the year of 2019. Average earning assets for the year of 2020 increased $4.22 billion or 24.61% from the year of 2019 due to a $3.16 billion or 22.91% increase in average net loans and leases, including loans held for sale, a $767.91 million or 104.64% increase in average short-term investments and a $293.21 million or 11.17% increase in average investment securities. The net interest spread for the year of 2020 increased 8 basis points from the year of 2019 due to an 80 basis point decrease in the average cost of funds partially offset by a 72 basis point decrease in average yield on earning assets. Loan accretion on acquired loans and leases was $41.77 million and $38.80 million for the year of 2020 and 2019, respectively, an increase of $2.96 million. The net interest margin of 3.24% for the year of 2020 was a decrease of 15 basis points from the net interest margin of 3.39% for the year of 2019.
United’s tax-equivalent
net interest income also includes the impact of acquisition accounting fair value adjustments. The following table provides the discount/premium and net accretion impact to tax-equivalent
net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
The following table reconciles the difference between net interest income and tax-equivalent
net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.

The tax-equivalent
adjustment combines amounts of interest income on federally nontaxable loans and investment securities using the statutory federal income tax rate of 21% for 2020, 2019, and 2018. All interest income on loans and investment securities was subject to state income taxes.
The following table shows the consolidated daily average balance of major categories of assets and liabilities for each of the three years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 with the consolidated interest and rate earned or paid on such amount. The interest income and yields on federally nontaxable loans and investment securities are presented on a tax-equivalent
basis using the statutory federal income tax rate of 21% for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018. Interest income on all loans and investment securities was subject to state taxes.

Provision for Credit Losses
The provision for loan and lease losses for the year of 2020 and 2019 was $106.29 million and $21.31 million, respectively. Net charge-offs for the year of 2020 were $23.60 million as compared to $20.96 million for year of 2019. The higher amount of provision expense for 2020 compared to 2019 was due mainly to a provision for loan losses of $28.95 million recorded on purchased non-PCD
loans and leases from Carolina Financial and the reasonable and supportable forecasts for future macroeconomic scenarios used in the estimation of current expected credit losses adversely impacted by the COVID-19
pandemic and future economic uncertainty. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases were 0.14% for the year of 2020.
As of December 31, 2020, nonperforming loans and leases were $132.21 million or 0.75% of loans and leases, net of unearned income as compared to nonperforming loans of $131.07 million or 0.96% of loans, net of unearned income at December 31, 2019. Nonperforming loans and leases at December 31, 2020 included $37.83 million of nonperforming loans and leases from the Carolina Financial acquisition. The components of nonperforming loans and leases include: 1) nonaccrual loans and leases, 2) loans and leases which are contractually past due 90 days or more as to interest or principal, but have not been put on a nonaccrual basis and 3) loans and leases whose terms have been restructured for economic or legal reasons due to financial difficulties of the borrowers.
Loans and leases past due 90 days or more were $13.83 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $4.34 million or 45.69% from $9.49 million at year-end
2019. This increase was primarily due to loans and leases that became delinquent due to impact of the COVID-19
pandemic that included loss of jobs and income as well as a Company-imposed moratorium on repossessions and foreclosures. At December 31, 2020, nonaccrual loans and leases were $62.72 million, which was
relatively flat compared to $63.21 million at year-end
2019. Restructured loans were $55.66 million at December 31, 2020, a decrease of $2.71 million or 4.65% from $58.37 million at year-end
2019. This decrease was primarily due to repayments and charge-offs of previously recognized impairments and repayment of several restructured loans. The loss potential on these loans has been properly evaluated and allocated within the Company’s allowance for loan and lease losses.
Nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and leases and real estate acquired in foreclosure or other settlement of loans (“OREO”). Total nonperforming assets of $154.80 million, including OREO of $22.60 million at December 31, 2020, represented 0.59% of total assets.
United maintains an allowance for loan and lease losses and a reserve for lending-related commitments. The combined allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for lending-related commitments is considered the allowance for credit losses. At December 31, 2020, the allowance for credit losses was $255.08 million as compared to $78.79 million at December 31, 2019.
At December 31, 2020, the allowance for loan and lease losses was $235.83 million as compared to $77.06 million at December 31, 2019. The increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses was due to the adoption of CECL, the impact of COVID-19
and the loans and leases acquired from Carolina Financial. As a percentage of loans and leases, net of unearned income, the allowance for loan losses was 1.34% at December 31, 2020 and 0.56% at December 31, 2019. The ratio of the allowance for loan and lease losses to nonperforming loans and leases or coverage ratio was 178.38% and 58.79% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in these ratios was due mainly to the adoption of CECL which caused a change in the Company’s methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses as well as the adverse impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on the reasonable and supportable forecasts for future macroeconomic scenarios used in the estimation of current expected credit losses and the allowance for loan losses recorded on loans and leases acquired from Carolina Financial.
The following table summarizes United’s credit loss experience for each of the five years ended December 31:

United continues to evaluate risks which may impact its loan and lease portfolios. As a result of the COVID-19
pandemic and resulting economic uncertainty given the rapidly changing economic impact, the Company reviewed its loan and lease portfolio segments, assessing the likely impact of COVID-19
on each segment and established relevant qualitative adjustment factors. Reserves are initially determined based on losses identified from the PD/LGD and Cohort models which utilize the Company’s historical information. Then any qualitative adjustments are applied to account for the Company’s view of the future. If current conditions underlying any qualitative adjustment factor were deemed to be materially different than historical conditions, then an adjustment was made for that factor.
The year of 2020 qualitative adjustments include analyses of the following:
•
Past events
- This includes portfolio trends related to business conditions; past due, nonaccrual, and graded loans and leases; and concentrations.
•
Current conditions
- United considered the impact of COVID-19
on the economy as well as loan deferrals and modifications made in light of the pandemic when making determinations related to factor adjustments, such as changes in economic and business conditions, collateral values, external factors and past due loans and leases, and the reasonable and supportable forecast. This is in contrast with the CECL adoption date (January 1, 2020) estimate as neither of these items were relevant for United’s footprint at the beginning of the year. Additional considerations were made for the Carolina Financial acquisition, such as the experience of lending management and staff and the nature and volume of the portfolio.
•
Reasonable and supportable forecasts
- The forecast is determined on a portfolio-by-portfolio
basis by relating the correlation of real GDP and the unemployment rate to loss rates to forecasts of those variables. The reasonable and supportable forecast selection is subjective in nature and requires more judgment compared to the other components of the allowance. Assumptions for the economic variables were the following:
Ø
The ranges for the economic variables of GDP and the unemployment rate have narrowed in the fourth quarter as compared to the third.
Ø
The forecast is less severe than third quarter while maintaining a gradual recovery pace extending beyond 2022.
Ø
Greater risk of loss is probable in the hotel and accommodations portfolio due to deteriorating economic conditions brought on by the pandemic which resulted in a more negative forecast relative to other portfolios.
Ø
Consideration was given to the $900 billion economic stimulus bill passed in December 2020 during the forecast selection process.
Ø
Reversion to historical loss data occurs via a straight-line method during the year following the one-year
reasonable and supportable forecast period.
Allocations are made for specific commercial loans based upon management’s estimate of the borrowers’ ability to repay and other factors impacting collectability. Other commercial loans and leases not specifically reviewed on an individual basis are evaluated based on historical loss percentages applied to loan pools that have been segregated by risk. Allocations for loans and leases other than commercial loans and leases are made based upon historical loss experience adjusted for current environmental conditions. The allowance for credit losses includes estimated lifetime losses within the portfolio due to uncertainties in economic conditions, delays in obtaining information, including unfavorable information about a borrower’s financial condition, the difficulty in identifying triggering events that correlate perfectly to subsequent loss rates, and risk factors that have not yet fully manifested themselves in loss allocation factors.
The following table presents the allocation of United’s allowance for credit losses for each of the five years ended December 31:
The following is a summary of loans outstanding as a percent of total loans at December 31:
United’s review of the allowance for loan and lease losses at December 31, 2020 produced increased allocations in each of the four loan categories, primarily due to implementation of CECL and the adverse impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on reasonable and supportable forecasts for future macroeconomic scenarios used in the estimation of expected credit losses. The allocation related to the commercial, financial & agricultural loan pool increased $89.24 million. The residential real estate allocation increased $20.13 million. The real estate construction and development loan pool allocation increased $35.72 million. The consumer loan pool experienced an increase of $13.98 million.
An allowance is established for estimated lifetime losses for loans that are individually assessed. Nonperforming commercial loans and leases are regularly reviewed to identify expected credit losses. A loan is individually assessed for expected credit losses when the loan does not share similar characteristics with other loans in the portfolio. Measuring expected credit losses of a loan requires judgment and estimates, and the eventual outcomes may differ from those estimates. Expected credit losses are measured based upon the present value of expected future cash flows from the loan discounted at the loan’s effective rate, the loan’s observable market price or the fair value of collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. When the selected measure is less than the recorded investment in the loan, an expected credit loss has occurred. The allowance for loans and leases that were individually assessed was $7.78 million at December 31, 2020 and $16.50 million at December 31, 2019. In comparison to the prior year-end,
this element of the allowance decreased by $8.72 million primarily due to charge-off
of previously recognized allocations for probable credit losses on individually assessed loans as well as repayment of individually assessed loans.
Management believes that the allowance for credit losses of $255.08 million at December 31, 2020 is adequate to provide for expected losses on existing loans and lending-related commitments based on information currently available. United’s loan administration policies are focused on the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio in terms of loan approval and credit quality. The commercial loan portfolio is monitored for possible concentrations of credit in one or more industries. Management has lending limits as a percentage of capital per type of credit concentration in an effort to ensure adequate diversification within the portfolio. Most of United’s commercial loans are secured by real estate located in West Virginia, southeastern Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina and the District of Columbia. It is the opinion of management that these commercial loans do not pose any unusual risks and that adequate consideration has been given to these loans in establishing the allowance for credit losses.
The provision for credit losses related to held to maturity and available for sale investment securities for the year of 2020 was immaterial. The provision for credit losses related to held to maturity investment securities was $19 thousand for the year of 2020. There was no provision recorded on available for sale investment securities for the year of 2020. Due to loan interest payment deferrals granted by United under the CARES Act, United assessed the collectability of the accrued interest receivables on these deferring loans during 2020. As a result of this assessment, United recorded a provision for credit losses and an allowance for credit losses of $250 thousand for accrued interest receivables not expected to be collected as of December 31, 2020.
Management is not aware of any potential problem loans or leases, trends or uncertainties, which it reasonably expects, will materially impact future operating results, liquidity, or capital resources which have not been disclosed. Additionally, management has disclosed all known material credits, which cause management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the loan repayment schedules.
Other Income
Other income consists of all revenues, which are not included in interest and fee income related to earning assets. Noninterest income has been and will continue to be an important factor for improving United’s profitability. Recognizing the importance, management continues to evaluate areas where noninterest income can be enhanced.
Noninterest income for the year of 2020 was $354.75 million, which was an increase of $204.26 million or 135.74% from the year of 2019. The increase was due mainly to an increase in income from mortgage banking activities.
Income from mortgage banking activities totaled $266.09 million for the year of 2020 compared to $76.95 million for the year of 2019. The increase of $189.14 million or 245.80% for the year of 2020 was the result of increased production and sales of mortgage loans in the secondary market and the acquisition of Carolina Financial and, in particular, the acquisition of its mortgage banking subsidiary, Crescent. Mortgage loan sales were $6.26 billion in the year of 2020 as compared to $2.44 billion in the year of 2019. Mortgage loans originated for sale were $6.53 billion for the year of 2020 as compared to $2.57 billion for the year of 2019.
Mortgage loan servicing income of $6.21 million was added for the year of 2020 due to the acquisition of Carolina Financial.
United recognized a net gain of $3.16 million and on investment securities’ activity in 2020 as compared to a net gain of $175 thousand on investment securities activity in 2019. In particular, United recognized net gains of $2.50 million on the sales, calls and redemption of available-for-sale
securities investment securities and $578 thousand on equity securities for the year of 2020 as compared to a net gains of $97 thousand on the sales, calls and redemption of available-for-sale
securities investment securities and $133 thousand on equity securities for the year of 2019. In addition, United did not recognize any impairment on investment securities for the year of 2020 as compared to other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) of $198 thousand for the year of 2019.
Fees from brokerage services for the year of 2020 were $11.76 million, an increase of $1.62 million or 16.00% from the year of 2019 due to increased volume.
Fees from deposit services for the year of 2020 were $34.83 million, an increase of $1.07 million or 3.15% from the year of 2019. Debit card income increased $3.25 million which was partially offset by declines of $1.87 million and $1.22 million in overdraft fees and automated teller machine (“ATM”) fees.
United recognized a net gain of $2.23 million in the year of 2020 on the sale-leaseback of a bank premise.
Bankcard fees for the year of 2020 decreased $608 thousand or 13.01% from the year of 2019 due to a decline in interchange income from decreased volume.
Other Expense
Just as management continues to evaluate areas where noninterest income can be enhanced, it strives to improve the efficiency of its operations to reduce costs. Other expense includes all items of expense other than interest expense, the provision for credit losses and income tax expense. Noninterest expense for the year of 2020 was $578.22 million, which was an increase of $195.56 million or 51.11% from the year of 2019. Generally, this increase in 2020 from 2019 was the result of additional general operating expenses and increased merger-related charges from the Carolina Financial acquisition, higher compensation in the mortgage banking segment due to increased production and an increase in prepayment penalties on long-term FHLB advances.
Employee compensation for the year of 2020 increased $100.70 million or 57.89% from the year of 2019. This increase was due mainly to additional employees from the Carolina Financial acquisition. The remainder of the increase in employee compensation for the year of 2020 was due mainly to higher employee incentives and commissions expense primarily related to the increased mortgage banking production.
Employee benefits expense for the year of 2020 increased $13.13 million or 36.72% as compared to the year of 2019. Federal Insurance Contributions Act (“FICA”) expense for the year of 2020 increased $4.57 million due mainly to the additional employees from the Carolina Financial acquisition as well as the higher commissions expense. In addition, health insurance expense for the year of 2020 increased $1.46 million due to higher premiums and additional employees from the Carolina Financial acquisition. For the year of 2020, postretirement expense, which includes expense associated with United’s pension plan, supplemental early retirement plans (“SERPs”) and Savings and Stock Investment Plan (“401K plan”), increased $7.60 million from the year of 2019. United uses certain valuation methodologies to measure the fair value of the assets within United’s pension plan which are presented in Note P, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The funded status of United’s pension plan is based upon the fair value of the plan assets compared to the projected benefit obligation. The determination of the projected benefit obligation and the associated periodic benefit expense involves significant judgment and estimation of future employee compensation levels, the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. If United assumes a 1% increase or decrease in the estimation of future employee compensation levels while keeping all other assumptions constant, the benefit cost associated with the pension plan would increase by approximately $814 thousand and decrease by approximately $740 thousand, respectively. If United assumes a 1% increase or decrease in the discount rate while keeping all other assumptions constant, the benefit cost associated with the pension plan would decrease by approximately $2.72 million and increase by approximately $3.22 million, respectively. If United assumes a 1% increase or decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets while keeping all other assumptions constant, the benefit cost associated with the pension plan would decrease by approximately $1.63 million and increase by approximately $1.63 million, respectively.
Net occupancy expense increased $6.45 million or 18.52% for the year of 2020 as compared to the prior year. The increase was due mainly to increases of $3.07 million in building rental expense and $1.41 million in depreciation due mainly to the offices added in the Carolina Financial acquisition. In addition, building maintenance expense increased $965 thousand.
Equipment expense increased $6.65 million or 46.81% for the year of 2020 as compared to the same periods in 2019. The increase was due mainly to increases in equipment maintenance of $3.70 million and depreciation of $2.81 million due mainly to the Carolina Financial acquisition.
Data processing expense increased $13.19 million or 59.32% for the year of 2020 as compared to the year of 2019 due to additional processing as a result of the Carolina Financial acquisition. In addition, the increase for the year of 2020 was due to a $9.66 million penalty to terminate the contract with Carolina Financial’s data processor.
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance expense for the year of 2020 increased $2.06 million from the same periods in 2019 due to a Small Bank Assessment Credit in the third quarter of 2019 partially offset by the exclusion of a surcharge in 2020.
Mortgage loan servicing expense and impairment for the year of 2020 increased $9.01 million from the same time periods in 2019. The increase was due to the acquisition of Carolina Financial. In addition, United recorded a $1.38 million temporary impairment charge on its mortgage servicing rights during the year of 2020.
During the year of 2020, United incurred penalties of $10.39 million to prepay three long-term FHLB advances. United incurred similar penalties of $5.11 million to prepay certain long-term FHLB advances during the year of 2019.
Other expense for the year of 2020 increased $38.83 million or 48.03% from the year of 2019. Included in other expense for the year of 2020 were merger-related expenses of $13.07 million for the Carolina Financial acquisition as compared to $589 thousand for the year of 2019. The expense for the reserve for unfunded commitments for the year of 2020 increased $10.97 million from the same time periods in 2019. The increase for the year of 2020 included $1.82 million of expense related to the reserve for acquired unfunded commitments from Carolina Financial. In addition, the amortization of income tax credits, which reduces the effective tax rate, for the year of 2020 increased $5.68 million. Other specific items that increased due mainly to the Carolina Financial acquisition were consulting and legal expense of $4.12 million, loss on the sale and impairment of assets of $2.49 million, ATM fees of $1.96 million, credit report requests of $1.32 million and office supplies of $1.05 million. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease of $1.08 million in donations due mainly to a $1 million donation to the West Virginia University Children’s Hospital in the year of 2019.
Income Taxes
For the year ended December 31, 2020, income taxes were $70.72 million, compared to $64.34 million for 2019, an increase of $6.38 million or 9.91%. The increase was due mainly to higher earnings partially offset by a slight decline in the effective tax rate due in large part to the previously mentioned income tax credits. United’s effective tax rate was approximately 19.7% and 19.8% for years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as compared to 21.7% for 2018. For further details related to income taxes, see Note O, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Quarterly Results
Net income for the first quarter of 2020 was $40.18 million as compared to earnings of $63.64 million for the first quarter of 2019. The lower amount of net income was driven primarily by a higher provision for loan losses resulting from an adverse future macroeconomic forecast as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic. United’s annualized return on average assets for the first three months of 2020 was 0.82% and return on average shareholders’ equity was 4.82% as compared to 1.34% and 7.88% for the first three months of 2019. For the first three months of 2020, United’s annualized return on average tangible equity was 8.77%, as compared to 14.64% for the first three months of 2019. Net interest income for the first three months of 2020 was $141.52 million, a decrease of $2.65 million or 1.84% from net interest income of $144.17 million for the first three months of 2019. The decrease of $2.65 million in net interest income occurred because total interest income decreased $8.62 million while total interest expense only decreased $5.97 million from the first quarter of 2019. The provision for credit losses was $27.12 million for the first three months of 2020 as compared to $5.00 million for the first three months of 2019. This increase was due to mainly the adoption of the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) accounting standard by United on January 1, 2020 and the reasonable and supportable forecasts for future macroeconomic scenarios used in the estimation of expected credit losses adversely impacted by the COVID-19
pandemic. Noninterest income was $36.81 million for the first three months of 2020, an increase of $5.58 million or 17.88% from the first three months of 2019. Noninterest expense for the first three months of 2020 increased $11.71 million or 13.09% from the first three months of 2019. Income taxes decreased $7.44 million or 42.93% for the first three months of 2020 as compared to the first three months of 2019. The effective tax rate was 19.75% and 21.40% for the first quarter of 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Net income for the second quarter of 2020 was $52.69 million or $0.44 per diluted share, as compared to $67.21 million or $0.66 per diluted share for the prior year second quarter. For the second quarter of 2020, United’s annualized return on average assets was 0.87% and return on average shareholders’ equity was 5.40% as compared to 1.38% and 8.12% for the second quarter of 2019. Net interest income for the second quarter of 2020 was $170.60 million which was an increase of $20.05 million or 13.32% from the second quarter of 2019. The increase in net interest income occurred because total interest income decreased $528 thousand while total interest expense decreased $20.58 million from the second quarter of 2019. The provision for credit losses was $45.91 million for the second quarter of 2020 as compared to $5.42 million for the second quarter of 2019. The higher amount of provision expense for 2020 compared to 2019 was due mainly to a provision for loan losses of $28.95 million recorded on purchased non-PCD
loans from Carolina Financial and
the reasonable and supportable forecasts for future macroeconomic scenarios used in the estimation of expected credit losses adversely impacted by the COVID-19
pandemic under the new CECL accounting standard adopted by United on January 1, 2020 . For the second quarter of 2020, noninterest income was $88.39 million, which was an increase of $48.60 million or 122.11% from the second quarter of 2019. For the second quarter of 2020, noninterest expense increased $49.18 million or 49.08% from the second quarter of 2019. Income taxes for the second quarter of 2020 were $11.02 million as compared to $17.53 million for the second quarter of 2019. For the quarters ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, United’s effective tax rate was 17.30% and 20.69%, respectively.
Net income for the third quarter of 2020 was $103.78 million or $0.80 per diluted share, as compared to $65.97 million or $0.65 per diluted share for the prior year third quarter. Net interest income for the third quarter of 2020 was $185.66 million, which was an increase of $43.75 million or 30.82% from the third quarter of 2019. The $43.75 million increase in net interest income occurred because total interest income increased $19.92 million while total interest expense decreased $23.83 million from the third quarter of 2019. Provision for credit losses was $16.78 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to a provision of $5.03 million for the same period of 2019. For the third quarter of 2020, noninterest income was $135.47 million, an increase of $93.24 million or 220.83% from the third quarter of 2019 mainly as a result of mortgage banking activities. Income from mortgage banking activities totaled $109.46 million for the third quarter of 2020 compared to $24.02 million for the same period of 2019. For the third quarter of 2020, noninterest expense increased $75.46 million or 78.49% compared to the same period in 2019 mainly due to additional general operating expenses and increased merger-related charges from the Carolina Financial acquisition and an increase in prepayment penalties on long-term FHLB advances which were recognized during the third quarter of 2020. Income tax expense was $28.97 million as compared to $17.01 million for the third quarter of 2019. The increase in the third quarter of 2020 from the third quarter of 2019 was due to overall higher earnings and a higher effective tax rate. For the quarters ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, United’s effective tax rate was 21.82% and 20.50%, respectively.
Net income for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $92.37 million or $0.71 per diluted share as compared to earnings of $63.29 million or $0.62 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2019. Net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $191.99 million, which was an increase of $50.71 million or 35.89% from the fourth quarter of 2019. The $50.71 million increase in net interest income occurred because total interest income increased $25.05 million while total interest expense decreased $25.66 million from the fourth quarter of 2019. Tax-equivalent
net interest income, which adjusts for the tax-favored
status of income from certain loans and investments, for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $193.03 million, an increase of $50.90 million or 35.81% from the fourth quarter of 2019. Average earning assets for the fourth quarter of 2020 increased $5.96 billion or 34.71% from the fourth quarter of 2019 due to a $4.39 billion or 31.62% increase in average net loans, including loans held for sale, a $1.17 billion or 196.68% increase in average short-term investments and a $395.05 million or 14.72% increase in average investment securities. For the quarters ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the provision for loan and lease losses was $16.75 million and $5.87 million, respectively. The increase in the provision in relation to the prior year quarter was driven by the impact from the reasonable and supportable forecasts of future macroeconomic conditions used in the estimation of expected credit losses adversely impacted by the COVID-19
pandemic under CECL. Noninterest income for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $94.08 million, which was an increase of $56.84 million or 152.62% from the fourth quarter of 2019. The higher amount of noninterest income was due mainly to a rise of $53.25 million in income from mortgage banking activities due to an elevated volume of mortgage loan originations and sales in the secondary market and the acquisition of Carolina Financial, in particular, the acquisition of its mortgage banking subsidiary, Crescent. Noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $156.12 million, an increase of $59.22 million or 61.11% from the fourth quarter of 2019. In particular, employee compensation increased $32.60 million due mainly due to the Carolina Financial acquisition as well as due to higher employee incentives and commissions expense mainly related to higher mortgage banking production. Additionally, noninterest expense increased from the fourth quarter of 2019 due to a $10.79 million increase in other expense, a $3.36 million increase in mortgage loan servicing expense and impairment, a $2.98 million increase in employee benefits, a $2.87 million increase in equipment expense, and a $2.25 million increase in net occupancy expense. Within other expense, the largest drivers of the increase included an increase in the expense for the reserve for unfunded commitments of $3.33 million and an increase in the amortization of income tax credits of $1.89 million.
Additional quarterly financial data for 2020 and 2019 may be found in Note Z, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Effect of Inflation
United’s income statements generally reflect the effects of inflation. Since interest rates, loan demand and deposit levels are impacted by inflation, the resulting changes in the interest-sensitive assets and liabilities are included in net interest income. Similarly, operating expenses such as salaries, rents and maintenance include changing prices resulting from inflation. One item that would not reflect inflationary changes is depreciation expense. Subsequent to the acquisition of depreciable assets, inflation causes price levels to rise; therefore, historically presented dollar values do not reflect this inflationary condition. With inflation levels at relatively low levels and monetary and fiscal policies being implemented to keep the inflation rate increases within an acceptable range, management expects the impact of inflation would continue to be minimal in the near future.
The Effect of Regulatory Policies and Economic Conditions
United’s business and earnings are affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government, its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities. The Federal Reserve Board regulates the supply of money in order to influence general economic conditions. Among the instruments of monetary policy available to the Federal Reserve Board are (i) conducting open market operations in United States government obligations, (ii) changing the discount rate on financial institution borrowings, (iii) imposing or changing reserve requirements against financial institution deposits, and (iv) restricting certain borrowings and imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by financial institutions and their affiliates. These methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to affect directly the availability of bank loans and deposits, as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits.
United’s business and earnings are also affected by general and local economic conditions. Certain credit markets can experience difficult conditions and volatility. Downturns in the credit market can cause a decline in the value of certain loans and securities, a reduction in liquidity and a tightening of credit. A downturn in the credit market often signals a weakening economy that can cause job losses and thus distress on borrowers and their ability to repay loans. Uncertainties in credit markets and the economy present significant challenges for the financial services industry.
Regulatory policies and economic conditions have had a significant effect on the operating results of financial institutions in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future; however, United cannot accurately predict the nature, timing or extent of any effect such policies or economic conditions may have on its future business and earnings.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
In the opinion of management, United maintains liquidity that is sufficient to satisfy its depositors’ requirements and the credit needs of its customers. Like all banks, United depends upon its ability to renew maturing deposits and other liabilities on a daily basis and to acquire new funds in a variety of markets. A significant source of funds available to United is “core deposits”. Core deposits include certain demand deposits, statement and special savings and NOW accounts. These deposits are relatively stable, and they are the lowest cost source of funds available to United. Short-term borrowings have also been a significant source of funds. These include federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase as well as advances from the FHLB. Repurchase agreements represent funds which are obtained as the result of a competitive bidding process.
Liquid assets are cash and those items readily convertible to cash. All banks must maintain sufficient balances of cash and near-cash items to meet the day-to-day
demands of customers and United’s cash needs. Other than cash and due from banks, the available for sale securities portfolio and maturing loans are the primary sources of liquidity.
The goal of liquidity management is to ensure the ability to access funding which enables United to efficiently satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers and meet United’s cash needs. Liquidity is managed by monitoring funds’ availability from a number of primary sources. Substantial funding is available from cash and cash equivalents, unused short-term borrowing and a geographically dispersed network of branches providing access to a diversified and substantial retail deposit market.
Short-term needs can be met through a wide array of outside sources such as correspondent and downstream correspondent federal funds and utilization of Federal Home Loan Bank advances.
Other sources of liquidity available to United to provide long-term as well as short-term funding alternatives, in addition to FHLB advances, are long-term certificates of deposit, lines of credit, borrowings that are secured by bank premises or stock of United’s subsidiaries and issuances of trust preferred securities. In the normal course of business, United through its Asset Liability Committee evaluates these as well as other alternative funding strategies that may be utilized to meet short-term and long-term funding needs. See Notes L and M, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Cash flows provided by operations in 2020 were $140.45 million due mainly to net income of $289.02 million for the year of 2020. In 2019, cash flows provided by operations were $151.97 million due mainly to net income of $260.10 million for the year of 2019. In 2020, net cash of $137.59 million was provided by investing activities which was primarily due to net cash of $629.11 million provided in the acquisition of Carolina Financial and $123.00 million of proceeds from sales of investment securities over purchases. Partially offsetting these cash inflows from investing activities was loan growth of $619.98 million, mainly from the PPP loans. In 2019, net cash of $383.32 million was used in investing activities which was primarily due to net purchases of $100.09 million in investment securities and net growth of $285.25 million in loans. During the year of 2020, net cash of $1.09 billion was provided by financing activities due primarily to net growth of $2.86 billion in deposits. This source of cash from funding activities was partially offset by net repayment of $232.35 million in short-term borrowings, net repayment of $1.35 billion in long-term FHLB advances and cash dividends paid of $162.71 million for year of 2020. During the year of 2019, net cash of $48.45 million was provided by financing activities due primarily to net increases of $340.00 million and $23.33 million in long-term and short-term borrowings, respectively. Partially offsetting this source of cash from financing activities was the payment of cash dividends in the amount of $138.94 million, a net withdrawal of $141.54 million in deposits and the acquisition of treasury stock for $35.67 million. The net effect of the cash flow activities was an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $1.37 billion for the year of 2020 as compared to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $182.90 million for the year of 2019. See the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
United enters into derivative contracts, mainly to protect against adverse interest rate movements on the value of certain assets or liabilities, under which it is required to either pay cash to or receive cash from counterparties depending on changes in interest rates. Derivative contracts are carried at fair value and not notional value on the consolidated balance sheet and therefore do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid under these contracts. Further discussion of derivative instruments is included in Note S, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
United is also a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet
risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include loan commitments and standby letters of credit. United’s maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to the financial instrument for the loan commitments and standby letters of credit is the contractual or notional amount of those instruments. United uses the same policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance
sheet instruments. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
The following table details the amounts of significant commitments and letters of credit as of December 31, 2020:
Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses, generally within one year, and may require the payment of a fee. Further discussion of commitments is included in Note R, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
United anticipates it can meet its obligations over the next 12 months and has no material commitments for capital expenditures. There are no known trends, demands, commitments, or events that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in United’s liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way. United also has lines of credit available. See Notes L and M to the accompanying unaudited Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more details regarding the amounts available to United under lines of credit.
The Asset Liability Committee monitors liquidity to ascertain that a liquidity position within certain prescribed parameters is maintained. No changes are anticipated in the policies of United’s Asset Liability Committee.
United’s capital position is financially sound. United seeks to maintain a proper relationship between capital and total assets to support growth and sustain earnings. United has historically generated attractive returns on shareholders’ equity. United is well-capitalized based upon regulatory guidelines. United’s risk-based capital ratio is 15.55% at December 31, 2020 while its Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and leverage ratios are 13.30%, 13.30% and 10.34%, respectively. The December 31, 2020 ratios reflects United’s election of a five-year transition provision, allowed by the Federal Reserve Board and other federal banking agencies in response to the COVID-19
pandemic, to delay for two years the full impact of CECL on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. The regulatory requirements for a well-capitalized financial institution are a risk-based capital ratio of 10.0%, a Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.0% and a leverage ratio of 5.0%.
Total shareholders’ equity was $4.30 billion at December 31, 2020, increasing $933.79 million or 27.76% from year-end
2019 as a result of the Carolina Financial acquisition. Common stock increased $70.79 million or 26.84% due to 28,031,501 shares issued in the Carolina Financial acquisition. Surplus increased $754.30 million or 35.24% mainly due to the Carolina Financial acquisition. In addition, United retained $117.15 million in net earnings partially offset by a cumulative effective adjustment of $44.33 million recognized in retained earnings for the adoption of ASU 2016-13
by United on January 1, 2020. Accumulated other comprehensive income increased $57.24 million due mainly to an after-tax
increase of $56.54 million in the fair value of available for sale securities. Treasury stock increased $21.35 million or 15.50% due to the repurchase of 660,000 shares of United common stock under a stock repurchase plan approved by United’s Board of directors in November of 2019.
United’s equity to assets ratio was 16.41% at December 31, 2020 as compared to 17.11% at December 31, 2019. The primary capital ratio, capital and reserves to total assets and reserves, was 17.22% at December 31, 2020 as compared to 17.44% at December 31, 2019. United’s average equity to average asset ratio was 16.39% at December 31, 2020 as compared to 17.13% at December 31, 2019. All of these financial measurements reflect a financially sound position.
During the fourth quarter of 2020, United’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.35 per share. Dividends per share of $1.40 for the year of 2020 represented an increase over the $1.37 per share paid for 2019. Total cash dividends declared to common shareholders were $171.88 million for the year of 2020 as compared to $139.51 million for the year of 2019. The year 2020 was the forty-seventh consecutive year of dividend increases to United shareholders.
