ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Discussion in Item 7 relates solely to operations of Tengasco, Inc. and does not include discussion related to REP, LLC operations.
Results of Operations
The Company reported a net loss from continuing operations of $(3.6 million) or $(4.10) per share in 2020 compared to a net loss of $(436,000) or $(0.49) per share in 2019. Loss per share in 2020 and in 2019 has been adjusted for the impact of the 1 for 12 reverse stock split approved at the shareholder meeting dated February 25, 2021, effective with trading on March 1, 2021.
On October 22, 2020, we entered into the Merger Agreement, providing for an all-stock merger of with REP, LLC which successfully closed on February 26, 2021. This strategic combination accelerates our transition to a cash-return business model, including the implementation of a dividend strategy.
The Company realized revenues of approximately $3.0 million in 2020 compared to $4.9 million in 2019. During 2020, revenues decreased approximately $1.9 million of which $1.5 million of this decrease related to a $17.18 per barrel decrease in the average oil price received from $52.12 per barrel received in 2019 to $34.94 per barrel received in 2020. Revenue also decreased approximately $387,000 related to a 7.4 MBbl decrease in oil sales volumes from 93.7 MBbl in 2019 to 86.3 MBbl in 2020. The decrease in volumes was primarily related to lower sales volumes on the Veverka D lease due to declines from increased volumes associated with the polymer work performed in mid-2018, lower sales volumes on the Bellerive Stice well that was completed at the end of 2018, as well as natural declines on other properties, partially offset by sales from the Zimmerman well that was completed at the end of 2019.
The Company’s production costs and taxes were approximately $3.1 million in 2020 compared to $3.4 million in 2019. The $294,000 decrease in 2020 was primarily due to lower well repair and utility costs, partially offset by a change in the oil inventory adjustment and an increase in Kansas payroll costs.
Depreciation, depletion, and amortization was approximately $644,000 in 2020 compared to $716,000 in 2019. The $72,000 decrease in 2020 was due to a $50,000 decrease related to lower sales volumes, a $17,000 decrease related to a decrease in the oil and gas depletion rate, and a $5,000 decrease in depreciation on field vehicles.
The Company’s general and administrative cost was approximately $2.2 million in 2020 compared to $1.3 million in 2019. The $885,000 increase in 2020 was primarily due to costs related to the Merger Transaction with REP, LLC.
The Company performed its assessment for impairment of oil and gas properties and other assets during 2020 and 2019. During 2020, the Company recorded impairment of approximately $920,000 primarily as a result of lower oil prices experienced during 2020. During 2019, no impairments of oil and gas properties or other assets resulted from the Company’s assessment.
Other income was $166,000 in 2020 compared to $6,000 in 2019. The amount recorded in 2020 related to forgiveness of the Company’s Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loan. On November 5, 2020, the Company was notified by Prosperity Bank PPP loan had been forgiven and the loan was closed.
During 2020 and 2019, the Company did not have any open derivative positions.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At December 31, 2020, the Company had a revolving credit facility with Prosperity Bank. Upon closing the Merger Transaction with Riley on February 26, 2021, the credit facility with Prosperity Bank was terminated. Other than cash flow from operations, this credit facility has historically been the Company’s primary source to fund working capital and future capital spending. Under the credit facility, loans and letters of credit were available to the Company on a revolving basis in an amount outstanding not to exceed the lesser of $50 million or the Company’s borrowing base in effect from time to time. As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s borrowing base was $3.1 million, subject to a credit limit based on current covenants of approximately $1.442 million. The credit facility was secured by substantially all of the Company’s producing and non-producing oil and gas properties. The credit facility included certain covenants with which the Company was required to comply. At December 31, 2020, these covenants include the following: (a) Current Ratio > 1:1; (b) Funded Debt to EBITDA < 3.5x; and (c) Interest Coverage > 3.0x. At December 31, 2020, the interest rate on this credit facility was 3.75%. The Company was in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
The Company had zero borrowings under the facility on December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. As the credit facility was terminated on February 26, 2021, no further borrowing base reviews will take place.
Net cash used in operating activities was $1.5 million in 2020 compared to $226,000 provided by operating activities in 2019. In 2020, cash flow provided by working capital was $571,000 compared to $163,000 of cash flow used in working capital during 2019. The change in cash used in operating activities during 2020 was primarily related to decreased revenues as a result of lower oil prices, and decreased revenues as a result of lower sales volumes, and increase in general and administrative expenses primarily as a result of costs related to the Merger Transaction with Riley.
Net cash used in investing activities was $71,000 in 2020 compared to $233,000 in 2019. The $162,000 decrease in cash used in investing activities during 2020 was due primarily to drilling and polymer costs incurred during 2019, and proceeds from the sale of equipment inventory in 2019.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $126,000 in 2020 compared to $106,000 used in financing activities in 2019. The change in net cash provided by financing activities was due the Company receiving approximately $166,000 from the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loan in May 2020. This loan was forgiven in November 2020.
On February 26, 2021, the Company completed an all-stock merger with REP, LLC. On the closing date of the Merger Transaction, each common unit of REP, LLC was automatically converted into the right to receive 97.796467 shares of Company common stock. This exchange ratio has not been adjusted for the impact of the 1 for 12 reverse stock split approved at the shareholder meeting dated February 25, 2021, effective with trading on March 1, 2021. Based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on February 26, 2021, the total value of the Company common stock issued to holders of REP, LLC common units as part of the Merger Transaction was approximately $500 million.
With this strategic merger, we are accelerating our transition to a cash-return business model, which moderates growth, emphasizes capital efficiencies and prioritizes cash returns to shareholders. These principles will position the Company to be a consistent builder of economic value through the cycle. The post-merger scalability is expected to enhance the Company’s free cash flow, credit profile and decrease the overall cost of capital.
Critical Accounting Policies
The Company prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing the Company’s financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Revenue Recognition
The Company identifies the contracts with each of its customers and the separate performance obligations associated with each of these contracts. Revenues are recognized when the performance obligations are satisfied and when it transfers control of goods or services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
Crude oil is sold on a month-to-month contract at a price based on an index price from the purchaser, net of differentials. Crude oil that is produced is stored in storage tanks. The Company will contact the purchaser and request them to pick up the crude oil from the storage tanks. When the purchaser picks up the crude from the storage tanks, control of the crude transfers to the purchaser, the Company’s contractual obligation is satisfied, and revenues are recognized. The sales of oil represent the Company’s share of revenues net of royalties and excluding revenue interests owned by others. When selling oil on behalf of royalty owners or working interest owners, the Company is acting as an agent and thus reports revenues on a net basis. Fees and other deductions incurred prior to transfer of control are recorded as production costs. Revenues are reported net of fees and other deductions incurred after transfer of control.
The Company operates certain salt water disposal wells, some of which accept water from third parties. The contracts with the third parties primarily require a flat monthly fee for the third parties to dispose water into the wells. In some cases, the contract is based on a per barrel charge to dispose water into the wells. There is no requirement under the contracts for these third parties to use these wells for their water disposal. If the third parties do dispose water into the Company operated wells in a given month, the Company has met its contractual obligations and revenues are recognized for that month.

There were no natural gas imbalances at December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019.
Full Cost Method of Accounting
The Company follows the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas property acquisition, exploration, and development activities. Under this method, all costs incurred in connection with acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas reserves are capitalized. Capitalized costs include lease acquisitions, seismic related costs, certain internal exploration costs, drilling, completion, and estimated asset retirement costs. The capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, plus estimated future development costs relating to proved reserves and estimated asset retirement costs which are not already included net of estimated salvage value, are amortized on the unit-of-production method based on total proved reserves. The Company has determined its reserves based upon reserve reports provided by LaRoche Petroleum Consultants Ltd. since 2009. The costs of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated, subject to an annual assessment of whether impairment has occurred. The Company had $0 in unevaluated properties as of both December 31, 2020 and 2019. Proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties are accounted for as reductions to capitalized costs unless such sales cause a significant change in the relationship between costs and the estimated value of proved reserves, in which case a gain or loss is recognized. At the end of each reporting period, the Company performs a “ceiling test” on the value of the net capitalized cost of oil and gas properties. This test compares the net capitalized cost (capitalized cost of oil and gas properties, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization and related deferred income taxes) to the present value of estimated future net revenues from oil and gas properties using an average price (arithmetic average of the beginning of month prices for the prior 12 months) and current cost discounted at 10% plus cost of properties not being amortized and the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproven properties included in the cost being amortized (ceiling). If the net capitalized cost is greater than the ceiling, a write-down or impairment is required. A write-down of the carrying value of the asset is a non-cash charge that reduces earnings in the current period. Once incurred, a write-down cannot be reversed in a later period.
Oil and Gas Reserves/Depletion, Depreciation, and Amortization of Oil and Gas Properties
The capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, plus estimated future development costs relating to proved reserves and estimated asset retirement costs which are not already included net of estimated salvage value, are amortized on the unit-of-production method based on total proved reserves. The costs of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated, subject to an annual assessment of whether impairment has occurred.
The Company’s proved oil and gas reserves as of December 31, 2020 were determined by LaRoche Petroleum Consultants, Ltd. Projecting the effects of commodity prices on production, and timing of development expenditures includes many factors beyond the Company’s control. The future estimates of net cash flows from the Company’s proved reserves and their present value are based upon various assumptions about future production levels, prices, and costs that may prove to be incorrect over time. Any significant variance from assumptions could result in the actual future net cash flows being materially different from the estimates.
Asset Retirement Obligations
The Company’s asset retirement obligations relate to the plugging, dismantling, and removal of wells drilled to date. The Company follows the requirements of FASB ASC 410, “Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Obligations”. Among other things, FASB ASC 410 requires entities to record a liability and corresponding increase in long-lived assets for the present value of material obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets. Over the passage of time, accretion of the liability is recognized as an operating expense and the capitalized cost is depleted over the estimated useful life of the related asset. If the estimated future cost of the asset retirement obligation changes, an adjustment is recorded to both the asset retirement obligation and the long-lived asset. Revisions to estimated asset retirement obligations can result from changes in retirement cost estimates, revisions to estimated inflation rates and changes in the estimated timing of abandonment. The Company currently uses an estimated useful life of wells typically ranging from 20-40 years. Management continues to periodically evaluate the appropriateness of these assumptions.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires the establishment of deferred tax accounts for all temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using currently enacted federal and state income tax rates. In addition, deferred tax accounts must be adjusted to reflect new rates if enacted into law.
Realization of deferred tax assets is contingent on the generation of future taxable income. As a result, management considers whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of such assets will be realized during periods when they are available, and if not, management provides a valuation allowance for amounts not likely to be recognized.
Management periodically evaluates tax reporting methods to determine if any uncertain tax positions exist that would require the establishment of a loss contingency. A loss contingency would be recognized if it were probable that a liability has been incurred as of the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
The amount recognized is subject to estimates and management’s judgment with respect to the likely outcome of each uncertain tax position. The amount that is ultimately incurred for an individual uncertain tax position or for all uncertain tax positions in the aggregate could differ from the amount recognized.
