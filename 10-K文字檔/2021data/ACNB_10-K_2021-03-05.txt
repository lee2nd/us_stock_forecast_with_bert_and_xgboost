ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
INTRODUCTION
The following is management’s discussion and analysis of the significant changes in the financial condition, results of operations, comprehensive income, capital resources, and liquidity presented in its accompanying consolidated financial statements for ACNB Corporation (the Corporation or ACNB), a financial holding company. Please read this discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and disclosures included herein. Current performance does not guarantee, assure or indicate similar performance in the future.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The accounting policies that the Corporation’s management deems to be most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations, and that require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgment, often result in the need to make estimates about the effect of such matters which are inherently uncertain. The following policies are deemed to be critical accounting policies by management:
The allowance for loan losses represents management’s estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Management makes numerous assumptions, estimates and adjustments in determining an adequate allowance. The Corporation assesses the level of potential loss associated with its loan portfolio and provides for that exposure through an allowance for loan losses. The allowance is established through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings. The allowance is an estimate of the losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the end of each reporting period. The Corporation assesses the adequacy of its allowance on a quarterly basis. The specific methodologies applied on a consistent basis are discussed in greater detail under the caption, Allowance for Loan Losses, in a subsequent section of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The evaluation of securities for other-than-temporary impairment requires a significant amount of judgment. In estimating other-than-temporary impairment losses, management considers various factors including the length of time the fair value has been below cost, the financial condition of the issuer, and the Corporation’s intent to sell, or requirement to sell, the security before recovery of its value. Declines in fair value that are determined to be other than temporary are charged against earnings.
Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, requires that goodwill is not amortized to expense, but rather that it be assessed or tested for impairment at least annually. Impairment write-downs are charged to results of operations in the period in which the impairment is determined. The Corporation did not identify any impairment on RIG’s outstanding goodwill from its most recent testing, which was performed as of October 1, 2020. The Corporation did not identify any impairment on the Bank’s outstanding goodwill from its most recent qualitative assessment, which was completed as of December 31, 2020. If certain events occur which might indicate goodwill has been impaired, the goodwill is tested for impairment when such events occur. Other acquired intangible assets that have finite lives, such as core deposit intangibles, customer relationship intangibles and renewal lists, are amortized over their estimated useful lives and subject to periodic impairment testing. Core deposit intangibles are primarily amortized over ten years using accelerated methods. Customer renewal lists are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives which range from eight to fifteen years.
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
ACNB acquired Frederick County Bancorp, Inc. (FCBI) and its wholly-owned subsidiary Frederick County Bank, effective January 11, 2020. On July 1, 2017, ACNB Corporation acquired New Windsor Bancorp, Inc. (New Windsor) and New Windsor State Bank. The acquisitions were part of ACNB Corporation’s long-term strategic plan to enhance shareholder value by systematically and methodically expanding into new geographic markets and growing our customer base. The $6.0 million in expenses to acquire FCBI were anticipated. A second nonrecurring 2020 event was the onset and continuation of negative economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic had immediate unanticipated financial impacts in 2020 and uncertain future negative financial impacts. As a result of both events, 2020 net income was reduced $5.3 million after 2019 experienced record net income. Even with reduced income ACNB remained financially well capitalized
ACNB Corporation uses non-GAAP financial measures to provide information useful to investors in understanding our operating performance and trends, and to facilitate comparisons with the performance of our peers. The non-GAAP financial measures and key performance indicators we use may differ from the non-GAAP financial measures and key performance
indicators other financial institutions use to measure their performance and trends. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP operating measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the tables below.
This 2020 net income figure of $18,394,000 represents a 22.5% decrease over the net income results for the year ended December 31, 2019. Basic earnings per share in 2020 decreased 36.6% over the earnings per share for 2019.
The primary source of the Corporation’s revenues is net interest income derived from interest earned on loans and investments, less deposit and borrowing funding costs. Revenues are influenced by general economic factors, including market interest rates, the economy of the markets served, stock market conditions, as well as competitive forces within the markets.
The Corporation’s overall strategy is to increase loan growth in local markets, while maintaining a reasonable funding base by offering competitive deposit products and services. The year 2020 was especially challenging for financial institutions with COVID-19 both slowing economic activity and FOMC slashing interest rates. ACNB continued to be profitable, well capitalized exercising its strategic plan and operationally sound despite these challenges.
Higher merger-related net interest income and improved fee income was offset by much higher Provision for Loan Losses and increased expenses (including nonrecurring merger-related) resulting in decreased income before income taxes of $22,702,000 in 2020, compared to $29,366,000 in 2019. State and Federal taxes decreased net income to $18,394,000, or $2.13 per share, in 2020, compared to $23,721,000, or $3.36 per share, in 2019. Returns on average equity were 7.39% and 13.33% in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
In 2020, the Corporation’s net interest margin was reduced to 3.35%, compared to 3.81% in 2019. Net interest income was $73,068,000 in 2020, as compared to $59,418,000 in 2019.
Other income was $19,934,000 and $18,169,000 in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The largest source of other income is commissions from insurance sales attributable to Russell Insurance Group, Inc. (RIG). Commissions from insurance sales decreased by 3.4% in 2020 to $6,125,000, because of lower contingent commissions as a result of specific practices of the insurance carriers. There were no sales of securities in 2020 or 2019. A $193,000 net loss (fair value change, none were sold) was recognized on local bank and CRA-related equity securities in 2020 due to frequent market changes in publicly-traded stocks, compared to a $267,000 net gain in 2019. Income from fiduciary, investment management and brokerage activities, which includes fees from both institutional and personal trust, investment management services, estate settlement and brokerage services, totaled $2,672,000 for 2020, as compared to $2,469,000 for 2019, an 8.2% net increase as a net result of higher fee volume from increased assets under management, higher sporadic estate fee income, and 35% higher fees on brokerage
relationships. Service charges on deposit accounts decreased 14.0% to $3,355,000 for 2020, due to significantly reduced consumer spending that creates the Bank’s fees. Fee volume varies with balance levels, account transaction activity, and customer-driven events such as overdrawing account balances. Revenue from ATM and debit card transactions increased 20.5% to $2,946,000 due to increased customer use of electronic products during shutdowns.
Other expenses increased to $61,160,000, or by 28.4%, in 2020, as compared to $47,621,000 in 2019. The largest component of other expenses is salaries and employee benefits, which increased 22.5% to $35,278,000 in 2020, compared to $28,798,000 in 2019, due to an increase in merger-combined organization employees, annual merit increases, and the increased cost of benefits. Compared to 2019, occupancy expense increased 19.0% in 2020 mostly due to higher net lease expense and merger-acquired locations; and equipment expense increased 14.1% due to expenses related to merger-acquired locations. Professional services expense decreased 20.0% from sporadic risk, loan, legal and corporate governance engagements, and for prior year one-time consulting fee for selecting a new core banking system. Marketing and corporate relations expense increased by 0.4% due to muted specific campaigns and brand awareness activities. FDIC and regulatory expense increased by 41.3% based on these agencies’ formulas and credits and COVID-19 related high balance sheet growth . In 2020, foreclosed real estate expenses decreased $168,000, or 1,400.0%, resulting varying expenses and recoveries in each year. Merger-related expenses were $5,965,000 in 2020, compared to $769,000 in 2019, due to majority of FCBI acquisition expenses occurring in 2020. A more thorough discussion of the Corporation’s results of operations is included in the following pages.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Net Interest Income
The primary source of ACNB’s traditional banking revenue is net interest income, which represents the difference between interest income on earning assets and interest expense on liabilities used to fund those assets. Earning assets include loans, securities, and interest bearing deposits with banks. Interest bearing liabilities include deposits and borrowings.
Net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates, volume of interest bearing assets and liabilities, and the composition of those assets and liabilities. The “interest rate spread” and “net interest margin” are two common statistics related to changes in net interest income. The interest rate spread represents the difference between the yields earned on interest earning assets and the rates paid for interest bearing liabilities. The net interest margin is defined as the percentage of net interest income to average earning assets, which also considers the Corporation’s net non-interest bearing funding sources, the largest of which are non-interest bearing demand deposits and stockholders’ equity.
The following table includes average balances, rates, interest income and expense, interest rate spread, and net interest margin:
Table 1 - Average Balances, Rates and Interest Income and Expense
For yield calculation purposes, nonaccruing loans are included in average loan balances. Loan fees (expense) of $3,391,000 and $317,000 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, are included in interest income. Yields on tax-exempt securities and loans are not tax effected.
Table 1 presents balance sheet items on a daily average basis, net interest income, interest rate spread, and net interest margin for the years ending December 31, 2020 and 2019. Table 2 analyzes the relative impact on net interest income for changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and changes in rates earned and paid by the Corporation on such assets and liabilities.
Net interest income totaled $73,068,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $59,418,000 for the same period in 2019, an increase of $13,650,000, or 23.0%. Net interest income increased due to an increase in interest income to a greater extent than an increase in interest expense. Interest income increased $15,732,000, or 22.6%, due to the acquisition of FCBI increasing average earning assets, in addition to volume from organic growth (including the SBA Paycheck Protection Program (PPP)) and increased purchase accounting adjustments net of decreased rates due to market events. The increase in interest expense resulted from FCBI related additions and organic deposit growth net of deposit rate decreases. Increased loans outstanding was a result of active participation in the PPP enacted in response to the COVID-19 crisis, the acquisition of FCBI, and a concerted effort by management to offset the recent year trend of the market area’s heightened competition and declines in the U.S. Treasury yields and other market driver interest rates. The year 2020 saw much lower market yields and the difference between longer term rates and shorter term rates was modest. These driver rates affect new loan originations and are indexed to a portion of the loan portfolio in that a change in the driver rates changes the yield on new loans and on existing loans at subsequent interest rate reset dates. From these changes, interest income yield was negatively affected as new loans
replace paydowns on existing loans and variable rate loans reset to new current rates in these years. Partially offsetting lower yields were FCBI purchase accounting adjustments that increased yield. Interest income increased on investment securities due to new purchases. An elevated amount of earning assets remained in short-term, low-rate money market type accounts during 2020; and there exists ample ability to borrow for liquidity needs. The ability to increase lending is contingent on the effects of intense competition that has reduced new loans and may result in the payoff of existing loans, as well as economic conditions in the Corporation’s marketplace. As to funding costs, interest rates on alternative funding sources, such as the FHLB, and other market driver rates are factors in rates the Corporation and the local market pay for deposits. However, after COVID-19 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)actions, rates on transaction, savings and time deposits, were sharply reduced in order to match sharply reduced market earning asset yields. Interest expense increased $2,082,000, or 20.5% due to the FCBI acquisition and large organic volume and year over year rates variances, partially offset by less use of higher cost borrowings. The medical need to stop the spread of COVID-19 caused government officials to close or restrict the operations of many businesses and their workers. One of the responses was for the Federal Reserve to decrease rates to 0% to 0.25%. The effects of these rate actions and a host of other responses cannot be predicted currently. Over the longer term, the Corporation continues its strategic direction to increase asset yield and interest income by means of loan growth and rebalancing the composition of earning assets to commercial loans.
The net interest spread for 2020 was 3.14% compared to 3.61% during 2019. Also comparing 2020 to 2019, the yield on interest earning assets decreased by 0.55% and the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased by 0.08%. The net interest margin was 3.35% for 2020 and 3.81% for 2019. The net interest margin decrease was net of higher purchase accounting adjustments which increased 23 basis points, but was decreased by less loans as a percentage in the earning asset mix and more lower yielding investments and liquidity assets.
Average earning assets were $2,181,492,000 in 2020, an increase of $620,497,000, or 39.8%, from the average balance of $1,560,995,000 in 2019. Liquidity assets represented the largest increase in average assets in 2020, while increased lending represented the largest increase in 2019. Changes in the investment portfolio in both years were made to balance liquidity needs and to collateralize eligible deposits. Average interest bearing liabilities were $1,581,101,000 in 2020, up from $1,193,463,000 in 2019. Average non-interest bearing demand deposits increased 61.8% in 2020, continuing the upward trend from 2019. All increases were in large part due to the acquisition of FCBI and to the COVID-19 related effect of money parked in the banking system during government-mandated shutdowns. On average, deposits (including non-interest bearing) were up 43.4%, while borrowings decreased by 18.8% due to principal paybacks. Lower-cost transaction and savings deposits were relatively stable in 2020. The increase in time deposits was in part from existing customers moving to higher rates available from time deposit rates due to competitive pricing.
The rate/volume analysis detailed in Table 2 shows that the increase in net interest income in 2020 was due to loan volume increases and rate decreases in earning asset offsetting rate and volume increases in funding cost. Earning asset yields decreased due to much lower market rates. Interest expense increased due to higher deposit volumes and rates.
The following table shows changes in net interest income attributed to changes in rates and changes in average balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities:
Table 2 - Rate/Volume Analysis
The net change attributable to the combination of rate and volume has been allocated on a consistent basis between volume and rate based on the absolute value of each. For yield calculation purposes, nonaccruing loans are included in average balances.
Provision for Loan Losses
The provision for loan losses charged against earnings was $9,140,000 in 2020 and $600,000 in 2019. The determination of a need for a provision was a result of the analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses calculation. The allowance for loan and lease losses generally does not include the loans acquired from the FCBI or New Windsor acquisition which were recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. Each quarter, the Corporation assesses risk in the loan portfolio compared with the balance in the allowance for loan losses and the current evaluation factors. The 2020 provision was calculated to be much higher due to higher charge-offs including a first quarter charge off of a $2,000,000 loan after the death of the borrower and a third quarter COVID-19 related $675,000 charge-off based on principal forgiveness to achieve a projected fourth quarter loan payoff. The second cause for the large increase was a quantitative factor developed that attempts to measure the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic related closure of and impact of restrictions on many of the Bank’s business customers for an undetermined time period. This customer base includes businesses in the hospitality/tourism industry, restaurants and related businesses and lessors of commercial real estate properties. The estimation of the qualitative factor for this event was approximately $4,100,000 for a total of $9,140,000 in provision expense. The remainder was due to the above-mentioned charge-offs, increase in economic qualitative factors, and adjustment to the New Windsor acquired portfolio. Otherwise, management concluded that before the COVID-19 pandemic and the unanticipated deficiencies in the unsecured loans, the loan portfolio exhibited continued general improvement in quantitative and qualitative credit quality measurements as shown in the tables and narrative in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, despite the potential for credit problems resulting from the 2020 shutting down of major business and consumer economic sections. In light of that credit problem potential, it was assessed that credit quality was stable, the majority charge-offs were not COVID-19 related and past due loans manageable. The increase in provision expense related to the measurement of latent current losses developed by various economic metric used to measure COVID-19 credit quality potential damage and changes in anchoring metrics that drive qualitative factors. This same analysis concluded that the unallocated allowance should be a higher percentage range in 2020 compared with the prior periods due to lags in metrics after renewed COVID-19 flare ups.
For additional discussion of the provision and the loans associated therewith, please refer to the Asset Quality section of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis. ACNB charges confirmed loan losses to the allowance and credits the allowance
for recoveries of previous loan charge-offs. For 2020, the Corporation had net charge-offs of $2,749,000 as compared to net charge-offs of $729,000 for 2019. $2,000,000 in 2020 charge-offs were not COVID-19 related.
Other Income
Other income was $19,934,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a $1,765,000, or 9.7%, increase from 2019. The largest source of other income is commissions from insurance sales from RIG, which decreased 3.4% to $6,125,000 in 2020. The decreases were due to an increase in personal lines commission income from new insurance books of business acquired offset by a larger decrease in contingent commission payments. The contingent, or extra, commissions is at the discretion of various insurance carriers in accordance with applicable insurance regulations. Heightened pressure on commissions is expected to continue in this business line.
There were no gains or losses on sales of securities in 2020 or 2019. A $193,000 net loss (fair value derived) was recognized on local bank and CRA-related equity securities during 2020 due to frequent market value changes in publicly-traded stocks and decreased market values for financial equities in particular, compared to a net gain of $267,000 in 2019. Income from fiduciary, investment management and brokerage activities, which includes fees from both institutional and personal trust, investment management services, estate settlement and brokerage services, totaled $2,672,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $2,469,000 for 2019. At December 31, 2020, ACNB had total assets under administration of approximately $436,700,000, compared to $389,000,000 at the end of 2019. The revenue increase was a net result of higher fee volume from increased assets under management, higher sporadic estate settlement income which varies with specific activity, and higher transaction-based fees on brokerage relationships.
Service charges on deposit accounts decreased 14.0% to $3,355,000, due to COVID-19 related slow economic conditions that reduced fee generating activity. Fee volume varies with balance levels, account transaction activity, and customer-driven events such as overdrawing account balances. Further, various specific government regulations and policies effectively limit fee assessments related to deposit accounts, making future revenue levels uncertain. Revenue from ATM and debit card transactions increased 20.5% to $2,946,000 due to variations in volume and mix, including the new FCBI market and COVID-19 related higher volume. The longer term trend had been increases resulting from consumer desire to use more electronic delivery channels (Internet and mobile applications); however, regulations or legal challenges for large financial institutions may impact industry pricing for such transactions and fees in connection therewith in future periods, the effect of which cannot be currently quantified. A more immediate challenge to this revenue source is the general COVID-19 event and related impact caused decrease in retail activity and the retail system-wide security breaches in the merchant base that are negatively affecting consumer confidence in the debit card channel. Income from sold mortgages, included in other income, increased by $1,634,000, or 234.4%, to $2,331,000 in 2020 as customer demand for refinancing in the low rate environment led to origination of mortgage types that were sold in the secondary market. This revenue source is subject to wide divergence due to national and local economic trends.
Impairment Testing
RIG and ACNB Bank has certain long-lived assets, including purchased intangible assets subject to amortization such as insurance books of business, core deposit intangibles and associated goodwill assets, which are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the statement of condition and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated.
Goodwill, which has an indefinite useful life, is evaluated for impairment annually and is evaluated for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset’s fair value. Accounting rules permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The goodwill impairment analysis involves comparing the reporting unit’s estimated fair value to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired. If the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess. Subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted.
As noted above, commissions from insurance sales were down 3.4% in 2020, and RIG’s stand alone net income decreased 38.2% in 2020 compared to 2019. The testing for potential impairment involves methods that include both current and projected income amounts, and RIG’s fair value remained above the carrying value as of the most recent annual impairment test date. Thus, the results of the annual evaluations determined that there was no impairment of RIG’s goodwill, including the
testing at October 1, 2020. However, declines in RIG’s net income or changes in external market factors, including likely buyers that are assumed in impairment testing, may require an impairment charge to goodwill. The Corporation did not identify any impairment on the Bank’s outstanding goodwill from its most recent qualitative and quantitative assessments, which were completed as of December 31, 2020. Should it be determined in a future period that the goodwill has been impaired, then a charge to earnings will be recorded in the period that such a determination is made.
Other Expenses
Other expenses increased 28.4% to $61,160,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The largest component of other expenses is salaries and employee benefits, which increased 22.5% in 2020 to $35,278,000 compared to $28,798,000 in 2019. The reasons for the increase in salaries and employee benefits expenses include the following:
•replacing and maintaining customer-facing staff through the COVID-19 event due to a competitive labor market;
•the customer-facing staff retained to service the FCBI market;
•increased staff in support functions and higher skilled mix of employees necessitated by regulations and growth;
•normal merit increases to employees and associated payroll taxes;
•varying and timing on performance-based commissions, restricted stock grants and incentives;
•market changes in actively managing employee benefit plan costs, including health insurance;
•varying costs of 401(k) plan and non-qualified retirement plan benefits; and,
•defined benefit pension expense due to plan investment performance and changes in discount rates. This expense decreased by $450,000 in 2020 compared to 2019.
The Corporation reduced the benefit formula for the defined benefit pension plan effective January 1, 2010, in order to manage total benefit costs. Subsequently, the Corporation amended the defined benefit pension plan effective April 1, 2012, in that no employee hired after March 31, 2012, shall be eligible to participate in the pension plan and no inactive or former plan participant shall be eligible to again participate in the pension plan. The Corporation’s overall pension plan investment strategy is to achieve a mix of investments to meet the long-term rate of return assumption and near-term pension obligations with a diversification of asset types, fund strategies, and fund managers. The mix of investments is adjusted periodically by retaining an advisory firm to recommend appropriate allocations after reviewing the Corporation’s risk tolerance on contribution levels, funded status, plan expense, as well as any applicable regulatory requirements. However, the determination of future benefit expense is also dependent on the fair value of assets and the discount rate on the year-end measurement date, which in recent years has experienced fair value volatility and low discount rates. Although 2020 reflected negative expense (income benefit), the expense will be higher in 2021 due to volatility in the discount rates at the latest measurement date, varying plan returns, and change in mortality tables utilized. The expense will be vary in future years due to these variables. A pension provision in a public law known as MAP-21, enacted in July 2012, had no effect on reducing the GAAP expense associated with the plan. In addition, the ACNB plan has maintained a well-funded status under ERISA rules.
Net occupancy expense was up 19.0% at $3,681,000 in 2020 and $3,094,000 in 2019. Equipment expense totaled $5,442,000 during 2020, as compared to $4,771,000 during 2019. Occupancy expense was up in 2020 due to additional offices as a part of the FCBI acquisition and equipment expense increased due to tech equipment expenditures including those for the FCBI market in 2020. In addition, increased outsourced processing costs were associated with more use of electronic banking channels. Equipment expense is subject to ever-increasing technology demands and the need for system upgrades for electronic delivery, security and reliability purposes.
Professional services expense totaled $1,417,000 for 2020, as compared to $1,772,000 for 2019. The variation in expense from year to year included varying legal costs associated with problem loans and corporate governance, as well as the expense of heightened compliance monitoring on existing regulations and the expense of implementing new regulations. In addition, ACNB paid $591,000 in one time consulting costs to negotiate a core system contract that replaces a contract that expired in 2019. Other tax expense increased $122,000 or 11.2% in 2020 compared to 2019 due to higher Pennsylvania Bank Shares Tax. The Pennsylvania Bank Shares Tax is a shareholders’ equity-based tax and is subject to increases based on state government parameters and the level of the shareholders’ equity base that increased with the retained earnings equity increase and higher rate. Supplies and postage expense decreased in 2020 compared to the prior year due to variation in timing of sporadic refills.
Marketing and corporate relations expense increased 0.4% from 2019 to 2020. Marketing expense varies with the timing and amount of planned advertising production and media expenditures, typically related to the promotion of certain in-market banking and trust products; and to promote and inform the FCBI marketplace of the ACNB acquisition, and ACNB’s products and systems.
FDIC and regulatory expense for 2020 was $616,000, an increase of $180,000 from $436,000 in 2019 based on FDIC variations in asset base and rate in credits received in the two periods based on the FDIC fund reaching a particular funding ratio. This credit does not necessarily repeat in future periods depending on the change in the funding ratio. FDIC expense varies with changes in net asset size, risk ratings, and FDIC derived assessment rates.
Foreclosed assets held for resale consist of the fair value of real estate acquired through foreclosure on real estate loan collateral or the acceptance of ownership of real estate in lieu of the foreclosure process. Fair values are based on appraisals that consider the sales prices of similar properties in the proximate vicinity less estimated selling costs. Foreclosed real estate (income) expenses were $(156,000) and $12,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Expenses decreased in 2020 due to settlements on properties written down in prior years. Values are written down based upon updated appraisals less selling costs (which in the often extended marketing periods can create multiple year expenses) and other fair value adjustments, or in some cases properties are written down based on sales agreements that do not subsequently close. In all, the historically high costs of all years consisted of these write-downs and other costs to carry and was due to the increased number and varying mix of commercial and residential collateral for which such carrying costs include insurance, property maintenance, unpaid and ongoing property taxes, and deferred maintenance required upon acquisition. Foreclosed real estate expenses will vary in 2021 depending on the unknown expenses related to any new properties acquired.
Intangible assets amortization increased 103.5% due to insurance books of business and calculated amortization on the bank acquisition intangible. Other operating expense increased $183,000 or 3.7% in 2020 as a result of a variety of increases including various delivery channels cost, corporate governance and risk management (including training) expenditures.
Merger related expenses totaled $5,965,000 in 2020 compared to $769,000 in 2019, due to the acquisition and integration of FCBI in 2020. Merger expenses included legal and consulting expenses to effect the legal merger, investment banking and preparing purchase accounting adjustments. Integration expenses included severance payments to FCBI staff separated by the merger, consultant costs to integrate FCBI systems into ACNB’s systems and the cost to terminate all FCBI core banking and electronic technology systems contracts. These costs were all necessary to provide requisite internal controls and cost effective core banking technology systems going forward. The costs of integrating all systems into one system was important to the merger viability and ongoing system integrity and quality.
Provision for Income Taxes
ACNB recognized income taxes of $4,308,000, or 19.0% of pretax income, during 2020, as compared to $5,645,000, or 19.2%, during 2019. The variances from the federal statutory rate of 21% in the respective periods are generally due to tax-exempt income from investments in and loans to state and local units of government at below-market rates (an indirect form of taxation), investment in bank-owned life insurance, and investments in low-income housing partnerships (which qualify for federal tax credits).
The varying effective tax rate during 2020 and 2019 was a result of varying pretax income in relationship to expiration of tax credits, varying levels of tax-exempt investments and allocation between states. Pretax income decreased due to internal growth offset by merger and provision for loan loss expenses. At December 31, 2020, net deferred tax assets amounted to $3,928,000. Deferred tax assets are realizable primarily through future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and future earnings. Management currently anticipates timing difference reversals will be adequate to utilize deferred tax assets. Accordingly, no valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets at December 31, 2020.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Average earning assets increased in 2020 to $2,181,492,000, or by 39.8%, from $1,560,995,000 in 2019. Loans increased from the PPP program and loans acquired from FCBI. Besides deposits acquired from FCBI, deposit increases were largely due to consumers and businesses seeking the safety and security of banks, as well as cash infusions from federal stimulus programs. ACNB’s overnight interest bearing deposits increased in 2020 on average, as more funds were allocated into liquid assets. On average, investments were increased in 2020 and 2019 to properly collateralize public deposits. Average loans increased 29.7% and 2.4% on average in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Loans were funded by increased deposits, investment cash flow and term FHLB borrowings. Average deposits increased 43.4% in 2020 to $1,984,518,000 from $1,383,987,000 in 2019. Deposit growth was the result of those acquired in the FCBI merger and increased balances due to the lack of economic activity in the COVID-19 environment. Average borrowings decreased in 2020 to $95,683,000 from $117,862,000 in 2019. Term borrowings were in anticipation of loan demand and maturing amounts were paid off from liquidity in 2020.
Investment Securities
ACNB uses investment securities to generate interest and dividend income, manage interest rate risk, provide collateral for certain funding products, and provide liquidity. The changes in the securities portfolio in 2020 were mainly to provide proper collateral for public deposits. Investing into investment security portfolio assets over the past several years was made more challenging due to the Federal Reserve Bank’s program commonly called Quantitative Easing in which, by the Federal Reserve’s open market purchases, the yields were maintained at a lower level than would otherwise be the case. The investment portfolio is comprised of U.S. Government agency, municipal, and corporate securities. These securities provide the appropriate characteristics with respect to credit quality, yield and maturity relative to the management of the overall balance sheet.
At December 31, 2020, the securities balance included a net unrealized gain on available for sale securities of $4,645,000, net of taxes, on amortized cost of $331,745,000 versus a net unrealized gain of $1,261,000, net of taxes, on amortized cost of $189,208,000 at December 31, 2019. The change in fair value of available for sale securities during 2020 was a result of the higher amount of investments in the available for sale portfolio and by an increase in fair value from a decrease in the U.S. Treasury yield curve rates and the spread from this yield curve required by investors on the types of investment securities that ACNB owns. The Federal Reserve reinstituted their rate-decreasing Quantitative Easing program in the COVID-19 crisis; and after increasing the fed funds rate in mid-December 2015 through 2018, the Federal Reserve decreased the target rate to 0% to 0.25% in the ongoing COVID-19 crisis; both actions causing the U.S. Treasury yield curve to decrease in the time relevant to the investment securities in the Corporation’s portfolio. However, fair values were volatile on any given day in 2020 and such volatility will continue. The changes in value are deemed to be related solely to changes in interest rates as the credit quality of the portfolio is high.
At December 31, 2020, the securities balance included held to maturity securities with an amortized cost of $10,294,000 and a fair value of $10,768,000, as compared to an amortized cost of $19,234,000 and a fair value of $19,281,000 at December 31, 2019. The held to maturity securities are U.S. government pass-through mortgage-backed securities in which the full payment of principal and interest is guaranteed; however, they were not classified as available for sale because these securities are generally used as required collateral for certain eligible government accounts or repurchase agreements. They are also held for possible pledging to access additional liquidity for banking subsidiary needs in the form of FHLB borrowings. Due to changes in accounting rules, no held to maturity securities were added in past several years. No held to maturity securities were acquired from FCBI.
The Corporation does not own investments consisting of pools of Alt-A or subprime mortgages, private label mortgage-backed securities, or trust preferred investments.
The fair values of securities available for sale (carried at fair value) are determined by obtaining quoted market prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges (Level 1) or by matrix pricing (Level 2), which is a mathematical technique used widely in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted market prices for the specific security but rather by relying on the security’s relationship to other benchmark quoted prices. The Corporation uses independent service providers to provide matrix pricing. Please refer to Note C - “Securities” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the security portfolio and Note L - “Fair Value Measurements” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about fair value.
The following tables set forth the composition of the securities portfolio and the securities maturity schedule, including weighted average yield, as of the end of the years indicated:

The Corporation adopted ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments-Overall (Topic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities effective January 1, 2018. The required fair value disclosures are as follows:
Loans
Year over year, loans outstanding increased by $365,183,000, or 28.7%, in 2020, as compared to 2019. The increase is primarily attributable the FCBI acquisition and active participation in the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), net of selling most newly originated residential mortgages and early payoffs of other loans (resulting from the COVID-19 caused lowering of interest rates). Both years demonstrated the focused efforts by management to lend to creditworthy borrowers subject to the Corporation’s disciplined underwriting standards, despite generally slower local commercial activity and intense competition. Within the portfolio, growth was centered in increased commercial purpose loans/commercial construction loans, while local market residential mortgages declined. Also growing were loans to Pennsylvania school districts, municipalities (including townships) and essential purpose authorities, as a result the net commercial purpose segments increased $375,904,000, or 50.6%, during 2020, spread among diverse categories that include farmland secured, loans to local government units, and other types of commercial lending. Residential real estate mortgage lending, which includes smaller commercial purpose loans secured by the owner’s home, decreased by $10,434,000, or 2.0%, to local borrowers who preferred loan types that would not be sold into the secondary mortgage market. Included in the mortgages were $134,419,000 in residential mortgage loans secured by junior liens or home equity loans, which are also in many cases junior liens. Junior liens inherently have more credit risk by virtue of the fact that another financial institution may have a senior security position in the case of foreclosure liquidation of collateral to extinguish the debt. Generally, foreclosure actions could become more prevalent if the real estate market weakens, property values deteriorate, or rates increase sharply. Included in commercial purpose were real estate construction loans up $27,486,000, or 104.1% in 2020, as a result of market demand despite continued conservative underwriting on this loan type due to the category’s credit attributes.
Included in the commercial, financial and agricultural category are loans to Pennsylvania school districts, municipalities (including townships) and essential purpose authorities. In most cases, these loans are backed by the general obligation of the local government body. In many cases, these loans are obtained through a bid process with other local and regional banks. The loans are mostly bank qualified for tax-free interest income treatment for federal income taxes. These loans totaled $68,772,000 in 2020, an increase of 7.2% from $64,137,000 held at the end of 2019 due to active bidding on these loans.
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was signed into law on March 27, 2020, and provided over $2.0 trillion in emergency economic relief to individuals and businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act authorized the SBA to temporarily guarantee loans under a new 7(a) loan program called the PPP. As a qualified SBA lender, the Corporation was automatically authorized to originate PPP loans. As of December 31, 2020, the Corporation had originated approximately 1,440 loans in the amount of $160,857,603 under the PPP. Fee income was approximately $6 million, before costs. The Corporation recognized $1,458,000 of PPP income during the fourth quarter of 2020, and $2,875,000 through December 31, 2020. The remaining amount will be recognized in future quarters as an adjustment of interest income yield.

LOANS MATURING
LOANS BY REPRICING OPPORTUNITY
Most of the Corporation’s lending activities are with customers located within southcentral Pennsylvania and in the northern Maryland area. This region currently and historically has lower unemployment rates than the U.S. as a whole. Included in commercial real estate loans are loans made to lessors of non-residential properties that total $358,663,000, or 21.9% of total loans, at December 31, 2020. These borrowers are geographically dispersed throughout ACNB’s marketplace and are leasing commercial properties to a varied group of tenants including medical offices, retail space, and other commercial purpose facilities. Because of the varied nature of the tenants, in aggregate, management believes that these loans present an acceptable risk when compared to commercial loans in general. ACNB does not originate or hold Alt-A or subprime mortgages in its loan portfolio.
Asset Quality
The ACNB loan portfolio is subject to varying degrees of credit risk. Credit risk is mitigated through prudent underwriting standards, ongoing credit review, and monitoring and reporting asset quality measures. Additionally, loan portfolio diversification, limiting exposure to a single industry or borrower, and requiring collateral also reduces ACNB’s credit risk.
ACNB’s commercial, consumer and residential mortgage loans are principally to borrowers in southcentral Pennsylvania and northern Maryland. As the majority of ACNB’s loans are located in this area, a substantial portion of the debtor’s ability to honor the obligation may be affected by the level of economic activity in the market area.
The unemployment rate in ACNB’s market area remained below the state and national average during 2020. Additionally, competitive lending rates, a less volatile local economy, and minimal inflation continued to provide some support to the economic conditions in the area. During 2020, continued low activity in new residential real estate development/construction and muted economic activity was a result of COVID-19 , challenging the Corporation’s marketplace commercial activity. Slower growth areas such as ACNB’s marketplace generally do not retract in economic recessions as quickly and as low as other areas of the country, however the recovery from low economic cycles are also generally slower.
Non-performing assets include nonaccrual loans and restructured loans (troubled debt restructures or TDRs), accruing loans past due 90 days or more, and other foreclosed assets. The accrual of interest on residential mortgage and commercial loans (consisting of commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, and commercial real estate construction loan categories) is discontinued at the time the loan is 90 days past due unless the credit is well secured and in the process of collection. Consumer loans (consisting of home equity lines of credit and consumer loan categories) are typically charged off no later than 120 days past due. Past due status is based on contractual terms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. ACNB occasionally returns nonaccrual loans to performing status when the borrower brings the loan current and performs in accordance with contractual terms for a reasonable period of time. ACNB categorizes a loan as a TDR if it changes the terms of the loan, such as interest rate, repayment schedule or both, to terms that it otherwise would not have granted to a borrower, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower’s financial difficulties.
The following table sets forth the Corporation’s non-performing assets as of the end of the years indicated:
Table 7 - Non-Performing Assets
If interest due on all nonaccrual loans had been accrued at original contract rates, it is estimated that income before income taxes would have been greater by $379,000 in 2020 and $249,000 in 2019. The increase in nonaccrual loans from 2019 to 2020 is discussed further below.
Impaired loans at December 31, 2020 and 2019, totaled $10,721,000 and $7,702,000, respectively. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Corporation had nonaccruing and accruing troubled debt restructurings of $3,807,000 and $3,974,000, respectively. $127,000 and $191,000, respectively, of the impaired loans were troubled debt restructured loans, which were also classified as nonaccrual. $3,680,000 and $3,783,000 of the impaired loans were accruing troubled debt restructured loans at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Loans whose terms are modified are classified as troubled debt restructurings if the borrowers have been granted concessions and it is deemed that those borrowers are experiencing financial difficulty. Concessions granted under a troubled debt restructuring generally involve interest rates being granted below current market rates for the credit risk of the loan or an extension of a loan’s stated maturity date. Nonaccrual troubled debt restructurings are restored to accrual status if principal and interest payments, under the modified terms, are current for six consecutive months
after modification. Loans classified as troubled debt restructurings are designated as impaired. The related allowance for loan losses on impaired loans totaled $1,382,000 and $42,000 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in accruing troubled debt restructurings was a result of payment made in accordance with loan terms. The increase in nonaccrual loans was a result of additional loans added to this category net of paydowns and payoffs made by the customers on these loans. Potential problem loans are defined as performing loans that have characteristics that cause management to have doubts as to the ability of the borrower to perform under present loan repayment terms and which may result in the reporting of these loans as non-performing loans in the future. Total additional potential problem loans approximated $2,607,000 at December 31, 2020, compared to $2,943,000 at December 31, 2019.
Foreclosed assets held for resale consist of the fair value of real estate acquired through foreclosure on real estate loan collateral or the acceptance of ownership of real estate in lieu of the foreclosure process. Fair values are based on appraisals that consider the sales prices of similar properties in the proximate vicinity less estimated selling costs. Foreclosed assets held for resale totaled $0 at December 31, 2020. In addition to three properties acquired in 2019, one rental real estate property was brought into foreclosed real estate in 2020 with an aggregate fair value of $118,000. Two residential properties were brought into foreclosed real estate in 2020 (including one acquired from FCBI) with an aggregate fair value of $481,000. At December 31, 2020, all properties had been settled. The total of $364,000 in foreclosed real estate at December 31, 2019, represented two commercial purpose real estate properties and one residential real estate single family home.
Allowance for Loan Losses
ACNB maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level believed to be adequate by management to absorb probable losses in the loan portfolio, and it is funded through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings. On a quarterly basis, ACNB utilizes a defined methodology in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, which considers specific credit reviews, past loan losses, historical experience, and qualitative factors. This methodology results in an allowance that is considered appropriate in light of the high degree of judgment required and that is prudent and conservative, but not excessive.
Management assigns internal risk ratings for each commercial lending relationship. Utilizing historical loss experience, adjusted for changes in trends, conditions and other relevant factors, management derives estimated losses for non-rated and non-classified loans. When management identifies impaired loans with uncertain collectibility of principal and interest, it evaluates a specific reserve on a quarterly basis in order to estimate potential losses. Management’s analysis considers:
•adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay;
•the current estimated fair value of underlying collateral; and,
•prevailing market conditions.
If management determines a loan is not impaired, a specific reserve allocation is not required. Management then places the loan in a pool of loans with similar risk factors and assigns the general loss factor to determine the reserve. For homogeneous loan types, such as consumer and residential mortgage loans, management bases specific allocations on the average loss ratio for the previous three years for each specific loan pool. Additionally, management adjusts projected loss ratios for other factors, including the following:
•lending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards and collection, charge-off, and recovery practices;
•national, regional, and local economic and business conditions, as well as the condition of various market segments, including the impact on the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans;
•nature and volume of the portfolio and terms of loans;
•experience, ability and depth of lending management and staff;
•volume and severity of past due, classified and nonaccrual loans, as well as other loan modifications; and,
•existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations.
•For 2020, a special allowance was developed to quantify a current expected incurred loss as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. The factor considered the loan mix effects of businesses likely to be harder hit by quarantine closure orders, the relative amount of COVID-19 related modifications requested to date, the estimated regional
infection stage and geopolitical factors. A large unknown in this factor is the expected duration of the quarantine period.
Management determines the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses, which represents the difference between the reported allowance for loan losses and the calculated allowance for loan losses, based on the following criteria:
•risk of imprecision in the specific and general reserve allocations;
•the perceived level of consumer and small business loans with demonstrated weaknesses for which it is not practicable to develop specific allocations;
•other potential exposure in the loan portfolio;
•variances in management’s assessment of national, regional, and local economic conditions; and,
•other internal or external factors that management believes appropriate at that time, such as COVID-19.
The unallocated portion of the allowance is deemed to be appropriate as it reflects an uncertainty that remains in the loan portfolio; specifically reserves where the Corporation believes that tertiary losses are probable above the loss amount derived using appraisal-based loss estimation, where such additional loss estimates are in accordance with regulatory and GAAP guidance. Appraisal-based loss derivation does not fully develop the loss present in certain unique, ultimately bank-owned collateral. The Corporation has determined that the amount of provision in 2020 and the resulting allowance at December 31, 2020, are appropriate given the continuing level of risk in the loan portfolio. Further, management believes the unallocated allowance is appropriate, because even though the impaired loans added since 2019 demonstrate generally low risk due to adequate real estate collateral, the value of such collateral can decrease; plus, the growth in the loan portfolio is centered around commercial real estate which continues to have little increase in value and low liquidity. In addition, there are certain loans that, although they did not meet the criteria for impairment, management believes there was a strong possibility that these loans represented potential losses at December 31, 2020. The amount of unallocated portion of the allowance increased at December 31, 2020, as management concluded that the loan portfolio would probably be impacted by a late 2020 resurgence of the COVID-19 virus that was not reflected in metrics used in the evaluation. Otherwise the assessment concluded that credit quality was stable, COVID-19 related charge offs were relatively low and past due loans manageable.
Management believes the above methodology accurately reflects losses inherent in the portfolio. Management charges actual loan losses to the allowance for loan losses. Management periodically updates the methodology and the assumptions discussed above.
Management bases the provision for loan losses, or lack of provision, on the overall analysis taking into account the methodology discussed above, which is consistent with recent years’ improvement in the credit quality in the loan portfolio, but the large unanticipated charge-offs ($2,665,000) with increased risk form the impact of the COVID-19 crisis (an additional $4,100,000). The acquisition of FCBI and New Windsor loans at fair value did not require a provision expense. The provision for 2020 was $9,140,000, compared to $600,000 for 2019. The increase in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans of 1.09% at December 31, 2019 to 1.23% at December 31, 2020 was primarily related to the increased risk from the impact of the COVID-19 crisis and even with the decrease in non-acquired loans; such reduction did not necessarily reduce the risk in the portfolio in direct proportion. More specifically, as total loans increased from year-end 2019 and the provision expense increased year over year, the allowance for loan losses was derived with data that most existing impaired credits were, in the opinion of management, adequately collateralized.
Federal and state regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Corporation’s allowance for loan losses and may require the Corporation to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination, which may not be currently available to management. Based on management’s comprehensive analysis of the loan portfolio and economic conditions, management believes the current level of the allowance for loan losses is adequate.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” ASU 2016-13 requires credit losses on most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments to be measured using an expected credit loss model (referred to as the current expected credit loss (CECL) model). Under this model, entities will estimate credit losses over the entire contractual term of the instrument (considering estimated prepayments, but not expected extensions or modifications unless reasonable expectation of a troubled debt restructuring exists) from the date of initial recognition of that instrument. Upon adoption, the change in this accounting guidance could result in an increase in the Corporation’s allowance for loan losses and require the Corporation to record loan losses more rapidly. In October 2019, FASB voted to delay implementation of the CECL standard for certain companies,
including those companies that qualify as a smaller reporting company under SEC rules until January 1, 2023. As a result ACNB will likely be able to defer implementation of the CECL standard for a period of time
The following tables set forth information on the analysis of the allowance for loan losses and the allocation of the allowance for loan losses as of the dates indicated:
Table 8 - Analysis of Allowance for Loan Losses
Table 9 - Allocation of the Allowance for Loan Losses
The allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2020, was $20,226,000, or 1.23% of loans, as compared to $13,835,000, or 1.09% of loans, at December 31, 2019. The ratio of non-performing loans plus foreclosed assets to total assets was 0.31% at December 31, 2020, as compared to 0.32% at December 31, 2019.
Loans past due 90 days and still accruing were $855,000 and nonaccrual loans were $7,041,000 as of December 31, 2020. Loans past due 90 days and still accruing were $1,219,000 at December 31, 2019, while nonaccruals were $3,919,000.
The Corporation has received significant numbers of requests to modify loan terms and/or defer principal and/or interest payments, and has agreed to appropriate deferrals or are in the process of doing so. Under Section 4013 of the CARES Act, loans less than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019, will be considered current for COVID-19 related modifications. A financial institution can then use FASB agreed upon temporary changes to GAAP for loan modifications related to COVID-19 that would otherwise be categorized as a troubled debt restructuring (TDR), and suspend any determination of a loan modified as a result of COVID-19 being a TDR, including the requirement to determine impairment for accounting purposes. Similarly, FASB has confirmed that short-term modifications made on a good-faith basis in response to COVID-19 to loan customers who were current prior to any relief are not TDRs.
Beginning the week of March 16, 2020, the Corporation began receiving requests for temporary modifications to the repayment structure for borrower loans. The modifications are grouped into deferred payments of no more than six months, interest only, lines of credit only and other. As of December 31, 2020, the Corporation had 48 temporary modifications with principal balances totaling $36,123,155.
Details with respect to actual loan modifications are as follows:
As to nonaccrual and substandard loans, management believes that adequate collateralization generally exists for these loans in accordance with GAAP. Each quarter, the Corporation assesses risk in the loan portfolio compared with the balance in the allowance for loan losses and the current evaluation factors.
Additional information on nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2020 and 2019, is as follows:
Management deemed it appropriate to provide this type of more detailed information by collateral type in order to provide additional detail on the loans.
All nonaccrual impaired loans are to borrowers located within the market area served by the Corporation in southcentral Pennsylvania and nearby areas of Maryland. All nonaccrual impaired loans were originated by ACNB’s banking subsidiary, except for three acquired loans and two participation loans discussed below, for purposes listed in the classifications in the table above.
The Corporation had no impaired and nonaccrual loans included in commercial real estate construction at December 31, 2020.
Owner occupied commercial real estate includes nine unrelated loan relationships. A $1,025,000 relationship in food service that was performing when acquired in 2017 was added in the first quarter of 2020 after becoming 90 days past due early
in the year. Collateral valuation resulted in a $6,000 specific allocation. An unrelated $2,199,000 relationship in the recreational industry effect by COVID-19 was added in the third quarter of 2020 after the Bank negotiated a settlement which subsequently paid off the loan after forgiving and charging off $675,000. An $802,000 merger-acquired loan relationship for a light manufacturing enterprise which was performing when acquired is making payments post-bankruptcy filing. An unrelated $392,000 credit was added to this category in the second quarter of 2020 when ACNB was notified that property was scheduled for tax sale which has been suspended. The other loans in this category have balances of less than $249,000 each, for which the real estate is collateral and is used in connection with a business enterprise that is suffering economic stress or is out of business. The loans in this category were originated between 2008 and 2014 and are business loans impacted by specific borrower credit situations. Most loans in this category are making principal payments, one loan paid off in the fourth quarter. Collection efforts will continue unless it is deemed in the best interest of the Corporation to initiate foreclosure procedures.
A $1,311,000 2017-acquired commercial real estate participation loan (after partial payoff in the third quarter 2020) was added in the fourth quarter of 2019 and has been assigned a $118,000 specific allocation.
Investment/rental residential real estate includes three loan relationships totaling $410,000 for which the real estate is collateral and the purpose of which is for speculation, rental, or other non-owner occupied uses. One loan in this category at April 2015, was stayed from further foreclosure action by a bankruptcy filing. A second loan added in the third quarter 2019 involves settling an estate, there appears to be adequate collateral. An unrelated loan relationship in this category was a business affected by COVID-19, but continues to make payments.
A $1,990,000 commercial and industrial loan was added in the fourth quarter of 2020 after ceasing operations. Liquidation plans are underway with a specific allocation of $1,207,000. A related $441,000 owner occupied real estate loan is also in nonaccrual. An unrelated commercial and industrial loan at December 31, 2020 with a balance of $40,000 and a specific allocation of $17,000; this loan is currently making payments.
The Corporation utilizes a systematic review of its loan portfolio on a quarterly basis in order to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. In addition, ACNB engages the services of an outside independent loan review function and sets the timing and coverage of loan reviews during the year. The results of this independent loan review are included in the systematic review of the loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses consists of a component for individual loan impairment, primarily based on the loan’s collateral fair value and expected cash flow. A watch list of loans is identified for evaluation based on internal and external loan grading and reviews. Loans other than those determined to be impaired are grouped into pools of loans with similar credit risk characteristics. These loans are evaluated as groups with allocations made to the allowance based on historical loss experience adjusted for current trends in delinquencies, trends in underwriting and oversight, concentrations of credit, and general economic conditions within the Corporation’s trading area. The provision expense was based on the loans discussed above, as well as current trends in the watch list and the local economy as a whole. The charge-offs discussed elsewhere in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis create the recent loss history experience and result in the qualitative adjustment which, in turn, affects the calculation of losses inherent in the portfolio. The provision for loan losses of $9,140,000 for 2020 and the provision for loan losses of $600,000 for 2019, was a result of the measurement of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at each period. More specifically, with the manageable level of nonaccrual loans and substandard loans in 2020, the $9,140,000 provision addition to the allowance was necessary in proportion to loan portfolio growth, net charge-offs and estimated loss from nonaccrual and substandard loans in accordance with management’s belief that adequate collateralization generally exists for these loans in accordance with GAAP. Each quarter, the Corporation assesses risk in the loan portfolio compared with the balance in the allowance for loan losses and the current evaluation factors.
Premises and Equipment
During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, a building was sold and the Corporation is leasing back a portion of that building. In connection with these transactions, a gain of $1,147,000 was realized, of which $447,000 was recognized in the quarter ended June 30, 2016 and the remaining $700,000 deferred for future recognition over the lease back term. A reduction of lease expense of $70,000 was recognized in 2020. A reduction of lease expense of $70,000 was recognized in 2019. ACNB valued six buildings acquired from New Windsor at $8,624,000 at July 1, 2017 and five properties acquired from FCBI at $7,514,000 at January 11, 2020.
Foreclosed Assets Held for Resale
The carrying value of real estate acquired through foreclosure was $0 on no properties at December 31, 2020, compared to $364,000 on three properties at December 31, 2019, which were sold in 2020. The decrease was due to all three properties added in 2020 being sold before year-end. All properties are actively marketed. The Corporation expects to obtain and market additional foreclosed assets in 2021; however, the total amount and timing is currently not certain.
Other Assets
Other assets increased $844,000, or 3.6%, in 2020 compared to 2019, in part due to the FCBI acquisition and normal variations in a number of non earning asset accounts.
Deposits
ACNB relies on deposits as the primary source of funds for lending activities. Average deposits increased 43.4%, or $600,531,000, during 2020, as compared to a 4.0% increase during 2019 which was organic growth totaling $293,333,000. Deposits acquired from FCBI totaled $374,058,000 on January 11, 2020. Deposits increased after the first quarter of 2020 from PPP proceeds deposited to customer’s accounts and from increased balances in a broad base of accounts from lack of economic activity due to the COVID-19 event. Otherwise, deposits vary between quarters mostly reflecting different levels held by local government and school districts during different times of the year. ACNB’s deposit pricing function employs a disciplined pricing approach based upon alternative funding rates, but also strives to price deposits to be competitive with relevant local competition, including a local government investment trust, credit unions and larger regional banks. The 2020 average deposit increase mainly due to FCBI acquisition and the COVID-19 event, but also local individual and business depositors continued to be attracted to strategically designed stable community bank time and non-interest bearing products. During 2020 deposit growth mix experienced a shift to transaction accounts as customers put more value in liquidity and FDIC insurance. Previously products, such as money market accounts and interest-bearing transaction accounts were subject to heightened competition from larger banks. Year-end 2019 to year-end 2020 recorded an increase in deposits of $773,265,000, or 54.8%, which was an indicator of organic growth. With heightened competition, ACNB’s ability to maintain and add to its deposit base may be impacted by the reluctance of consumers to accept community banks’ lower rates (as compared to Internet-based competition) and by larger competition willing to pay above market rates to attract market share. If rates rise rapidly, or when the equity markets are high, funds could leave the Corporation or be priced higher to maintain deposits.
Table 10 - Time Deposits
Maturities of time deposits of $100,000 or more outstanding at December 31, 2020, are summarized as follows:
Borrowings
Short-term borrowings are comprised primarily of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and short-term borrowings from the FHLB. As of December 31, 2020, short-term borrowings were $38,464,000, an increase of $5,029,000, or 15.0%, from the December 31, 2019, balance of $33,435,000. Agreements to repurchase accounts are within the commercial and local government customer base and have attributes similar to core deposits. Investment securities are pledged in sufficient amounts to collateralize these agreements. Compared to year-end 2019, repurchase agreement balances were up due to fluctuations in the liquid assets of ACNB’s commercial and local government customer base. At December 31, 2020, there were $0 in short-term FHLB borrowings, as compared to $0 at December 31, 2019, this account is used or not used due to daily fluctuation in deposits and loans. Short-term FHLB borrowings are used to even out funding from seasonal and daily fluctuations in the deposit base. Long-term borrowings consist of longer-term advances from the FHLB that provides term funding of loan assets, and Corporate borrowings that were acquired or originated in regards to the acquisitions. Long-term borrowings totaled $53,745,000 at December 31, 2020, versus $66,296,000 at December 31, 2019. The Corporation decreased long-term borrowings 18.9% from December 31, 2019. A $4.6 million loan was paid down to $1.3 million outstanding balance on a borrowing from a local bank that had been made to fund the cash payment to shareholders of the New Windsor acquisition. RIG borrowed $1.0 million from a local bank at the end of the third quarter of 2018 to fund a book of business purchase. The balance of this loan was paid down to $0 at December 31, 2020. $16.5 million FHLB borrowings matured and were not renewed to balance earning assets and deposit changes. Laddered FHLB fixed-rate term advances were taken in prior years to mature from 2021 to 2023 to balance liability sensitivity. In addition, $5 million and $8.7 million was Corporation debt acquired from New Windsor and FCBI, respectively. Further borrowings will be used when necessary for a variety of risk management and funding purposes. Please refer to the Liquidity discussion below for more information on the Corporation’s ability to borrow.
The following tables set forth information about the Corporation’s short-term borrowings as of the dates indicated:
Capital
ACNB’s capital management strategies have been developed to provide an appropriate rate of return, in the opinion of management, to shareholders, while maintaining its “well capitalized” regulatory position in relationship to its risk exposure. Total shareholders’ equity was $257,972,000 at December 31, 2020, compared to $189,516,000 at December 31, 2019. Shareholders’ equity increased during 2020, primarily due to the equity consideration and issuance of the FCBI acquisition.
The acquisition of New Windsor resulted in 938,360 new ACNB shares of common stock issued to the New Windsor shareholders valued at $28,620,000 in 2017. The acquisition of FCBI resulted in 1,590,547 new ACNB shares of common stock issued to the FCBI shareholders valued at $57,721,000.
A $215,000 decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss was a result of a net increase in the fair value of the investment portfolio and changes in the net funded position of the defined benefit pension plan. Other comprehensive income or loss is mainly caused by fixed-rate investment securities gaining or losing value in different interest rate environments and changes in the net funded position of the defined benefit pension plan.
The primary source of additional capital to ACNB is earnings retention, which represents net income less dividends declared. During 2020, ACNB retained $9,709,000, or 52.8%, of its net income, as compared to $16,801,000, or 70.8%, in 2019.
ACNB Corporation has a Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan that provides registered holders of ACNB Corporation common stock with a convenient way to purchase additional shares of common stock by permitting participants in the plan to automatically reinvest cash dividends on all or a portion of the shares owned and to make quarterly voluntary cash payments under the terms of the plan. Participation in the plan is voluntary, and there are eligibility requirements to participate in the plan. Cumulative to December 31, 2020, 190,611 shares were issued under this plan. Proceeds are used for general corporate purposes.
ACNB Corporation has a Restricted Stock plan available to selected officers and employees of the Bank, to advance the best interest of ACNB Corporation and its shareholders. The plan provides those persons who have responsibility for its growth with additional incentive by allowing them to acquire an ownership in ACNB Corporation and thereby encouraging them to contribute to the success of the Corporation. As of December 31, 2020, there were 25,945 shares of common stock granted as restricted stock awards to employees of the subsidiary bank. The restricted stock plan expired by its own terms after 10 years on February 24, 2019, and no further shares may be issued under the plan. Proceeds are used for general corporate purposes.
On May 1, 2018, shareholders approved and ratified the ACNB Corporation 2018 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan, effective as of March 20, 2018, in which awards shall not exceed, in the aggregate, 400,000 shares of common stock, plus any shares that are authorized, but not issued, under the 2009 Restricted Stock Plan. As of December 31, 2020, 35,587 shares were issued under this plan and 538,468 shares were available for grant. Proceeds are used for general corporate purposes.
ACNB is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on ACNB. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, ACNB must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of its assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and
reclassifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors.
Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require ACNB to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and Tier 1 capital to average assets. Management believes, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, that ACNB’s banking subsidiary met all minimum capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject and is categorized as “well capitalized” for regulatory purposes. There are no subsequent conditions or events that management believes have changed the banking subsidiary’s category.
Regulatory Capital Changes
In July 2013, the federal banking agencies issued final rules to implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The phase-in period for community banking organizations began January 1, 2015, while larger institutions (generally those with assets of $250 billion or more) began compliance effective January 1, 2014. The final rules call for the following capital requirements:
•a minimum ratio of common Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5%;
•a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6.0%;
•a minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0%; and,
•a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%.
In addition, the final rules establish a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets applicable to all banking organizations. If a banking organization fails to hold capital above the minimum capital ratios and the capital conservation buffer, it will be subject to certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. The phase-in period for the capital conservation and countercyclical capital buffers for all banking organizations began on January 1, 2016.
Under the initially proposed rules, accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) would have been included in a banking organization’s common equity Tier 1 capital. The final rules allow community banks to make a one-time election not to include these additional components of AOCI in regulatory capital and instead use the existing treatment under the general risk-based capital rules that excludes most AOCI components from regulatory capital. The opt-out election must be made in the first call report or FR Y-9 series report that is filed after the financial institution becomes subject to the final rule. The Corporation elected to opt-out.
The rules permanently grandfather non-qualifying capital instruments (such as trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock) issued before May 19, 2010, for inclusion in the Tier 1 capital of banking organizations with total consolidated assets of less than $15 billion as of December 31, 2009, and banking organizations that were mutual holding companies as of May 19, 2010.
The proposed rules would have modified the risk-weight framework applicable to residential mortgage exposures to require banking organizations to divide residential mortgage exposures into two categories in order to determine the applicable risk weight. In response to commenter concerns about the burden of calculating the risk weights and the potential negative effect on credit availability, the final rules do not adopt the proposed risk weights, but retain the current risk weights for mortgage exposures under the general risk-based capital rules.
Consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act, the new rules replace the ratings-based approach to securitization exposures, which is based on external credit ratings, with the simplified supervisory formula approach in order to determine the appropriate risk weights for these exposures. Alternatively, banking organizations may use the existing gross-up approach to assign securitization exposures to a risk weight category or choose to assign such exposures a 1,250 percent risk weight.
Under the new rules, mortgage servicing assets and certain deferred tax assets are subject to stricter limitations than those applicable under the current general risk-based capital rule. The new rules also increase the risk weights for past due loans, certain commercial real estate loans, and some equity exposures, and makes selected other changes in risk weights and credit conversion factors.
The Corporation calculated regulatory capital ratios as of December 31, 2020, and confirmed no material impact on the capital, operations, liquidity and earnings of the Corporation and the banking subsidiary from the changes in the regulations.
Table 11 - Risk-Based Capital
ACNB Corporation considers the capital ratios of the banking subsidiary to be the relevant measurement of capital adequacy.
In 2019, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule to provide an optional simplified measure of capital adequacy for qualifying community banking organizations, including the community bank leverage ratio (CBLR) framework. Generally, under the CBLR framework, qualifying community banking organizations with total assets of less than $10 billion, and limited amounts of off-balance sheet exposures and trading assets and liabilities, may elect whether to be subject to the CBLR framework if they have a CBLR of greater than 9% (subsequently reduced to 8% as a COVID-19 relief measure). Qualifying community banking organizations that elect to be subject to the CBLR framework and continue to meet all requirements under the framework would not be subject to risk-based or other leverage capital requirements and, in the case of an insured depository institution, would be considered to have met the well capitalized ratio requirements for purposes of the FDIC’s Prompt Corrective Action framework. The CBLR framework was available for banks to use in their March 31, 2020 Call Report. The Corporation has performed changes to capital adequacy and reporting requirements within the quarterly Call Report, and it opted out of the CBLR framework on December 31, 2020.
The banking subsidiary’s capital ratios are as follows:
For further information on the actual and required capital amounts and ratios, please refer to Note N - “Stockholders’ Equity and Regulatory Matters” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Liquidity
Effective liquidity management ensures the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, as well as the operating cash needs of ACNB, are met.
ACNB’s funds are available from a variety of sources, including assets that are readily convertible such as interest bearing deposits with banks, maturities and repayments from the securities portfolio, scheduled repayments of loans receivable, the core deposit base, and the ability to borrow from the FHLB. At December 31, 2020, ACNB’s banking subsidiary could borrow approximately $847,881,000 from the FHLB of which $791,915,000 was available. Because of various restrictions and requirements on utilizing the available balance, ACNB considers $580,000,000 to be the practicable additional borrowing capacity, which is considered to be sufficient for operational needs. The FHLB system is self-capitalizing, member-owned, and its member banks’ stock is not publicly traded. ACNB creates its borrowing capacity with the FHLB by granting a security interest in certain loan assets with requisite credit quality. ACNB has reviewed information on the FHLB system and the FHLB of Pittsburgh, and has concluded that they have the capacity and intent to continue to provide both operational and contingency liquidity. The FHLB of Pittsburgh instituted a requirement that a member’s investment securities must be moved into a safekeeping account under FHLB control to be considered in the calculation of maximum borrowing capacity. The Corporation currently has securities in safekeeping at the FHLB of Pittsburgh; however, the safekeeping account is under the Corporation’s control. As better contingent liquidity is maintained by keeping the securities under the Corporation’s control, the Corporation has not moved the securities which, in effect, lowered the Corporation’s maximum borrowing capacity. However, there is no practical reduction in borrowing capacity as the securities can be moved into the FHLB-controlled account promptly if they are needed for borrowing purposes.
Another source of liquidity is securities sold under repurchase agreements to customers of ACNB’s banking subsidiary totaling $38,464,000 and $33,435,000 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These agreements vary in balance according to the cash flow needs of customers and competing accounts at other financial organizations.
The liquidity of the parent company also represents an important aspect of liquidity management. The parent company’s cash outflows consist principally of dividends to shareholders and corporate expenses. The main source of funding for the parent company is the dividends it receives from its subsidiaries. Federal and state banking regulations place certain legal restrictions and other practicable safety and soundness restrictions on dividends paid to the parent company from the subsidiary
bank. For a discussion of ACNB’s dividend restrictions, please refer to Item 1 - “Business” and Note J - “Regulatory Restrictions on Dividends” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
In 2019, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule to provide an optional simplified measure of capital adequacy for qualifying community banking organizations, including the community bank leverage ratio (CBLR) framework. Generally, under the CBLR framework, qualifying community banking organizations with total assets of less than $10 billion, and limited amounts of off-balance sheet exposures and trading assets and liabilities, may elect whether to be subject to the CBLR framework if they have a CBLR of greater than 9%. Qualifying community banking organizations that elect to be subject to the CBLR framework and continue to meet all requirements under the framework would not be subject to risk-based or other leverage capital requirements and, in the case of an insured depository institution, would be considered to have met the well capitalized ratio requirements for purposes of the FDIC’s Prompt Corrective Action framework. The CBLR framework will be available for banks to use in their March 31, 2020 Call Report. The Corporation has performed a preliminary analysis of the changes to capital adequacy and reporting requirements within the quarterly Call Report, and expects that it will opt into the CBLR framework if qualified on March 31, 2020.
ACNB manages liquidity by monitoring projected cash inflows and outflows on a daily basis, and believes it has sufficient funding sources to maintain sufficient liquidity under varying degrees of business conditions.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Corporation is party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and, to a lesser extent, standby letters of credit. At December 31, 2020, the Corporation had unfunded outstanding commitments to extend credit of $367,561,000 and outstanding standby letters of credit of $8,105,000. Because these commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and many will expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment level does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Please refer to Note O - “Financial Instruments with Off-balance Sheet Risk” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the nature, business purpose, and importance of the Corporation’s off-balance sheet arrangements.
New Accounting Pronouncements
See Note A - “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of these new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted.
Acquisition of Frederick County Bancorp, Inc.
ACNB Corporation, the parent financial holding company of ACNB Bank, a Pennsylvania state-chartered, FDIC-insured community bank, headquartered in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, completed the acquisition of Frederick County Bancorp, Inc. (FCBI) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Frederick County Bank, headquartered in Frederick, Maryland, effective January 11, 2020. FCBI was merged with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of ACNB Corporation immediately followed by the merger of Frederick County Bank with and into ACNB Bank. ACNB Bank will operate in the Frederick County, Maryland, market as “FCB Bank, A Division of ACNB Bank”.
Under the terms of the Reorganization Agreement, FCBI stockholders received 0.9900 share of ACNB Corporation common stock for each share of FCBI common stock that they owned as of the closing date. As a result, ACNB Corporation issued 1,590,547 shares of its common stock and cash in exchange for fractional shares based upon $36.43, the determined market share price of ACNB Corporation common stock in accordance with the Reorganization Agreement.
With the combination of the two organizations, ACNB Corporation, on a consolidated basis, has approximately $2.6 billion in assets, $2.2 billion in deposits, and $1.6 billion in loans with 34 community banking offices and three loan offices located in the counties of Adams, Cumberland, Franklin, Lancaster and York in Pennsylvania and the counties of Baltimore, Carroll and Frederick in Maryland.
