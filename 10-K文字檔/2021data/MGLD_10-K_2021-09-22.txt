ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto and is qualified in its entirety by the foregoing and by more detailed financial information appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. See "Consolidated Financial Statements."
Our audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
Introduction
Concierge Technologies, Inc. (“Concierge” or the “Company”) conducts business through its wholly-owned operating subsidiaries operating in the U.S., New Zealand and Canada. The operations of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries are more particularly described herein but are summarized as follows:
●
Wainwright Holdings, Inc. (“Wainwright”), a U.S. based company, is the sole member of two investment services limited liability company subsidiaries that manages, operates or is an investment advisor to exchange traded funds organized as limited partnerships or investment trusts that issue shares that trade on the NYSE Arca stock exchange.
●
Gourmet Foods, Ltd., a New Zealand based company, manufactures and distributes New Zealand meat pies on a commercial scale and its wholly-owned New Zealand subsidiary company, Printstock Products Limited, prints specialty wrappers for the food industry in New Zealand and Australia. (collectively "Gourmet Foods")
●
Brigadier Security Systems (2000) Ltd. (“Brigadier”), a Canadian based company, sells and installs commercial and residential alarm monitoring systems.
●
Kahnalytics, Inc. dba/Original Sprout (“Original Sprout”), a U.S. based company, is engaged in the wholesale distribution of hair and skin care products under the brand name Original Sprout on a global scale.
●
Marygold & Co., a newly formed U.S. based company, together with its wholly-owned limited liability company, Marygold & Co. Advisory Services, LLC, ( collectively "Marygold") was established by Concierge to explore opportunities in the financial technology ("Fintech") space, still in the development stage as of June 30, 2021, and estimated to launch commercial services in the coming fiscal year. Through June 30, 2021, expenditures have been limited to developing the business model and the associated application development.
Because the Company conducts its businesses through its wholly-owned operating subsidiaries, the risks related to our wholly-owned subsidiaries are also risks that impact the Company's financial condition and results of operations. See, "Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies / Major Customers and Suppliers - Concentration of Credit Risk" in the consolidated financial statements for more information. The emergence of a novel coronavirus on a global scale, known as COVID-19, and related geopolitical events could lead to increased market volatility, disruption to U.S. and world economies and markets and may have significant adverse effects on the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The financial risk to future operations is largely unknown, (refer to Part I, Item 1A, for further details.)
Critical Accounting Policies
We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position, and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner. Our significant policies are summarized in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may vary from those estimates.
We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
Business Combinations - Purchase Price Allocation
We are a diversified holding company whose activities involve the acquisition of operating companies through stock purchase or asset purchase transactions. We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. All the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and amounts attributable to intangible assets, including goodwill, are recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities involves estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available. We use various techniques to determine fair value in such instances, including the income approach and use of independent valuation firms. Significant estimates used in determining fair value include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates and useful lives. The excess of the purchase consideration over fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. See Note 8 for further detail on goodwill. Management’s estimate of fair value is based on assumptions believed to be reasonable, and are supported by independent valuations where possible, but nevertheless remain subjective and subject to future adjustment if actual results differ from the estimates.
Foreign Subsidiaries
We currently have two wholly-owned subsidiaries that are domiciled in foreign countries. In the future we may acquire additional foreign subsidiaries. The financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries are kept in accordance with their respective local jurisdictions and require adjustment in order to conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, local currencies of these subsidiaries require conversion to our US dollar in accordance with ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters. Due to changing currency translation rates, the value of our assets and liabilities held in foreign jurisdictions are inherently volatile in nature and may vary significantly despite our use of averages and estimates.
Revenue Recognition
Our operating subsidiaries derive revenues from a number of sources including sales of hardware, services, food items, printing, financial services, and consumer products. The company recognizes the revenue when the product or service is delivered, or the ownership of the product is deemed to have been transferred to the buyer. We carefully monitor the outgoings of product shipments and service completions to ensure revenues are properly recorded. In the case of continued support services, such as warranty or extended contracts, the company makes an assessment at each reporting period as to the significance of the cost of such support or warranty. This estimate is based on historical experience and careful monitoring of costs throughout the reporting period to determine if any reserve should be recorded for estimated expenses. We believe we have made careful and reasonable estimates, however adjustments may be required in the future if actual results vary from our estimates.
Plan of Operation for the Next Twelve Months
Our plan of operation for the next twelve months is to apply necessary resources, which may include experienced personnel, cash, or synergistic acquisitions made with cash, equity or debt, into growing each of our business units to their potential. Original Sprout is in the initial stages of transitioning from a largely boutique offering distributed through specialty wholesalers to a more mainstream product available at traditional outlets and online and as such we anticipate measurable growth in revenues for the coming years, though there may be one-time initial expenses associated with the launch of new sales channels. Additionally, we are expecting moderate growth in Brigadier through focused management initiatives and consolidation within the security industry coupled with expanded product offerings. Similarly, we expect Gourmet Foods to be operating more efficiently under current management and continue to increase market share through additional product offerings and channels to market, including the printing and sale of food wrappers by their newly acquired subsidiary, Printstock. Wainwright will continue to develop innovative and new fund products to grow its portfolio. In addition to our long-term mission that is an acquisition strategy based upon identifying and acquiring profitable, mature, companies of a diverse nature and with in-place management that produces increased revenue streams, the Company is also focused upon building expertise and developing Fintech opportunities in the financial services sector through its development stage subsidiary Marygold and Co. In a more general sense, the Company is characterizing its business in two categories: 1) financial services and 2) other consumer-based operating units. The purpose is to isolate the cyclical, and sometimes volatile, nature of the financial services business from our other industry segments. As revenues from financial services fluctuate over time due to varying performance of the commodities markets, our other operations are expected to be stable and sustainable by comparison. By these initiatives we seek to:
●
continue to gain market share for our wholly-owned subsidiaries’ areas of operation,
●
increase our gross revenues and realize net operating profits,
●
lower our operating costs by unburdening certain selling expenses to third party distributors,
●
have sufficient cash reserves to pay down accrued expenses and losses,
●
attract parties who have an interest in selling their privately held companies to us,
●
achieve efficiencies in accounting and reporting through adoption of standards used by all subsidiaries on a consistent basis,
●
strategically pursue additional company acquisitions, and
●
explore opportunities as may present themselves in the Fintech space, including the launch of services by Marygold and Marygold Advisory Services, and the creation of new corporate entities as focused subsidiary holdings.
Results of Operations
For the Year Ended June 30, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended June 30, 2020
Financial Summary
The table below summarizes each of Concierge's subsidiaries into one of two categories. The Wainwright business is included in the "Financial Services" columns and all other subsidiaries, including Gourmet Food, Brigadier, and Original Sprout are included in the "Other Operating Units" columns. Corporate expenses are included in the "Concierge Corporate" column and also includes, includes losses as a result of Marygold being in the development stage. The table below is calculated using operating results rounded to the nearest thousand. The operating results depicted below may differ slightly compared to the actual results as indicated on our Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of rounding.
Revenue and Operating Income
Consolidated revenue for the year ended June 30, 2021 was $39.9 million representing a $13.2 million increase from the prior year revenue of $26.7 million. The increase in consolidated revenues is attributed to the increase in annual revenues of Wainwright and Gourmet Foods. Wainwright’s average Assets Under Management ("AUM") for the year ended June 30, 2021 was significantly higher than that of 2020, which resulted in a revenue increase of approximately $9.7 million. The acquisition of Printstock by Gourmet Foods added an additional $3.0 million in revenues for 2021, whereas Printstock was acquired in July 2020 and therefore did not contribute revenues during fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. The other operating subsidiaries were relatively stable in revenues for the year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to 2020. Concierge produced an operating income for the year ended June 30, 2021 of $7.4 million as compared to $1.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2020. This represents an increase in operating income of $5.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2021 when compared to the year ended June 30, 2020 or approximately 287%.
Other Income (Expenses)
Other income (expense) for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 were $0.2 million and $0.4 million, respectively, resulting in a net income before income tax of $7.6 million and $2.3 million, respectively. After giving consideration to currency translation gain of $332 thousand our comprehensive income for the year ended June 30, 2021 was $6.2 million as compared to the year ended June 30, 2020 where there was a currency translation gain of $31 thousand which resulted in comprehensive income of $1.8 million. Comprehensive gain and loss are comprised of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and effects in the valuation of our holdings in New Zealand and Canada.
Income Tax
Provision for income tax for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 are $1.8 million and $0.6 million, respectively, primarily attributable to our United States operations through our Wainwright subsidiary. Income tax expense recorded at the Concierge level totaled $1.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2021, while a tax expense of $0.4 million was recorded for the year ended June 30, 2020.
Net Income
Overall, the net income between the year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2020 increased by approximately $4.1 million or approximately 230% to approximately $5.9 million. The increase in net income for the year ended June 30, 2021 was primarily attributable to higher fund management revenue from Wainwright due to a higher amount of AUM.
Investment Fund Management - Wainwright Holdings
Wainwright was founded as a holding company in March 2004 as a Delaware corporation with one subsidiary, Ameristock Corporation, which was an investment adviser to Ameristock Mutual Fund, Inc., a registered 1940 Act large cap value equity fund. In January 2010, Ameristock Corporation was spun off as a standalone company. In May 2005, USCF was formed as a single member limited liability company in the state of Delaware. In June 2013, USCF Advisers was formed as a Delaware limited liability company and in July 2014, was registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. In November 2013, the USCF Advisers board of managers formed USCF ETF Trust (“ETF Trust”) and in July 2016, the USCF Mutual Funds Trust (“Mutual Funds Trust” and together with “ETF Trust” the “Trusts”) both as open-end management investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended ("the 1940 Act"). The Trusts are authorized to have multiple segregated series or portfolios. Wainwright owns all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company membership interests of its subsidiaries, USCF and USCF Advisers, each a Delaware limited liability company and are affiliated companies. USCF serves as the general partner (“General Partner”) for various limited partnerships (“LP”) and sponsor (“Sponsor”) as noted below. USCF and USCF Advisers are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations generally applicable to the investment services industry. USCF is a commodity pool operator (“CPO”) subject to regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the "CFTC") and the National Futures Association (the “NFA”) under the Commodities Exchange Act (“CEA”). USCF Advisers is an investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended and has registered as a CPO under the CEA. Exchange traded products (“ETPs”) issued or sponsored by USCF are required to be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) in accordance with the Securities Act of 1933. Wainwright operates through USCF and USCF Advisers, which collectively operate ten exchange-traded products ("ETPs") and exchange traded funds (“ETFs”), regulated by the 1940 Act and 1933 Act, and listed on the NYSE Arca, Inc. ("NYSE Arca") with a total of approximately $4.5 billion assets under management as of June 30, 2021. Wainwright and subsidiaries USCF and USCF Advisers are collectively referred to as “Wainwright” hereafter.
USCF currently serves as the General Partner or the Sponsor to the following commodity pools, each of which is currently conducting a public offering of its shares pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended:
In addition, USCF served as a Sponsor to the USCF Funds Trust, a Delaware Statutory Trust that initially launched two series - United States 3X Oil Fund and United States 3X Short Oil Fund - both of which were liquidated in December 2019.
USCF Advisers, a registered investment adviser, serves as the investment adviser to the funds listed below within the USCF ETF Trust (the “ETF Trust”) and has overall responsibility for the general management and administration for the ETF Trust. Pursuant to the current Investment Advisory Agreements, USCF Advisers provides an investment program for each of series within the ETF Trust and manages the investment of the assets.

All commodity pools managed by USCF and each series of the ETF Trust managed by USCF Advisers are collectively referred to as the “Funds” hereafter.
Wainwright’s revenue and expenses are primarily driven by the amount of AUM. Wainwright earns monthly management and advisory fees based on agreements with each Fund as determined by the contractual basis point management fee structure in each agreement multiplied by the average AUM over the given period. Many of the company’s expenses are dependent upon the amount of AUM. These variable expenses include Fund administration, custody, accounting, transfer agency, marketing and distribution, and sub-adviser fees and are primarily determined by multiplying contractual fee rates by AUM. The total operating expenses are grouped into the following financial statement line items: General and Administrative, Marketing, Operations and Salaries and Compensation.
For the Year Ended June 30, 2021, Compared to the Year Ended June 30, 2020
Revenue
Average AUM for the year ended June 30, 2021 was at $4.9 billion, as compared to approximately $3.0 billion from the year ended June 30, 2020 primarily due to an increase in AUM at USO, BNO and USL. As a result, the revenues from management and advisory fees increased by approximately $9.7 million, or 63%, to $25.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2020 where revenues from management and advisory fees totaled $15.4 million.
Expenses
Wainwright’s total operating expenses for the year ended June 30, 2021 increased by $2.4 million to $15.2 million, or approximately 19%, from $12.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2020. Variable expenses, as described above, increased by $1.3 million over the respective twelve-month period due to higher AUM for the fiscal year which resulted in higher marketing and distribution expenses, sub-advisory fees and other variable costs. General and Administrative expenses increased $1.0 million to $3.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2021 from $2.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2020 due to increases in expense waiver and legal and professional expenses, partially offset by decreases in travel and entertainment. Total marketing expenses increased $0.5 million to $2.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to the prior year period due to an increase in marketing distribution costs as a result of higher AUM, partially offset by decreases in advertising and marketing conferences. Other Operating expenses increased by $0.5 million primarily due to higher fund administration and sub-adviser fees as result of higher AUM. Employee Salaries and Compensation expenses were approximately $5.4 million and $4.9 million, an increase of $0.5 million, for the years ended June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, respectively, due to bonuses and small increases in annual compensation.
Income
Income before income taxes for the year ended June 30, 2020 increased $7.1 million to $10.0 million from $2.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2020 due to $9.7 million increase in revenue as a result of higher AUM, in addition to a $2.4 million increase in operating expenses along with a decrease of $0.2 million in other income.
Food Products - Gourmet Foods, Ltd.
Gourmet Foods was organized in its current form in 2005 (previously known as Pats Pantry Ltd). Pats Pantry was founded in 1966 to produce and sell wholesale bakery products, meat pies and patisserie cakes and slices, in New Zealand. Gourmet Foods, located in Tauranga, New Zealand, sells substantially all of its goods to supermarkets and service station chains with stores located throughout New Zealand. Gourmet Foods also has a large number of smaller independent lunch bars, cafes and corner dairies among the customer list, however they comprise a relatively insignificant dollar volume in comparison to the primary accounts of large distributors and retailers. On July 1, 2020, Gourmet Foods acquired the New Zealand company, Printstock Products Limited ("Printstock"). Located in nearby Napier, New Zealand, Printstock prints wrappers for food products, including those used by Gourmet Foods. Printstock is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gourmet Foods and its operating results are consolidated with those of Gourmet Foods from July 1, 2020 onwards.
Gourmet Foods operates exclusively in New Zealand and thus the New Zealand dollar is its functional currency. In order to consolidate Concierge’s reporting currency, the US dollar, with that of Gourmet Foods, Concierge records foreign currency translation adjustments and transaction gains and losses in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 830, Foreign Currency Matters. The translation of New Zealand currency into U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using a weighted average exchange rate during the period. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency translations are included in foreign currency translation (loss) gain on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income as well as accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income found on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
For the Year Ended June 30, 2021, Compared to the Year Ended June 30, 2020
Revenue
Net revenues for the year ended June 30, 2021 were $8.3 million with cost of goods sold of $5.7 million resulting in a gross profit of $2.6 million, or approximately 31% gross margin, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2020 where net revenues were $4.7 million and cost of goods sold were $3.2 million producing a gross profit of $1.5 million, or approximately 32% gross margin. The increase in revenues is attributed to the acquisition of Printstock in July 2020 which contributed $3 million in net revenues during the year ended June 30, 2021 and contributed no revenues for the year ended June 30, 2020.
Expenses
General, administrative and selling expenses, including wages and marketing, for the year ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 were $1.7 million and $1.1 million producing operating income of $0.8 million and $0.4 million, respectively, or approximately 10% net operating profit for the year ended June 30, 2021 and 8% for the year ended June 30, 2020. The depreciation expense and other income (expense) totaled approximately ($157) thousand for the year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to ($38) thousand for the year ended June 30, 2020.
Income
Income for the year ended June 30, 2021, after income tax of $0.2 million, resulted in net income of approximately $0.5 million as compared to a net income of $0.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2020. The increase in revenues and operating expenses during the year ended June 30, 2021 are attributable to the acquisition of Printstock and its operating results.
Security Systems - Brigadier Security Systems (2000) Ltd.
Brigadier Security Systems, founded in 1985, is a leading electronic security company in the province of Saskatchewan. Brigadier Security Systems has offices located in the urban areas of Saskatchewan, Brigadier Security in Saskatoon, and operating as Elite Security in Regina. The company has a combined industry experience of over 135 years. Brigadier provides comprehensive security solutions including access control, camera systems, fire alarm monitoring panels, and intrusion alarms to home and business owners as well as government offices, schools, and public buildings. Their experience as the provider of choice on many large notable sites shows a commitment to design, service and support. Brigadier specializes, and is certified, in several major manufacturers’ products: Honeywell Security, Panasonic, Avigilon and JCI/DSC/Kantech security products. The company and staff are recognized for dedication to customer service with annual awards from SecurTek including being recipients of the Customer Retention, Service Excellence, and overall best dealer with the President’s Award. The company demonstrates a commitment to delivering outstanding quality to customers by the notable facilities, businesses, and homes they secure.
Brigadier Security Systems is an authorized SecurTek dealer. SecurTek is owned by SaskTel which is Saskatchewan's leading Information and Communications Technology (ICT) provider with over 1.4 million customer connections across Canada. Under the terms of its authorized dealer contract with the monitoring company, Brigadier earns monthly payments during the term of the monitoring contract in exchange for performance of customer service activities on behalf of the monitoring company.
Brigadier operates exclusively in Canada and thus the Canadian dollar is its functional currency. In order to consolidate Concierge’s reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, with that of Brigadier, Concierge records foreign currency translation adjustments and transaction gains and losses in accordance with ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters. The translation of Canadian currency into U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using a weighted average exchange rate during the period.
For the Year Ended June 30, 2021, Compared to the Year Ended June 30, 2020
Revenue
Net revenues for the year ended June 30, 2021 were $2.7 million with cost of goods sold of approximately $1.3 million, resulting in a gross profit of approximately $1.4 million with a gross margin of approximately 53% as compared to the year ended June 30, 2020 where net revenues were approximately $2.7 million with cost of goods sold of $1.2 million and a gross profit of $1.5 million, or approximately 56% gross margin. The decline in profit margin is an indirect result of the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Brigadier's ability to source hardware timely and to perform installation services at residential locations. Management believes that this is business deferred rather than lost, and expects that the eventual resolution of the pandemic will restore operations to their prior levels.
Expenses
General, administrative and selling expenses for the year ended June 30, 2021 were $1.2 million producing an operating profit of $0.2 million or approximately 11% operating profit margin as compared to the year ended June 30, 2020 where general, administrative and selling expenses where $1.2 million producing an operating profit of $0.3 million, or approximately 12% operating profit margin.
Income
Other income (expense) comprised of depreciation, income tax, interest income, other income (expense) including taxable government subsidies due to COVID-19 of approximately $137 thousand, impairment to inventory value, and gain on sale of assets totaling approximately $6 thousand for the year ended June 30, 2021 resulting in income after income taxes of approximately $0.3 million as compared to income after income taxes of approximately $0.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2020 with expenses totaling approximately ($12) thousand.
Beauty Products - Original Sprout
Kahnalytics was founded in 2015 and adopted the dba/Original Sprout in December 2017. Original Sprout formulates and packages various hair and skin care products that are 100% vegan, tested safe and non-toxic, and marketed globally through distribution networks to salons, resorts, grocery stores, health food stores, e-tail sites and on the company's website. The company operates from warehouse and sales offices located in San Clemente, CA, USA. As a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Original Sprout has made adjustments to its primary channels to market. Prior to the pandemic Original Sprout relied heavily upon its wholesale distribution network to place products at retail locations and generally to make products available to consumers, whereas in the current environment of social distancing and closures of retail businesses the company found a significant drop in sales volumes as consumers avoided traditional sales outlets. In response to this trend, Original Sprout has established new sales channels with online retailers and also encouraged those national retail chains who stock the product to also make it available at online shopping carts. The positive effects of this transition are now being realized while at the same time the negative effects of the pandemic on the wholesale distribution business continues to increase for the U.S. market. The result is that sales overall have been relatively stable during the pandemic, though derived from different sources. Contributing to lower profit margins and higher expenses during the current fiscal year are the one-time costs of relocating to a larger facility during December and January, the disposal of obsolete product, the transition to new packaging and new product development.
For the Year Ended June 30, 2021, Compared to the Year Ended June 30, 2020
Revenue
Net revenues for the year ended June 30, 2021 were $3.8 million with cost of goods sold of approximately $2.3 million resulting in a gross profit of approximately $1.5 million and a gross margin of approximately 40% compared to the year ended June 30, 2020 were net revenues totaled $3.9 million with cost of goods sold of approximately $2.1 million resulting in a gross profit of approximately $1.8 million and a gross margin of approximately 46%.
Expenses
General, administrative and selling expenses for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 were approximately $1.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively, resulting in operating income of approximately $9 thousand and $500 thousand or approximately 0.2% and 13%, respectively.
Income
After consideration given to income tax provision, other income, and depreciation expense, the net (loss) income for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 was approximately ($200) thousand and $200 thousand, respectively.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Concierge is a holding company that conducts its operations through its subsidiaries. At the holding-company level, its liquidity needs relate to operational expense, the funding of additional business acquisitions and new investment opportunities. Our operating subsidiaries' principal liquidity requirements arise from cash used in operating activities, debt service, and capital expenditures, including purchases of equipment and services, operating costs and expenses, and income taxes. Cash is managed at the holding company or the subsidiary level. There are no limitations or constraints on the movement of funds between the entities.
As of June 30, 2021, we had $16.1 million of cash and cash equivalents on a consolidated basis as compared to $9.8 million as of June 30, 2020. The increase in cash was due to an increase in higher revenues.
During the past five fiscal years combined, Concierge has invested approximately $8.2 million in cash towards purchasing and assimilating Gourmet Foods and its Printstock subsidiary, Brigadier Security Systems and the Original Sprout assets into the Concierge Technologies group of companies as well as the acquisition through a stock-for-stock exchange of Wainwright, which provides a significant revenue stream and value. We have also invested approximately $2.9 million in the development of Fintech applications through our newly organized subsidiary, Marygold. Despite these cash investments, our working capital position remains strong at $19 million and our position has strengthened year-to-year. While Concierge intends to maintain and improve its revenue stream from wholly owned subsidiaries, Concierge continues to pursue acquisitions of other profitable companies which meet its target profile. Provided Concierge’s subsidiaries continue to operate as they are presently, and are projected to operate, Concierge has sufficient capital to pay its general and administrative expenses for the coming fiscal year and to adequately pursue its long term business objectives. However, given the significant economic and financial market disruptions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company’s results of operations could be adversely impacted.
Lease Liability
In relation to the adoption of ASC 842, the Company recognized $1,150,916 of operating lease liabilities on July 1, 2019. The total amount due under these obligations was $1,120,631 and $770,457 as of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, respectively. The obligations will amortize over the passage of time through the recognition of periodic rent expense. See Note 14 for further analysis of this obligation.
Borrowings
As of June 30, 2021, we had $1.0 million of related-party and third-party indebtedness on a consolidated basis as compared to $1.0 million as of June 30, 2020. Approximately US$394,898 is owed by Brigadier and secured with the land and building in Saskatoon purchased in July 2019. The initial principal balance was CD$525,000 (approximately US$401,000 translated as of the loan date July 1, 2019) with an annual interest rate of 4.14% maturing June 30, 2024. The short-term portion of principal for this loan due within 12 months as of June 30, 2021 is CD$18,718 (approximately US$15,094) and the long term principal amount due is CD$471,020 (approximately US$379,804). Interest on the loan is expensed or accrued as it becomes due. Interest expense on the loan for the year ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 was US$16,078 and US$16,738, respectively. Concierge, without inclusion of its subsidiary companies, as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, had $0.6 million of related-party indebtedness. We are not required to make interest payments on our related party notes until the maturity date.
Current related party notes payable consist of the following:
Investments
Wainwright, from time to time, provides initial investments in the creation of ETP funds that Wainwright manages. Wainwright classifies these investments as current assets as these investments are generally sold within one year from the balance sheet date. As of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, Wainwright did not hold any initial investment positions. These investments, as applicable, are described further in Note 7 to our Financial Statements.
Dividends
Our strategy on dividends is to declare and pay dividends only from retained earnings and only when our Board of Directors deems it prudent and in the best interests of the company to declare and pay dividends. We paid no dividends during the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
At June 30, 2021, and as of September 21, 2021, we have not entered into any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement with an entity unconsolidated with us under which we have:
●
