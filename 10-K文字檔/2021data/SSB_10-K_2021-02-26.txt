Introduction
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) describes South State Corporation and its subsidiary’s results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, and the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, and also analyzes our financial condition as of December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019. Like most banking institutions, we derive most of our income from interest we receive on our loans and investments. Our primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits, on most of which we pay interest. Consequently, one of the key measures of our success is the amount of net interest income, or the difference between the income on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and the expense on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits. Another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interest-earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities.
There are risks inherent in all loans, so we maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb our estimate of probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible. We establish and maintain this allowance by charging a provision for loan losses against our earnings. In the following section, we have included a detailed discussion of this process.
In addition to earning interest on our loans and investments, we earn income through fees and other services we charge to our customers. We incur costs in addition to interest expense on deposits and other borrowings, the largest of which is salaries and employee benefits. We describe the various components of this noninterest income and noninterest expense in the following discussion.
The following section also identifies significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements. We encourage you to read this discussion
and analysis in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes and the other information included in this Report.
Overview
The merger with CSFL approximately doubled the size of the Company, resulting in significant increases to assets, liabilities and equity on the Consolidated Statements of Balance Sheet, as well as to many categories of revenue and expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. We earned net income of $120.6 million, or $2.19 diluted earnings per share (“EPS”), during 2020 compared to net income of $186.5 million, or $5.36 diluted EPS, in 2019. Net income available to the common shareholders was down $65.9 million, or 35.3% in 2020, due primarily to the following:
● Increased interest income of $319.2 million, which resulted from a $316.4 million increase in interest income from loans and loans held for sale, an $8.5 million increase in interest income from investment securities, and offset by a $5.7 million decrease in interest income on federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreement to resell and interest-bearing deposits. The increase in interest income on loans resulted from a $258.8 million increase in interest income on acquired loans due to an increase in average acquired loans from the merger with CSFL and a $51.0 million increase in interest income on non-acquired loans. Non-acquired loan interest income increased due to an increase in average balance through organic loan growth. The increase in interest income from investment securities was due to an increase in average balance in 2020 from both the balances acquired in the merger with CSFL and the Company’s decision to invest its excess liquidity into investment securities;
● Increased provision for credit losses of $223.2 million which resulted primarily from the provision for credit losses on Non-PCD loans acquired from CSFL (i.e., the impact of the adoption of CECL on Non-PCD acquired loans) and on the provision for credit losses on non-acquired loans, which was the result of forecasted losses taking into consideration the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has on the overall economic environment and the potential impact on the overall loan portfolio;
● Increased noninterest income of $167.6 million, which resulted primarily from a $88.6 million increase in mortgage banking income, a $61.9 million increase in correspondent banking and capital markets income, a $8.9 million increase in fees on deposit accounts and a $17.5 million increase in other noninterest income, all of which were increased with the CSFL merger. These increases were partially offset by a decline in recoveries on acquired loans of $6.8 million as the recoveries are now part of ACL as a result of the CECL adoption and a decline in gains on sales of securities of $2.7 million (See Noninterest Income section on page 61 for further discussion);
● Increased noninterest expense of $393.0 million, which primarily resulted from a $181.9 million increase in salaries and employee benefits expense, $81.4 million increase in merger and branch consolidation related expense, a $28.1 million increase in occupancy expense, a $24.4 million increase in information services expense, a $13.9 million increase in amortization of intangibles and $6.2 million increase in FDIC assessment and other regulatory charges, all of which primarily resulted from the CSFL merger. The Company also terminated three cash flow hedges (SWAPs) given the current low interest rate environment and expectation of low interest rates in the foreseeable future resulting in a termination cost of $38.8 million. These increases were partially offset by the of $9.5 million of pension plan termination expense in 2019. (See Noninterest Expense section on page 64 for further discussion);
● Lower income tax provision of $60.6 million primarily due to the recognition of a one-time benefit of $31.5 million recorded in the fourth quarter 2020, related to the ability to carryback tax losses under the CARES Act, and lower income tax provision totaling $29.1 million on lower pretax income of $126.5 million; and
● Decreased interest expense of $3.0 million due to a 41 basis point decrease in the cost of total interest-bearing liabilities. The decrease in cost of interest-bearing liabilities was due to a falling interest rate environment as the Federal Reserve dropped the federal funds target rate by 75 bps from July 2019 to October 2019. The Federal Reserve then dropped the federal funds target rate 150 bps to a range of 0.00% to 0.25% in March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The effects from the decline in cost were partially offset by an increase in average balance in interest-bearing liabilities. The increase in average balances was mainly due to
the balances acquired in the merger with CSFL as the average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased $6.8 billion and the average balance of federal funds purchased, repurchase agreements and other borrowings increased $633.6 million.
Our asset quality results remained strong in 2020. At December 31, 2020, net charge offs as a percentage of average loans was 0.01%. At December 31, 2019, which is prior to the implementation of CECL, the net charge offs as a percentage of average non-acquired loans was 0.04%. The total NPAs increased $78.3 million to $119.1 million at December 31, 2020 from $40.8 million at December 31, 2019. The total NPAs for the current year include nonaccrual loans that are purchased credit deteriorated. Prior to January 1, 2020, these loans, previously called purchased credit impaired loans, were excluded from NPAs. Due to this change, the Company’s nonperforming assets increased by $21.0 million in the first quarter of 2020. Acquired Nonperforming Assets (“NPAs”) increased $72.3 million to $89.2 million at December 31, 2020 from $17.0 million at December 31, 2019 mainly through assets acquired through the merger with CSFL. Acquired nonperforming loans increased $66.6 million and acquired OREO and other nonperforming assets increased $5.7 million. The increase in the acquired nonperforming loans was due to the addition of the nonperforming loans assumed from the merger with CSFL, as well as the addition of $21.0 million in the first quarter of 2020, which were formerly accounted for as credit impaired loans (with ASU 2106-13, these loans are now considered PCD loans). Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13, acquired credit impaired loans were considered to be performing due to the application of the accretion method under FASB ASC Topic 310-30. Our asset quality related to the non-acquired loan portfolio remained stable in 2020 as the NPAs slightly increased by $6.0 million. NPAs as a percentage of total assets increased six bps to 0.32% at December 31, 2020 as compared to 0.26% at December 31, 2019.
The ACL increased $400.4 million from the balance of $56.9 million at December 31, 2019. The increase in ACL was mainly due to a $54.4 million allowance recorded at adoption of the CECL standard as of January 1, 2020, a $149.4 million allowance recorded on the purchased credit deteriorated loans of $149.4 million through fair value adjustments through the merger with CSFL and $109.4 million recorded on the initial provision for credit losses on the non-purchased credit deteriorated loans acquired in the CSFL merger. The ACL of period-end loans was at 1.85% at December 31, 2020 or 2.01% excluding PPP loans compared to 0.62% at December 31, 2019. The ACL provides 4.28 times coverage of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, the Company also had an ACL on unfunded commitments of $43.4 million which was recorded in Other Liabilities on the Balance Sheet. With the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, the Company increased its allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments by $6.5 million. The Company also recorded an initial provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments of $9.6 million with the merger with CSFL.
Our efficiency ratio was 69.8% at December 31, 2020, compared with 62.5% at December 31, 2019. The change in our efficiency ratio was due to the effect of the 97.1% increase in noninterest expense being greater than the effect of the 75.6% increase in the total of net interest income and noninterest income. The main reason for the increase in noninterest expense was the $302.0 million increase in salaries and employee benefit, merger and branch consolidation and swap termination expenses in 2020.
We continue to remain well-capitalized with a total risk-based capital ratio of 14.2% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 8.3%, as of December 31, 2020, compared to 12.8% and 9.7%, respectively, at December 31, 2019. The total risk-based capital ratio increased in 2020 as total risk-based capital (excluding the change in accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI) grew by $2.1 billion or 142.6% while total risk-weighted assets increased $13.8 billion or 117.7%. The increase in total risk-based capital was mainly due to the equity issued from the merger with CSFL of $2.3 billion, net income of $120.6 million, an increase in subordinated debt that qualifies as capital of $279.2 million (debt acquired in the merger with CSFL) and an increase in the allowance for credit losses that qualifies as total capital of $178.0 million (increase in allowance due the merger with CSFL and the transition to CECL in 2020). The increase in risk weighted asset was mainly due to the assets acquired in the merger with CSFL. The Tier 1 leverage ratio decreased from the prior year as tier 1 capital (excluding the change in AOCI) increased by $1.6 billion or 109.2%, while total average eligible assets increased $21.6 billion, or 145.9%. This decrease was due to the percentage increase in average eligible assets from the merger with CSFL being greater than the percentage increase in tier 1 capital from the merger. We believe our current capital ratios position us well to grow both organically and through certain strategic opportunities.
At December 31, 2020, we had $37.8 billion in assets and 5,184 full-time equivalent employees. Through our Bank branches, ATMs and online banking platforms, we provide our customers with a wide range of financial services, including deposit accounts such as checking accounts, NOW accounts, savings and time deposits of various types, safe
deposit boxes, bank money orders, wire transfer and ACH services, brokerage services and alternative investment products such as annuities and mutual funds, trust and asset management services, loans of all types, including business loans, agriculture loans, real estate-secured (mortgage) loans, personal use loans, home improvement loans, automobile loans, manufactured housing loans, boat loans, credit cards, letters of credit, home equity lines of credit, treasury management services, merchant services, factoring, and a wide range of correspondent banking services for community banks and others.
Recent Events
COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic has severely restricted the level of economic activity in our markets. Specifically due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal and state governments in which we have financial centers and of most other states have taken preventative or protective actions, such as imposing restrictions on travel and business operations, advising or requiring individuals to limit or forego their time outside of their homes, and ordering temporary closures of some businesses that have been deemed to be non-essential.
While our business has been designated an essential business, which allows us to continue to serve our customers, we serve many customers that were deemed, or who were employed by businesses that were deemed, to be non-essential. Although states in our market area have allowed businesses to reopen in the second and third quarters of 2020 that were deemed non-essential, there are still many restrictions, and our customers are still being adversely effected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In many of the states in our market area, as the economies have been allowed to reopen, there has been an increase in cases of COVID-19 and some restrictions have been reinstated.
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is fluid and continues to evolve. The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated impacts on trade (including supply chains and export levels), travel, employee productivity, unemployment, consumer spending, and other economic activities has resulted in less economic activity, lower equity market valuations and increased volatility and disruption in financial markets, and has had an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of general operations, with a more limited impact to our mortgage and correspondent banking business lines. The ultimate extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations is uncertain and will depend on various developments and other factors, including, among others, the duration and scope of the pandemic, as well as governmental, regulatory and private sector responses to the pandemic, and the associated impacts on the economy, financial markets and our customers, employees and vendors.
Our business, financial condition and results of operations generally rely upon the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, the value of collateral underlying our secured loans, and demand for loans and other products and services we offer, which are highly dependent on the business environment in our primary markets where we operate and in the United States as a whole. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on our business and operations. As part of our efforts to practice social distancing, in March 2020, we closed all of our banking lobbies and began conducting most of our business through drive-thru tellers and through electronic and online means. To support the health and well-being of our employees, we allowed a majority of our non-customer facing workforce to work from home. In October 2020, we reopened our banking lobbies in our branch locations, but a majority of our support staff is still working from home. To support our customers or to comply with law, we have deferred loan payments from 90 to 180 days for consumer and commercial customers. For customers directly impacted by the COVID-19, we suspended residential property foreclosure sales, evictions, and involuntary automobile repossessions, and are offering fee waivers, payment deferrals, and other expanded assistance for automobile, mortgage, small business and personal lending customers.
Future governmental actions may require more of these and other types of customer-related responses. For non-FHA insured loans that were not directly impacted by the COVID-19, normal collection efforts and foreclosure filings resumed at the end of the third quarter 2020. Eviction actions remain suspended through December 31, 2020 per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Agency Order 2020-19654.
As of December 31, 2020, we have deferrals of $255.2 million, or 1.12%, of our total loan portfolio, excluding loans held for sale and PPP loans. For commercial loans, the standard deferral was 90 days for both principal and interest, 120 days of principal payments only or 180 days of interest payments only. For consumer and mortgage loans, the standard deferral was 120 days of both principal and interest or 180 days of interest only. We have actively reached
out to our customers to provide guidance and direction on these deferrals. In terms of available lines of credit, the company has not experienced an increase in borrowers drawing down on their lines. As of December 31, 2020, below are the loan portfolios which we view are of the greatest risk:
● Lodging (hotel / motel) loan portfolio - 18% of the portfolio was under deferral, and the weighted average loan to value (“LTV”) was 52%. The Company had $974 million, or 4.3% of the total loan portfolio, excluding loans held for sale and PPP loans, in lodging loans.
● Restaurant loan portfolio - 1% of the portfolio was under deferral, and the weighted average LTV of real estate secured was 56%. The Company had $488 million, or 2.2% of the total loan portfolio, excluding loans held for sale and PPP loans, in restaurants.
● Retail loan portfolio - 0.2% of retail CRE loan portfolio was under deferral and the weighted average LTV was 58%. The Company currently has $2.2 billion, or 9.6% of the total loan portfolio, excluding loans held for sale and PPP loans, in retail CRE loans.
We have extended credit to both customers and non-customers related to the PPP. During 2020, we produced approximately 20,000 loans totaling approximately $2.4 billion through the PPP. While deferrals have been decreasing materially since the third quarter, given the fluidity of the pandemic and the risk there may be new lockdowns or restrictions on business activities to slow the spread of the virus, there is no guarantee that some loan not currently on deferral might return to deferral status.
A restructuring that results in only a delay in payments that is insignificant is not considered an economic concession. In accordance with the CARES Act, the Company implemented loan modification programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in order to provide borrowers with flexibility with respect to repayment terms. The Company’s payment relief assistance includes forbearance, deferrals, extension and re-aging programs, along with certain other modification strategies. The Company elected the accounting policy in the CARES Act to suspend TDR accounting to loans modified for borrowers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic if the concession meets the criteria defined under the CARES Act.
We are monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations and financial condition. We implemented ASU 2016-13 in the first quarter of 2020 related to the calculation for our ACL for loans, investments, unfunded commitments and other financial assets. Considering the COVID-19 pandemic in our CECL models and moving to one CECL model (with the merged bank) during the third quarter of 2020, we recorded a provision for credit losses of $236.0 million in 2020, which was significantly higher than $12.8 million recorded in 2019. The increase mainly was from the second quarter 2020, where the provision for credit losses was comprised of three major components: (1) $119.1 million for the day 1 provision for loans without significant credit deterioration (“Non-PCD”) acquired from CSFL, (2) $31.3 million from the legacy South State loan portfolio, and (3) $1.1 million from the acquired CSFL loan portfolio since the merger date. We also adjust our investment securities portfolio to market each period end and review for any impairment that would require a provision for credit losses. At this time, we have determined there is no need for a provision for credit losses related to our investment securities portfolio. Because of changing economic and market conditions affecting issuers, we may be required to recognize impairments in the future on the securities we hold, as well as reductions in other comprehensive income. We cannot currently determine the ultimate impact of the pandemic on the long-term value of our portfolio.
We also are monitoring the impact of COVID-19 on the valuation of goodwill. Additional detail in regards to the goodwill analysis is disclosed below under the Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets section of the Recent Events.
CenterState Bank Corporation Merger
On June 7, 2020, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of CSFL, the holding company for CSB, in a stock transaction. Pursuant to the merger agreement, (i) CSFL merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger, and (ii) immediately following the Merger, SSB merged with and into CSB, with CSB continuing as the surviving bank in the Bank Merger. In connection with the Bank Merger, CSB changed its name to South State Bank, National Association. CSFL common shareholders received 0.3001 shares of the Company’s common stock in exchange for each share of CSFL stock resulting in the Company issuing
37,271,069 shares of its common stock. In total, the purchase price for CSFL was $2.3 billion including the value of the conversion of outstanding warrants, stock options and restricted stock units totaling $10.3 million.
In the acquisition, the Company acquired $13.0 billion of loans (excluding loans held for sale) at fair value, net of $239.5 million, or 1.82%, estimated discount to the outstanding principal balance. Of the total loans acquired, Management identified $3.1 billion with credit deficiencies that were identified as Purchased Credit Deteriorated (“PCD”) loans. The Company assumed $15.6 billion in deposits including a $20.2 million premium for fixed maturity time deposits.
As a result of the Bank Merger, the Bank became a national banking association that is subject to primary
supervision and regulation by the OCC and subject to the National Bank Act and is no longer subject to supervision and regulation by the SCBFI. In addition, the FDIC is no longer the Bank’s primary federal regulator, and the Bank is now a member of the Federal Reserve System.
Branch Consolidation and Other Cost Initiatives
As a part of the ongoing evaluation of customer service delivery and efficiencies, the Company consolidated 20 branch locations in the fourth quarter 2020. The expected cost associated with these closures and cost initiatives is estimated to be approximately $5.0 million, and primarily includes personnel, facilities and equipment cost. The annual savings in 2021 of these closures is expected to be $7.0 million, and the impact in 2020 was approximately $900,000. Eleven of the locations were in Florida, five in South Carolina, two in North Carolina, one in Georgia and one in Alabama. The Company subsequently announced consolidation of an additional 4 branch locations which is expected to take in place in the first quarter 2021.
Capital Management
During 2020, the Company repurchased a total of 320,000 shares for $24.7 million or $77.23 per share (excluding commission expense). On January 27, 2021, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the authorization of a new 3.5 million share Company stock repurchase plan (the “2021 Repurchase Program”). This 2021 Repurchase Plan replaced in its entirety the Company’s stock repurchase plan announced on June 13, 2019. Additional detail on the 2021 Repurchase Plan is discussed in the Note 32-Subsequent Events of our audited consolidated financial statements.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and follow general practices within the banking industry. Our financial position and results of operations are affected by management’s application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses. Differences in the application of these policies could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations and related disclosures. Understanding our accounting policies is fundamental to understanding our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. Accordingly, our significant accounting policies and changes in accounting principles and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in Note 1 of our audited consolidated financial statements.
The following is a summary of our critical accounting policies that are highly dependent on estimates, assumptions and judgments.
Business Combinations
We account for acquisitions under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 805, Business Combinations, which requires the use of the acquisition method of accounting. All identifiable assets acquired, including loans, and liabilities assumed, are recorded at fair value. We adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, on January 1, 2020 which now requires us to record purchased financial assets with credit deterioration (PCD assets), defined as a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination or issuance, at the purchase price plus the allowance for credit losses expected at the time of acquisition. Under this method, there is no
credit loss expense affecting net income on acquisition of PCD assets. Changes in estimates of expected credit losses after acquisition are recognized as credit loss expense (or reversal of credit loss expense) in subsequent periods as they arise. Any non-credit discount or premium resulting from acquiring a pool of purchased financial assets with credit deterioration shall be allocated to each individual asset. At the acquisition date, the initial allowance for credit losses determined on a collective basis shall be allocated to individual assets to appropriately allocate any non-credit discount or premium. The non-credit discount or premium, after the adjustment for the allowance for credit losses, shall be accreted to interest income using the interest method based on the effective interest rate determined after the adjustment for credit losses at the adoption date.
A purchased financial asset that does not qualify as a PCD asset is accounted for similar to an originated financial asset. Generally, this means that an entity recognizes the allowance for credit losses for non-PCD assets through net income at the time of acquisition. In addition, both the credit discount and non-credit discount or premium resulting from acquiring a pool of purchased financial assets that do not qualify as PCD assets shall be allocated to each individual asset. This combined discount or premium shall be accreted to interest income using the effective yield method.
For further discussion of our loan accounting and acquisitions, see Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 2-Mergers and Acquisitions, Note 5-Loans and Note 6-Allowance for Credit Losses to the audited condensed consolidated financial statements.
Allowance for Credit Losses or ACL
The ACL reflects Management’s estimate of losses that will result from the inability of our borrowers to make required loan payments. Due to the Merger between the Company and CSFL, effective June 7, 2020, Management collectively evaluated loans utilizing two different methodologies for the second quarter 2020. Subsequently during the third quarter 2020, Management adopted one methodology. Management used the one systematic methodology to determine its ACL for loans held for investment and certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures. Management considers the effects of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the loan portfolio. The Company’s estimate of its ACL involves a high degree of judgment; therefore, Management’s process for determining expected credit losses may result in a range of expected credit losses. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach a different reasonable conclusion. The Company’s ACL recorded in the balance sheet reflects Management’s best estimate within the range of expected credit losses. The Company recognizes in net income the amount needed to adjust the ACL for Management’s current estimate of expected credit losses. See Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further detailed descriptions of our estimation process and methodology related to the ACL. See also Note 6-Allowance for Credit Losses and “Provision for Credit Losses” in this MD&A.
Other Real Estate Owned and Bank Property Held For Sale
Other real estate owned (“OREO”) consists of properties obtained through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu of foreclosure in satisfaction of loans. Prior to the merger with CSFL, we classified former branch sites as held for sale OREO. During the second quarter of 2020 and with the merger with CSFL, the Company elected to reclassify these assets as bank property held for sale and report on a separate line within the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Both OREO and bank property held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value and the fair value was determined on the basis of current valuations obtained principally from independent sources, adjusted for estimated selling costs. At the time of foreclosure or initial possession of collateral, for OREO, any excess of the loan balance over the fair value of the real estate held as collateral is treated as a charge against the ACL. At the time a bank property is no longer in service and is moved to held for sale, any excess of the current book value over fair value is recorded as an expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Subsequent adjustments to this value are described below in the following paragraph.
We report subsequent declines in the fair value of OREO and bank properties held for sale below the new cost basis through valuation adjustments. Significant judgments and complex estimates are required in estimating the fair value of these properties, and the period of time within which such estimates can be considered current is significantly shortened during periods of market volatility. In response to market conditions and other economic factors, Management may utilize liquidation sales as part of its problem asset disposition strategy. As a result of the significant judgments required in estimating fair value and the variables involved in different methods of disposition, the net proceeds realized
from sales transactions could differ significantly from the current valuations used to determine the fair value of these properties. Management reviews the value of these properties periodically and adjusts the values as appropriate. Revenue and expenses from OREO operations as well as gains or losses on sales and any subsequent adjustments to the value are recorded as OREO expense and loan related expense, a component of non-interest expense.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the sum of the estimated fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less the estimated fair value of the liabilities assumed in a business combination. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the balance of goodwill was $1.6 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively. Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset’s fair value.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment for all entities by requiring impairment charges to be based on Step 1 of the previous accounting guidance’s two-step impairment test under ASC Topic 350. Under the new guidance, if a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an entity will record an impairment charge based on that difference. The impairment charge will be limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The new standard eliminates the requirement to calculate a goodwill impairment charge using Step 2 which involved calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which the first step indicated impairment. The standard does not change the guidance on completing Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test. An entity will still be able to perform today’s optional qualitative goodwill impairment assessment before determining whether to proceed to the quantitative step of determining whether the reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds it fair value. This guidance was effective for the Company as of January 1, 2020.
We evaluated the carrying value of goodwill as of April 30, 2020, our annual test date, considering the effects of COVID-19 and determined that no impairment charge was necessary. Our stock price has historically traded above its book value. However, during the first quarter of 2020, our stock price fell below book value and remained below book value until November, 2020. This drop in stock price was mainly in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected stock prices of companies in almost all industries. The lowest trading price for our stock during 2020 was $40.42, which was below book value of $65.49. However, our stock price closed on December 31, 2020 at $72.30, which is above the book value. The Company completed its annual valuation of the carrying value of goodwill as of April 30, 2020, taking into account the Company’s drop in stock price in 2020, and the effect that the COVID-19 pandemic has had and continues to have on the U.S. economy and the economies of the markets in which we operate. Along with its internal analysis, the Company received a limited independent third-party valuation of its goodwill, and based upon the valuation and our analysis, we determined that no impairment charge was necessary at this time. We will continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition. If the COVID-19 pandemic continues and the economy continues to deteriorate and our stock price falls below current levels, we will have to reevaluate the impact on our financial condition and potential impairment of goodwill.
Core deposit intangibles, client list intangibles, and noncompetition (“noncompete”) intangibles consist primarily of amortizing assets established during the acquisition of other banks. This includes whole bank acquisitions and the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities from other financial institutions. Core deposit intangibles represent the estimated value of long-term deposit relationships acquired in these transactions. Client list intangibles represent the value of long-term client relationships for the correspondent banking and wealth and trust management business. Noncompete intangibles represent the value of key personnel relative to various competitive factors such as ability to compete, willingness or likelihood to compete, and feasibility based upon the competitive environment, and what the Bank could lose from competition. These costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives, such as deposit accounts in the case of core deposit intangible, on a method that we believe reasonably approximates the anticipated benefit stream from this intangible. The estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed for reasonableness.
Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets
Income taxes are provided for the tax effects of the transactions reported in our consolidated financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related to differences between the tax basis and accounting basis of certain assets and liabilities, including available-for-sale securities, ACL, write downs of OREO
properties, accumulated depreciation, net operating loss carry forwards, accretion income, deferred compensation, intangible assets, mortgage servicing rights, and post-retirement benefits. The deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. A valuation allowance is recorded in situations where it is “more likely than not” that a deferred tax asset is not realizable. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes. The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. Additionally, income tax returns are filed by the Company or its subsidiaries in the states of Alabama, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, New York, New York City and Virginia. We evaluate the need for income tax reserves related to uncertain income tax positions but had no material reserves at December 31, 2020 or 2019.

Results of Operations
Consolidated net income available to common shareholders decreased by $65.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease reflects an increase in provision for credit losses and an increase in noninterest expense. Partially offsetting these negative effects on net income was an increase in interest income, a decrease in interest expense, an increase in noninterest income and a decrease in the provision for income taxes. Below are key highlights of our results of operations during 2020:
● Consolidated net income available to common shareholders decreased 35.3% to $120.6 million in 2020 compared to $186.5 million in 2019, and decreased $58.2 million or 32.6%, from $178.9 million in 2018.
● Basic earnings per common share decreased 59.3% to $2.20 in 2020, from $5.40 in 2019 and decreased 55.1% from $4.90 in 2018.
● Diluted earnings per common share decreased 59.1% to $2.19 in 2020, from $5.36 in 2019, and decreased 54.9% from $4.86 in 2018.
● Book value per common share was $65.49 at the end of 2020, a decrease from $70.32 at the end of 2019 and from $66.04 at the end of 2018. The merger with CSFL was the primary reason for an increase in total equity of $2.27 billion as of December 31, 2020 compared to as of December 31, 2019. The total intangible assets, including goodwill as of December 31, 2020, also due to the merger with CSFL, increased by $663.8 million compared to the balance as of December 31, 2019. These changes resulted the intangible assets as a percentage of total equity to decrease to 37.1% as of December 31, 2020 from 44.1% as of December 31, 2019. In addition, the decrease in 2020 was the result of the percentage increase of 110.3% in the common shares outstanding, mainly due to the merger with CSFL, being greater than the percentage increase of 95.9% in total equity, also mainly due to the merger. The equity was also negatively affected by the payment of dividends on common stock, the repurchase of 320,000 shares on the open market and the reduction in equity from the adoption of ASU 2016-13 during 2020. The increase in 2019 was the result of the increase in shareholders’ equity from net income and the increase in accumulated other comprehensive income along with the decline in common shares outstanding due to our repurchase of 2,165,000 shares during 2019, partially offset by the reduction in equity from our share repurchases and dividends paid on our common stock.
● Return on average assets was 0.42% in 2020, a decrease from 1.21% in 2019 and 1.23% in 2018. The decrease in 2020 compared to 2019, was driven by the increase in total average assets of 86.4%, or $13.3 billion, to $28.8 billion in 2020, as well as a decline in net income of 35.3%, or $65.9 million, to $120.6 million in 2020. The increase in average assets was mainly related the merger with CSFL in the second quarter of 2020 while the decline in net income was mainly due to the Day 1 provision for credit losses and expenses related to the merger with CSFL. The decrease in 2019 compared to 2018, was driven by the increase in total average assets of 6.1%, or $887.4 million, to $15.4 billion in 2019, while net income rose only 4.3%, or $7.6 million, to $186.5 million in 2019.
● Return on average common shareholders’ equity decreased to 3.35% in 2020, compared to 7.89% in 2019, and 7.63% in 2018. The decrease in 2020 compared to 2019, was driven by both an increase in average common shareholders’ equity of 52.5%, or $1.2 billion and a decline in net income of 35.3%, or $65.9 million, in 2020. The increase in average equity was due to the equity issued in the merger with CSFL in the second quarter of 2020 and the decline in net income was mainly due to the Day 1 provision for credit losses and expenses related to the merger with CSFL. The increase in 2019 compared to 2018, was driven by an increase in net income of 4.3%, or $7.6 million, in 2019, compared to a smaller percentage increase in average common shareholders’ equity of 0.9% or $20.0 million, in 2019.
● Our dividend payout ratio was 81.45% for 2020 compared with 30.94% in 2019 and 28.27% in 2018. The increase in the dividend payout ratio in 2020 compared to 2019, was due to the increase in dividends paid of 70.3%, or $40.6 million as well as the decline in net income available to common shareholders which decreased 35.3%. The increase in the dividends paid was due the increase in outstanding shares from the merger with CSFL and the decline in net income was mainly due to the Day 1 provision for credit losses and expenses related to the merger with CSFL. The increase in the dividend payout ratio in 2019 compared to 2018, was due to the percentage increase in dividends paid of 14.1%, or $7.1 million, being higher than the percentage increase in net income available to common shareholders which increased 4.3%.
● Our common equity to assets ratio decreased to 12.30% in 2020, compared with 14.90% in 2019 and 16.12% in 2018. The decrease in 2020, compared to 2019, was the result of the percentage increase in total assets of 137.4% being greater than the percentage increase in shareholders’ equity of 95.9%. The decrease in 2019, compared to 2018, was the result of the percentage increase in total assets of 8.5% being greater than the percentage increase in shareholders’ equity of 0.3%.
Net Interest Income
Net interest income is the largest component of our net income. Net interest income is the difference between income earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is determined by the yields earned on interest-earning assets, rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, the relative balances of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the degree of mismatch, and the maturity and repricing characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets represents our net interest margin.
The Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee’s target for federal funds was gradually increased to a range of 2.25% to 2.50% for the year ended December 31, 2018. During 2019, the federal funds target rate remained at the 2.25% to 2.50% range until July 2019 when the Federal Reserve began to drop the federal funds target rate. In the last half of 2019, the Federal Reserve dropped the federal funds target rate 75 bps to the range of 1.50% to 1.75% at December 31, 2019. The Federal Reserve then dropped the federal funds target rate 150 bps to a range of 0.00% to 0.25% in March 2020 in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. This drop in interest rates in 2019 and 2020 affected both our net interest income and net interest margin. The yield on our non-acquired loan portfolio decreased 38 bps in 2020 from 2019 after increasing 19 bps in 2019 from 2018. The yield on all interest-earning assets declined in 2020 compared to 2019 by 83 bps. This has had an overall negative effect on our net interest income and net interest margin in 2020.
We have also decreased the rates paid on most of our deposit products in 2020 as interest rates have decreased. As a result, the cost of interest-bearing deposits decreased 40 bps in 2020 after increasing 22 bps in 2019. The overall cost on all interest-bearing liabilities declined in 2020 compared to 2019 by 41 bps. The decrease in the rate/cost of interest-bearing liabilities has had a positive effect on our net interest income and net interest margin for 2020, however, the negative effect on the yield on interest earning assets has been greater.
2020 compared to 2019
Net interest income and net interest margin highlighted for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019:
● Our net interest income increased by $322.2 million, or 63.9%, to $826.5 million during 2020, compared to 2019, as interest income increased $319.2 million and interest expense declined $3.0 million.
● Our interest income increased by $319.2 million with acquired loan interest income increasing by $258.8 million because of higher average balances of acquired loans of $6.1 billion, higher non-acquired loan interest income of $51.0 million due to a higher average balance of $2.1 billion, higher investment
securities interest income of $8.5 million because of higher average balances of $1.2 billion and higher interest income of $6.6 million on loans held for sale due to higher average balances of $250.4 million. These increases in interest income were partially offset by a $5.7 million decline in federal funds sold and repurchase agreements interest income as the yield declined by 191 bps, offsetting the effects of the average balance increasing by $2.4 billion. The effects from the increases in average balance of interest-earning assets have outweighed the effects of the declines in average yields in 2020.
● Average interest-earning assets increased $12.0 billion, or 89.8%, to $25.5 billion in 2020, compared to 2019 mainly due to the merger with CSFL. The average balance of our acquired loans portfolio increased by $6.1 billion as the Company acquired $13.0 billion in loans from the merger with CSFL in June 2020. The average balance of our non-acquired loan portfolio increased $2.1 billion because of organic growth. In addition, the average balance of federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell and interest-bearing deposits increased $2.4 billion and the average balance of investment securities increased $1.2 billion, as we acquired $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $1.2 billion in investment securities in the merger with CSFL. The increase in the average balance of loans held for sale was due to both the increase in volume from the merger with CSFL along with the decrease in interest rates in 2020.
● Overall, our yield on interest-earning assets in 2020 decreased 83 bps from 2019, due to a falling interest rate environment as the Federal Reserve dropped the federal funds target rate by 75 bps from July 2019 to October 2019 and then dropped the federal funds target rate 150 bps to a range of 0.00% to 0.25% in March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The yield on the non-acquired loan portfolio declined 38 bps, on the acquired loan portfolio of 147 bps, on the investment securities by 81 bps, on federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell and interest-bearing deposits of 191 bps and loans held for sale by 97 bps.
● Our interest expense decreased by of $3.0 million in 2020 compared to 2019 with interest expense on interest-bearing deposits declining $10.5 million because of a lower average cost of 40 bps and with interest expense on federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements declining $677,000 because of a lower average cost of 58 bps. These declines in interest expense were partially offset by an increase interest expense from borrowings of $8.2 million because of a higher average balance of $362.7 million, mainly due to the assumption of borrowings from the merger with CSFL. The effects from the declines in average cost of interest-bearing liabilities have outweighed the effects of the increases in average balance in 2020.
● Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $7.5 billion, or 77.9%, to $17.1 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 mainly due to the merger with CSFL. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased $6.8 billion as the Company acquired $10.3 billion in interest-bearing deposits from the merger with CSFL in June 2020. The average balance of federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements increased $270.9 million as the Company acquired $401.5 million in federal funds purchased and repurchase agreement from the merger with CSFL. The average balance of borrowings increased $362.7 million as the Company assumed $271.5 million in borrowings from the merger with CSFL along with the average balance of FHLB Advances held during 2020 being higher by $175.8 million in 2020 compared to 2019.
● The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities in 2020 compared to 2019 decreased 41 bps. This decrease occurred in all categories of funding and was due to the falling interest rate environment in the last half of 2019 and in 2020. The average cost on interest bearing deposits declined 40 bps, federal funds purchased and repurchase agreement declined 58 bps and borrowing declined 18 bps. The decline in the average cost of borrowing due to the decline in interest rates was partially offset by the higher average cost on the subordinated debentures assumed in the merger with CSFL in the second quarter of 2020 along with the rising costs of the cash flow hedges on $700 million of FHLB advances held during most of 2020. The $700 million in FHLB advances and the cash flow hedges tied to these advances were paid-off and terminated in the fourth quarter of 2020.
● Both the non-tax equivalent and the tax equivalent net interest margin decreased by 51 bps 2020 compared to 2019 due to the decline in the yield on interest earning assets of 83 bps, which was only partially offset by the lower cost of interest-bearing liabilities of 41 bps. Our interest-earning assets have repriced more quickly than our interest-bearing liabilities as rates have fallen in the last half of 2019 and in 2020 causing the net interest margin to decline.
2019 compared to 2018
Net interest income and net interest margin highlighted for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018:
● Our net interest income decreased by $8.9 million, or 1.7%, to $504.3 million during 2019, compared to 2018, as increases in interest income were more than offset by increases in interest expense.
● Our interest income increased $23.6 million in 2019, primarily because of a $73.7 million increase in interest income on non-acquired loans, a $4.4 million increase in interest income from investment securities and a $5.9 million increase in interest income on federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell and interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a $60.9 million decrease in interest income on acquired loans. The increase in interest income was due primarily to both higher average balances on interest-earning assets (other than acquired loans) and higher yields on non-acquired loans and investment securities, as follows:
◾ Average interest-earning assets increased $811.9 million, or 6.4%, to $13.4 billion in 2019, compared to 2018. The average balance of our non-acquired loan portfolio increased $1.4 billion because of organic growth. In addition, the average balance of federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell and interest-bearing deposits increased $286.3 million and the average balance of investment securities increased $198.1 million, as we had more funds to invest as a result of growth in total deposits and other borrowings. These increases were partially offset by a $1.0 billion decrease in the average balance of our acquired loan portfolio.
◾ The average yield on non-acquired loans increased 19 bps in 2019, compared to 2018, while the average yield on investment securities increased 11 bps, each due to the higher rate environment for most of 2019, compared to 2018, as the Federal Reserve increased the federal funds target rate 100 bps from December 2017 to December 31, 2018.
● Overall, our yield on interest-earning assets in 2019 decreased ten bps from 2018, due to a change in asset mix, as the average balance of acquired loans (our highest yielding asset at 6.37%) declined $1.0 billion and the average balance of federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell and interest-bearing deposits (our lowest yielding asset at 2.06%) increased $286.3 million, which more than offset the increased average yields and balances on our non-acquired loan portfolio and investment securities in 2019 (discussed above). Our loan portfolio continues to remix with 81% of the portfolio comprised of non-acquired loans and 19% comprised of acquired loans at December 31, 2019, compared to 72% and 28%, respectively, on December 31, 2018. The decrease in the acquired loan portfolio as a percentage of the total loan portfolio in 2019 was due to continued payoffs, charge-offs, transfers to OREO, and renewals of acquired loans that are moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio.
● Our interest expense increased $32.6 million in 2019, primarily because of a $20.5 million increase in deposit interest expense and an $11.8 million increase in other borrowing interest expense. These increases were due primarily to higher average balances of $174.2 million in interest-bearing deposits and higher average balances of $496.8 million in other borrowings.
● Overall, the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities for 2019 increased 30 bps from 2018, due primarily to a 23-basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing deposits and a $496.8 million increase in the average balance of other borrowings (our highest cost interest-bearing liability at 2.75%). The average cost of deposits increased from 0.54% during 2018 to 0.76% in 2019, due to the higher interest rate environment for most of 2019, compared to 2018, and because of increased competition for deposits in our markets. The increase in the average balance of other borrowing was due to our strategic decision to use a longer term FHLB funding strategy to fund balance sheet growth, resulting in the average balance of FHLB advances increasing $496.4 million in 2019. We have borrowed $700 million in FHLB borrowings since March 2019 to lock in longer term low cost funds.
● Our net interest margin decreased by 31 bps to 3.76% in 2019, compared to 4.07% in 2018. Our net interest margin (taxable equivalent) decreased by 32 bps to 3.77% in 2019, compared to 4.09% in 2018. These decreases were due mainly to the increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities of 30 bps, the decline in the average balance of acquired loans of $1.0 billion (our highest yielding asset), the increase in the average balance of federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell and interest-
bearing deposits of $286.3 million (our lowest yielding asset) and the increase in the average balance of other borrowings of $496.8 million (our highest cost interest-bearing liability).
● The yield on interest-earning assets and the cost on interest-bearing liabilities began to decline during the last half of 2019 as the Federal Reserve Bank reduced the federal funds target rate 75 bps during the period. Our interest-earning assets have repriced more quickly than our interest-bearing liabilities as rates have fallen during the last six months of the year causing the net interest margin to decline.

(1) The rate/volume variance for each category has been allocated on the same basis between rate and volumes.
(2) Nonaccrual loans are included in the above analysis.
(3) Tax exempt income is not presented on a taxable-equivalent basis in the above analysis.
Noninterest Income and Expense
Noninterest income provides us with additional revenues that are significant sources of income. In 2020, 2019, and 2018, noninterest income comprised 27.4%, 22.2%, and 22.1%, respectively, of total net interest income and noninterest income. Note that recoveries on acquired loans were no longer recorded through the income statement beginning in 2020 with the adoption of CECL. These recoveries are now recorded through the allowance for credit losses on the balance sheet.
Table 3-Noninterest Income for the Three Years
2020 compared to 2019
Our noninterest income increased 116.7% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019 resulting primarily from the merger with CSFL in June of 2020. In addition, the following was also noted:
● Service charges on deposit accounts and debit, prepaid, ATM and merchant card related income was higher in 2020 by $8.9 million than in 2019, due primarily to the increase in customers and activity through the merger with CSFL during the second quarter of 2020. Service charges on deposit accounts increased $3.7 million which was mainly attributable to an increase in service charge maintenance fees on checking accounts. Debit, prepaid, ATM and merchant card related income increased $5.1 million and was mainly attributable to an increase in debit card income.
● Mortgage banking income increased by $88.6 million, or 504.7%, which was comprised of $85.2 million, or 491.8%, increase from mortgage income in the secondary market, and a $3.5 million, or 1389.3%, increase from mortgage servicing related income, net of the hedge. These increases were directly attributable to the increase in volume resulting from the low interest rate environment brought on by the pandemic and monetary policy of the US Government during 2020 along with the increase in volume due to the merger with CSFL. The increase in mortgage income from the secondary market in 2020 was due to a $93.1 million increase in the gain on sale of mortgage loans net of the cost related to mortgage production. This increase was offset by a $8.0 million decline in the change in fair value of the pipeline, loans held for sale and MBS forward trades. The increase in mortgage servicing related income, net of the hedge in 2020 was due to a $1.9 million increase in servicing fee income along with a $1.6 million increase in the change in fair value of the MSR including decay.
● The merger with CSFL resulted in a significant increase in correspondent banking and capital markets income. The income for 2020 increased by $61.9 million, or 2138.7%. The income from this business includes commissions earned on fixed income security sales, fees from hedging services, loan brokerage fees and consulting fees for services related to these activities.
● Bank owned life insurance (“BOLI”) income is now reported separately (not included in Other Income) in the table above and increased by $5.6 million, or 97.6%, due to the merger with CSFL. Total BOLI increased to $559.4 million at December 31, 2020 as the Company acquired $333.1 million in BOLI through the merger with CSFL in 2020.
● Recoveries on acquired loans declined by $6.8 million, given these are no longer recorded through the income statement, but through the balance sheet as a result of the adoption of CECL.
● Securities gains, net, declined by $2.7 million compared to 2020. During 2019, securities gains were mainly a result of selling VISA Class B shares at a gain of $5.4 million partially offset by net realized losses of $2.7 million on lower yielding securities that were sold during the year.
● Other income increased by $11.9 million primarily from income related to the merger with CSFL. Two of the largest categories were from the servicing and sale of SBA loans, which increased $5.7 million, and from an increase in rental income of $1.4 million.
2019 compared to 2018
Our noninterest income decreased 1.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018 resulting primarily from the following:
● Fees on deposit accounts decreased $6.2 million, or 7.6%, which resulted primarily from decreased bankcard service income of $7.1 million, due to a decline in net debit card income of $8.3 million because of the cap on fees charged related to the Durbin amendment, which became effective for us on July 1, 2018 (The Durbin amendment is a provision of federal law that requires the Federal Reserve to limit a bank’s fees charged to retailers for debit card processing, if the bank has over $10 billion in assets.) These decreases were partially offset by an increase in service charges on deposit accounts of $1.0 million, in ATM income of $413,000 and an increase in credit card sales income of $624,000. The increase in deposit
account service charges was due to a $287,000 increase in NSF and AOP income and a $730,000 increase in monthly maintenance fees on deposit accounts. These increases were due to more customers/accounts and more activity on accounts. The increase in monthly maintenance fees was also due to an increase in commercial treasury services.
● Recoveries on acquired loans declined $2.3 million, or 24.9%. (Recoveries on acquired loans will no longer be recorded through the income statement in 2020 with the adoption of CECL)
● Trust and investment services income decreased by $985,000, or 3.3%, which resulted from a decline in trust asset management fees of $951,000.
These decreases were partially offset by:
● Mortgage banking income increased by $4.0 million, or 29.2%, which was a result of an increase of $8.0 million in secondary market income due to a $4.5 million increase in gains on sale of mortgage loans from a higher volume of sales driven by the lower rate environment in the last half of 2019, due to an increase in the fair value of the mortgage pipeline and loan held for sale of $2.5 million with the lower interest rate environment and due to an increase in income from the mortgage-backed securities forward hedge of $1.0 million. These increases were partially offset by a decline in income from mortgage servicing rights, net of the hedge of $4.0 million which was the result of a decrease in the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights due to the decline in interest rates in the last half of 2019.
● Securities gains, net of $2.7 million during 2019 compared to securities losses, net of $655,000 during 2018. The securities gains in 2019 were mainly a result of us selling VISA Class B shares at a gain of $5.4 million partially offset by net realized losses of $2.7 million on lower yielding securities that were sold during the year.
Reclassification of Interchange network costs
ASU Topic 606 requires us to report network costs associated with debit card and ATM transactions netted against the related fees from such transactions. Previously, such network costs were reported as a component of noninterest expense as Bankcard expense. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, gross interchange and debit card transaction fees totaled $30.2 million, $24.4 million, and $33.0 million, respectively, while the related network costs totaled $16.5 million, $11.9 million, and $12.1 million, respectively. On a net basis, we reported $13.7 million, $12.5 million, and $20.9 million, respectively, as interchange and debit card transactions fees in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income as noninterest income in Fees on Deposit Accounts for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. (See Bankcard Services Income section below for a discussion on the decline in gross interchange fees during 2019 and 2018).
Bankcard Services Income
Banks with over $10 billion in total assets, such as the Bank, are subject to the requirements of the Federal Reserve’s regulations issued pursuant to the Durbin Amendment relating to interchange transaction fees for debit cards. This means, beginning on July 1, 2018, the Bank may receive a maximum permissible interchange fee equal to no more than $0.21 plus 5 bps of the transaction plus a $0.01 fraud adjustment for an interchange transaction fee for many types of debit card transactions. This reduction in the amount of interchange fees we receive for electronic debit interchange began reducing our revenues as of July 1, 2018. As noted above, bankcard income including interchange transaction fees is included in “Fees on deposit accounts”. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we earned approximately $23.7 million and $31.2 million, respectively, in interchange transaction fees for debit cards. We estimate that bankcard service income was reduced by approximately $10.0 million during the third and fourth quarters of 2018 and approximately $20.0 million in 2019 due to the Durbin Amendment’s impact on the amount that we may charge for interchange transaction fees.
Noninterest expense represents the largest expense category for our company. During 2020 and 2019, we continued to emphasize careful controls around our noninterest expense, while also working through the CSFL merger. With that, our expenses in 2020 increased $393.0 million or 97.1% from 2019 and decreased $16.3 million or 3.9% in 2019 from 2018.
Table 4-Noninterest Expense for the Three Years
2020 compared to 2019
Noninterest expense increased $393.0 million, or 97.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019 resulting primarily the merger with CSFL in June 2020. Below includes additional discussion:
● Salary and employee benefits increased by $181.9 million, or 77.5%, as all categories of salaries and benefits expense increased due to the merger with CSFL. With the merger, the number of full-time equivalent employees increased 103.5% from 2,547 at December 31, 2019 to 5,184 at December 31, 2020
● In the fourth quarter of 2020, the company terminated three cash flow hedges (SWAPs) given the current low interest rate environment and expectation of low interest rates in the foreseeable future resulting in a termination cost of $38.8 million.
● Merger and branch consolidation related expense increased $81.4 million, or 1787.2%. This increase was related primarily to the merger with CSFL and includes cost both before and after the merger, including professional fees, severance, contract terminations, branch consolidations, fixed assets written off and other related cost. The costs in 2019 were mainly related to the consolidation of 13 branches during the year.
● Information services expense increased $24.4 million, or 68.7%. This increase was related to the additional cost associated with facilities, employees and systems added through our merger with CSFL. Our number of branches increased by 129, or 83.2% from 155 at December 31, 2019 to 285 at December 31, 2020.
● Occupancy expense increased $28.1 million, or 59.3%. This increase was related to the additional cost associated with facilities added resulting from our merger with CSFL. Our number of branches increased by 129, or 83.2% from 155 at December 31, 2019 to 285 at December 31, 2020.
● Amortization of intangibles increased $13.9 million, or 106.3%. This increase was due to the merger with CSFL which resulted in the Company recording a core deposit intangible asset of $125.9 million and a correspondent banking customer intangible asset of $10.0 million in 2020.
● FDIC assessment and other regulatory charges increased $6.2 million, or 135.7%. This increase was mainly due to the addition of assets and liabilities acquired through our merger with CSFL in the second quarter of 2020.
● In 2019, the Company recorded a pension plan termination expense of $9.5 million related to the termination of our pension plan. This resulted in the recognition of the losses from the pension plan that were being held in accumulated other comprehensive income of $7.7 million and the write-off of the pension plan asset of $1.8 million.
● Other noninterest expense increased by $20.6 million, or 93.2%. This increase was mainly due to a general increase in expenses due to the merger with CSFL including loan expenses, insurance expense, donations, various operational reserves, miscellaneous taxes and miscellaneous operating charge-offs. There was also a $6.5 million increase in passive losses recorded in 2020 related to tax credit partnerships. We added approximately $29 million more in these CRA investments in 2020, of which $13.8 million were acquired through the merger with CSFL. We added approximately $39 million of CRA investments in 2019.
2019 compared to 2018
Noninterest expense decreased $16.3 million, or 3.9% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018 resulting primarily from the following:
● Merger and branch consolidation related expense decreased $25.3 million, or 84.8%. This decrease in costs was related to the higher costs in 2018 associated with the merger with PSC, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the conversion in the second quarter of 2018. The costs in 2019 were mainly related to the consolidation of 13 branches during the year.
● FDIC assessment and other regulatory charges decreased by $3.9 million, or 45.9%. This decrease was mainly due to our receipt of our small bank assessment credit of $2.4 million in 2019 from the FDIC, which was applied to the assessment to be paid in September 2019 ($1.6 million) and December 2019 ($760,000). This decrease was also related to the elimination of the surcharge assessment that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the change in risk related to certain acquired loans, which resulted in lower assessments beginning in the fourth quarter of 2018.
● Occupancy expense decreased by $1.7 million, or 3.5%. This decrease was related to the cost savings related to the merger with PSC and branch consolidations that occurred during 2019. Our number of branches decreased by 13, or 7.7%, from 168 at December 31, 2018 to 155 at December 31, 2019.
● Amortization of intangibles decreased $1.1 million, or 7.9%. This decrease was due to the decline in amortization of core deposit intangibles as time passed from the applicable merger dates.
These decreases were partially offset by:
● Pension plan termination expense of $9.5 million related to the termination of our pension plan which resulted in the recognition of the losses from the pension plan that were being held in accumulated other comprehensive income of $7.7 million and the write-off of the pension plan asset of $1.8 million.
● Other noninterest expense increased by $2.1 million, or 7.2%. This increase was mainly due to a $2.3 million increase in passive losses recorded in 2019 related to low income housing tax credit partnerships. We added approximately $39 million more in these CRA investments in 2019.
● Salaries and employee benefits increased $1.6 million, or 0.7%. This increase was mainly due to an increase in salaries, wages and commission of $4.5 million partially offset by a decline in incentives of $2.4 million and benefits of $429,000. The increase in salaries and wages was mainly due to normal annual raises in 2019 and the increase in commissions was mainly related to the increase in mortgage production with the declining interest rate environment in the last half of 2019. The decline in incentives in 2019 was based upon the measurement against our goals compared to 2018.
● Professional fees increased $1.4 million, or 16.2%. This increase was mainly due to consulting fees related to the implementation of ASU No 2016-13 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses or “CECL” which becomes effective for us on January 1, 2020.
Income Tax Expense
Our effective tax rate decreased to (16.02)% at December 31, 2020, compared to 19.07% at December 31, 2019. The reduced rate is primarily the result of an income tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to the ability to carryback tax losses under the CARES Act. Without the impact of this one-time item, the effective tax rate was 14.24%, which was lower compared to 2019 due to a decrease in pre-tax book income.
Financial Condition
Overview
At December 31, 2020, we had total assets of approximately $37.8 billion, consisting principally of $12.3 billion in non-acquired loans, $9.5 billion in acquired non-credit deteriorated loans, $2.9 billion in acquired credit deteriorated loans, net of $457 million allowance for credit losses and $4.4 billion in investment securities. Our liabilities at December 31, 2020 totaled $33.1 billion, consisting principally of deposits of $30.7 billion, borrowings of $1.2 billion and derivative liabilities of $804.8 million. At December 31, 2020, our shareholders’ equity was $4.6 billion.
At December 31, 2019, we had total assets of approximately $15.9 billion, consisting principally of $9.3 billion in non-acquired loans, $1.8 billion in acquired non-credit impaired loans, $356.8 million in acquired credit impaired loans, net of allowance and $2.0 billion in investment securities. Our liabilities at December 31, 2019 totaled $13.5 billion, consisting principally of deposits of $12.2 billion. At December 31, 2019, our shareholders’ equity was $2.4 billion.
Trading Securities
We have a trading portfolio associated with our Correspondent Bank Division, that was inherited with our CSFL acquisition in June 2020. For this portfolio, realized and unrealized gains and losses are included in trading securities revenue, a component of Correspondent Banking and Capital Market Income in our “Consolidated Statements of Income”. Securities purchased for this portfolio have primarily been municipal securities and are held for short periods of time and totaled $10.7 million at December 31, 2020. This activity was initiated to take advantage of market opportunities, when presented, for short-term revenue gains. See Note 3 in our “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a summary of purchases, sales and revenue recognized for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Investment Securities
We use investment securities, the second largest category of interest-earning assets, to generate interest income through the employment of excess funds, to provide liquidity, to fund loan demand or deposit liquidation, and to pledge as collateral for public funds deposits, repurchase agreements and as collateral for derivative exposure. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, investment securities totaled $4.4 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, average investment securities were $2.9 billion, or 11.4% of average earning assets, compared with $1.7 billion, or 12.8% of average earning assets for the year ended December 31, 2019. The expected average life of the investment portfolio at December 31, 2020 was approximately 4.35 years, compared with 4.69 years at December 31, 2019. See Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the audited consolidated financial statements for our accounting policy on investment securities.
As securities are purchased, they are designated as held-to-maturity or available-for-sale based upon our intent, which incorporates liquidity needs, interest rate expectations, asset/liability management strategies, and capital requirements.
The following table presents the reported values of investment securities for the past five years:
Table 5-Values of Investment Securities
During 2020, our total investment securities increased $2.4 billion, or 121.8%, from December 31, 2019. The merger with CSFL added $1.2 billion of investment securities and our purchases of investment securities totaled $2.4 billion. These were partially offset by maturities, calls and paydowns of investment securities totaling $1.0 billion and sales totaling $100.7 million during 2020. Net amortization of premiums was $22.2 million during 2020. We increased our investment securities strategically with the excess funds from deposit growth in 2020. In the third and fourth quarter of 2020, we also sold certain state and municipal obligations where the overall credit of the issuer was a concern and some lower yielding mortgage-backed securities. The proceeds from the security sales along with additional on balance sheet liquidity were used for security purchases in the third and fourth quarters of 2020. The Company elected to classify some of these securities as held-to-maturity, primarily agency and certain mortgage backed securities.
At December 31, 2020, the unrealized net gain of the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio was $62.6 million, or 1.9%, above its amortized cost basis. Comparable valuations at December 31, 2019 reflected a total available-for-sale investment portfolio fair value that was $15.3 million, or 0.8%, below its amortized cost basis. The increase in fair value in the available-for-sale investment portfolio at December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 was mainly due to the decrease in interest rates during 2020. At December 31, 2020, the unrealized net gain of the held-to-maturity investment securities portfolio was $1.6 million, 0.2%, above its amortized cost basis. At December 31, 2019, the Company had no held-to-maturity securities.
Table 6-Credit Ratings of Investment Securities
* Agency mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”) are guaranteed by the issuing government-sponsored enterprise (“GSE”) as to the timely payments of principal and interest. Except for Government National Mortgage Association securities, which have the full faith and credit backing of the United States Government, the GSE alone is responsible for making payments on this guaranty. While the rating agencies have not rated any of the MBS issued, senior debt securities issued by GSEs are rated consistently as “Triple-A.” Most market participants consider agency MBS as carrying an implied Aaa rating (S&P rating of AA+) because of the guarantees of timely payments and selection criteria of mortgages backing the securities. We do not own any private label mortgage-backed securities. The balances presented under the ratings above reflect the amortized cost of the investment securities.
Held-to-maturity
As described above the Company elected to classify some of its securities purchased during 2020 as held-to-maturity. These are securities that the Company does not intend to sell and expects to hold to maturity. The securities consist of $25.0 million of agency securities and $930.5 million of mortgage-backed securities. The following are highlights of our held-to-maturity portfolio:
● Total held-to-maturity portfolio totaled $955.5 million, representing all 2020 purchases.
● The balance of securities held-to-maturity represented 2.5% of total assets at December 31, 2020.
Available-for-sale
Securities available-for-sale consist mainly of debentures of government-sponsored entities, state and municipal bonds, and mortgage-backed securities. At December 31, 2020, investment securities with both a fair value and amortized cost of $3.3 billion, were classified as available-for-sale. The adjustment for net unrealized gains of $62.6 million between the carrying value of these securities and their amortized cost has been reflected, net of tax, in the consolidated balance sheet as a component of accumulated other comprehensive gain. The following are highlights of our available-for-sale securities:
● Total securities available-for-sale increased $1.4 billion, or 70.3%, from the balance at December 31, 2019. The unrealized gain/loss position on the investment portfolio increased $47.4 million and net amortization of premiums was $21.9 million during 2020. The acquisition of CSFL added $1.2 billion of available-for-sale securities. We purchased $1.3 billion of available-for-sale investment securities in 2020, partially offset by maturities, calls and paydowns totaling $1.0 billion and sales totaling $100.7 million in 2020. The sales in 2020 were mainly related to restructuring our portfolio to fit our investment strategy and risk profile.
● The balance of securities available-for-sale represented 8.8% of total assets at December 31, 2020 and 12.6% of total assets at December 31, 2019.
● Interest income earned on all investment securities in 2020 was $54.6 million, an increase of $8.5 million, or 18.4%, from $46.1 million in 2019. The increase was due to a $1.2 billion increase in average balances which was partially offset by a reduction in the yield on investment securities. The yield on investment securities declined 81 bps during 2020, to 1.88%, primarily a result of repricing the CSFL portfolio at acquisition and lower yields on securities purchased during 2020. In 2020, we used a portion of our excess liquidity from deposit growth and lower loan growth to increase the size of our investment portfolio.
At December 31, 2020, we had 86 investment securities (including both available-for-sale and held-to-maturity) in an unrealized loss position, which totaled $5.3 million. See Note 4-Investment Securities in the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The decrease in the number of securities in a loss position and the relative percentage of loss to portfolio size was primarily a result of the decrease in interest rates during 2020 as both short and long-term interest rates declined during the year.
Management evaluates securities for impairment where there has been a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis of a security to determine whether there is a credit loss associated with the decline in fair value on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation. Credit losses are calculated individually, rather than collectively, using a discounted cash flow method, whereby Management compares the present value of expected cash flows with the amortized cost basis of the security. The credit loss component would be recognized through the provision for credit losses. Consideration is given to (1) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer including looking at default and delinquency rates, (2) the outlook for receiving the contractual cash flows of the investments, (3) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (4) our intent and ability to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value or for a debt security whether it is more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell the debt security prior to recovering its fair value, (5) the anticipated outlook for changes in the general level of interest rates, (6) credit ratings, (7) third party guarantees, and (8) collateral values. In analyzing an issuer’s financial condition, management considers whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, whether
downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, the results of reviews of the issuer’s financial condition, and the issuer’s anticipated ability to pay the contractual cash flows of the investments. The Company performed an analysis that determined that the following securities have a zero expected credit loss: U.S. Treasury Securities, Agency-Backed Securities including securities issued by GNMA, FNMA, FHLB, FFCB and SBA. All of the U.S. Treasury and Agency-Backed Securities have the full faith and credit backing of the United State Government or one of its agencies. Municipal securities and all other securities that do not have a zero expected credit loss are evaluated quarterly to determine whether there is a credit loss associated with a decline in fair value. All debt securities in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2020 continue to perform as scheduled and we do not believe there is a credit loss or a provision for credit losses is necessary.
Also, as part of our evaluation of our intent and ability to hold investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market, we consider our investment strategy, cash flow needs, liquidity position, capital adequacy and interest rate risk position. We do not currently intend to sell the securities within the portfolio and it is not more-likely-than-not we will be required to sell the debt securities. See Note 1-Summary of Significant Account Policies for further discussion.
Other Investments
Our other investment securities consist of non-marketable equity securities that have no readily determinable market value. Accordingly, when evaluating these securities for impairment, management considers the ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than recognizing temporary declines in value. As of December 31, 2020, we determined that there was no impairment on our other investment securities. As of December 31, 2020, other investment securities represented approximately $160.4 million, or 0.42% of total assets and primarily consisted of FRB and FHLB stock which totals $129.8 million and $15.1 million, respectively. There were no gains or losses on the sales of these securities during 2020 or 2019.

(7) The expected average life for the total investment securities portfolio is 4.35 years (not including FHLB and corporate stock with no maturity date).
(8) The available-for-sale securities, in the table above, are reported at fair value; held-to-maturity securities are presented at amortized cost.
Loan Portfolio
Our loan portfolio remains our largest category of interest-earning assets. At December 31, 2020, total loans, excluding held for sale loans, were $24.7 billion, which was an overall increase of $13.3 billion, or 116.8%, from the balance at the end of 2019. Non-acquired loan growth was $3.0 billion, or 32.8% for 2020, which was made up of an 6.8% increase in consumer real estate loans, a 28.9% increase in non-owner occupied real estate loans, a 27.1% increase in commercial owner occupied real estate loans, a 115.1% increase in commercial and industrial loans, a 12.1% increase in other income producing property and a 12.8% increase in consumer non real estate loans. The increases in non-acquired loans were due to organic growth and PPP loans. Total acquired loans increased by $10.3 billion. The increase in acquired loans was due to the addition of $13.0 billion from the merger with CSB during the second quarter of 2020, net of $2.7 billion in principal payments, charge offs, foreclosures and renewals of acquired loans that were moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio.
Acquired loans as a percentage of total loans increased to 50.2% at December 31, 2020 compared to 18.7% at December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, non-acquired loans as a percentage of the overall portfolio were 49.8% compared to 81.3% at December 31, 2019. Average total loans outstanding during 2020 were $19.4 billion, an increase of $8.2 billion, or 73.3%, over the 2019 average of $11.2 billion. (For further discussion of the Company’s acquired loan accounting, see Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 2-Mergers and Acquisitions, Note 5-Loans and Note 6-Allowance for Credit Losses in the consolidated financial statements.)
The following table presents a summary of the loan portfolio by category (excludes loans held for sale):
Table 8-Distribution of Loans by Type
The comparative periods in the below table reflect the loan portfolio prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13. Prior periods were reported with the acquired loans being net of unearned income and of related discounts, which includes the credit discount on the acquired credit impaired loans.
(1) Includes $1.3 billion, $968.4 million, $841.4 million, $830.9 million, and $580.5 million of construction and land development loans at December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
(2) Includes loans on both 1-4 family owner occupied property, as well as 1-4 family investment property.
(3) Includes $503.8 million, $33.6 million, $165.1 million, $403.4 million, and $10.1 million of construction and land development loans at December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
(4) Includes $115.1 million, $15.3 million, $30.9 million, $43.6 million, and $39.9 million of construction and land development loans at December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
Real estate mortgage loans continue to comprise the largest segment of our loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019:
● Non-acquired loans were $12.3 billion, or 49.8% of total loans and acquired loans were $12.4 billion, or 50.2% of total loans at December 31, 2020. This compared to non-acquired loans of $9.3 billion, or 81.3% and acquired loans of $2.1 billion, or 18.7% at December 31, 2019. The increase in non-acquired loans of $3.0 billion was due to organic growth and to the addition of $958.0 million in PPP loans in 2020 which are included in the commercial loan category. Total acquired loans increased by $10.3 billion, as compared to the same period in 2019. The increase in acquired loans was due to the addition of $13.0 billion in loans from the merger with CSFL during the second quarter of 2020, net of $2.7 billion in principal payments, charge offs, foreclosures and renewals of acquired loans that were moved to our non-acquired loan portfolio.
● Non-acquired loans secured by non-owner occupied and consumer real estate were $6.4 billion and comprised 25.9% of the total loan portfolio. This was an increase of $980.1 million, or 18.1%, over December 31, 2019. Acquired loans secured by non-owner occupied and consumer real estate were $6.9 billion and comprised 27.9% of the total loan portfolio. This was an increase of $5.5 billion, or 395.1%, over December 31, 2019 due to the merger with CSFL. Between both the non-acquired and acquired portfolios, 53.8% of loans were non-owner occupied and consumer real estate loans.
● Of these non-acquired real estate loans, $3.6 billion, or 14.5% of the loan portfolio were secured by non-owner occupied real estate. Loans secured by consumer real estate were $2.8 billion, or 11.4% of the total loan portfolio. This compared to loans secured by non-owner occupied real estate of $2.8 billion, or 24.4% and to loans secured by consumer real estate of $2.6 billion, or 23.2% at December 31, 2019.
● Of these acquired real estate loans, $4.2 billion, or 17.2% of the loan portfolio were secured by non-owner occupied real estate at December 31, 2020. Loans secured by consumer real estate were $2.6. billion, or 10.7% of the total loan portfolio. This compared to acquired loans secured by non-owner occupied real estate of $561.7 million, or 4.9% and to loans secured by consumer real estate of $827.5 million, or 7.3% at December 31, 2019.
● Non-acquired and acquired commercial owner-occupied real estate loans were $4.8 billion, or 19.6% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2020 compared to $2.2 billion, or 19.0% at December 31, 2019. Non-acquired commercial owner-occupied real estate loans totaled $2.3 billion and increased $482.6 million through organic growth and acquired commercial owner-occupied real estate loans totaled $2.6 billion and increased $2.2 billion from December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2020 through the merger with CSFL.
● Non-acquired and acquired commercial loans were $5.0 billion, or 20.5% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2020 compared to $1.4 billion, or 12.2% at December 31, 2019. Non-acquired commercial loans totaled $2.8 billion and increased $1.5 billion and acquired commercial loans totaled $2.3 billion and increased $2.2 billion from December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2020. The non-acquired commercial loan growth included $958.0 million of PPP loans originated in 2020. The growth in the acquired commercial loans includes $975.5 million of PPP acquired in the CSFL merger in the second quarter of 2020.
Total loan interest income, excluding interest income on held for sale loans, was $842.9 million in 2020, an increase of $309.9 million, or 58.1%, over $533.0 million in 2019, due to a $2.1 billion increase in the average balance of our non-acquired loan portfolio and a $6.1 billion increase in the average balance of our acquired loan portfolio. The
growth in the non-acquired loan portfolio average balance was due to normal organic growth and PPP loans. The growth in the acquired loan portfolio was due to the merger with CSFL. The effects on interest income from the increases in average portfolio balances were offset by a 38 bps decrease in the yield on the non-acquired portfolio and a 148 bps decrease in the yield on the acquired portfolio. The yield on the non-acquired loan portfolio decreased from 4.29% in 2019 to 3.91% in 2020 while the yield on acquired loan portfolio decreased from 6.37% to 4.90% in 2020. The decline in the yield on the non-acquired loan portfolio and on the acquired loan portfolio was mainly due to the falling interest rate environment as the Federal Reserve dropped the federal funds target rate 150 bps to a range of 0.00% to 0.25% in March 2020 in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Total construction and land development loans were $1.9 billion at December 31, 2020 compared to $1.0 billion at December 31, 2019. Non-acquired construction and land development loans increased $311.7 million in 2020 from $968.4 million at December 31, 2019 to $1.3 billion. Acquired construction and land development loans increased $570.1 million in 2020 from $48.9 million at December 31, 2019 to $619.0 million. During 2020, we have seen our construction and land development loan portfolio increase by $881.8 million of which a majority of this increase was due to the loans acquired from the CSFL merger. Construction and land development loans are more susceptible to a risk of loss during a downturn in the business cycle.
Consumer real estate loans were comprised of $4.1 billion in consumer owner occupied loans and $1.3 billion in home equity line loans at December 31, 2020. This compares to $2.7 billion in consumer owner occupied loans and $758.0 million in home equity lines loans at December 31, 2019. Non-acquired loans secured by consumer real estate were comprised of $2.2 billion in consumer owner occupied loans and $609.2 million in home equity loans at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2019, we had $2.1 billion in consumer owner occupied loans and $518.6 million in home equity loans in the non-acquired loan portfolio. Acquired loans secured by consumer real estate comprised of $1.9 billion in consumer owner occupied loans and $727.5 billion in home equity loans at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2019, we had $588.1 million in consumer owner occupied loans and $239.4 million in home equity loans in the acquired loan portfolio. During 2020, we have seen the consumer real estate loan portfolio increase by $2.0 billion from 2019 with the acquired consumer real estate loans comprising $1.8 million of that increase through the merger with CSFL.
The table below shows the contractual maturity of the non-acquired loan portfolio at December 31, 2020.
Table 9-Maturity Distribution of Non-acquired Loans
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, our non-acquired non owner-occupied real estate loans, with fixed rates and maturities greater than a year, had a balance of $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. The adjustable interest rate loan balance in this loan category was $1.7 billion and $963.4 million, respectively. The non-acquired commercial owner-occupied loans, with fixed rates and maturities greater than a year, had a balance of $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. The adjustable interest rate loan balance in this loan category was $384.3 million and $157.0 million, respectively. The non-acquired commercial and industrial loan category, with fixed rates and maturities greater than a year, had a balance of $2.0 billion and $875.3 million, respectively. The adjustable interest rate loan balance in this loan category was $254.1 million and $102.6 million, respectively.

At December 31, 2020 and 2019, our acquired non-purchased credit deteriorated non owner-occupied real estate loans, with fixed rates and maturities greater than a year, had a balance of $970.3 million and $185.2 million, respectively. The adjustable interest rate loan balance in this loan category was $1.7 billion and $223.1 million, respectively. The acquired non-purchased credit deteriorated commercial owner occupied loans, with fixed rates and maturities greater than a year, had a balance of $684.0 million and $167.3 million, respectively. The adjustable interest rate loan balance in this loan category was $1.0 billion and $92.5 million, respectively. The acquired non-purchased credit deteriorated commercial and industrial loan category, with fixed rates and maturities greater than a year, had a balance of $768.6 million and $60.4 million, respectively. The adjustable interest rate loan balance in this loan category was $128.4 million and $12.2 million, respectively.
The table below shows the contractual maturity of the acquired credit impaired loan portfolio at December 31, 2020.
Table 11-Maturity Distribution of Acquired Purchased Credit Deteriorated Loans
At December 31, 2020 and 2019 our acquired purchased credit deteriorated non-owner occupied real estate loans, with fixed rates and maturities greater than a year, had a balance of $408.7 million and $54.4 million, respectively. The adjustable interest rate loan balance in this loan category was $730.6 million and $1.3 million, respectively. The acquired purchased credit deteriorated commercial owner-occupied loans, with fixed rates and maturities greater than a year, had a balance of $325.0 million and $43.3 million, respectively. The adjustable interest rate loan balance in this loan category was $359.8 million and $5.3 million, respectively. The acquired purchased credit deteriorated commercial and industrial loan category, with fixed rates and maturities greater than a year, had a balance of $98.0 million and $1.6 million, respectively. The adjustable interest rate loan balance in this loan category was $45.1 million and $603,000, respectively.
Troubled Debt Restructurings (“TDRs”)
We designate expected credit losses over the contractual term of a loan. When determining the contractual term, the Company considers expected prepayments but is precluded from considering expected extensions, renewals, or modifications, unless the Company reasonably expects it will execute a troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”) with a borrower. In the event of a reasonably-expected TDR, the Company factors the reasonably-expected TDR into the current expected credit losses estimate. For consumer loans, the point at which a TDR is reasonably expected is when
the Company approves the borrower’s application for a modification (i.e., the borrower qualifies for the TDR) or when the Credit Administration department approves loan concessions on substandard loans. For commercial loans, the point at which a TDR is reasonably expected is when the Company approves the loan for modification or when the Credit Administration department approves loan concessions on substandard loans. The Company uses a discounted cash flow methodology for a TDR to calculate the effect of the concession provided to the borrower within the ACL.
A restructuring that results in only a delay in payments that is insignificant is not considered an economic concession. In accordance with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, also known as the CARES Act, the Company implemented loan modification programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in order to provide borrowers with flexibility with respect to repayment terms. The Company’s payment relief assistance includes forbearance, deferrals, extension and re-aging programs, along with certain other modification strategies. The Company elected the accounting policy in the CARES Act to not apply TDR accounting to loans modified for borrowers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic if the concession meets the criteria as defined under the CARES Act. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, total TDRs were $19.7 million and $13.5 million, respectively, of which $14.6 million were accruing restructured loans at December 31, 2020, compared to $10.9 million at December 31, 2019. We do not have significant commitments to lend additional funds to these borrowers whose loans have been modified.
The level of risk elements in the loan portfolio, OREO and other nonperforming assets for the past five years is shown below:
Table 12-Nonperforming Assets
(1) Includes nonaccrual loans that are purchase credit deteriorated (PCD loans). In prior periods, these loans, which were called acquired credit impaired (“ACI”) loans were excluded from nonperforming assets. The adoption of CECL resulted in the discontinuation of the pool-level accounting for ACI loans and replaced it with loan-level evaluation for nonaccrual status. The Company’s nonperforming loans increased by $21.0 million in the first quarter of 2020 from these loans. The Company has not assumed or taken on any additional risk relative to these assets.
(2) Periods prior to the adoption of CECL exclude the acquired credit impaired loans that are contractually past due 90 days or more totaling $9.2 million, $16.8 million, $16.7 million, and $14.8 million as of December 31, 2019, December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, including the valuation discount.
(3) Excludes certain property no longer intended for bank use.
(4) Consists of non-real estate foreclosed assets, such as repossessed vehicles.
(5) Loan data excludes mortgage loans held for sale.
(6) For purposes of this calculation, total assets include all assets (both acquired and non-acquired).
(7) Excludes non-acquired bank premises held for sale of $2.2 million, $2.7 million, $2.5 million, $1.5 million, and $1.2 million as of December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019, December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, respectively, that is now separately disclosed on the balance sheet.
(8) Excludes acquired bank premises held for sale of $33.8 million, $2.7 million, $2.7 million, $3.4 million and $3.2 million as of December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019, December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, respectively, that is now separately disclosed on the balance sheet.
Total non-acquired nonperforming loans were $29.2 million, or 0.24% of total non-acquired loans, an increase of approximately $6.4 million, or 27.9%, from December 31, 2019. The increase in nonperforming loans was driven primarily by an increase in accruing loans past due 90 days or more of $9.1 million, an increase in restructured nonaccrual loans of $1.0 million, offset by a decline in primarily commercial nonaccrual loans of $3.7 million. The accruing loans past due 90 days or more are deemed to be low risk and almost all of these loans were brought current in January 2021. Acquired nonperforming loans were $77.7 million, or 0.63% of total acquired loans, an increase of $66.6 million, or 598.8%, from December 31, 2019. The increase in acquired nonperforming loans was mainly driven by the addition of the nonperforming loans related to the merger with CSFL in the second quarter of 2020, as well as the addition of $21.0 million in the first quarter of 2020, formerly accounted for as credit impaired loans (with ASU 2016-13 are now considered PCD loans). The Company has not assumed or taken on any additional risk relative to these assets.
Non-acquired nonperforming loans increased by approximately $6.7 million during the fourth quarter of 2020 from the level at September 30, 2020. The increase was mainly due to an increase in accruing loans past due 90 days or more of $8.9 million, offset by a decline in primarily commercial nonaccrual loans of $2.2 million. The non-acquired accruing loans past due 90 days or more are deemed to be low risk and almost all of these loans were brought current in January 2021. Acquired nonperforming loans decreased by approximately $12.3 million during the fourth quarter of 2020 from the level at September 30, 2020. The decrease was mainly due to $14.8 million returning to accrual status or paying off, $1.5 million moving to OREO, offset by new non-accruing loans of $4.0 million. The top ten nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2020 totaled $12.9 million and consisted of three loans located in South Carolina, one in North Carolina, three in the Georgia, one in Alabama and two in Florida. These loans comprise 14.1% of total nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2020, with the majority being real estate collateral dependent. We do not currently hold a specific reserve against any of these ten loans due to carrying balance being below current collateral value.
At December 31, 2020, non-acquired OREO decreased by $323,000 from the balance at December 31, 2019 to $552,000. At December 31, 2020, non-acquired OREO consisted of 7 properties with an average value of $79,000, an decrease of $131,000 in the average value from December 31, 2019, when we had 17 properties. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we added one property with an aggregate value of $29,000 into non-acquired OREO, and we sold two properties with a basis of $62,000 in that same quarter. We recorded a net gain of $2,000 on the properties sold during the quarter. Our non-acquired OREO balance of $552,000 at December 31, 2020 is comprised of 3% in the Coastal Region (Beaufort to Myrtle Beach, 6% in the Charlotte region, 78% in the Low Country region (Orangeburg), 4% in the Central region (Columbia), 4% in the North Georgia region and 5% in the Upstate region (Greenville and Spartanburg).
At December 31, 2020, acquired OREO increased by $5.7 million from the balance at December 31, 2019 to $11.4 million. At December 31, 2020, non-acquired OREO consisted of 35 properties with an average value of $325,000, an increase of $125,000 from December 31, 2019, when we had 42 properties. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we added six properties with an aggregate value of $1.3 million into acquired OREO, and we sold 18 properties with a basis of $2.6 million in that same quarter. We recorded a net gain of $784,000 on the properties sold during the quarter. Our general policy is to obtain updated OREO valuations at least annually. OREO valuations include appraisals or broker opinions, (See Other Real Estate Owned (“OREO”) under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion on our OREO policies.)
Potential Problem Loans
Potential problem loans, which are not included in nonperforming loans, related to non-acquired loans were approximately $5.9 million, or 0.05% of total non-acquired loans outstanding at December 31, 2020, compared to $7.5 million, or 0.08% of total non-acquired loans outstanding at December 31, 2019. Potential problem loans related to acquired loans totaled $13.4 million, or 0.11%, of total acquired loans at December 31, 2020. In 2019, only potential
problem non-credit impaired acquired loans were reported, which were $4.4 million, or 0.25% of total acquired non-credit impaired loans at December 31, 2019. All potential problem loans represent those loans where information about possible credit problems of the borrowers has caused management to have concern about the borrower’s ability to comply with present repayment terms.
Provision for Credit Losses
As stated previously, the Company adopted ASC Topic 326 on January 1, 2020. The ACL reflects Management’s estimate of losses that will result from the inability of our borrowers to make required loan payments. The Company established the incremental increase in the ACL at adoption date through equity and subsequent adjustments through a provision for credit losses charged to earnings. The Company records loans charged off against the ACL and subsequent recoveries, if any, increase the ACL when they are recognized.
Management uses systematic methodologies to determine its ACL for loans held for investment and certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures. The ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loan portfolio. Management considers the effects of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the loan portfolio. The Company’s estimate of its ACL involves a high degree of judgment; therefore, Management’s process for determining expected credit losses may result in a range of expected credit losses. The Company’s ACL recorded in the balance sheet reflects Management’s best estimate within the range of expected credit losses. The Company recognizes in net income the amount needed to adjust the ACL for Management’s current estimate of expected credit losses. The Company’s ACL is calculated using collectively evaluated and individually evaluated loans.
The Company merged with CSFL on June 7, 2020. For the second quarter ended June 30, 2020, given the proximity of the merger date to the quarter end, Management collectively evaluated loans from each legacy loan portfolio utilizing pre-existing methodologies implemented prior to the merger and aggregated the result. During the third quarter of 2020, Management consolidated the two methodologies into one to arrive at the ACL recorded at September 30, 2020 for both the ACL related to the loan portfolio and the reserve related to the unfunded commitments (off-balance-sheet credit exposures). The new methodology for unfunded commitments utilizes a funding rate, as opposed to a utilization rate which was a method applied to the South State legacy portfolio prior to the third quarter, to determine the reserve for each respective segment of unfunded commitments. This new method, along with the change in mix of unfunded commitments, resulted in an increase in the reserve for legacy South State Bank unfunded commitments during the third quarter of 2020.
The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Loans with similar risk characteristics are grouped into homogenous segments, or pools, for analysis. The Discounted Cash Flow (“DCF”) method is utilized for each loan in a pool, and the results are aggregated at the pool level. A periodic tendency to default and absolute loss given default are applied to a projective model of the loan’s cash flow while considering prepayment and principal curtailment effects. The analysis produces expected cash flows for each instrument in the pool by pairing loan-level term information (e.g., maturity date, payment amount, interest rate, etc.) with top-down pool assumptions (e.g., default rates and prepayment speeds). The Company has identified the following portfolio segments: Owner-Occupied Commercial Real Estate, Non Owner-Occupied Commercial Real Estate, Multifamily, Municipal, Commercial and Industrial, Commercial Construction and Land Development, Residential Construction, Residential Senior Mortgage, Residential Junior Mortgage, Revolving Mortgage, and Consumer and Other.
In determining the proper level of the ACL, Management has determined that the loss experience of the Bank provides the best basis for its assessment of expected credit losses. It therefore utilized its own historical credit loss experience by each loan segment over an economic cycle, while excluding loss experience from certain acquired institutions (i.e., failed banks). For most of the segment models for collectively evaluated loans, the Company incorporated two or more macroeconomic drivers using a statistical regression modeling methodology.
Management considers forward-looking information in estimating expected credit losses. The Company subscribes to a third-party service which provides a quarterly macroeconomic baseline outlook and alternative scenarios for the United States economy. The baseline, along with the evaluation of alternative scenarios, is used by Management to determine the best estimate within the range of expected credit losses. The baseline forecast incorporates a 50% probability of the United States economy performing better than this projection and the same as the probability that it will perform worse. Management has evaluated the appropriateness of the reasonable and supportable forecast scenarios
and has made adjustments as needed. For the contractual term that extends beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company reverts to the long term mean of historical factors within four quarters using a straight-line approach. The Company generally utilizes a four quarter forecast and a four quarter reversion period.
Included in its systematic methodology to determine its ACL, Management considers the need to qualitatively adjust expected credit losses for information not already captured in the loss estimation process. These qualitative adjustments either increase or decrease the quantitative model estimation (i.e., formulaic model results). Each period the Company considers qualitative factors that are relevant within the qualitative framework that includes the following: 1) Lending Policy; 2) Economic conditions not captured in models; 3) Volume and Mix of Loan Portfolio; 4) Past Due Trends; 5) Concentration Risk; 6) External Factors; and 7) Model Limitations.
When a loan no longer shares similar risk characteristics with its segment, the asset is assessed to determine whether it should be included in another pool or should be individually evaluated. During the third quarter of 2020, we consolidated the ACL models and due to the size of the combined company elected to increase the threshold for individually-evaluated loans to all non-accrual loans with a net book balance in excess of $1.0 million. We will monitor the credit environment and make adjustments to this threshold in the future if warranted. Based on the threshold above, consumer financial assets will generally remain in pools unless they meet the dollar threshold. The expected credit losses on individually-evaluated loans will be estimated based on discounted cash flow analysis unless the loan meets the criteria for use of the fair value of collateral, either by virtue of an expected foreclosure or through meeting the definition of collateral-dependent. Financial assets that have been individually evaluated can be returned to a pool for purposes of estimating the expected credit loss insofar as their credit profile improves and that the repayment terms were not considered to be unique to the asset.
Management measures expected credit losses over the contractual term of a loan. When determining the contractual term, the Company considers expected prepayments but is precluded from considering expected extensions, renewals, or modifications, unless the Company reasonably expects it will execute a trouble debt restructuring (“TDR”) with a borrower. In the event of a reasonably-expected TDR, the Company factors the reasonably-expected TDR into the current expected credit losses estimate. For consumer loans, the point at which a TDR is reasonably expected is when the Company approves the borrower’s application for a modification (i.e., the borrower qualifies for the TDR) or when the Credit Administration department approves loan concessions on substandard loans. For commercial loans, the point at which a TDR is reasonably expected is when the Company approves the loan for modification or when the Credit Administration department approves loan concessions on substandard loans. The Company uses a discounted cash flow methodology for a TDR to calculate the effect of the concession provided to the borrower within the ACL.
A restructuring that results in only a delay in payments that is insignificant is not considered an economic concession. In accordance with the CARES Act, the Company implemented loan modification programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in order to provide borrowers with flexibility with respect to repayment terms. The Company’s payment relief assistance includes forbearance, deferrals, extension and re-aging programs, along with certain other modification strategies. The Company elected the accounting policy in the CARES Act to suspend TDR accounting to loans modified for borrowers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic if the concession meets the criteria as defined under the CARES Act.
For purchased credit-deteriorated, otherwise referred to herein as PCD, assets are defined as acquired individual financial assets (or acquired groups of financial assets with similar risk characteristics) that, as of the date of acquisition, have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination, as determined by the Company’s assessment. The Company records PCD loans by adding the expected credit losses (i.e., allowance for credit losses) to the purchase price of the financial assets rather than recording through the provision for credit losses in the income statement. The expected credit loss, as of the acquisition day, of a PCD loan is added to the allowance for credit losses. The non-credit discount or premium is the difference between the unpaid principal balance and the amortized cost basis as of the acquisition date. Subsequent to the acquisition date, the change in the ACL on PCD loans is recognized through the provision for credit losses. The non-credit discount or premium is accreted or amortized, respectively, into interest income over the remaining life of the PCD loan on a level-yield basis. In accordance with the transition requirements within the standard, the Company’s acquired credit-impaired loans (i.e., ACI or Purchased Credit Impaired) were treated as PCD loans.
The Company follows its nonaccrual policy by reversing contractual interest income in the income statement when the Company places a loan on nonaccrual status. Therefore, Management excludes the accrued interest receivable balance from the amortized cost basis in measuring expected credit losses on the portfolio and does not record an
allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable. As of December 31, 2020, the accrued interest receivable for loans recorded in Other Assets was $93.9 million.
The Company has a variety of assets that have a component that qualifies as an off-balance sheet exposure. These primarily include undrawn portions of revolving lines of credit and standby letters of credit. The expected losses associated with these exposures within the unfunded portion of the expected credit loss will be recorded as a liability on the balance sheet with an offsetting income statement expense. Management has determined that a majority of the Company’s off-balance-sheet credit exposures are not unconditionally cancellable. As part of the new combined ACL methodology implemented during the current year, Management completed a funding study based on historical data to estimate the percentage of unfunded loan commitments that will ultimately be funded to calculate the reserve for unfunded commitments. Management applied this funding rate, along with the loss factor rate determined for each pooled loan segment, to unfunded loan commitments, excluding unconditionally cancellable exposures and letters of credit, to arrive at the reserve for unfunded loan commitments. Prior to the third quarter, the Company applied a utilization rate instead of a funding rate to the South State legacy portfolio to determine the reserve for unfunded commitments.
With the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, the Company changed its method for calculating it allowance for loans from an incurred loss method to a life of loan method. See Note 1-Significant Accounting Policies and Note 6-Allowance for Credit Losses for further details. As of December 31, 2020, the balance of the ACL was $457.3 million or 1.85% of total loans. The ACL increased $17.1 million from the balance of $440.2 million recorded at September 30, 2020. This increase during the fourth quarter of 2020 included a $18.0 million provision for credit losses partially offset by $0.8 million in net charge-offs. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the ACL increased $400.1 million from the balance of $56.9 million. This increase included a $199.4 million provision for credit losses during the period (which includes $109.4 million of provision recorded for non-PCD loans acquired through the merger with CSFL), a $149.4 million allowance for credit losses recorded on acquisition date on PCD loans acquired from CSFL and an increase of $54.5 million through the impact of the initial adoption of CECL. These increases were partially offset by $2.8 million in net charge-offs. The impact of COVID-19 was modeled in the forecasted loss period and macroeconomic assumptions.
At December 31, 2020, the Company also had a reserve on unfunded commitments of $43.4 million which was recorded in Other Liabilities on the Balance Sheet, compared to $43.2 million at September 30, 2020. With the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, the Company increased its reserve on unfunded commitments by $6.5 million in the first quarter of 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments was $36.6 million. Of these amounts, $9.6 million was related to the merger with CSFL during the second quarter of 2020. These amounts were recorded in the provision for credit losses on the Statements of Income. The Company did not have an allowance for credit losses or record a provision for credit losses on investment securities or other financials asset during 2020.
On December 31, 2020, the allowance for credit losses was $457.3 million, or 1.85%, of period-end loans. The ACL provides 4.28 times coverage of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2020. Net charge offs to the total average loans during the year ended December 31, 2020 were 0.01%. We continued to show solid and stable asset quality numbers and ratios as of December 31, 2020. The following table provides the allocation, by segment, for expected credit losses. Because PPP loans are government guaranteed and Management implemented additional reviews and procedures to help mitigate potential losses, Management does not expect to recognize credit losses on this loan portfolio and as a result, did not record an ACL for PPP loans within the C&I loan segment presented in the table below.

* Loan balance in each category expressed as a percentage of total loans excluding PPP loans.
The following tables provide the allocation for the non-acquired and acquired credit impaired allowance for loan losses, prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13. At December 31, 2019, there was no allowance recognized for acquired non-credit impaired loan losses.

Table 19-Summary of Acquired Credit Impaired Loan Loss Experience
During 2019, the valuation allowance on acquired credit impaired loans increased by $460,000, or 10.0%. This was the result of impairments of $1.2 million which were recorded through the provision for loan losses, being offset by loan removals of $723,000 due to loans being paid off, fully charged off or transferred to OREO. Impairments are recognized immediately and releases are generally spread over time.
Deposits
We rely on deposits by our customers as the primary source of funds for the continued growth of our loan and investment securities portfolios. Customer deposits are categorized as either noninterest-bearing deposits or interest-bearing deposits. Noninterest-bearing deposits (or demand deposits) are transaction accounts that provide us with “interest-free” sources of funds. Interest-bearing deposits include savings deposit, interest-bearing transaction accounts, certificates of deposits, and other time deposits. Interest-bearing transaction accounts include NOW, HSA, IOLTA, and Market Rate checking accounts.
During 2020, all categories of deposits increased from 2019. Total deposits increased $18.5 billion, or 152.1%, to $30.7 billion during 2020. The year over year growth was primarily due to $15.6 billion in deposits assumed through the merger with CSFL during the second quarter of 2020. Our deposit growth since December 31, 2019 included an
increase in interest-bearing demand deposits of $8.6 billion, noninterest-bearing transaction account deposits of $6.5 billion, certificates of deposits of $2.1 billion and saving deposits of $1.4 million. During 2020, we continued our focus on increasing core deposits (excluding certificates of deposits and other time deposits), which are normally lower cost funds compared to certificate of deposit balances.
The following table presents total deposits for the five years at December 31:
Table 20-Total Deposits
Overall deposits grew through both the merger with CSFL and organic growth during 2020 from December 31, 2019. The following are key highlights regarding overall growth in total deposits:
● Total deposits increased $18.5 billion, or 152.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019, driven primarily by deposits assumed through the merger with CSFL during the second quarter of 2020. Of the increase in 2020, $15.6 million was related to deposits assumed in the merger with CSFL and $2.9 million was through organic growth.
● Noninterest-bearing deposits (demand deposits) increased by $6.5 billion, or 199.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, when compared with December 31, 2019. Of the increase in 2020, $5.3 million was related to noninterest-bearing deposits assumed in the merger with CSFL and $1.2 million was through organic growth.
● Money market (Market Rate Checking) and other interest-bearing demand deposits (NOW, IOLTA, and others) increased $8.6 billion, or 143.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2020. Of the increase in 2020, $6.6 million was related to money market and other interest-bearing demand deposits assumed in the merger with CSFL and $2.0 million was through organic growth.
● Savings deposits increased $1.4 billion, or 105.7%, when compared with December 31, 2019. Of the increase in 2020, $1.0 million was related to savings deposits assumed in the merger with CSFL and $361.3 million was through organic growth.
● At December 31, 2020, the ratio of savings, interest-bearing, and time deposits to total deposits was 68.4%, a decrease of 4.9% with the ratio of 73.3% at the end of 2019.
The following are key highlights regarding overall growth in average total deposits:
● Total deposits averaged $22.6 billion in 2020, an increase of $10.8 billion, or 90.7%, from 2019, mainly due to the June 2020 merger with CSFL.
● Average interest-bearing deposits increased by $6.8 billion, or 79.1%, to $15.5 billion in 2020 compared to 2019, mainly due to the June 2020 merger with CSFL.
● Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased by $3.9 billion, or 121.8%, to $7.1 billion in 2020 compared to 2019, mainly due to the June 2020 merger with CSFL.
The following table provides a maturity distribution of certificates of deposit of $250,000 or more for the next twelve months as of December 31:
Table 21-Maturity Distribution of Certificates of Deposits of $250 Thousand or More
Short-Term Borrowed Funds
Our short-term borrowed funds consist of federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements and short-term FHLB Advances. Note 11-Federal Funds Purchased and Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase in our audited financial statements provides a profile of these funds at each year-end, the average amounts outstanding during each period, the maximum amounts outstanding at any month-end, and the weighted average interest rates on year-end and average balances in each category. Federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase most typically have maturities within one to three days from the transaction date. Certain of these borrowings have no defined maturity date. Note 12-Other Borrowings in our audited financial statements provide provides a profile of short-term FHLB advances at each year-end, the average amounts outstanding during each period and the weighted average interest rates on year-end and average balances in each category. Short-term FHLB advances have a maturity of less than one year.
Long-Term Borrowed Funds
Our long-term borrowed funds consist of junior subordinated debt and subordinated debt. Note 12-Other Borrowings in our audited financial statements provides a profile of these funds at each year-end, the balance at year end, the interest rate at year end and the weighted average interest rate for long-term borrowings. Each issuance of junior subordinated debt has a maturity of 30 years, but we can call the debt at any point without penalty.
Capital and Dividends
Our ongoing capital requirements have been met primarily through retained earnings, less the payment of cash dividends. As of December 31, 2020, shareholders’ equity was $4.6 billion, an increase of $2.3 billion, or 95.9%, compared to the balance at December 31, 2019. The change from year-end was mainly attributable to the increase in equity through the issuance of common stock and the conversion of stock options and restricted stock totaling $2.3 billion from the merger with CSFL during the second quarter of 2020.
The following shows the changes in shareholders’ equity during 2020:
Table 22-Changes in Shareholders’ Equity
Our equity-to-assets ratio decreased to 12.30% at December 31, 2020 from 14.90% at December 31, 2019. The decrease from December 31, 2019 was due to the percentage increase in equity of 95.9% being less than the percentage increase in total assets of 137.3%. This was mainly due to the increase in assets from the merger with CSFL being greater than the increase in equity from the merger.
On January 25, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a new program to repurchase up to 1,000,000 of our common stock, which were repurchased in the first and second quarter of 2019 at an average price of $69.89 per share (excluding commission expense) for a total of $69.9 million. In June 2019, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 2,000,000 shares of our common stock after considering, among other things, our liquidity needs and capital resources as well as the estimated current value of our net assets. The number of shares to be purchased and the timing of the purchases during 2019 and 2020 were based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of cash balances, general business conditions, regulatory requirements, the market price of our common stock, and the availability of alternative investment opportunities. In 2019, the Company repurchased a total of 2,165,000 shares for $156.9 million or $72.49 per share (excluding commission expense), of which 1,000,000 shares were from the 2019 Repurchase Program and the remaining 1,165,000 shares were from the revised 2019 Repurchase Program. In 2020, the Company repurchased a total of 320,000 shares for $24.7 million or $77.23 per share (excluding commission expense) from the revised 2019 Repurchase Program. We had 515,000 shares of common stock remaining under the revised 2019 Repurchase Program. On January 27, 2021, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the authorization of a new 3.5 million share Company stock repurchase plan, which replaced in its entirety the revised 2019 Repurchase Program. Additional detail on the newly approved plan is discussed in the Note 32-Subsequent Events of our audited consolidated financial statements.
We are subject to regulations with respect to certain risk-based capital ratios. These risk-based capital ratios measure the relationship of capital to a combination of balance sheet and off-balance sheet risks. The values of both balance sheet and off-balance sheet items are adjusted based on the rules to reflect categorical credit risk. In addition to the risk-based capital ratios, the regulatory agencies have also established a leverage ratio for assessing capital adequacy. The leverage ratio is equal to Tier 1 capital divided by total consolidated on-balance sheet assets (minus amounts deducted from Tier 1 capital). The leverage ratio does not involve assigning risk weights to assets.
Specifically, we are required to maintain the following minimum capital ratios:
●a CET1, risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%;
●a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%;
●a total risk-based capital ratio of 8%; and
●a leverage ratio of 4%.
Under the current capital rules, Tier 1 capital includes two components: CET1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital. The highest form of capital, CET1 capital, consists solely of common stock (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income, otherwise referred to as AOCI, and limited amounts of minority interests that are in the form of common stock. Additional Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, Tier 1 minority interests and grandfathered trust preferred securities (as discussed below). Tier 2 capital generally includes the allowance for loan losses up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, qualifying preferred stock, subordinated debt and qualifying tier 2 minority interests, less any deductions in Tier 2 instruments of an unconsolidated financial institution. Cumulative perpetual preferred stock is included only in Tier 2 capital, except that the capital rules permit bank holding companies with less than $15 billion in total consolidated assets to continue to include trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock issued before May 19, 2010 in Tier 1 Capital (but not in CET1 capital), subject to certain restrictions. With the merger with CSFL during the second quarter of 2020, the Company’s $115.0 million in trust preferred securities no longer qualifies for Tier 1 capital and is now only included in Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital calculations. AOCI is presumptively included in CET1 capital and often would operate to reduce this category of capital. When the current capital rules were first implemented, the Bank exercised its one-time opportunity at the end of the first quarter of 2015 for covered banking organizations to opt out of much of this treatment of AOCI, allowing us to retain our pre-existing treatment for AOCI.
In order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executives, a banking organization must maintain a “capital conservation buffer” on top of its minimum risk-based capital requirements. This buffer must consist solely of Tier 1 Common Equity, but the buffer applies to all three risk-based measurements (CET1, Tier 1 capital and total capital), resulting in the following effective minimum capital plus capital conservation buffer
ratios: (i) a CET1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5%.
The Bank is also subject to the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, which identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions (well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized) and is based on specified thresholds for each of the three risk-based regulatory capital ratios (CET1, Tier 1 capital and total capital) and for the leverage ratio.
The federal banking agencies revised their regulatory capital rules to (i) address the implementation of CECL; (ii) provide an optional three-year phase-in period for the day 1 adverse regulatory capital effects that banking organizations are expected to experience upon adopting CECL; and (iii) require the use of CECL in stress tests beginning with the 2020 capital planning and stress testing cycle for certain banking organizations that are subject to stress testing. CECL became effective for us on January 1, 2020 and the Company applied the provisions of the standard using the modified retrospective method as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings. Related to the implementation of ASU 2016-13, we recorded additional allowance for credit losses for loans of $54.4 million, deferred tax assets of $12.6 million, an additional reserve for unfunded commitments of $6.4 million and an adjustment to retained earnings of $44.8 million. Instead of recognizing the effects on regulatory capital from ASU 2016-13 at adoption, the Company initially elected the option for recognizing the adoption date effects on the Company’s regulatory capital calculations over a three-year phase-in.
In 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule for additional transitional relief to regulatory capital related to the impact of the adoption of CECL. The final rule provides banking organizations that adopt CECL in the 2020 calendar year with the option to delay for two years the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital, followed by the aforementioned three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of benefit during the initial two-year delay for a total five-year transition. The estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital (modified CECL transitional amount) is calculated as the sum of the day-one impact on retained earnings upon adoption of CECL (CECL transitional amount) and the calculated change in the ACL relative to the day-one ACL upon adoption of CECL multiplied by a scaling factor of 25%. The scaling factor is used to approximate the difference in the ACL under CECL relative to the incurred loss methodology. The modified CECL transitional amount will be calculated each quarter for the first two years of the five-year transition. The amount of the modified CECL transition amount will be fixed as of December 31, 2021, and that amount will be subject to the three-year phase out. The Company chose the five-year transition method and is deferring the recognition of the effects from day 1 and the CECL difference for the first two years of application.
Table 23-Capital Adequacy Ratios
The following table presents our consolidated capital ratios under the applicable capital rules:
The Tier 1 leverage ratio and the tier 1 risk-based capital ratio decreased compared to December 31, 2019 due mainly to the merger with CSFL. The percentage increase in the average assets for regulatory capital purposes for the Tier 1 leverage ratio of 145.9% and the percentage increase in risk-based weighted assets for the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 116.4% was greater than the percentage increase in Tier 1 risk-based capital of 109.2% at the holding company. The decline in the holding company ratios was greater than the decline at the bank due to the reduction in Tier 1 risk-based capital related to the $115.0 in trust preferred debt no longer being able to be included as Tier 1 capital due to the merger with CSFL along with the Company exceeding $15.0 billion in assets. The reduction in tier 1 risk-based capital was also due to our repurchase of 320,000 shares of common stock at a cost of $24.7 million through our stock repurchase plans, the common stock dividend paid of $98.3 million, and a reduction in retained earnings of $44.8 million from a cumulative change in accounting principle resulting from the adoption of ASU 2016-13. The total risk-based capital ratio increased compared to December 31, 2019 due to an increase in the allowance for credit losses that qualifies as Tier 2 capital of $178.0 million and an increase in trust preferred debt and subordinated debt of $279.2
million that qualified for Tier 2 capital at the holding company. The increase in the allowance was mainly due a provision for credit losses of $119.1 million recorded on the loan portfolio and unfunded commitments acquired in the merger with CSFL during the second quarter of 2020. The increase in debt that qualifies for Tier 2 capital was due to the Company assuming $238.0 million in subordinated debt and $38.5 million in trust preferred debt in the merger with CSFL. The increase in securities that qualifies for Tier 2 capital did not affect the Bank’s total risk-based capital ratio because the debt is at the holding company level. Our capital ratios are currently well in excess of the minimum standards and continue to be in the “well capitalized” regulatory classification.
The Company pays cash dividends to shareholders from its assets, which are mainly provided by dividends from its banking subsidiary. However, certain restrictions exist regarding the ability of its subsidiary to transfer funds to the Company in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances. Prior to the merger with CSFL, the Bank was required to receive the approval of the SCBFI in order to pay dividends that exceeds 100% of net income in any calendar year. With the merger with CSFL, the Bank became a national bank regulated by the OCC. The approval of the OCC is required if the total of all dividends declared by a national bank in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus. The federal banking agencies have issued policy statements which provide that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally pay dividends only out of current earnings.
During first quarter of 2020, the Bank paid special dividends to the Company totaling $24.7 million for which SCBFI approval was not required. These funds were used to repurchase Company stock on the open market totaling $24.7 million during the first quarter of 2020. The Bank also paid a special dividend of $33.0 million during the first quarter of 2020 to provide the Company with more general operating liquidity during the COVID pandemic. During 2019, the Bank paid special dividends to the Company totaling $157.0 million for which SCBFI approval was required. The Bank received approval from the SCBFI in June 2019 to pay an additional $60.0 million above current year net income in dividends to the Company. These funds were used to repurchase Company stock on the open market totaling $156.9 million during 2019. In 2018, the Bank paid special dividends to the Company totaling $66.6 million for which SCBFI approval was not required. These funds were used to repurchase Company stock on the open market totaling $68.4 million in the third and fourth quarters of 2018.
The following table provides the amount of dividends and payout ratios for the years ended December 31:
Table 24-Dividends Paid to Common Shareholders
We retain earnings to have capital sufficient to grow our loan and investment portfolios and to support certain acquisitions or other business expansion opportunities. The dividend payout ratio is calculated by dividing dividends paid during the year by net income for the year.
Liquidity
Liquidity refers to our ability to generate sufficient cash to meet our financial obligations, which arise primarily from the withdrawal of deposits, extension of credit and payment of operating expenses. Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank’s financial condition or overall safety and soundness is adversely affected by an inability (or perceived inability) to meet its obligations. Our Asset Liability Management Committee (“ALCO”) is charged with the responsibility of monitoring policies that are designed to ensure acceptable composition of our asset/liability mix. Two critical areas of focus for ALCO are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management. We have employed our funds in a manner to provide liquidity from both assets and liabilities sufficient to meet our cash needs.
Asset liquidity is maintained by the maturity structure of loans, investment securities and other short-term investments. Management has policies and procedures governing the length of time to maturity on loans and investments. As reported in Table 7, less than one percent of the investment portfolio contractually matures in one year or less. This segment of the portfolio consists mostly of municipal obligations along with some paydowns of mortgage-backed securities. There is also an additional amount of securities that could be called or prepaid, as well as expected
monthly paydowns of mortgage-backed securities. Normally, changes in the earning asset mix are of a longer-term nature and are not utilized for day-to-day corporate liquidity needs.
Our liabilities provide liquidity on a day-to-day basis. Daily liquidity needs are met from deposit levels or from our use of federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, interest-bearing deposits at other banks and other short-term borrowings. We engage in routine activities to retain deposits intended to enhance our liquidity position. These routine activities include various measures, such as the following:
● Emphasizing relationship banking to new and existing customers, where borrowers are encouraged and normally expected to maintain deposit accounts with our Bank;
● Pricing deposits, including certificates of deposit, at rate levels that will attract and /or retain balances of deposits that will enhance our Bank’s asset/liability management and net interest margin requirements; and
● Continually working to identify and introduce new products that will attract customers or enhance our Bank’s appeal as a primary provider of financial services.
Our non-acquired loan portfolio increased by approximately $3.0 billion, or approximately 32.8%, compared to the balance at December 31, 2019. Of the increase, $958.0 million was related to PPP loans made in 2020. Excluding PPP loans, the non-acquired loan portfolio increased by $2.1 billion, or 22.5% from December 31, 2019. The acquired loan portfolio increased by $10.3 billion, or 483.1%, from the balance at December 31, 2019. This increase was due the merger with CSFL in which the Company acquired $13.0 billion in loans in the second quarter of 2020. Net of the addition of loans acquired in the CSFL merger, the acquired loan portfolio decreased by $2.7 billion during 2020 through principal paydowns, charge-offs, foreclosures and renewals of acquired loans that moved into our non-acquired loan portfolio.
Our investment securities portfolio increased $2.4 billion compared to the balance at December 31, 2019. Of this increase, $1.2 billion in investment securities were acquired in the merger with CSFL during the second quarter of 2020. Excluding investment securities acquired in the CSFL merger, the investment portfolio increased by $1.2 billion, or 62.2% from December 31, 2019. The increase in investment securities from December 31, 2019 was a result of investments acquired in the CSFL merger of $1.2 billion, purchases of $2.4 billion as well as improvements in the market value of the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio of $47.4 million. These increases were partially offset by maturities, calls, sales and paydowns of investment securities totaling $1.1 billion. Net amortization of premiums were $22.2 million in 2020. The increase in investment securities excluding investments acquired in the CSFL merger was due to the Company making the strategic decision to increase the size of the portfolio with the excess funds from deposit growth and the increase in other borrowings. Total cash and cash equivalents were $4.6 billion at December 31, 2020 as compared to $688.7 million at December 31, 2019. The Company acquired $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents in the merger with CSFL in the second quarter of 2020.
At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had $600.0 million and $0 of traditional, out-of-market brokered deposits. We assumed $804.0 million in traditional, out-of-market brokered deposits in the merger with CSFL in the second quarter of 2020 of which $204.0 million paid out in the third quarter of 2020. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had $611.1 million and $45.8 million, respectively, of reciprocal brokered deposits. Reciprocal brokered deposits of $458.3 million were assumed in the CSFL merger in June 2020. Total deposits were $30.7 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $18.5 billion from $12.2 billion at December 31, 2019. This increase was mainly due the merger with CSFL in which the Company acquired $15.6 billion in deposits in the second quarter of 2020. Excluding the assumed deposits in the CSFL merger, deposits increased by $2.9 billion, or 23.8% from December 31, 2019. Our legacy deposit growth since December 31, 2019 included an increase in demand deposit accounts of $1.3 billion, an increase in savings and money market accounts of $991.3 million and an increase in interest-bearing transaction accounts of $921.2 million partially offset by a decline in certificates of deposit of $106.3 million. Total other borrowings decreased $700.1 million from December 31, 2019 as all of the Company’s FHLB borrowings were paid off in the fourth quarter of 2020 due to the excess liquidity the Company was holding. Total short-term borrowings at December 31, 2020 were $780.0 million consisting of $384.7 million in federal funds purchased and $394.9 million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase. Corporate and subordinated debentures increased approximately $274.3 million in 2020 through acquisition of trust preferred and subordinated debt in the CSFL merger during the second quarter of 2020. To the extent that we employ other types of non-deposit funding sources, typically to accommodate retail and correspondent customers, we continue to take in shorter maturities of such funds. Our current approach may
provide an opportunity to sustain a low funding rate or possibly lower our cost of funds but could also increase our cost of funds if interest rates rise.
Through the operations of our Bank, we have made contractual commitments to extend credit in the ordinary course of our business activities. These commitments are legally binding agreements to lend money to our customers at predetermined interest rates for a specified period of time. We manage the credit risk on these commitments by subjecting them to normal underwriting and risk management processes. We believe that we have adequate sources of liquidity to fund commitments that are drawn upon by the borrowers. In addition to commitments to extend credit, we also issue standby letters of credit, which are assurances to third parties that they will not suffer a loss if our customer fails to meet its contractual obligation to the third party. Although our past experience indicates that many of these standby letters of credit will expire unused, through our various sources of liquidity, we believe that we will have the necessary resources to meet these obligations should the need arise.
Our ongoing philosophy is to remain in a liquid position as reflected by such indicators as the composition of our earning assets, typically including some level of reverse repurchase agreements, federal funds sold, balances at the Federal Reserve Bank, and/or other short-term investments; asset quality; well-capitalized position; and profitable operating results. Cyclical and other economic trends and conditions can disrupt our desired liquidity position at any time. We expect that these conditions would generally be of a short-term nature. Under such circumstances, we expect our reverse repurchase agreements and federal funds sold positions, or balances at the Federal Reserve Bank, if any, to serve as the primary source of immediate liquidity. At December 31, 2020, we had total federal funds credit lines of $375.0 million with no outstanding advances. If we needed additional liquidity, we would turn to short-term borrowings as an alternative immediate funding source and would consider other appropriate actions such as promotions to increase core deposits or the use of the brokered deposit markets. At December 31, 2020, we had $1.2 billion of credit available at the Federal Reserve Bank’s discount window, but had no outstanding advances as of the end of 2020. In addition, we could draw on additional alternative immediate funding sources from lines of credit extended to us from our correspondent banks and/or the FHLB. At December 31, 2020, we had a total FHLB credit facility of $2.8 billion with $12.2 million in outstanding FHLB letters of credit to secure certain public funds deposits, leaving $2.8 billion in availability on the FHLB credit facility. We have a $100.0 million unsecured line of credit with U.S. Bank National Association with no outstanding advances. We believe that our liquidity position continues to be adequate and readily available.
Our contingency funding plan describes several potential stages based on stressed liquidity levels. Liquidity key risk indicators are reported to the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. During 2020, we conducted two contingency funding plan stress tests and will perform these tests on a quarterly basis in the future. We maintain various wholesale sources of funding. If our deposit retention efforts were to be unsuccessful, we would utilize these alternative sources of funding. Under such circumstances, depending on the external source of funds, our interest cost would vary based on the range of interest rates charged. This could increase our cost of funds, impacting our net interest margin and net interest spread.
Asset-Liability Management and Market Risk Sensitivity
Our earnings and the economic value of equity may vary in relation to changes in interest rates and the accompanying fluctuations in market prices of certain of our financial instruments. We define interest rate risk as the risk to earnings and equity arising from the behavior of interest rates. These behaviors include increases and decreases in interest rates as well as continuation of the current interest rate environment.
Our interest rate risk principally consists of reprice, option, basis, and yield curve risk. Reprice risk results from differences in the maturity or repricing characteristics of asset and liability portfolios. Option risk arises from embedded options in the investment and loan portfolios such as investment securities calls and loan prepayment options. Option risk also exists since deposit customers may withdraw funds at their discretion in response to general market conditions, competitive alternatives to existing accounts or other factors. The exercise of such options may result in higher costs or lower revenue. Basis risk refers to the potential for changes in the underlying relationship between market rates or indices, which subsequently result in narrowing spreads on interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Basis risk also exists in administered rate liabilities, such as interest-bearing checking accounts, savings accounts and money market accounts where the price sensitivity of such products may vary relative to general markets rates. Yield curve risk refers to the adverse consequences of nonparallel shifts in the yield curves of various market indices that impact our assets and liabilities.
We use simulation analysis as a primary method to assess earnings at risk and equity at risk due to assumed changes in interest rates. Management uses the results of its various simulation analyses in combination with other data and observations to formulate strategies designed to maintain interest rate risk within risk tolerances.
Earnings at risk is defined as the percentage change in net interest income due to assumed changes in interest rates. Earnings at risk is generally used to assess interest rate risk over relatively short time horizons. We compute earnings at risk on a quarterly basis over one and two-year time horizons.
Equity at risk is defined as the percentage change in the net economic value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates compared to a base net economic value. The discounted present value of all cash flows represents our economic value of equity. Equity at risk is generally considered a measure of the long-term interest rate exposures of the balance sheet at a point in time. We compute equity at risk on a quarterly basis.
The earnings simulation models take into account our contractual agreements with regard to investments, loans, deposits, borrowings, and derivatives as well as a number of behavioral assumptions applied to certain assets and liabilities.
Mortgage banking derivatives used in the ordinary course of business consist of forward sales contracts and interest rate lock commitments on residential mortgage loans. These derivatives involve underlying items, such as interest rates, and are designed to mitigate risk. For additional information see Note 29-Derivative Financial Instruments in the consolidated financial statements.
From time to time we enter into interest rate swaps to hedge some of our interest rate risks. Under these arrangements, the Company enters into a variable rate loan with a client in addition to a swap agreement. The swap agreement effectively converts the client’s variable rate loan into a fixed rate loan. The Company then enters into a matching swap agreement with a third party dealer in order to offset its exposure on the customer swap. For additional information on these derivatives refer to Note 29-Derivative Financial Instruments in the consolidated financial statements.
Our interest rate risk key indicators are applied to a static balance sheet using forward rates from the Moody’s Baseline Scenario. This Base Case Scenario assumes the maturity composition of asset and liability rollover volumes is modeled to approximately replicate current consolidated balance sheet characteristics throughout the simulation. These treatments are consistent with the Company’s goal of assessing current interest rate risk embedded in its current balance sheet. The Base Case Scenario assumes that maturing or repricing assets and liabilities are replaced at current market prices consistent with maintaining a stable balance sheet. Key rate drivers are used to price assets and liabilities with sensitivity assumptions used to price non-maturity deposits. The sensitivity assumptions for the pricing of non-maturity deposits are subjected to stress testing no less frequently than on an annual basis.
Interest rate shocks are applied to the Base Case on an instantaneous basis. The range of interest rate shocks will include upward and downward movements of rates through 400 bps in 100 basis point increments. At times, market conditions may result in assumed rate movements that will be deemphasized. For example, during a period of ultra-low interest rates, certain downward rate shocks may be impractical. The Model simulation results produced from the Base Case Scenario and related instantaneous shocks for changes in net interest income and instantaneous rate shocks for changes in the economic value of equity are referred to as the Core Scenario Analysis and constitute the policy key risk indicators for interest rate risk when compared to risk tolerances.
As of December 31, 2020, the earnings simulations indicated that the impact of a 100 basis point increase / decrease in rates would result in an estimated 9.43% increase (up 100) and 4.68% decrease (down 100) in net interest income as compared the Moody’s Baseline rate forecast.
We use Economic Value of Equity (“EVE”) analysis as an indicator of the extent to which the present value of our capital could change, given potential changes in interest rates. This measure also assumes a static balance sheet (Base Case Scenario) with rate shocks applied as described above. At December 31, 2020, the percentage change in EVE due to a 100 bps increase or decrease in interest rates was 3.27% and 5.12%, respectively. The percentage change in EVE due to a 200 bps increase or decrease in interest rates was 5.70% and 19.57%, respectively.
Simulation analysis involves the use of several assumptions including, but not limited to, the timing of cash
flows such as investment security calls, loan prepayment speeds, deposit attrition rates, the interest rate sensitivity of loans and deposits relative to general market rates, and the behavior of interest rates and spreads. Furthermore, equity at risk simulation uses assumptions regarding discount rates that value cash flows. Simulation analysis is highly dependent on model assumptions that may vary from actual outcomes. For example, higher levels of interest rate sensitivity of deposits to upward movements in interest rates may adversely impact net interest income. Additionally, slower prepayment speeds of loans may adversely impact the economic value of equity in a rising interest rate environment. Key simulation assumptions are subject to stress testing to assess the impact of assumption changes on earnings at risk and equity at risk.
Asset Credit Risk and Concentrations
The quality of our interest-earning assets is maintained through our management of certain concentrations of credit risk. We review each individual earning asset including investment securities and loans for credit risk. To facilitate this review, we have established credit and investment policies that include credit limits, documentation, periodic examination, and follow-up. In addition, we examine these portfolios for exposure to concentration in any one industry, government agency, or geographic location.
Loan and Deposit Concentration
We have no material concentration of deposits from any single customer or group of customers. We have no significant portion of our loans concentrated within a single industry or group of related industries. Furthermore, we attempt to avoid making loans that, in an aggregate amount, exceed 10% of total loans to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar business activities. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no aggregated loan concentrations of this type. We do not believe there are any material seasonal factors that would have a material adverse effect on us. We do not have material foreign loans or deposits.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Each category of earning assets has a certain degree of credit risk. We use various techniques to measure credit risk. Credit risk in the investment portfolio can be measured through bond ratings published by independent agencies. In the investment securities portfolio, the investments consist of U.S. government-sponsored entity securities, tax-free securities, or other securities having ratings of “AAA” to “Not Rated”. All securities, with the exception of those that are not rated, were rated by at least one of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations. The credit risk of the loan portfolio can be measured by historical experience. We maintain our loan portfolio in accordance with credit policies that we have established. Although the subsidiary has a diversified loan portfolio, a substantial portion of their borrowers’ abilities to honor their contracts is dependent upon economic conditions within our geographic footprint and the surrounding regions.
We consider concentrations of credit to exist when, pursuant to regulatory guidelines, the amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar business activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by general economic conditions represents 25% of Tier 1 capital plus regulatory adjusted allowance for credit losses of the Company, or $841.1 million at December 31, 2020. Based on this criteria, we had five such credit concentrations at December 31, 2020, including loans on hotels and motels of $969.9 million, loans to lessors of nonresidential buildings (except mini-warehouses) of $3.7 billion, loans secured by owner occupied nonresidential buildings of $3.1 billion, loans to lessors of residential buildings (investment properties and multi-family) of $1.1 billion and loans secured by 1st mortgage 1-4 family owner occupied residential property of $3.6 billion. The risk for these loans and for all loans is managed collectively through the use of credit underwriting practices developed and updated over time. The loss estimate for these loans is determined using our standard ACL methodology.
With some financial institutions adopting CECL in the first quarter of 2020, banking regulators established new guidelines for calculating credit concentrations. Banking regulators set the guidelines for construction, land development and other land loans to total less than 100% of total Tier 1 capital less modified CECL transitional amount plus ACL (CDL concentration ratio) and for total commercial real estate loans (construction, land development and other land loans along with other non-owner occupied commercial real estate and multifamily loans) to total less than 300% of total Tier 1 capital less modified CECL transitional amount plus ACL (CRE concentration ratio). Both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by the Bank’s total Tier 1 capital less modified CECL transitional amount plus ACL. At December 31, 2020, the Bank’s CDL concentration ratio was 54.1%
and its CRE concentration ratio was 229.5%. As of December 31, 2020, the Bank was below the established regulatory guidelines. When a bank’s ratios are in excess of one or both of these loan concentration ratios guidelines, banking regulators generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank Management. Therefore, we monitor these two ratios as part of our concentration management processes.
Previous to the adoption of the new guidelines established in 2020, the guidelines for the construction, land development and other land loans were to total less than 100% of total risk-based capital and for total commercial real estate loans to total less than 300% of total risk-based capital. Both ratios were calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by the Bank’s total risk-based capital. At December 31, 2019, the Bank’s construction, land development and other land loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital was 68.7%. Commercial real estate loans (which includes construction, land development and other land loans along with other non-owner occupied commercial real estate and multifamily loans) as a percentage of total risk-based capital was 225.6% as of December 31, 2019.
Effect of Inflation and Changing Prices
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require the measure of financial position and results of operations in terms of historical dollars, without consideration of changes in the relative purchasing power over time due to inflation. Unlike most other industries, the majority of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant effect on a financial institution’s performance than does the effect of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily change in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services.
While the effect of inflation on banks is normally not as significant as is its influence on those businesses which have large investments in plant and inventories, it does have an effect. During periods of high inflation, there are normally corresponding increases in money supply, and banks will normally experience above average growth in assets, loans and deposits. Also, general increases in the prices of goods and services will result in increased operating expenses. Inflation also affects our bank’s customers and may result in an indirect effect on our bank’s business.
Contractual Obligations
The following table presents payment schedules for certain of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020. Long-term debt obligations totaling $390.2 million mostly include junior subordinated debt. Operating and finance lease obligations of $145.4 million and $3.7 million, respectively, pertain to banking facilities. Certain lease agreements include payment of property taxes and insurance and contain various renewal options. Additional information regarding leases is contained in Note 22 of the audited consolidated financial statements.
