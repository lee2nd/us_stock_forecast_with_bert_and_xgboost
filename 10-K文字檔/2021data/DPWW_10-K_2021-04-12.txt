The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those consolidated financial statements that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Our discussion includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions.

Overview
Diego Pellicer Worldwide, Inc. was established on August 26, 2013 to take advantage of growing market for legalized cannabis being made possible by the escalating legislation allowing for the legalization of cannabis operations in the majority of states:
The industry is operating under stringent regulations within the various state jurisdictions. The Company’s primary business plan is twofold: First to lease various properties to licensed operators in these jurisdictions to grow, process and sell cannabis and related products, and the second the Diego Pellicer Management Company, will license the upscale Diego Pellicer brand to qualified operators and receive royalty payments, while providing expertise in retail, product and manufacturing from Diego’s management team. The Company will also provide educational training, compliance consultation, branding, and related accessories to their tenants. These leases and management agreements are expected to provide substantial streams of income. We believe that as laws evolve, it is possible that we will have the opportunity to participate directly in these operations. Accordingly, the Company will selectively negotiate an option on our tenants’ operating company.

The legalization taking place in other states such as California and Florida present opportunities many times that of Washington and Colorado. The Company is exploring opportunities in Oregon, California and Florida and is getting inquiries from other potential operators in other jurisdictions.
Summary
The Company’s primary business objective is to lease various properties to licensed operators to grow, process and retail cannabis and related products. By developing a premium brand name, building upscale facilities, and providing quality accessories to a market where financing is difficult to obtain, these subleases are designed to provide a substantial stream of income. We believe that as laws evolve, it is possible that we will have the opportunity to participate directly in these operations as well.
was a year of growth for Diego Pellicer Worldwide. All tenants were open and generating lease revenue. The tenants were showing steady revenue increases and operating improvements. The business model was being proven. The brand name was getting national recognition and garnered the “Most Valuable Brand of the Year” at the 2018 National Cannabis Business Awards beating out tough national competition including MedMen™, The Clinic, Lightshade and Olio. Diego was also honored as the “Best Retail Center” for the second year in a row, defeating other highly regarded names including LiveWell, The Clinic, The Green Solutions, Euflora and Kind Love.
was a time of continued growth and a change of focus for the Company. An effective and experienced team was assembled from within our operators to develop our newly formed management company, and to complement the current executives with knowledge and experience in real estate operations, banking, site selection, branding, facility design, corporate finance, investor relations, store management, and grow expertise, Additional capital needed to be raised in order to have sufficient capital to help support our operators expand within their markets, and to begin the expansion into different markets in the US. Much of the Company’s debt was renegotiated, and additional commitments were formalized for the expansion in the Colorado market. New markets had to be explored, new alliances forged, and opportunities prioritized.
2020 was a year of strategic alliances and developing a strong operating structure that would be used to compliment any new acquisition, and guiding our branded tenants. An effective and experienced team was developed from within our operators to develop our management company. The Company has been working diligently to renegotiate our debt and lower our convertible debt in anticipation of the merger and acquisition phase of the Company. The Company divested itself from a poor performing lease and secured all the potential future premium rents from our branded tenant, at the same time as securitizing deferred rents from this tenant in the form of a note with specific short term repayment functions. The Company has started numerous introductory discussions with potential acquisitions that would follow one of the key requirements at being additive to our consolidated financial statements.
Plans of Operation
Diego is currently exploring opportunities in California, Colorado, Nevada, Florida, Washington and other states. The Company will continue to raise capital to finance that expansion. This should result in increased revenues for the future and increased opportunities into new markets.
Going Concern Qualification
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred losses since inception, its current liabilities exceed its current assets by $11,767,522 at December 31, 2020, and it has an accumulated deficit of $55,110,000 at December 31, 2020. These factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern over the next twelve months. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Although the Company has been successful raising additional capital, there is no assurance that the company will sell additional shares of stock or borrow additional funds. The Company’s inability to raise additional cash could have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, and its ability to continue in existence. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Management believes that the Company’s future success is dependent upon its ability to achieve profitable operations, generate cash from operating activities and obtain additional financing. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to generate sufficient cash from operations, sell additional shares of stock or borrow additional funds. However, cash generated from lease revenues is currently exceeding lease costs, but is insufficient to cover operating expenses.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Year ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019
After rental expense the gross margins on the lease were as follows:
Revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company leased three facilities to licensees in Colorado. The year ended December 31, 2020 is the beginning of the third year of operations for these licensees. Diego, is no longer forbearing the premium rents contractually due from the tenant as a result of the cost of leasehold improvements, but is still forbearing the deferral of preopening rents. These will become recorded as revenue when the Company considers all the premium rents collectible considering the relative success of the tenant’s operations. These licensees have now had their opening year behind them and are experiencing increasing revenues in the second year of operations. The Company also divested itself from one of the underperforming leaseholds to conserve cash flow and negotiated from the tenant all the future premium rents due through the end of the lease. This is a significant event for the Company. In October 2020 one of the leases and the related sublease was terminated. As a result, total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1,265,137, as compared to $1,646,369 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $381,232.
Gross profit. Rental revenue for the period ended December 31, 2020 decreased over the prior year ended December 31, 2019, resulting in a gross profit of $258,556, a decrease of $198,461 from 2019 gross profit of $457,017.
General and administrative expense. Our general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $1,029,185, compared to $2,521,649 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease of $1,492,464 was largely attributable to a reduction in executive compensation and termination costs and fees.
Selling expense. Our selling expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $32,940, compared to $52,605 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decline of $19,665 was due to reduction of services used related to selling and marketing
The increase in net other expense resulted primarily from the effects that the changes in market value of the Company’s stock had on the derivative liability associated with our convertible debt, plus a decrease in gain on the sale/termination of leases, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense and financing costs of new debt incurred by the Company.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Operating Activities. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the net cash used of $346,448 was a decrease over the same period of the prior year of $837,543. The loss from operations after non-cash adjustments decreased by $787,651 from the prior year.
Investing Activities. There were no investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2019, proceeds from sale of the Seattle lease was $550,000.

Payments of convertible notes payable was $49,578. During the year ended December 31, 2019, $897,725 in proceeds were from convertible notes payable and $130,000 from the sale of preferred stock. Payments of convertible notes payable was $120,500 and debt cost was $16,225.
