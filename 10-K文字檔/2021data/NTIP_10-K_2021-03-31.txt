ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
OVERVIEW
Our principal business is the development, licensing and protection of our intellectual property assets. We presently own eighty-four (84) patents including: (i) our remote power patent (“Remote Power Patent”) covering the delivery of power over Ethernet (PoE) cables for the purpose of remotely powering network devices, such as wireless access ports, IP phones and network based cameras; (ii) our Mirror Worlds patent portfolio (the “Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio”) relating to foundational technologies that enable unified search and indexing, displaying and archiving of documents in a computer system; (iii) our Cox patent portfolio (the “Cox Patent Portfolio”) relating to enabling technology for identifying media content on the Internet and taking further action to be performed after such identification; and (iv) our M2M/IoT patent portfolio (the “M2M/IoT Patent Portfolio”) relating to, among other things, enabling technology for authenticating, provisioning and using embedded sim cards in next generation IoT, Machine-to-Machine, and other mobile devices, including smartphones, tablets and computers. In addition, we continually review opportunities to acquire or license additional intellectual property as well as other strategic alternatives.
Until March 7, 2020, when the Remote Power Patent expired, we had been actively engaged in the licensing of our Remote Power Patent (U.S. Patent No. 6,218,930) which generated licensing revenue in excess of $151,000,000 from May 2007 through December 31, 2020. As of March 7, 2020, we had twenty-seven (27) license agreements with respect to our Remote Power Patent which, among others, included license agreements with Cisco, Dell Inc., Extreme Networks, Inc., Netgear, Microsemi Corporation, Motorola Solutions, Inc., NEC Corporation, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., ShoreTel, Inc., Juniper Networks, Inc., Polycom, Inc. and Avaya, Inc. As a result of the expiration of our Remote Power Patent, we no longer receive licensing revenue for our Remote Power Patent that accrues for any period subsequent to the expiration date (March 7, 2020). As a result of the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on September 24, 2020 to overturn the District Court’s judgment of non-infringement that resulted from our trial with Hewlett-Packard involving our Remote Power Patent, we believed that Cisco, the largest licensee of our Remote Power Patent, was obligated to pay us significant royalties that accrued but were not paid beginning in the fourth quarter of 2017 through the expiration of our Remote Power Patent. On March 30, 2021, we entered into an amendment (the “Amendment”) to the Settlement and License Agreement, dated May 25, 2011, between us and Cisco (the “Agreement”). Pursuant to the Amendment, Cisco agreed to pay $18,691,890 to us to
resolve a dispute relating to Cisco’s contractual obligation to pay us royalties under the Agreement for the period beginning in the fourth quarter of 2017 through March 7, 2020 (when the Remote Power Patent expired) with respect to licensing the Remote Power Patent (see Note O[5] to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report). We also believe that Netgear, another licensee of our Remote Power Patent, is obligated to pay us royalties that accrued but were not paid for the same period. We have commenced litigation against Netgear (see Note K[6] to our consolidated financial statements included herein). In addition, we may receive additional revenue related to our Remote Power Patent from Hewlett-Packard depending upon the outcome of the new trial as a result of the September 24, 2020 decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (see Notes K[1] and Note K[3] to our consolidated financial statements included herein).
Consistent with our revenue recognition policy (see Note B[5] of the consolidated financial statements included herein), we did not record revenue beginning in the fourth quarter of 2017 through March 7, 2020 (the expiration of the Remote Power Patent) from Cisco and Netgear who notified us they would not pay us ongoing royalties as a result of the jury verdict of non-infringement in our trial with HP.
Our current strategy includes continuing our licensing efforts with respect to our intellectual property assets. In addition, we continue to seek to acquire additional intellectual property assets to develop, commercialize, license or otherwise monetize. Our strategy includes working with inventors and patent owners to assist in the development and monetization of their patented technologies. We may also enter into strategic relationships with third parties to develop, commercialize, license or otherwise monetize their intellectual property. Our patent acquisition and development strategy is to focus on acquiring high quality patents which management believes have the potential to generate significant licensing opportunities as we have achieved with respect to our Remote Power Patent and Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio.
We have been dependent upon our Remote Power Patent for a significant portion of our revenue. Our Remote Power Patent has generated licensing revenue in excess of $151,000,000 from May 2007 through December 31, 2020. Revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 from license agreements for our Remote Power Patent constituted $4,403,000 (100% of our revenue), $3,037,000 (100% of our revenue) and $15,785,000 (71% of our revenue), respectively. As a result of the expiration of our Remote Power Patent on March 7, 2020, we no longer receive licensing revenue for our Remote Power Patent for any period subsequent to the expiration date. Except for the above referenced uncertain revenue from our Remote Power Patent for periods prior to its expiration date, our future revenue will be entirely dependent on our ability to monetize our Mirror Worlds, Cox M2M/IoT patent portfolios as well as any new patents we may acquire.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we had a change in estimate related to accrued contingency fees and related costs. The change was the result of our receiving new information reflecting additional legal costs in connection with certain contingent litigation. The effect of this change in estimate for the year ended December 31, 2020 was an increase in professional fees and related costs of $886,000 and a corresponding increase in our operating loss and net loss of $886,000, and a decrease in basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.04 per share (see Note B[8] to our financial statements included herein).
Our annual and quarterly operating and financial results may fluctuate significantly from period to period as a result of a variety of factors that are outside our control, including the timing and our ability to achieve successful outcomes of patent litigation, our ability and timing of consummating future license agreements for our intellectual property, and whether we will achieve a return on our investment in ILiAD Biotechnologies, LLC (“ILiAD”) and the timing of any such distributions.
At December 31, 2020, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents and, marketable securities of $44,871,000 and working capital of $42,959,000. Based on our current cash position, we believe that we will have sufficient cash to fund our operations for the foreseeable future. Based on our cash position, we continually review opportunities to acquire additional intellectual property as well as evaluate other strategic opportunities.
We currently have pending patent infringement litigations involving our Remote Power Patent and certain patents within our Cox Patent Portfolio and Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio (see Note [K] to our consolidated financial statements included herein). Patent litigation is inherently risky and the outcome is uncertain.
In future years we could be classified as a Personal Holding Company. If this is the case, we would be subject to a 20% tax on the amount of any PHC Income for such year that we do not distribute to our shareholders (see Note E to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report).
During the period December 2018 through March 2021, we made an aggregate investment of $6,000,000 in ILiAD, a clinical stage biotechnology company with an exclusive license to fifty-one (51) patents (see Note H and Note O[4] to our consolidated financial statements included herein). Our investment in ILiAD involves significant risk (see “Risk Factors” at page 17 hereof).
As to the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic on us, COVID-19 has and continues to cause some delays in the courts including the scheduling of trial dates, which could adversely affect the timing of our consummation of future license agreements (see “Risk Factors - The global COVID-19 pandemic could have an adverse impact on our Business”).
On June 9, 2020, our Board of Directors approved the continuation of our dividend policy consisting of semi-annual cash dividends of $0.05 per share ($0.10 per share annually) which are anticipated to be paid in March and September of each year. Our dividend policy undergoes a periodic review by our Board of Directors and is subject to change at any time depending upon our financial requirements, earnings and other factors existing at the time (see Note N to our consolidated financial statements included herein).
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019
Revenue. We had revenue of $4,403,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 (“2020”) as compared to revenue of $3,037,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 (“2019”). The increase in revenue of $1,366,000 for 2020 was primarily due to revenue of $4,150,000 from our settlement with Dell (see Note K[2] to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report).
Operating Expenses. Operating expenses for 2020 were $6,816,000 as compared to $5,391,000 for 2019. The increase in operating expenses for 2020 was primarily due to increased costs of revenue of $771,000 as a result of our settlement with Dell and an increase in professional fees and related costs of $917,000 primarily related to a change in estimate for accrued contingency fees and related costs (see Note B[8] to our consolidated financial statements included herein). We had costs of revenue of $1,653,000 and $882,000 for 2020 and 2019, respectively. Included in the costs of revenue for 2020 were contingent legal fees of $1,433,000 and $220,000 of incentive bonus compensation payable to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer pursuant to his employment agreement (see Note J[1] to our consolidated financial statements included herein). Included in the costs of revenue for 2019 were contingent legal fees of $730,000 and $152,000 of incentive bonus compensation payable to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer pursuant to his employment agreement.
General and administrative expenses were $2,162,000 for 2020 as compared to $2,167,000 for the year ended 2019. Amortization of patents was $292,000 for 2020 as compared to $285,000 for 2019. Stock-based compensation expense related to the issuance of restricted stock units was $302,000 for 2020 as compared to $567,000 for 2019. Professional fees and related costs were $2,407,000 for 2020 compared to $1,490,000 for 2019.
Operating Loss. We had an operating loss of $2,413,000 for 2020 compared with an operating loss of $2,354,000 for 2019.
Interest and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income for 2020 was $522,000 as compared to interest and dividend income of $1,150,000 for 2019 primarily as a result of a change in the mix of our short-term fixed income investments and cash equivalents.
Income Taxes (Benefit). In 2020 we had a deferred tax benefit for federal, state and local income taxes of $(490,000) related to the relief of our valuation allowance and a current tax benefit of $(464,000) in connection with the current year losses. In 2019, we had a deferred tax expense for federal, state and local income taxes of $168,000 and a current tax benefit of $(147,000) for federal, state and local taxes.
Share of Net Losses of Equity Method Investee. We incurred a net loss of $787,000 for 2020 related to our equity share in ILiAD as compared to a net loss of $604,000 for 2019 as ILiAD has no revenue from operations and continues to sustain losses (see Note H to our consolidated financial statements included herein).
Net Loss. As a result of the foregoing, we realized a net loss of $1,709,000 or $(0.07) per share basic and diluted for 2020 compared with a net loss of $1,792,000 or $(0.07) per share basic and diluted for 2019. The net loss of $1,709,000 for 2020 includes an increase of $886,000 in professional fees and related costs due to a change in estimate of accrued contingency fees and related costs (see Note B[8] to our consolidated financial statements included herein).
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We have financed our operations primarily from revenue from licensing our patents. At December 31, 2020, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $44,871,000 and working capital of $42,959,000. Based on our current cash position, we believe that we will have sufficient cash to fund our operations for the foreseeable future.
Working capital decreased by $4,230,000 at December 31, 2020 to $42,959,000 as compared to working capital of $47,189,000 at December 31, 2019. The decrease in working capital of $4,230,000 for 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $3,446,000, an increase in our accounts payable of $180,000, and an increase in accrued contingency fees and related costs of $440,000.
Net cash used in operating activities for 2020 decreased by $102,000 from $605,000 for 2019 to $503,000 for 2020.
Net cash provided by investing activities during 2020 was $6,306,000 as compared to $3,048,000 for 2019 primarily as a result of the differential of purchases and sales of marketable securities and our additional equity investment of $2,500,000 in ILiAD for 2019.
Net cash used in financing activities for 2020 and 2019 was $2,885,000 and $3,619,000, respectively. The change of $734,000 primarily resulted from a decrease of $519,000 in repurchases of common stock and a decrease of $377,000 in the value of shares delivered to fund withholding taxes.
We maintain our cash in money market funds, certificates of deposit and short-term fixed income securities. Accordingly, we do not believe that our investments have significant exposure to interest rate risk.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, purchase obligations, operating lease obligations, or other long-term liabilities.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are based on our audited consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. The significant estimates and assumptions made in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements include revenue recognition, contingent legal fees and related expenses, income taxes, valuation of patents and equity method investments. Actual results could be materially different from those estimates, upon which the carrying values were based. See also Note B to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for full disclosure of our accounting policies.
We believe our most critical accounting policies to be the following:
Revenue Recognition
Under ASC 606, revenue is recognized when we complete the licensing of our intellectual property to our licensees, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for licensing our intellectual property. Revenue from our patent licensing business is generated from negotiated license agreements. The timing and amount of revenue recognized from each licensee depends upon a variety of factors, including the terms of each agreement and the nature of the obligations of the parties. These agreements may include, but not be limited to, elements related to past infringement liabilities, non-refundable upfront license fees, and ongoing royalties on licensed products sold by the licensee. Generally, in the event of settlement of litigation related to our assertion of patent infringement involving our intellectual property, defendants will either pay (i) a non-refundable lump sum payment for a non-exclusive fully-paid license (a “Fully-Paid License”), or (ii) a non-refundable lump sum payment (license initiation fee) together with an ongoing obligation to pay quarterly or monthly royalties to us for the life of the licensed patent (a “Royalty Bearing License”).
We recognize revenue from our Royalty Bearing Licenses in a manner consistent with the legal form of the arrangement, and in accordance with the royalty recognition constraint that applies to licenses of IP for which some or all of the consideration is in the form of sales or usage based royalty. Consequently, we recognize revenue at the later of when (1) the subsequent sale occurs or (2) the performance obligation to which some or all of the sales based royalty has been satisfied.
Fully-Paid Licenses provide for a non-refundable up-front payment, for which we have no future obligations or performance requirements, revenue is generally recognized when we have obtained the signed license agreement, all performance obligations have been substantially performed, amounts are fixed and determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue from Fully-Paid Licenses may consist of one or more installments. The timing and amount of revenue recognized from each licensee depends upon a number of factors including the specific terms of each agreement and the nature of the deliverables and obligations.
Costs of Revenue and Related Costs
We include in costs of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 contingent legal fees payable to patent litigation counsel, any other contractual payments related to net proceeds from settlements (see Note I[2] hereof) and incentive bonus compensation payable to its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we had a change in estimate related to accrued contingency fees and related costs. The change was the result of our receiving new information reflecting additional legal costs in connection with certain contingent litigation. The effect of this change in estimate for the year ended December 31, 2020, was an increase in professional fees and related costs of $886,000 and a corresponding increase in our operating loss and net loss of $886,000, and a decrease in basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.04 per share.
