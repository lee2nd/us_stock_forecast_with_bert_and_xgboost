ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. When necessary, certain amounts in prior year financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation. The following discussion and analysis is presented to assist the reader in understanding and evaluating of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. It is intended to complement the Consolidated Financial Statements, footnotes, and supplemental financial data appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K and should be read in conjunction therewith.
Overview
The Company’s principal subsidiary is the Bank. The Bank is a Massachusetts-chartered savings bank whose primary subsidiary is a residential mortgage company, HarborOne Mortgage, acquired on July 1, 2015.
On August 14, 2019, the Company completed a second step conversion offering (the “Offering”). Prior to the completion of the Offering approximately 53% of the shares of common stock of the Company were owned by HarborOne Mutual Bancshares, a mutual holding company (the “MHC”). The Company raised gross proceeds of $310.4 million and incurred expenses of $6.3 million resulting in net cash proceeds of $304.1 million by selling 31,036,812 shares of common stock at $10.00 per share in the Offering. In addition, each share of the Company common stock owned by shareholders, other than the MHC, prior to the Offering was exchanged for 1.795431 shares of Company common stock, a total of 12,162,763 shares of Company common stock were issued in the exchange. The Company utilized $24.8 million to fund an additional ESOP loan, invested $151.3 million into the Bank’s operations, and retained the remaining amount for general corporate purposes.
As a result of the Offering, all shares and per share information prior to August 14, 2019 has been revised to reflect the 1.795431 exchange ratio. Such revised financial information presented in this Form 10-K is derived from the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company.
As described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we have two reportable segments: HarborOne Bank and HarborOne Mortgage. The Bank segment provides consumer and business banking products and services to individuals, businesses and municipalities. Consumer products include loan and deposit products, and business banking products include loans for working capital, inventory and general corporate use, commercial real estate construction loans, and deposit accounts. The HarborOne Mortgage segment consists of originating residential mortgage loans primarily for sale in the secondary market and the servicing of those loans.
The HarborOne Bank segment generates the significant majority of our consolidated net interest income and requires the provision for loan losses. The HarborOne Mortgage segment generates the majority of our noninterest income. We have provided below a discussion of the material results of operations for each segment on a separate basis for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, which focuses on noninterest income and noninterest expenses. We have also provided a discussion of the consolidated operations of the Company, which includes the operations of HarborOne Bank and HarborOne Mortgage, for the same periods.
For additional revenue, net income, assets, and other financial information for each of the Company’s reportable segments, see Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 23: Segment Reporting.”
COVID-19 Pandemic Update
The COVID-19 pandemic is a highly unusual, unprecedented and evolving public health and economic crisis that had an impact on our operations during 2020. The Company continues to take significant steps to protect the health and well-being of its employees and customers and to assist customers who have been impacted by COVID-19 including providing drive-up and appointment banking, continued access to PPP loans and payment deferrals and forbearance to commercial and consumer customers.
Company Impact and Response
Our commercial and consumer banking products and services are offered primarily in Southeastern New England, where individual and governmental responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have led to a broad curtailment of economic activity beginning in March 2020. We have been able to continue serving our customers through online banking, drive-up teller windows and pre-scheduled appointments at our branches. We implemented work-from-home protocols for non-branch staff without any degradation to customer service or operations. The Company’s COVID-19 response team continues to monitor the local impact of COVID-19 in order to

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
anticipate and respond to developments quickly and decisively. As of December 31, 2020, we do not anticipate significant challenges to our ability to maintain our systems and controls and do not currently face any material resource constraints. The Company maintains access to multiple sources of liquidity. If an extended recession caused large numbers of the Company’s deposit customers to withdraw their funds, the Company may become more reliant on volatile or more expensive sources of funding.
We provided access to the PPP to both our existing and new customers to ensure small businesses in our communities have access to this important lifeline for their businesses. Under the initial phase of the PPP we provided 1,041 loans totaling $153.0 million. As of December 31, 2020, PPP loans amounted to $126.5 million, as we had processed forgiveness on 175 loans. As of December 31, 2020, there was $2.7 million in remaining deferred processing fee income that will be recognized over the life of the loans. We continue to participate in the PPP and have provided $71.0 million in PPP-2 loans as of January 29, 2021.
We are also working with commercial loan customers that may need payment deferrals or other accommodations to keep their loans out of default through the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December 31, 2020, we have provided 171 payment deferrals on commercial loans with a total principal balance of $295.3 million, or 14.0%, of total commercial loans. Of these 90.8% of the commercial deferrals have expired and the borrower is making payments as agreed, 0.09% of the commercial deferrals have expired and the borrower is delinquent, and 9.1% are in active deferral period. The active commercial deferrals expire during 2021. We have also provided loans with other accommodations totaling $4.6 million. We continue to consider requests for additional deferrals or new deferrals at December 31, 2020 for commercial credits. Commercial credits requesting extended deferrals are reviewed on a case-by-case basis by the Credit Committee, including the appropriate risk rating.
The residential loan and consumer loan portfolios have not experienced significant credit quality deterioration as of December 31, 2020; however, the continuing impact and uncertain nature of the COVID-19 pandemic may result in increases in delinquencies, charge-offs and loan modifications in these portfolios through the remainder of 2021. As of December 31, 2020, we had provided 172 payment deferrals on residential mortgage loans with a total principal balance of $51.9 million, or 4.7% of total residential loans, of which 86.1% of the deferrals have expired and are paying as agreed and 5.4% are in active deferral periods. We had 495 payment deferrals on consumer loans with a total principal balance of $11.6 million, or 4.2%, of total consumer loans, of which 93.5% of the deferrals have expired and are paying as agreed. Requests for additional extensions on residential mortgage loans and consumer loans were not significant as of December 31, 2020.
Most initial deferrals were for a 90-day period and none were greater than 180 days. Deferrals under this program began to expire in the third quarter of 2020. The following tables provide the principal balance of loans with payment deferrals, the current status of the deferral agreement and the quarter of expected expiration for active deferrals as of December 31, 2020.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Management continues to evaluate our loan portfolio, particularly the commercial loan portfolio, in light of the expected decrease in economic activity, the mitigating effects of government stimulus, and loan modification efforts designed to limit the long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our commercial loan portfolio is diversified across many sectors and is largely secured by commercial real estate loans, which make up 73.3% of the total commercial loan portfolio. Initial assessments of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the commercial loan portfolio have been focused on sectors that have experienced a direct impact. Management has identified six sectors as the most susceptible to immediate increased credit risk: retail, office space, hotels, health and social services, restaurants, and recreation. The total loan portfolio of the six commercial sectors identified as at risk totaled $948.5 million, which represents 44.8% of the commercial loan portfolio. The at-risk sectors include $735.7 million in commercial real estate loans, $179.3 million in commercial and industrial loans, and $33.6 million in commercial construction loans.
As of December 31, 2020, the retail sector was $261.8 million, or 12.4% of total commercial loans, and included $219.8 million in commercial real estate loans, $28.6 million in commercial and industrial loans, and $13.4 million in commercial construction loans. SBA PPP loans included in this sector totaled $4.5 million. We have provided deferrals for loans in this sector with outstanding principal balances of $46.7 million, $44.7 million have expired and are paying and $2.0 million are in active deferral that will expire in 2021. New loans originated in the retail sector during 2020 generally are supported by leases to credit-related tenants such as pharmacy and grocery stores, which have been essential businesses during the pandemic.
As of December 31, 2020, the office space sector was $210.3 million, or 9.9% of total commercial loans, and included $193.1 million in commercial real estate loans, $16.3 million in commercial and industrial loans, and $854,000 in commercial construction loans. We provided deferrals for loans in the sector with outstanding principal balances of $13.4 million, all of which have expired and are paying as of December 31, 2020. No PPP loans were originated in this sector.
As of December 31, 2020, the hotel sector was $201.0 million, or 9.5% of total commercial loans, and included $190.3 million in commercial real estate loans, $2.6 million in commercial and industrial loans, and $8.0 million in commercial construction loans. PPP loans included in the sector totaled $444,000. We have provided deferrals for loans in this sector with outstanding principal balances of
HarborOne Bancorp, Inc.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
$120.4 million, $95.9 million that have expired deferral periods and are paying as agreed, and $254,000 that have expired deferral periods and are greater than 30 days delinquent and $24.2 million that are in an active deferral period. In addition, we have provided other relief for loans in this sector with outstanding principal balances of $81,000. At December 31, 2020, nonperforming loans included in the hotel sector amount to $12.2 million, including one loan that amounted to $9.0 million that is on nonaccrual and is considered impaired. This loan’s deferral period expires in the second quarter of 2021, however it was determined in the fourth quarter that weaknesses in the credit warranted a downgrade to substandard and nonaccrual status. A specific reserve of $1.8 million has been allocated to this loan.
The health and social services sector amounted to $199.3 million, or 9.4% of total commercial loans, as of December 31, 2020 and included $107.5 million in commercial real estate loans, $90.7 million in commercial and industrial loans, and $1.0 million in commercial construction loans. PPP loans included in the sector totaled $36.2 million, and we have provided deferrals for loans in this sector with outstanding principal balances of $12.6 million, all of which have expired and are paying as of December 31, 2020. New loans originated in the health and social services sector were generally owner occupied commercial real estate supported by stable and diverse medical practices.
As of December 31, 2020, the restaurant sector amounted to $55.0 million, or 2.6% of total commercial loans, including $7.3 million in PPP loans. We provided deferrals for loans in this sector with outstanding principal balances of $13.5 million. The recreation sector amounted to $21.3 million, or 1.0% of total commercial loans, including $1.8 million in PPP loans. We provided deferrals for loans in this sector with outstanding principal balances of $15.7 million. During the fourth quarter of 2020 two non-performing loans that were included in the recreation sector in previous quarters, with a recorded investment of $10.9 million, were sold and a charge off of $937,000 was recorded.
The loan portfolio has not experienced significant credit quality deterioration as of December 31, 2020, however, the continuing impact and uncertain nature of the COVID-19 pandemic may result in increases in delinquencies, charge-offs and loan modifications in these portfolios through the remainder of the year. Continued uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic effects will continue to impact the magnitude of loan loss provisions and allowance for loan losses.
While interest and fees will continue to accrue on short term deferrals, the breadth of the economic impact may affect our borrowers’ ability to repay in future periods. Should eventual credit losses on these deferred payments emerge, interest income and fees in future periods could be negatively impacted.
The impact of the pandemic on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and its customers has not been fully manifested in 2020. The fiscal stimulus and relief programs may have only delayed material adverse financial impact to the Company, and once the stimulus programs have been exhausted the Company may experience these impacts. The impacts will be contingent upon the possible resurgence of the virus, including new strains, offset by the success of the vaccine and its distribution and the ability of customers and businesses to return to their pre-pandemic routines. We anticipate continued economic uncertainty and volatility, which may have a future adverse financial impact on the Company.
Critical Accounting Policies
Certain of our accounting policies, which are important to the portrayal of our financial condition, require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances. Facts and circumstances which could affect these judgments include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rates, changes in the performance of the economy and changes in the financial condition of borrowers. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in detail in Note 1 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. As an “emerging growth company” we have elected to use the extended transition period to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. Accordingly, our Consolidated Financial Statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of public companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.
Critical accounting estimates are necessary in the application of certain accounting policies and procedures and are particularly susceptible to significant change. Critical accounting policies are defined as those involving significant judgments and assumptions by management that could have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes that the most critical accounting policies, which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments, are as follows:
HarborOne Bancorp, Inc.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses, which is charged to income. The allowance consists of general, specific reserve and unallocated components. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment. Among the material estimates required to establish the allowance are: the likelihood of default; the loss exposure at default; the amount and timing of future cash flows on impaired loans; the value of collateral; and the determination of loss factors to be applied to the various elements of the portfolio. All of these estimates are susceptible to significant change. Management reviews the level of the allowance at least quarterly and establishes the provision for loan losses based upon an evaluation of the portfolio, past loss experience, current economic conditions and other factors related to the collectability of the loan portfolio. Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic or other conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluation. In addition, the FDIC and the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. A large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance, which would adversely affect earnings. See Note 6, “Loans” within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in item 8 of this annual report.
Goodwill. The assets (including identifiable intangible assets) and liabilities acquired in a business combination are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recognized for the excess of the acquisition cost over the fair values of the net assets acquired and is not subsequently amortized. Identifiable intangible assets include core deposit premium and non-compete contracts and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives. Management assesses the recoverability of goodwill at least on an annual basis and of all intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. The impairment test uses a combined qualitative and quantitative approach. The initial qualitative approach assesses whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after this assessment, the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying value, a quantitative impairment test is performed. The quantitative impairment test compares book value to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds fair value, an impairment charge is recorded through earnings. Management has identified two reporting units for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment. The Company’s reporting units are the same as the segments used for segment reporting: the Bank, including the two security corporations and a Rhode Island passive investment corporation; and HarborOne Mortgage.
Deferred Tax Assets. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. Management reviews deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to identify any uncertainties pertaining to the realization of such assets. In determining whether a valuation allowance is required against deferred tax assets, management assesses historical and forecasted operating results, including a review of eligible carryforward periods, tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations. We believe the accounting estimate related to the valuation allowance is a critical estimate because the underlying assumptions can change from period to period. For example, tax law changes or variances in future projected operating performance could result in a change in the valuation allowance. Should actual factors and conditions differ materially from those used by management, the actual realization of net deferred tax assets could differ materially from the amounts recorded in the financial statements. If we were not able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the related valuation allowance would be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination was made and could have a negative impact on earnings. In addition, if actual factors and conditions differ materially from those used by management, we could incur penalties and interest imposed by taxing authorities.
Please see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of accounting policies.
Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019
Total Assets. Total assets increased $424.7 million, or 10.5%, to $4.48 billion at December 31, 2020 from $4.06 billion at December 31, 2019.
HarborOne Bancorp, Inc.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Cash and Cash Equivalents. At December 31, 2020 cash and cash equivalents were $205.9 million, a decrease of 2.7% from $211.6 million at December 31, 2019.
Loans Held for Sale. Loans held for sale at December 31, 2020 were $208.6 million, an increase of $98.1 million, or 88.7%, from $110.6 million at December 31, 2019, primarily reflecting higher residential mortgage loan demand in 2020 as compared to 2019.
Loans, net. At December 31, 2020, net loans were $3.44 billion, an increase of $291.7 million, or 9.3%, from $3.15 billion at December 31, 2019. Gross loans increased $323.1 million, reflecting an increase in commercial loans of $486.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in residential real estate loans of $1.3 million and a decrease in consumer loans of $162.1 million. The allowance for loan losses was $55.4 million at December 31, 2020 and $24.1 million December 31, 2019.

HarborOne Bancorp, Inc.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
The following table sets forth certain information at December 31, 2020 regarding scheduled contractual maturities during the period indicated. The table does not include any estimate of prepayments. Demand loans having no stated schedule of repayments and no stated maturity are reported as due in one year or less. The following table also sets forth the rate structure of loans scheduled to mature after one year.
Generally, the actual maturity of loans is shorter than their contractual maturity due to prepayments. The average life of residential real estate loans are impacted by the current interest rate environment. The average life tends to increase when current mortgage loan rates are higher than the rates of the loans in the portfolio and decrease when current rates are lower than the rates of the loans in the portfolio. Also, commercial and commercial real estate loans may be renewed at or near maturity resulting in significant differences in principal payments actually received as compared to amounts contractually due in a period.
Securities. Total investment securities at December 31, 2020 were $276.5 million, an increase of $10.7 million, or 4.0%, from December 31, 2019. The purchase of $191.6 million of securities was partially offset by $113.3 million in prepayments, maturities, calls and amortization of securities. Securities in the amount of $69.8 million were sold with a gross realized gain of $2.5 million. The total security portfolio represented 6.2% of total assets as of December 31, 2020, compared to 6.5% as of December 31, 2019. The following table provides the composition of our securities available for sale and our securities held to maturity at the dates indicated:

The following table sets forth the stated maturities and weighted average yields of investment securities at December 31, 2020:
Mortgage Servicing Rights. MSRs are created as a result of our mortgage banking origination activities and accounted for at fair value. At December 31, 2020, we serviced mortgage loans for others with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $3.05 billion. Total MSRs were $24.8 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $17.2 million at December 31, 2019. The $7.7 million increase was primarily additions as a result of increased mortgage origination volume and loan sales throughout 2020, partially offset by reductions due to changes in market interest rates impacting payoff volume and valuations.
The following table represents the activity for mortgage servicing rights and the related fair value changes during the periods noted:
The fair value of our MSRs is determined by a third-party provider that determines the appropriate prepayment speed, discount and default rate assumptions based on our portfolio. Management obtains and reviews the calculation. Any measurement of fair value is limited by the conditions existing and assumptions made at a particular point in time. Those assumptions may not be appropriate if they are applied to a different point in time. The following table presents weighted average assumptions utilized in determining the fair value of MSRs at December 31, 2020 and 2019:
HarborOne Bancorp, Inc.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Prepayment speeds are significantly impacted by mortgage rates. Decreasing mortgage rates normally encourage increased mortgage refinancing activity, which reduces the life of the loans underlying the mortgage servicing rights, thereby reducing the value of mortgage servicing rights. The value of mortgage servicing rights added during 2020 may not be as significantly impacted by changes in residential mortgage rates in the future due to the historically low mortgage rates during 2020.
Deposits. Deposits increased $563.3 million, or 19.1%, to $3.51 billion at December 31, 2020 from $2.94 billion at December 31, 2019. The following table sets forth information concerning the composition of deposits:
The deposit growth was driven by an increase of $519.1 million in retail deposits, a $35.0 million in municipal deposits, and an increase of $9.2 million in wholesale deposits. The increase in retail deposits was due to the increase in regular savings of $378.3 million, an increase of $283.2 million in noninterest-bearing deposits, and an increase of $52.7 million in NOW accounts, partially offset by a decrease of $170.1 million in term certificate deposits and a decrease of $25.0 million in money market accounts. Deposit growth reflects the development of commercial lending relationships, continued marketing efforts and customers maintaining liquidity.
Wholesale deposits includes brokered deposits of $100.0 million and $11.4 million in certificates of deposits from institutional investors. The Bank participates in a reciprocal deposit program that converts deposits at the Bank into multiple deposits at other financial institutions. The reciprocal deposit program provides access to FDIC-insured deposit products in aggregate amounts exceeding the current limits for depositors. Total deposits at December 31, 2020 included $104.9 million in reciprocal deposits, including $4.9 million in municipal deposits. The wholesale deposits provide a channel for the Company to seek additional funding outside the Bank’s core market. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we continued to focus on enhancing our deposit mix in order to better manage our cost of funds and to expand our customer relationships.

In August 2018, the Company issued $35.0 million in fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes. The notes bear interest at an annual fixed rate of 5.625% until September 1, 2023 at which time the interest rate resets quarterly to an interest rate per annum equal to the three month LIBOR plus 278 basis points. The notes are carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of unamortized issuance costs of $967,000 at December 31, 2020, which are being amortized over the period to maturity date.

Comparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
HarborOne Bancorp, Inc. Consolidated
Overview. Consolidated net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $44.8 million compared to net income of $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The 2020 results were significantly impacted by the earnings of HarborOne Mortgage as a result of their historical level of loan closings, contributing $41.8 million in net income. The 2020 results also include $19.6 million in provision for loan losses and $1.8 million in noninterest expense related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the 2020 results include $2.5 million in gain on sale of securities and a $1.6 million gain on the sale of VISA B shares. The 2019 results include a full year of income and expense from Coastway. Additionally, the 2019 results include $1.3 million in gain on sale of securities and a $482,000 loss on disposal of asset held for sale.
Average Balances and Yields. The following tables set forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs, and certain other information for the periods indicated, on a consolidated basis. Interest income on tax-exempt securities has been adjusted to a fully taxable-equivalent, or FTE, basis using a federal tax rate of 21% for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. All average balances are daily average balances. Non-accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances, but have been reflected in the table as loans carrying a zero yield. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or expense.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Rate/Volume Analysis. The following table presents, on a tax equivalent basis, the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the periods indicated, on a consolidated basis. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The total column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.
Interest and Dividend Income. Tax equivalent interest and dividend income decreased $6.3 million, or 4.07%, in 2020, compared to 2019, primarily reflecting the repricing of adjustable rate loans and new loan originations at lower rates. Loan interest income decreased $4.5 million to $137.8 million, average loans increased $323.6 million and the yield decreased 58 basis points from a year ago. Loan interest income includes $4.9 million, as compared to $3.6 million in 2019, in accretion income from the fair value discount on loans acquired from Coastway. Loan interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 also includes $2.5 million recognition of origination fees on the Paycheck Protection Payment loans.
Interest Expense. Compared to 2019, interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $17.2 million, or 37.7% to $28.5 million from $45.7 million. The decrease primarily reflects a 66 basis point decrease in the cost of interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by an increase of $235.3 million in average interest-bearing deposits, resulting in a $14.3 million decrease in interest expense on deposits. The cost of deposit funds was significantly impacted by falling rates and the deposit mix, as customers moved to more liquid options. Money market accounts and certificates of deposits were the primary drivers of the rate decreases, decreasing 85 basis points and 52 basis points, respectively. The cost of FHLB borrowings decreased 42 basis points and the average balance decreased $94.1 million, resulting in a $3.0 million decrease in interest expense on FHLB borrowings.
Net Interest and Dividend Income. Compared to 2019, tax equivalent net interest and dividend income for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $10.9 million, or 10.0%, to $120.1 million from $109.2 million. The tax equivalent net interest spread decreased 1 basis point to 2.80% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 2.81% for the year ended December 31, 2019, and net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis decreased 8 basis points to 3.06% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 3.14% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in margin and spread was offset by the increase in interest-earning assets.

The provision for income taxes and effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $13.2 million and 22.8%, respectively, compared to $4.4 million and 19.4%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019. The 2020 tax provision was impacted by a 2016 federal tax refund of $1.9 million recognized on the expiration of the statute of limitations. During 2019, federal and state tax refunds of $2.5 million were recognized.
Segments. The Company has two reportable segments: HarborOne Bank and HarborOne Mortgage. Revenue from HarborOne Bank consists primarily of interest earned on loans and investment securities and service charges on deposit accounts. Revenue from HarborOne Mortgage is comprised of interest earned on loans and fees received as a result of the residential mortgage origination, sale and servicing process. The table below shows the results of operations for the Company’s segments, HarborOne Bank and HarborOne Mortgage, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the increase or decrease in those results.
HarborOne Bank Segment
Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Net Income. Bank net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $15.6 million, or 74.8%, to $5.3 million from $20.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in net income reflects an increase of $30.1 million in provision for loan losses and a decrease of $1.5 million in noninterest income, partially offset by a $2.3 million decrease in noninterest expense and a decrease in provision for income taxes of $4.5 million.
Provision for Loan Losses. We recorded a provision for loan losses of $34.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The year ended December 31, 2020 included $19.6 million of provision directly related to the estimate of incurred losses and uncertainty resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The provision also includes adjustments for our historical and peer loss experience rates and commercial loan growth. Additionally, there was a provision and charge-off in the amount of $937,000 related to two non-performing commercial loans that were transferred out of the portfolio and subsequently sold during the year ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Bank recorded net charge-offs of $3.5 million compared to $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Nonaccrual loans increased to $34.1 million at December 31, 2020 from $30.3 million at December 31, 2019. The increase in nonaccrual loans is primarily due commercial real estate loans.

Noninterest Income. Compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, total noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $1.5 million, or 6.7%, to $20.7 million from $22.2 million. The following table sets forth the components on non-interest income:
The primary reasons for the changes within the noninterest income categories shown in the preceding tables are noted below:
● The Bank records an intersegment loss on loans purchased from HarborOne Mortgage that is offset in consolidation. The Bank has purchased $371.4 million residential mortgage loans from HarborOne Mortgage during 2020.
● The decrease in other deposit fees reflects fee policy changes established in response to our customer needs related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
● Other noninterest income includes $1.6 million in income from the sale of VISA B shares held in the investment portfolio.
● The gain on sale and call of securities primarily reflects gain recognized on the sale of $72.3 million of securities.
● The increase in bank-owned life insurance reflects an additional investment of $41.4 million in BOLI at the end of 2019.
● Swap fee income is collected and recorded at the time the swap contract is entered into and therefore income fluctuates as a function of the swap agreements entered into in a period.
● The loss on asset held for sale in 2019 reflects the write down to fair value on the transfer of the former Coastway corporate office in Warwick, RI to assets held for sale. The closing on the sale occurred in 2020 with no additional gain or loss being recorded at the time of sale.

Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $2.3 million, or 2.3% to $98.4 million from $100.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The following table sets forth the components on noninterest expense:
The primary reasons for the significant changes within the noninterest expense categories shown in the preceding table are noted below:
● The compensation and benefits decrease reflects a decrease in salary cost due the staff realignment that was undertaken in the third quarter and a decrease in 401(k) expense due to a change in the Company’s contribution rate from 9.3% to 5% of the social security wage base. The prior year included the accrual of compensation for the employment agreement of a former Coastway executive.
● The decreases in loan expenses is due a decrease in lease termination expense as the lease auto loan portfolio runs off.
● The increase in deposit expense reflects an increase in customer bad check losses.
● Fluctuations in marketing and professional expenses are due to strategic efforts.
● The increase in other expenses is due to $1.7 million in COVID-19 pandemic expenses partially offset by a decrease of $635,000 in amortization of core deposit intangibles.

HarborOne Mortgage Segment
Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Net Income. HarborOne Mortgage recorded a net income of $41.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to net income of $114,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The HarborOne Mortgage segment’s results are heavily impacted by prevailing rates, refinancing activity and home sales.
Noninterest Income. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, noninterest income totaled $118.5 million and $38.8 million, respectively. Noninterest income is primarily from mortgage banking income for which the following table provides further detail:
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, HarborOne Mortgage closed $2.81 billion and $1.33 billion, respectively, of residential mortgage loans. The following tables provide additional loan production detail:
The primary reason for the changes within the noninterest income categories shown in the preceding tables are noted below:
● Gain on sale of mortgage loans increased $71.9 million, or 217.3%, due to increased residential mortgage demand as a result of increased refinance and purchase activity in 2020 due to lower mortgage interest rates. Included in the gain on mortgage sales was $13.7 million of originated mortgage servicing rights for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
HarborOne Bancorp, Inc.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
● Processing, underwriting and closing fees increased, due to volume increases.
● Secondary market loan servicing fees, net of guarantee fees increased consistent with an increase in the average balance of the serviced portfolio. The unpaid balance of the servicing portfolio totaled $2.56 billion and $1.28 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
● The change in the MSR fair value is consistent with the change in the 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity rate. As interest rates fall, prepayment speeds increase and resulting in a decrease in MSR fair value. The Federal Reserve cuts to the federal funds rate resulted in the 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity rate decreasing 99 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2020, negatively impacting the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights. Decreasing interest rates generally result in a decrease in mortgage servicing rights fair value as the assumed prepayment speeds of the underlying mortgage loans tend to increase. Conversely, as interest rates rise and prepayment speeds slow, mortgage servicing rights fair value tends to increase. Residential mortgage loan payoffs also resulted in accelerated amortization of MSRs of $3.1 million and $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, mortgage servicing rights were $21.8 million and $12.4 million, respectively.
Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense increased $27.1 million or 68.2%, to $66.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $39.8 million. The following table sets forth the components on noninterest expense:
The primary reason for the changes within the noninterest expense categories shown in the preceding tables are noted below:
● The increase in compensation and benefits and loan expenses reflects increases consistent with the increase in loan origination volume.
● Occupancy and equipment expense increased due to an increase in rent on leased premises.
● The decrease in professional fees reflects 2019 consulting expenses to review the filings effected by the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and no such expenses in 2020.
● Other expenses includes $107,000 in pandemic expense with no such expense in 2019.

Comparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018
Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 are included in the December 31, 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed by HarborOne Bancorp’s predecessor company, also named HarborOne Bancorp, Inc., with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 13, 2020.
Asset Quality
The following table provides information with respect to our nonperforming assets and troubled debt restructurings at the dates indicated. We did not have any accruing loans past due 90 days or more at the dates presented.
Income related to impaired loans included in interest income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 amounted to $1.2 million, $2.0 million and $1.8 million, respectively. If nonperforming and restructured loans had been performing in accordance with their original terms, we estimate the income earned on those loans to be $2.1 million, $2.5 million and $2.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Classified Assets. Federal regulations require us to review and classify assets on a regular basis. In addition, the FDIC and the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks have the authority to identify problem assets and, if appropriate, require them to be classified. There are three classifications for problem assets: substandard, doubtful and loss. “Substandard assets” must have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. “Doubtful assets” have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values questionable, and there is a high possibility of loss. An asset classified as “loss” is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the institution is not warranted. When management classifies a loan as substandard or doubtful, a specific allowance for loan losses may be established. If management classifies a loan as loss, an amount equal to 100.0% of the portion of the loan classified loss is charged to the allowance for loan losses. The regulations also provide for a “special mention” category, described as loans that do not currently expose us to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification, but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving our close attention. We utilize a ten-grade internal loan rating system for commercial real estate, commercial construction and commercial loans. Loans not rated consist primarily of certain smaller balance commercial real estate and commercial loans that are managed by exception.
HarborOne Bancorp, Inc.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
The following table presents our risk rated loans considered classified or special mention in accordance with our internal risk rating system:
None of the special mention assets at December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018 were on nonaccrual. The increase in classified loans at December 31, 2020 was primarily caused by commercial real estate loans. As of December 31, 2020 classified loans includes two hotel loans that amount to $12.0 million and 5 loans to one borrower that amount to $5.4 million.
HarborOne Bancorp, Inc.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
At December 31, 2020, our allowance for loan losses was $55.4 million, or 1.59% of total loans and 162.44% of nonperforming loans. At December 31, 2019, our allowance for loan losses was $24.1 million, or 0.76% of total loans and 79.35% of nonperforming loans. Nonperforming loans at December 31, 2020 were $34.1 million, or 0.98% of total loans, compared to $30.3 million, or 0.96% of total loans, at December 31, 2019. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that represents management’s best estimate of losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. However, there can be no assurance that the allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover losses which may be realized in the future or that additional provisions for loan losses will not be required.
Delinquencies. The following table provides information about delinquencies in our loan portfolio at the dates indicated.

Analysis of Loan Loss Experience. The following table sets forth an analysis of the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated:
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded a provision for loan losses of $34.8 million and $4.7 million, respectively. The provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 included adjustments for our analysis of our historical and peer loss experience rates, commercial real estate loan growth, and a $19.6 million provision directly related to the estimate of incurred losses and uncertainty resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The allowance for loan losses also reflects an additional provision expense and charge-off in the amount of $937,000 related to two non-performing commercial loans that were transferred out of portfolio and subsequently sold during the year. The provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily reflected total commercial loan growth and overall credit quality indicators.
Management of Market Risk
Net Interest Income Analysis. The Bank uses income simulation as the primary tool for measuring interest-rate risk inherent in our balance sheet at a given point in time by showing the effect on net interest income, over specified time frames and using different interest rate shocks and ramps. The assumptions include, but are not limited to, management’s best assessment of the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment speeds of certain assets and liabilities, projections for account balances in each of the product lines offered and the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates. These assumptions are inherently changeable, and as a result, the model is not expected to precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from the simulated results due to timing, magnitude, and

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in the balance sheet composition and market conditions. Assumptions are supported with quarterly back-testing of the model to actual market rate shifts.
The table below presents the estimated impact of interest rate changes on our estimated net interest income over one year:
Economic Value of Equity Analysis. The Bank also uses the net present value of equity at risk, or “EVE,” methodology. This methodology calculates the difference between the present value of expected cash flows from assets and liabilities. The comparative scenarios assume an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve up 300 basis points and down 100 basis points.
The table below sets forth, as of December 31, 2020, the estimated changes in the net economic value of equity that would result from the designated changes in the United States Treasury yield curve under an instantaneous parallel shift for the Bank. Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions, including relative levels of market interest rates, loan prepayments and deposit decay, and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results.
The board of directors and management review the methodology’s measurements for both net interest income and EVE on a quarterly basis to determine whether the exposure resulting from the changes in interest rates remains within established tolerance levels and develops appropriate strategies to manage this exposure.
Liquidity Management and Capital Resources
Liquidity measures the Company’s ability to meet both current and future financial obligations of a short and long term nature. Liquidity planning is necessary for the Company to ensure it has the ability to respond to the needs of its customers as well as opportunities for earnings enhancements. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows, calls of investment securities and prepayments and sales on loans are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition.
HarborOne Bancorp, Inc.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
The Company has both a liquidity and contingent liquidity policy. The management of both policies is monitored by ALCO which is responsible for establishing and monitoring liquidity targets as well as strategies to meet these targets. The projected cash flows are stress tested quarterly to estimate the needs for contingent funding outside of the normal course of business. To supplement liquidity, the Company has available collateral at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, or FHLB of Boston and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. At December 31, 2020, the Bank had $741.7 million of additional borrowing capacity available at the FHLB of Boston and $65.3 million at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. The Bank also has a $25.0 million correspondent bank line of credit available. At December 31, 2020, the Bank had $149.1 million of borrowings outstanding with the FHLB of Boston. As of December 31, 2020, we have not experienced any signs of stress in our liquidity position as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise. Management plans to continually monitor liquidity in future periods for signs of stress resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Our cash flows are composed of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities as reported in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents. The level of these assets is dependent on our operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. At December 31, 2020 cash and cash equivalents totaled $205.9 million.
Net cash used by operating activities was $27.0 million and $36.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our primary investing activities are originating loans and purchasing securities. Net cash used in investing activities was $318.9 million and $228.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $306.4 million and $76.4 million, respectively, of loan originations, net of principal payments. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we purchased $191.6 million of securities and received proceeds from the maturities, prepayments and calls totaling $110.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, those amounts were $109.3 million and $103.3 million, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities was $340.1 million and $371.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities included $304.1 million from the offering in 2019. The net increase in deposits was $562.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to a net increase of $256.8 million for the prior year. The net decrease in borrowings was $205.0 million and $165.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
HarborOne Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements. At December 31, 2020, HarborOne Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements and was considered “well capitalized” under regulatory guidelines. See “Supervision and Regulation-Capital Adequacy and Safety and Soundness-Regulatory Capital Requirements” and Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
At December 31, 2020, we had outstanding commitments to originate loans of $539.1 million and unadvanced funds on loans of $476.1 million. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet our current loan origination commitments. Certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from December 31, 2020 totaled $682.3 million. Management expects, based on historical experience, that a substantial portion of the maturing certificates of deposit will be renewed. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits is not retained, we may use FHLB advances or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations
Commitments. We are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, which involve elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The contract amount of these instruments reflects the extent of involvement we have in these particular classes of financial instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. Our exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of the instruments. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments and unadvanced funds on lines-of-credit generally have fixed expiration dates and may expire without being drawn upon. Therefore, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We evaluate each customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. In addition, from time to time we enter into commitments to sell mortgage loans that we originate. For additional information, see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
HarborOne Bancorp, Inc.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Contractual Obligations. We are obligated to make future payments according to various contracts. The following table presents the expected future payments of contractual obligations aggregated by obligation type at December 31, 2020. FHLB advances payments are assumed to be at call date, subordinated notes are assumed to be a redemption date and certificate of deposits are assumed to occur at maturity.
Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices
Our Consolidated Financial Statements, including the notes thereto, and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). GAAP generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration of changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations. Unlike industrial companies, our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature. As a result, changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than the effects of inflation.
