Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Until December 31, 2020, the Company continued to manage the Alleghany subsidiary SORC. See “Item 1. Business” for a discussion of our business and our transactions with SORC. On December 31, 2020, the Company purchased 100% of the stock of SORC from Alleghany. Prior to its purchase by the Company, SORC sold the assets of three major projects, described below, and transferred funds therefrom to Alleghany. The Company acquired vehicles and oil field assets with the SORC purchase that were not included in the project sales.
The first project was located in Kansas. SORC funds had been used to acquire oil and gas leases and to purchase mineral rights totaling approximately 2,500 acres and used to construct and develop an Underground Gravity Drainage (“UGD”) facility. SORC completed construction of its underground facility in 2014 and commenced its drilling program in 2015. After a thorough evaluation of the project, SORC sold substantially all its assets to third parties as of December 29, 2017 and no longer had oil and gas properties in Kansas.
The second project was located in Louisiana where SORC had acquired oil and gas leases on approximately 9,244 acres in a targeted oil reservoir. The oil field assets there were operational, producing crude oil using both conventional and UGD production methods, and were sold to a third party effective July 1, 2020.
The third project was located in Wyoming. On January 30, 2015, SORC, through one of its subsidiaries, purchased the Department of Energy’s Naval Petroleum Reserve Number 3 (NPR-3), the Teapot Dome Oilfield, for $45.2 million. The purchase culminated a competitive bidding process that closed on October 16, 2014. Under the terms of the sale, operation and ownership of all of NPR-3’s mineral rights and approximately 9,000 acres of land immediately transferred to SORC. The remaining surface acreage transferred in June 2015, bringing the total acres purchased to 9,318. The oil field there was sold to a third party on December 31, 2020.
During the period from June 14, 2011 through December 31, 2020, Company management gained specialized know-how and operational experience implementing UGD projects, as well as experience developing conventional oil wells. Based upon the knowledge gained, the Company has identified and has acquired 23,739.9 acres of mineral properties in Montana with the intention to drill a development well there in calendar year 2021 and, based upon successful results, will develop the field thereafter.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As a result of the SORC Purchase Transaction, the Company is no longer entitled to receive management fee revenue or operations reimbursements from Alleghany or SORC. Further, the Company is no longer entitled to any Royalty cash distributions from Alleghany or SORC. The Company plans to use its cash and cash equivalents on hand, and the proceeds from the Consulting Agreement, to maintain the mineral rights acquisition program in Montana and to pay its operating costs.
On April 28, 2020, the Company entered into a note in the amount of $1,233,656 (the “First PPP Note”) pursuant to the terms of the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) authorized by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act (the “Program”). The Program provides loans to qualifying businesses for amount up to 2.5 times the average monthly payroll expenses of the qualifying business. On July 19, 2021, the Company was notified that the SBA forgave $1,209,809 of the note, leaving $23,847 payable over the remaining life of the five-year loan. The loan will be repaid through monthly payments of principal and accrued interest in the amount of $559 beginning September 1, 2021 and ending April 28, 2025 with the final payment including all outstanding principal as well as accrued interest through that date.
Effective as of February 3, 2021, the Company entered into a note in the amount of $1,233,655 (the “Second PPP Note” and, together with the First PPP Note, the “PPP Notes”) for a second draw under the Program.
Under the terms of the Second PPP Note, PPP loan participants can apply for and be granted forgiveness for all or a portion of the loan (including interest) granted pursuant to the PPP. Such forgiveness will be determined, subject to limitations, based on the use of the loan proceeds for eligible purposes. No assurance can be given that the Company will obtain forgiveness of the Second PPP Note, in whole or part.

Results of Operations
Pursuant to the Management Services Agreement with SORC, which terminated effective December 31, 2020 in connection with the SORC Purchase Transaction, the Company received and recorded management fee revenue and direct costs totaling $4,015,763 and $4,775,976, respectively, for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2021 and $8,145,167 and $7,968,985, respectively, for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2020. The decrease in revenues and direct costs is primarily attributable to the termination of the MSA with SORC resulting in a reduction in force contributing to the decrease in employee related costs as well as the cessation of the related monthly and quarterly management fee revenues in fiscal year ending May 31, 2021 as compared to fiscal year ending May 31, 2020. Offsetting the decrease in the management fee revenue is an increase in other revenue totaling $576,863 recorded for continued consulting services after the termination of the MSA.
During the years ended May 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, we incurred operating expenses of $499,332 and $307,048. These expenses consisted of general operating expenses incurred in connection with the day to day operation of our business, the preparation and filing of our required reports and stock option compensation expense. The increase in expenses for the year ended May 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 is primarily attributable to consulting and legal costs related to investment in Cat Creek and the Securities Purchase Agreement. The Company also experienced increases in other general and administrative expenses including insurance, IT and internet services and transfer agent fees, as well as depreciation expense in connection with the acquired property, plant and equipment.
Due to the nature of the Agreements, the Company is relatively unaffected by the impact of inflation. Usually, when general price inflation occurs, the price of crude oil increases as well, which may have a positive effect on sales. However, as the price of oil increases, it also most likely will result in making targeted oil fields more expensive.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The process of preparing consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of liabilities and stockholders’ equity/(deficit) at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates in these consolidated financial statements include estimates related to purchase price allocation. Changes in the status of certain facts or circumstances could result in a material change to the estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not currently have any off-balance sheet arrangements or other such unrecorded obligations, and we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party.
