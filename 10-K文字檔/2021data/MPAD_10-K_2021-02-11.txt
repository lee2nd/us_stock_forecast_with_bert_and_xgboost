The Company designs, manufactures and distributes various types of microelectronic circuits including solid state relays and power controllers, optoelectronic components, and sensor and display components and assemblies. The Company’s products are used as components and assemblies in a broad range of military, space and industrial systems, including aircraft instrumentation and navigation systems, satellite systems, power supplies, electronic controls, computers, medical devices, and high-temperature (200o C) products.
The Company’s facilities are certified and qualified by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) to MIL-PRF-38534 (class K-space level) and MIL-PRF-19500 JANS (space level) and are certified to ISO 9001:2008 and AS 9100C. Micropac is a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) core supplier, and is registered to AS9100-Aerospace Industry standard for supplier certification. The Company has Underwriters Laboratories (UL) approval on our industrial power controllers.
The Company’s core technology is microelectronic and optoelectronic designs to include the packaging and interconnecting of multi-chip microelectronics modules. Other technologies include light emitting and light sensitive materials and products, including light emitting diodes and silicon phototransistors, and electronic integration used in the Company’s optoelectronic components and assemblies.
Company sales totaled $22,274,000 resulting in a decrease of $3,176,000 from 2020. The majority of the decrease in sales were due to timing of shipments of $8,268,000 of backlog from customers on custom sensor products and a decrease in sales of space level solid state relays compared to 2019.
At November 30, 2020, the Company had a backlog of unfilled orders totaling approximately $29,793,000 compared to approximately $22,021,000 at November 30, 2019. The majority of the increase was associated with 3 new custom products orders for $4,000,000 and an increase in $2,900,000 in orders on existing products.
New orders for fiscal year 2020 totaled $30,012,000 compared to $30,179,000 for fiscal 2019. Approximately $6,677,000 of the new orders received in 2020 was delivered to customers in 2020, along with approximately $15,597,000 of the Company’s $22,021,000 backlog of orders at November 30, 2019 resulting in revenue of $22,208,000.
Cost of goods sold, as a percentage of net sales, was 61.4% in 2020 compared to 54.0% in 2019 with lower margins from the decrease in sales of space level solid state relay microelectronic products. In actual dollars, cost of sales decreased $78,000 for 2020 versus 2019. The delay in shipments of custom products, lower sales of space level solid state relays with traditional higher margins, and approximately $540,000 associated with COVID-19 production down time resulted in lower overall gross margin.
In 2020, the Company’s investment in technology through research and development, which was expensed, totaled
approximately $1,431,000 ($1,707,000 in 2019). The Company’s research and development expenditures were directed primarily toward standard proprietary microelectronic products, including industrial power controllers and DC-DC converters, fiber optic transceivers, high voltage optocouplers and continued product development and improvement associated with the Company’s space level and other high reliability products.
In addition to the Company’s investment in research and development, various customers paid the Company approximately $2,227,000 in non-recurring engineering revenue with $1,722,000 recorded within cost of goods sold associated with the development of custom products for specific applications.
Selling, general, and administrative expenses totaled 24.9% of net sales in 2020 compared to 22.3% in 2019. In dollars expensed, selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $5,543,000 in 2020 as compared to $5,673,000 in 2019, an decrease or $130,000.
Other income and net interest income for fiscal 2020 totaled $65,000 compared to $122,000 for fiscal 2019.
Income before taxes for fiscal 2020 was approximately $1,690,000, or 7.6% of net sales, compared to $4,439,000, or 17.4% of net sales in fiscal 2019.
Provisions for income tax for fiscal 2020 totaled $218,000 compared $726,000 for fiscal 2019. The Company’s effective income tax rate was 13.0% for the year ended November 30, 2020 and 16.5% for the year ended November 30, 2019.
Net income totaled approximately $1,472,000 or $0.57 per share in 2020 versus 2019 net income of $3,713,000 or $1.44 per share.
Impact of COVID-19 on our Business
The spread of the COVID-19 virus during the first half of 2020 has caused an economic downturn on a global scale, as well as significant volatility in the financial markets. In March 2020 the World Health Organization declared the spread of the COVID-19 virus a pandemic. The Company continues to monitor our supply chain and orders from customers for COVID-19 pandemic related changes. In this time of uncertainty as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are continuing to serve our customers while taking precautions to provide a safe work environment for our employees and customers. We have been staggering some shifts and otherwise adjusting work schedules to maximize our capacity while adhering to recommended precautions such as social distancing. We have established and implemented a work from home provision where possible. We may have to take further actions that we determine are in the best interests of our employees or as required by federal, state, or local authorities.
We experienced multiple confirmed case of COVID-19 during 2020, which caused us to shut down our Garland facility for a few days to thoroughly clean the facility and address employee concerns. Production in the Garland facility has been impacted, although we are not able to quantify the impact at this time. Our maquiladora contractor in Mexico was shut down during April and May but reopened as of mid-June at limited capacity due to local restrictions in that area. We have relocated some of that production to our Garland facility. We are working with our customers to meet their current requirements and believe that our customers have not incurred any major impact related to our position in their supply chain as of the date of this filing. The combined impact of reduced production in the Garland facility as well as stopped production from Mexico has impacted our cost of production by an estimated 2% to 3% in 2020 due to overhead cost that could not be allocated to work in process.
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold. The extent of the pandemic’s effect on our operational and financial performance will depend in large part on future developments, which cannot be predicted with confidence at this time. Future developments include the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain or mitigate its impact, the impact on governmental programs and budgets, the development of treatments or vaccines, and the resumption of widespread economic activity. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the unprecedented and rapidly evolving situation, we are unable to predict with any confidence the likely impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our future operations.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
On August 29, 2019, the Company renewed the Loan Agreement with a Texas banking institution. The Loan Agreement provides for revolving credit loans, in amounts not to exceed a total principal balance of $6,000,000 with a rate equal to prime rate. The Loan Agreement also contains financial covenants to maintain at all times including (i) minimum working capital of not less than $4,000,000, (ii) a ratio of senior funded debt, minus the Company’s balance sheet cash on hand to the extent in excess of $2,000,000 to EBITDA of not more than 3.0 to 1.0, and (iii) a ratio of free cash flow to debt service of not less than 1.2 to 1.0. The Company has not, to date, drawn any amounts under the revolving line
of credit and is currently in compliance with the financial covenants. The Company has not received any indication that borrowing under the Loan Agreement may be restricted due to COVID-19 uncertainties. The agreement termination date is April 23, 2021.
On April 17, 2020, Micropac Industries, Inc. (the Company) obtained an unsecured $1,924,400 loan under the Paycheck Protection Program (the PPP Loan). The Paycheck Protection Program (or PPP) was established under the recently congressionally-approved Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act) and is administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration. The PPP Loan to the Company is being made through Frost Bank, the Company s existing lender (the Lender).
Based upon updated guidance issued April 23, 2020 by the Federal Government including a presumption that no publicly traded companies with sources of liquidity are eligible for a PPP loan, the Company returned the loan proceeds within the time period imposed under these new guidelines and paid off the loan on May 4, 2020.
The Company used $416,000 of cash from operating activities in 2020 compared to the $3,944,000 of cash provided by operating activities in 2019. The decrease in net cash provided by operations is due to lower revenues in 2020 and an increase in inventory associated with the increase in backlog. The Company used $686,000 in cash for investment in additional manufacturing equipment and construction in process on the new facility in 2020 compared to $249,000 in 2019.
The Company issued a dividend payment of $0.10 per share to all shareholders of record for each of the last two years. The total dividend payment was $258,000 per year.
As of November 30, 2020, the Company had $14,619,000 in cash and cash equivalents compared to $13,890,000 in cash and cash equivalents on November 30, 2019. The Company held $2,089,000 in short term investments at November 30, 2019.
The Company anticipates that it will use a combination of cash and a commercial real estate construction loan for the construction of a new 76,000 square foot manufacturing center on the 9.2 acres of land in Garland, Texas the Company purchased. In addition, the Company continues on-going investigations for the use of cumulative cash for business expansion and improvements, such as operational improvements and new product expansion.
Company management believes it will meet its 2021 capital requirements through the use of cash derived from operations for the year and/or usage of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents. There were no significant outstanding commitments for equipment purchases or improvements at November 30, 2020.
The Company has no significant off-balance sheet arrangements.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions and factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Note 2 to the Financial Statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2020, describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Financial Statements. liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
The core principle of revenue recognition under accounting principles generally accepted in the Unites States of America (GAAP) is that the Company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company’s revenue on the majority of its customer contracts are recognized at a point in time, generally upon shipment of products. The application of GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates. Specifically, the determination of whether revenues related to our revenue contracts should be recognized over time or at a point in time, as these determinations impact the timing and amount of our reported revenues and net income. Other significant judgments include the estimation of the point in the manufacturing process at which we are entitled to receive payment, as well as the progress of the job order to completion in order to determine the amount of consideration earned for contractual revenue recognized over time.
The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable. If there is a deterioration of a major customer’s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be adversely affected.
Inventory purchases and commitments are based upon future demand. If there is a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products or there is a higher risk of inventory obsolescence because of changing customer requirements, we may be required to increase our inventory allowances and our gross margin could be adversely affected.
The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered. If we were to determine we would not be able to realize all or part of the deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be necessary which would reduce our net income for that period.
Depreciable and useful lives estimated for property and equipment are based on initial expectations of the period of time these assets will provide benefit. Changes in circumstances related to a change in our business or other factors could result in these assets becoming impaired, which could adversely affect the value of these assets.
New Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which changes the impairment model for most financial assets. The ASU requires the use of an “expected loss” model for instruments measured at amortized cost, in which companies will be required to estimate the lifetime expected credit loss and record an allowance to offset the amortized cost basis, resulting in a net presentation of the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 for Smaller Reporting Companies, including interim periods within those fiscal years and requires a modified-retrospective approach to adoption. The Company believes that adopting ASU 2016-13 will have no material impact on the financial statements and related disclosures.
