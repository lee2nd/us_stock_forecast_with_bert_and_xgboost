Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.
Overview
We are a medical technology company focused on developing innovative medical devices that have the potential to improve healthcare. Our primary focus is the sales and marketing of our LuViva® Advanced Cervical Scan non-invasive cervical cancer detection device. The underlying technology of LuViva primarily relates to the use of biophotonics for the non-invasive detection of cancers. LuViva is designed to identify cervical cancers and precancers painlessly, non-invasively and at the point of care by scanning the cervix with light, then analyzing the reflected and fluorescent light.
LuViva provides a less invasive and painless alternative to conventional tests for cervical cancer screening and detection. Additionally, LuViva improves patient well-being not only because it eliminates pain, but also because it is convenient to use and provides rapid results at the point of care. We focus on two primary applications for LuViva: first, as a cancer screening tool in the developing world, where infrastructure to support traditional cancer-screening methods is limited or non-existent, and second, as a triage following traditional screening in the developed world, where a high number of false positive results cause a high rate of unnecessary and ultimately costly follow-up tests.
We are a Delaware corporation, originally incorporated in 1992 under the name “SpectRx, Inc.,” and, on February 22, 2008, changed our name to Guided Therapeutics, Inc. At the same time, we renamed our wholly owned subsidiary, InterScan, which originally had been incorporated as “Guided Therapeutics.”
Since our inception, we have raised capital through the public and private sale of debt and equity, funding from collaborative arrangements, and grants.
Our prospects must be considered in light of the substantial risks, expenses and difficulties encountered by entrants into the medical device industry. This industry is characterized by an increasing number of participants, intense competition and a high failure rate. We have experienced operating losses since our inception and, as of December 31, 2020 we have an accumulated deficit of approximately $140.0 million. To date, we have engaged primarily in research and development efforts and the early stages of marketing our products. We do not have significant experience in manufacturing, marketing or selling our products. We may not be successful in growing sales for our products. Moreover, required regulatory clearances or approvals may not be obtained in a timely manner, or at all. Our products may not ever gain market acceptance and we may not ever generate significant revenues or achieve profitability. The development and commercialization of our products requires substantial development, regulatory, sales and marketing, manufacturing and other expenditures. We expect our operating losses to continue for the foreseeable future as we continue to expend substantial resources to complete commercialization of our products, obtain regulatory clearances or approvals, build our marketing, sales, manufacturing and finance capabilities, and conduct further research and development.
Our product revenues to date have been limited. In 2020, the majority of our revenues were from the sale of components of our LuViva devices and disposables. We expect that the majority of our revenue in 2021 will be derived from revenue from the sale of LuViva devices and disposables.
Current Demand for LuViva
Based on discussions with our distributors, we currently hold and expect to generate additional purchase orders for approximately $2.0 to $3.0 million in LuViva devices and disposables in 2021 and expect those purchase orders to result in actual sales of $1.0 to $2.0 million in 2021, representing what we view as current demand for our products. We cannot be assured that we will generate all or any of these additional purchase orders, or that existing orders will not be canceled by the distributors or that parts to build product will be available to meet demand, such that existing orders will result in actual sales. Because we have a short history of sales of our products, we cannot confidently predict future sales of our products beyond this time frame and cannot be assured of any particular amount of sales. Accordingly, we have not identified any particular trends with regard to sales of our products.
Recent Developments
A 1:800 reverse stock split of all of our issued and outstanding common stock was implemented on March 29, 2019. As a result of the reverse stock split, every 800 shares of issued and outstanding common stock were converted into 1 share of common stock. All fractional shares created by the reverse stock split were rounded to the nearest whole share. The number of authorized shares of common stock did not change.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our material accounting policies, which we believe are the most critical to investors understanding of our financial results and condition, are discussed below. Because we are still early in our enterprise development, the number of these policies requiring explanation is limited. As we begin to generate increased revenue from different sources, we expect that the number of applicable policies and complexity of the judgments required will increase.
Revenue Recognition: ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers establishes a single and comprehensive framework which sets out how much revenue is to be recognized, and when. The core principle is that a vendor should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the vendor expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue will now be recognized by a vendor when control over the goods or services is transferred to the customer. In contrast, Revenue based revenue recognition around an analysis of the transfer of risks and rewards; this now forms one of a number of criteria that are assessed in determining whether control has been transferred. The application of the core principle in ASC 606 is carried out in five steps: Step 1 - Identify the contract with a customer: a contract is defined as an agreement (including oral and implied), between two or more parties, that creates enforceable rights and obligations and sets out the criteria for each of those rights and obligations. The contract needs to have commercial substance and it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration to which it will be entitled. Step 2 - Identify the performance obligations in the contract: a performance obligation in a contract is a promise (including implicit) to transfer a good or service to the customer. Each performance obligation should be capable of being distinct and is separately identifiable in the contract. Step 3 - Determine the transaction price: transaction price is the amount of consideration that the entity can be entitled to, in exchange for transferring the promised goods and services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties. Step 4 - Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract: for a contract that has more than one performance obligation, the entity will allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation separately, in exchange for satisfying each performance obligation. The acceptable methods of allocating the transaction price include adjusted market assessment approach, expected cost plus a margin approach, and, the residual approach in limited circumstances. Discounts given should be allocated proportionately to all performance obligations unless certain criteria are met and reallocation of changes in standalone selling prices after inception is not permitted. Step 5 - Recognize revenue as and when the entity satisfies a performance obligation: the entity should recognize revenue at a point in time, except if it meets any of the three criteria, which will require recognition of revenue over time: the entity’s performance creates or enhances an asset controlled by the customer, the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of the entity’s performance as the entity performs, and the entity does not create an asset that has an alternative use to the entity and the entity has the right to be paid for performance to date.
Valuation of Deferred Taxes: We account for income taxes in accordance with the liability method. Under the liability method, we recognize deferred assets and liabilities based upon anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. We establish a valuation allowance to the extent that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be utilized against future taxable income.
Valuation of Equity Instruments Granted to Employee, Service Providers and Investors: On the date of issuance, the instruments are recorded at their fair value as determined using either the Black-Scholes valuation model or Monte Carlo Simulation model.
Beneficial Conversion Features of Convertible Securities: Conversion options that are not bifurcated as a derivative pursuant to ASC 815 and not accounted for as a separate equity component under the cash conversion guidance are evaluated to determine whether they are beneficial to the investor at inception (a beneficial conversion feature) or may become beneficial in the future due to potential adjustments. The beneficial conversion feature guidance in ASC 470-20 applies to convertible stock as well as convertible debt which are outside the scope of ASC 815. A beneficial conversion feature is defined as a nondetachable conversion feature that is in the money at the commitment date. The beneficial conversion feature guidance requires recognition of the conversion option’s in-the-money portion, the intrinsic value of the option, in equity, with an offsetting reduction to the carrying amount of the instrument. The resulting discount is amortized as a dividend over either the life of the instrument, if a stated maturity date exists, or to the earliest conversion date, if there is no stated maturity date. If the earliest conversion date is immediately upon issuance, the dividend must be recognized at inception. When there is a subsequent change to the conversion ratio based on a future occurrence, the new conversion price may trigger the recognition of an additional beneficial conversion feature on occurrence.
Allowance for Accounts Receivable: We estimate losses from the inability of our distributors to make required payments and periodically review the payment history of each of our distributors, as well as their financial condition, and revise our reserves as a result.
Inventory Valuation: All inventories are stated at lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined substantially on a “first-in, first-out” basis. Selling, general, and administrative expenses are not inventoried, but are charged to expense when purchased.
Reverse Stock Split: On March 29, 2019, the Company implemented a 1:800 reverse stock split of all of our issued and outstanding common stock. As a result of the reverse stock split, every 800 shares of issued and outstanding common stock were converted into 1 share of common stock. All fractional shares created by the reverse stock split were rounded to the nearest whole share. The number of authorized shares of common stock did not change. The reverse stock split decreased the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock from 2,135,478,405 shares of Common Stock to 2,669,348 shares as of that date.
Results of Operations
Comparison of 2020 and 2019
Sales Revenue, Cost of Sales and Gross Profit from Devices and Disposables: Revenues from the sale of other parts of our LuViva devices for 2020 and 2019 was approximately $102,000 and $36,000, respectively. Revenues for 2020 was approximately, $66,000 or 183% higher when compared to the same period in 2019, due to a sale of parts to one customer in 2020. Related cost of sales recovered was approximately $41,000 for 2020 compared to $70,000 cost of sales for 2019, a decrease of $111,000 or 159%. Cost of sales recovered was a result of the buy-back of parts from one customer that were then sold and the revaluation of inventory reserve, the net effect was a cost of goods sold recovered. This resulted in a gross profit of approximately $143,000 on the sales of devices and disposables for 2020 compared with a gross loss of approximately $34,000 for the same period in 2019.
Research and Development Expenses: Research and development expenses for 2020, increased to approximately $143,000, from approximately $122,000 to the same period in 2019. The increase of $21,000, or 17%, was primarily due to increases in research and development costs and salaries incurred in 2020.
Sales and Marketing Expenses: Sales and marketing expenses for 2020, increased to approximately $139,000, compared to $87,000 for the same period in 2019. The increase, of approximately $52,000, or 60% was primarily due to higher payroll expenses for 2020.
General and Administrative Expense: General and administrative expenses for 2020, increased to approximately $913,000, compared to $694,000 for the same period in 2019. The increase of approximately $219,000, or 32%, was primarily related to higher compensation, stock based compensation and insurance expenses incurred during the same period. During 2020, the Company had also reversed a $292,000 reserve taken for a deposit made for inventory parts for its devices, and the Company recorded stock based compensation expense of $310,000 for stock options granted in July 2020.
Other Income: Other income for 2020, increased to approximately $271,000, compared to $48,000 for the same period in 2019. The increase of approximately $223,000 or 465% was primarily a result of the recovery of employment expenses and old outstanding payables which had exceeded their statute of limitations on collectability.
Interest Expense: Interest expense for 2020 decreased to approximately $1,056,000, compared to $1,412,000 for the same period in 2019. The decrease of approximately $356,000, or 25%, was primarily related to amortization expense of and interest recorded for the value of the beneficial conversion feature on convertible debt outstanding and amortization of debt issuance costs.
Loss from Extinguishment of Debt: Loss from extinguishment of debt for 2020 increased to approximately $296,000, compared to nil for the same period in 2019. The increase of approximately $296,000, or 100%, was primarily related to debt that had been eliminated from debt exchange agreements and debt reduction through exchanges and forgiveness.
Fair Value of Derivative Liability: Fair value of derivatives for 2020, increased to approximately $25,000 compared to fair value of derivatives expense of $0 for the same period in 2019. The increase of approximately $25,000, or 100% was primarily due to changes to the derivative liability for a short-term convertible note payable in 2020.
Fair Value of Warrants: Fair value of warrants recovered for 2020, increased to approximately $1,879,000 compared to fair value of warrants recovered of $380,000 for the same period in 2019. The increase of approximately $1,499,000, or 394% was primarily due to favorable significant changes in common stock warrant conversion prices, a reduction in the number of outstanding warrants and an increase in the warrant conversion price in 2020.
Net Loss: Net loss attributable to common stockholders decreased to approximately $401,000, or $0.04 per share for 2020, from a net loss of $1,921,000, or $0.58 per share, for the same period in 2019. The decrease in the net loss of $1,520,000, or 79% was for reasons outlined above. As stated previously, our net loss for 2020, would have been greater if it were not for favorable results from changes in the fair value of warrants, favorable significant changes in common stock warrant conversion prices, a reduction in the number of outstanding warrants and an increase in the warrant conversion price in 2020.
There was no income tax benefit recorded for 2020 or 2019, due to recurring net operating losses.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Since our inception, we have raised capital through the public and private sale of debt and equity, funding from collaborative arrangements, and grants. At December 31, 2020, we had cash of approximately $182,000 and negative working capital of approximately $8,000,000.
Our major cash flows for 2020 consisted of cash out-flows of $1.9 million from operations, including approximately $0.4 million of net loss, (as stated previously, our net loss for 2020, would have been greater if it were not for favorable results from changes in the fair value of warrants, favorable significant changes in common stock warrant conversion prices, a reduction in the number of outstanding warrants and an increase in the warrant conversion price), and a net change from financing activities of $1.2 million; which primarily represented the proceeds received from issuance of preferred stock, common stock and warrants, loans and payments made on notes payable.

This resulted in a net loss on extinguishment of debt of $118,396 ($446,818 fair value less the $328,422 of exchanged debt). During 2020, we paid $100,000 and $20,000 of common stock to reduce the outstanding balance. As of December 31, 2020, a balance of $40,000 remained to be paid for these exchanged loans.

The notes may be prepaid in accordance with the terms set forth in the notes. The notes also contain certain representations, warranties, covenants and events of default including if we are delinquent in our periodic report filings with the SEC and increases in the amount of the principal and interest rates under the notes in the event of such defaults. In the event of default, at Adar’s option and in its sole discretion, Adar may consider the notes immediately due and payable. In addition, we had recorded a $38,500 beneficial conversion feature, $5,250 original issue discount and $7,500 of debt issuance costs. As of December 31, 2019, the note outstanding increased to $84,780 as a default penalty of $27,030 was added to the outstanding balance of the note, which consisted of unamortized balance of $14,438 of a beneficial conversion feature, unamortized original issue discount of $1,942, unamortized debt issuance costs of $2,774 and interest of $3,190 included in accrued expenses on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. On May 22, 2020, the outstanding note was paid off.
We will be required to raise additional funds through public or private financing, additional collaborative relationships or other arrangements, as soon as possible. We cannot be certain that our existing and available capital resources will be sufficient to satisfy our funding requirements through 2021. We are evaluating various options to further reduce our cash requirements to operate at a reduced rate, as well as options to raise additional funds, including loans.
Generally, substantial capital will be required to develop our products, including completing product testing and clinical trials, obtaining all required U.S. and foreign regulatory approvals and clearances, and commencing and scaling up manufacturing and marketing our products. Any failure to obtain capital would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Based on discussions with our distributors, we currently hold and expect to generate additional purchase orders for approximately $2.0 to $3.0 million in LuViva devices and disposables in 2021 and expect those purchase orders to result in actual sales of $1.0 to $2.0 million in 2021, representing what we view as current demand for our products. The primary source for 2021 projected sales revenue is an existing $2.5 million purchase order from SMI, our distribution and manufacturing partner for China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. While we project that a portion of this purchase order will be paid before the end of 2021, we cannot be assured that this payment will be not be delayed or canceled, just as we cannot be assured that we will generate all or any of a number of other purchase orders, or that existing orders will not be canceled by the distributors or that parts to build product will be available to meet demand, such that existing orders will result in actual sales. Because we have a short history of sales of our products, we cannot confidently predict future sales of our products beyond this time frame and cannot be assured of any particular amount of sales. Accordingly, we have not identified any particular trends with regard to sales of our products.
Our financial statements have been prepared and presented on a basis assuming we will continue as a going concern. The above factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, as more fully discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained herein and in the report of our independent registered public accounting firm accompanying our financial statements contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Contingencies
Based on the current outbreak of the Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen responsible for COVID-19, which has already had an impact on financial markets, there could be additional repercussions in our operating business, including but not limited to, the sourcing of materials for product candidates, manufacture of supplies for preclinical and/or clinical studies, delays in clinical operations, which may include the availability or the continued availability of patients for trials due to such things as quarantines, conduct of patient monitoring and clinical trial data retrieval at investigational study sites.
The future impact of the outbreak is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, and we cannot provide any assurance that the outbreak will not have a material adverse impact on our operations or future results or filings with regulatory health authorities. The extent of the impact, if any, we will depend on future developments, including actions taken to contain the coronavirus.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements, no special purpose entities, and no activities that include non-exchange-traded contracts accounted for at fair value.
