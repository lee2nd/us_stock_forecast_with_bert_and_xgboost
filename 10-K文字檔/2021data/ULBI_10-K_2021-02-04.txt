ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
The financial information in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is presented in thousands of dollars, except for share and per share amounts. All figures presented below represent results from continuing operations, unless otherwise specified.
General
We offer products and services ranging from power solutions to communications and electronics systems to customers across the globe in the government, defense and commercial sectors. With an emphasis on strong engineering and a collaborative approach to problem solving, we design, manufacture, install and maintain power and communications systems including rechargeable and non-rechargeable batteries, communications and electronics systems and accessories and custom engineered systems. We sell our products internationally through a variety of trade channels, including original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), industrial and defense supply distributors and directly to U.S. and international defense departments.
We report our results in two operating segments: Battery & Energy Products and Communications Systems. The Battery & Energy Products segment includes Lithium 9-volt, cylindrical, thin cell and various other non-rechargeable batteries, in addition to rechargeable batteries, uninterruptable power supplies, charging systems and accessories, such as cables. The Communications Systems segment includes RF amplifiers, power supplies, cable and connector assemblies, amplified speakers, equipment mounts, case equipment, integrated communication systems for fixed or vehicle applications and communications and electronics systems design. We believe that reporting performance at the gross profit level is the best indicator of segment performance. As such, we report segment performance at the gross profit level and operating expenses as Corporate charges.
We continually evaluate ways to grow, including opportunities to expand through mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures, which we believe can broaden the scope of our products and services, expand operating and market opportunities and provide the ability to enter new lines of business synergistic with our portfolio of product offerings.
In January 2016, we acquired Accutronics Limited (“Accutronics”), a U.K. corporation based in Newcastle-under-Lyme, U.K., a leading independent designer and manufacturer of smart batteries and charger systems for high-performance, feature-laden portable and handheld electronic devices. We acquired Accutronics to advance our strategy of commercial revenue diversification, to expand our geographic penetration, and to achieve revenue growth from new product development.
On May 1, 2019, we acquired Southwest Electronic Energy Corporation, a Texas corporation (“SWE”), and a leading designer and manufacturer of high-performance smart battery systems and battery packs to customer specifications using lithium cells. SWE serves a variety of industrial markets, including oil and gas, remote monitoring, process control and marine, which demand uncompromised safety, service, reliability and quality. We acquired SWE as a bolt-on acquisition to further support our strategy of commercial revenue diversification by providing entry to the oil and gas exploration and production, and subsea electrification markets, which were previously unserved by us. Another key benefit includes obtaining a highly valuable technical team of battery pack and charger system engineers and technicians to add to our new product development-based revenue growth initiatives in our commercial end-markets particularly asset tracking, smart metering and other industrial applications.
Currently, we do not experience significant seasonal sales trends in any of our operating segments, although sales to the U.S. Department of Defense and other international defense organizations can be sporadic based on the needs of those particular customers and allocated funding levels.
The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant economic disruption and uncertainty around the world. The Company continues to closely monitor the developments surrounding COVID-19 and take actions to mitigate the business risks involved. During this challenging time, we remain focused on ensuring the health and safety of our employees by implementing the protocols established by public health officials in addition to meeting the demand of our customers. As an essential supplier currently exempt from government-mandated shutdown directives, we are striving to ensure an uninterrupted flow of our mission critical products serving medical device, first responder, public safety, energy and national security customers. For 2020, we have maintained normal operations at all our facilities with the exception of an approximately one-month closure of our China facility as was mandated by the Chinese government through early March 2020.
For 2020, we estimate that the net impact of COVID-19 was a reduction to sales of approximately $7,000, a reduction to operating income of approximately $2,600 and a reduction to net income of approximately $2,000 or approximately $0.12 per diluted share. Demand for medical batteries, especially those used in ventilators, respirators and infusion pumps, substantially increased during 2020; however, this increase was more than offset by the revenue declines in oil and gas and international industrial markets, delays in medical battery orders for devices used for elective surgeries and the overall disruptions in supply chains and operations impacting both commercial and government/defense markets.
Consolidated revenues increased by $917 or 0.9% to $107,712 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $106,795 for the year ended December 31, 2019. During 2020, we experienced revenue growth of 0.7% for our Battery & Energy Products business and a revenue decline of 37.6% for our Communications Systems business. This 2020 performance reflected a $2,648 or 4.4% increase in sales to our commercial customers and a $1,731 or 3.7% decrease in sales to government and defense customers. The increase in our commercial business was due primarily to a $13,380 increase in battery sales to medical customers largely driven by an increase in demand for our batteries used in ventilators, respirators, infusion pumps and other medical devices attributable to COVID-19, partially offset by a $5,681 decrease in sales to oil and gas customers of our SWE operation due primarily to declining demand attributable to the effects of COVID-19 on the oil and gas market and a $5,051 sales decrease for other commercial industrial products primarily due to COVID-19. The decrease in government and defense sales primarily resulted from higher 2019 shipments of mounted power amplifiers and vehicle amplifier-adaptor systems to support the U.S. Army’s Network Modernization and other initiatives under the delivery orders announced in October 2018, and shipments of Universal Vehicle Adaptors under an indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract with the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division announced in June 2019, partially offset by higher demand from a large global defense contractor and the shipment of our legacy 5390 batteries to complete a firm fixed price delivery order received in December 2019.
Gross margin decreased to 27.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 29.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The 210-basis point decrease was due primarily to costs incurred for the transition of new products to high volume production in 2020 and incremental costs associated with COVID-19 including an approximately one-month shutdown of our China operation as mandated by the Chinese government and supply chain and logistics disruptions, partially offset by improved efficiencies and productivity in the production of vehicle amplifier-adaptor systems to fulfill U.S. Army orders for our Communications Systems business.
Operating expenses decreased by $339 or 1.4% to $23,458 during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $23,797 during the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease primarily reflects the timing of testing of new products and a realignment of some of the SWE engineering and technical resources to support manufacturing including the short cycle turnaround for a medical battery pack supporting a respirator application to serve the COVID-19 response. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased 50 basis points from 22.3% in 2019 to 21.8% in 2020.
Other income totaled $1,322 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to expense of $597 for the year ended December 31, 2019. On December 14, 2020, Ultralife was awarded a final settlement of $1,593 (net of fees) upon court approval and order authorizing distribution of settlement funds in a class action lawsuit (In Re: Lithium-Ion Batteries Antitrust Litigation, 13-MD-02420-YGR, United States District Court, Northern District of California). At the time of the court order, the settlement funds were held in an escrow account controlled by the court for administrative purposes, and there remained no potential for appeal or reversal of the court order. Based on all conditions present upon the court order, it was concluded that the net settlement amount was fully realizable. Accordingly, a gain of $1,593 was recognized and is separately reported as gain on litigation settlement on the consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Income tax provision was $1,692 for the year-ended December 31, 2020 compared to $1,457 for the year-ended December 31, 2019. Our effective tax rate increased to 24.1% for 2020 as compared to 21.5% for 2019, primarily due to a greater level of discrete tax benefits realized in 2019 on disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options exercised by employees and the geographic mix of earnings. The income tax provision for the 2020 period is comprised of a $306 current provision for taxes expected to be paid on income from our foreign operations, representing a cash-based effective tax rate of 4.4%, and a $1,386 deferred tax provision which primarily represents non-cash charges for U.S. taxes which will be fully offset by net operating loss carryforwards and other tax credits for the foreseeable future. For the 2019 period, the income tax provision was comprised of an $221 current tax provision, representing a cash-based effective tax rate of 3.3%, and a non-cash $1,236 deferred provision for taxes.
Net income attributable to Ultralife was $5,232 for 2020 and $5,205 for 2019. Net income attributable to Ultralife common shareholders per diluted share was $0.33 for 2020 compared to $0.32 for 2019. Reflecting the use of net operating losses and tax credits on U.S. generated income, adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.41 for 2020 compared to $0.40 for 2019. See the section “Adjusted EPS” on page 34 for a reconciliation of adjusted EPS to EPS.
Adjusted EBITDA, defined as net income attributable to Ultralife before net interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, plus/minus income/expense that we do not consider reflective of our continuing operations, amounted to $9,696 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $11,007 for the prior year. See the section “Adjusted EBITDA” beginning on page 33 for a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to Ultralife.
The Company’s liquidity remains solid, with cash on hand of $10,653, debt of $1,474, working capital of $45,790 and a current ratio of 3.4. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had cash on hand of $7,405, debt of $17,316, working capital of $53,183 and a current ratio of 4.1.
While the outlook for demand in our end markets is less visible than we would like, we will remain focused on what we can control: organic growth initiatives, including completing transformational new product development projects and investments in strategic capital expenditure, and synergistic acquisitions.
Results of Operations
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2019:
Revenues. Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 amounted to $107,712, an increase of $917, or 0.9% from the $106,795 reported for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Battery & Energy Products revenues increased $7,911, or 9.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the prior year. Commercial revenues of this business increased 4.4% from 2019 and now comprise 67.8% of total segment sales versus 71.1% last year. The year-over-year increase primarily resulted from a $13,380 increase in battery sales to medical customers largely driven by an increase in demand for our batteries used in ventilators, respirators, infusion pumps and other medical devices attributable to COVID-19, partially offset by a $5,681 decrease in sales to oil and gas customers of our SWE operation due primarily to declining demand attributable to the effects of COVID-19 on the oil and gas market and a $5,051 sales decrease for other commercial industrial products primarily due to COVID-19. Government and defense sales of this business increased 21.6% from 2019 and now comprise 32.2% of total segment sales versus 28.9% last year. The increase primarily reflects higher demand from a large global defense contractor and the shipment of our legacy 5390 batteries to complete a firm fixed price delivery order received in December 2019.
Communications Systems revenues decreased $6,994 or 30.7% for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the prior year. This decrease is primarily attributable to higher 2019 shipments of Mounted Power Amplifiers and Vehicle Amplifier-Adaptor systems to support the U.S. Army’s Network Modernization and other initiatives under the delivery orders announced in October 2018, and shipments of Universal Vehicle Adaptors under an indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract with the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division announced in June 2019. Approximately 71% of the products provided for in these contracts were shipped in 2019 with the remainder shipped in 2020.
Our order backlog at December 31, 2020 was $39,292, a decrease of $3,266 or 7.7% from the backlog at December 31, 2019 which was $42,558. For our Battery & Energy Products business, the backlog decreased $1,142 or 3.2% to $34,602 from $35,744. The decrease primarily resulted from the 2020 completion of the December 2019 legacy BA-5390 delivery contract received from the Defense Logistics Agency in December 2019, partially offset by the continuing demand for batteries for medical devices. The 2020 year-end backlog is related to orders that are expected to ship throughout 2021 and does not include future shipments under the indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity Defense Logistic Awards for our BA-5390 batteries ($21,400) and BA-5790/BA-5795 batteries ($49,800). For our Communications Systems business, the backlog decreased $2,124 or 31.2% to $4,690 from $6,814. The decrease is primarily a result of the completion of shipments in 2020 under two October 2018 contract awards totaling $19,200 to supply our Vehicle Amplifier-Adaptors (“VAA”) and Mounted Power Amplifiers to a large global defense contractor to support the U.S. Army’s Network Modernization initiatives, Leader Radio Program and other opportunities that were included in our 2019 backlog. The 2020 year-end backlog is related to orders that are expected to ship throughout 2021.
Cost of Products Sold and Gross Profit. Cost of products sold for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $2,923 or 3.9% from the year ended December 31, 2019. Consolidated cost of products sold as a percentage of total revenue increased from 70.8% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 72.9% for the year ended December 31, 2020. Correspondingly, consolidated gross margin was 27.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with 29.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The 210-basis point decline in gross margin is due primarily to costs incurred for the transition of new products to high volume production in 2020 and incremental costs associated with COVID-19 including an approximately one-month shutdown of our China operation as mandated by the Chinese government and supply chain and logistics disruptions, partially offset by improved efficiencies and productivity in the production of vehicle amplifier-adaptor systems to fulfill U.S. Army orders for our Communications Systems business.
For our Battery & Energy Products segment, the cost of products sold increased $7,324 or 12.0%, from the year ended December 31, 2019. Battery & Energy Products’ gross profit for 2020 was $23,400 or 25.5% of revenues, an increase of $587 or 2.6% from gross profit of $22,813, or 27.2% of revenues, for 2019. Battery & Energy Products’ gross margin decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020 by 170 basis points from the prior year to 25.5%, reflecting costs associated with the transition of new products to higher volume production and incremental costs associated with COVID-19 including an approximately one-month shutdown of our China operation as mandated by the Chinese government and supply chain and logistics disruptions.
For our Communications Systems segment, the cost of products sold decreased by $4,401 or 30.5% from the year ended December 31, 2019. Communications Systems’ gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $5,759 or 36.4% of revenues, a decrease of $2,593 or 31.0% from gross profit of $8,352 or 36.6% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2019. The 20 basis points decrease in gross margin during 2020 to 36.4% is primarily due to sales mix between years, predominantly higher sales of VAA systems to fulfill U.S. Army orders in 2019.
Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $339 or 1.4% from the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was due primarily to the timing of testing of new products and a realignment of some of the SWE engineering and technical resources to support manufacturing including the short cycle turnaround for a medical battery pack supporting a respirator application to serve the COVID-19 response.
Overall, operating expenses as a percentage of revenues was 21.8% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 22.3% for the comparable 2019 period. Amortization expense associated with intangible assets related to our acquisitions increased to $595 for the year ended December 31, 2020 ($471 in selling, general and administrative expenses and $124 in research and development costs) from $525 for the year ended December 31, 2019 ($395 in selling, general and administrative expenses and $130 in research and development costs). This increase was due to our acquisition of SWE in May 2019. Research and development costs were $5,947 in 2020, a decrease of $858 or 12.6%, from $6,805 reported in 2019. This decrease was primarily due to the timing of testing of new products and a realignment of some of the SWE engineering and technical resources to support manufacturing including the short cycle turnaround for a medical battery pack supporting a respirator application to serve the COVID-19 response. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $519 or 3.1%, to $17,511 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $16,992 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is attributable to the inclusion of SWE results for the full 2020 year as compared to eight months for the comparable 2019 period and the hiring of an experienced sales and business development resource. We continued tight control over discretionary spending across the Company.
Other (Income) Expense. Other income totaled $1,322 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to expense of $597 for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily reflecting a $1,593 litigation gain (net of fees) recognized upon resolution of Ultralife’s claim in a class action lawsuit in December 2020. Interest and financing expense, net of interest income, decreased $103 to $436 for 2020 from $539 for 2019 due to a 91% reduction of debt, from $17,316 at year-end 2019 to $1,474 at year-end 2020, related to our acquisition of SWE in May 2019. Miscellaneous income amounted to $165 for 2020 compared to an expense of $58 for 2019, primarily due to transactions impacted by foreign currency fluctuation between the U.S. dollar, pound sterling and euro.
Income Taxes. The income tax provision was $1,692 for the year-ended December 31, 2020 compared to $1,457 for the year-ended December 31, 2019. Our effective tax rate increased to 24.1% for 2020 as compared to 21.5% for 2019, primarily due to a greater level of discrete tax benefits realized in 2019 on disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options exercised by employees and the geographic mix of earnings. The income tax provision for the 2020 period is comprised of a $306 current provision for taxes expected to be paid on income from our foreign operations, representing a cash-based effective tax rate of 4.4%, and a $1,386 deferred tax provision which primarily represents non-cash charges for U.S. taxes which we expect will be fully offset by net operating loss carryforwards and other tax credits for the foreseeable future. For the 2019 period, the income tax provision was comprised of an $221 current tax provision, representing a cash-based effective tax rate of 3.3%, and a non-cash $1,236 deferred provision for taxes.
Net Income Attributable to Ultralife. Net income attributable to Ultralife was $5,232 for 2020 and $5,205 for 2019. Net income attributable to Ultralife common shareholders per diluted share was $0.33 for 2020 compared to $0.32 for 2019. Reflecting the use of net operating losses and tax credits on U.S. generated income, adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.41 for 2020 compared to $0.40 for 2019. Adjusted EPS excludes the provision for deferred income taxes which represents non-cash charges of $1,386 and $1,236 for the 2020 and 2019 periods, respectively, for income taxes which will be fully offset by deferred tax assets including past U.S. net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. See the section “Adjusted EPS” on page 34 for a reconciliation of Adjusted EPS to EPS. The net adverse impact of COVID-19 on Adjusted EPS for 2020 was approximately $0.16. Weighted average common shares outstanding used to compute diluted earnings per share decreased from 16,179,119 for the 2019 period to 16,095,676 for the 2020 period, mainly due to a decrease in the weighted average stock price used to compute diluted shares from $9.05 for 2019 to $6.79 for 2020.
Adjusted EBITDA
In evaluating our business, we consider and use Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, as a supplemental measure of our operating performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Ultralife before net interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and stock-based compensation expense, plus/minus expense/income that we do not consider reflective of our ongoing continuing operations. We also use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to review and assess our operating performance and to enhance comparability between periods. We also believe the use of Adjusted EBITDA facilitates investors’ understanding of operating performance from period to period by backing out potential differences caused by variations in such items as capital structures (affecting relative interest expense and stock-based compensation expense), the amortization of intangible assets acquired through our business acquisitions (affecting relative amortization expense and provision (benefit) for income taxes), the age and book value of facilities and equipment (affecting relative depreciation expense) and one-time charges/benefits relating to income taxes. We also present Adjusted EBITDA from operations because we believe it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties as a measure of financial performance. We reconcile Adjusted EBITDA to Net income attributable to Ultralife, the most comparable financial measure under GAAP.
We use Adjusted EBITDA in our decision-making processes relating to the operation of our business together with GAAP financial measures such as operating income. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA permits a comparative assessment of our operating performance, relative to our performance based on our GAAP results, while isolating the effects of depreciation and amortization, which may vary from period to period without any correlation to underlying operating performance, and of stock-based compensation, which is a non-cash expense that varies widely among companies. We believe that by presenting Adjusted EBITDA, we assist investors in gaining a better understanding of our business on a going forward basis. We provide information relating to our Adjusted EBITDA so that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties have the same data that we employ in assessing our overall operations. We believe that trends in our Adjusted EBITDA are a valuable indicator of our operating performance on a consolidated basis and of our ability to produce operating cash flows to fund working capital needs, to service debt obligations and to fund capital expenditures.
The term Adjusted EBITDA is not defined under GAAP, and is not a measure of operating income, operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Our Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and when assessing our operating performance, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income attributable to Ultralife or other consolidated statement of operations data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Some of these limitations include, but are not limited to, the following:
a.
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect (1) our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; (2) changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (3) the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt; (4) income taxes or the cash requirements for any tax payments; and (5) all of the costs associated with operating our business;
b.
Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized often will have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements;
c.
While stock-based compensation is a component of cost of products sold and operating expenses, the impact on our consolidated financial statements compared to other companies can vary significantly due to such factors as assumed life of the stock-based awards and assumed volatility of our common stock; and
d.
Other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA only on a supplemental basis. Neither current nor potential investors in our securities should rely on Adjusted EBITDA as a substitute for any GAAP measures and we encourage investors to review the following reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to Ultralife.
Adjusted EPS
In evaluating our business, we consider and use Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP financial measure, as a supplemental measure of our business performance in addition to GAAP financial measures. We define Adjusted EPS as net income attributable to Ultralife Corporation excluding the provision for deferred taxes divided by our weighted average shares outstanding on both a basic and diluted basis. We believe that this information is useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of our results by reflecting the portion of our tax provision that we expect will be offset by our U.S. net operating loss carryforwards and other tax credits for the foreseeable future. We reconcile Adjusted EPS to EPS, the most comparable financial measure under GAAP. Neither current nor potential investors in our securities should rely on Adjusted EPS as a substitute for any GAAP measures and we encourage investors to review the following reconciliation of Adjusted EPS to EPS and net income attributable to Ultralife.
Adjusted EPS is calculated as follows for the periods presented:
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash Flows and General Business Matters
As of December 31, 2020, cash totaled $10,653 (including restricted cash of $91), an increase of $3,248, or 44%, from the beginning of the year, primarily attributable to net cash provided by operating activities, partially offset by a $15,842 reduction of debt drawn in connection with our acquisition of SWE in May 2019.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated $21,720 from our operations, as compared to a net use of $2,970 in operations for the year ended December 31, 2019. In 2020, cash generated from operating activities was attributable to net income of $5,331, a deferred tax provision of $1,386, non-cash expenses of depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation totaling $3,929, and a $12,667 reduction in net working capital, partially offset by a gain of $1,593 recognized upon resolution of Ultralife’s claim in a class action lawsuit. The working capital reduction is primarily due to a reduction in accounts receivable largely driven by collections on prior year shipments on a large global defense prime contract.
Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $15,694, primarily for the paydown of a substantial portion of the remaining debt outstanding in connection with our 2019 acquisition of SWE. For the year ended December 31, 2019, cash generated from financing activities was $16,124, which primarily represented debt incurred in connection with the SWE acquisition, including $18,182 in borrowing drawn on our Credit Facilities, less $866 of Term Loan principal payments and debt issuance costs totaling $157. In 2020 and 2019, we received $148 and $922, respectively, in proceeds from the issuance of common stock on stock option exercises by our employees, net of tax withholdings. In 2019, we spent $1,957 (including fees and commissions) to repurchase shares of our common stock under the Company’s Share Repurchase Program, which commenced on November 1, 2018 and ended on October 31, 2019.
Cash used in investing activities was $2,981 for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily attributable to capital expenditures. For the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in investing activities was $31,529, which was attributable to our acquisition of SWE and $6,281 of capital expenditures. The year over year decrease in capital expenditures is primarily due to completion of strategic projects for improving and broadening our thionyl chloride products and automation equipment for cell production for our Battery and Energy Products business.
We continue to have significant U.S. net operating loss carryforwards available to utilize as an offset to taxable income. As of December 31, 2020, none of our U.S. net operating loss carryforwards have expired. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Going forward, we expect positive operating cash flow and the availability under our Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our obligations for both financing and investing.
Commitments
On May 1, 2019, in connection with financing the SWE acquisition (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements), the Company drew down $8,000 on its Term Loan Facility and $6,782 under its Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had $7,134 outstanding principal on the Term Loan Facility, of which $1,372 was due to be paid over the next twelve months, and $10,182 outstanding principal on the Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had paid the full amount outstanding on the Revolving Credit Facility and reduced the outstanding principal balance on the Term Loan Facility to $1,474. The Company is in full compliance with its debt covenants under the Credit Facilities.
As of December 31, 2020, we had made commitments to purchase approximately $873 of production machinery and equipment.
With respect to our battery products, we typically offer warranties against any defects due to product manufacture or workmanship for up to one year from the date of purchase. With respect to our communications accessory products, we typically offer a three-year warranty. We provide for a reserve for these potential warranty expenses, which is based on an analysis of historical warranty issues. There is no assurance that future warranty claims will be consistent with past history, and in the event we experience a significant increase in warranty claims, there is no assurance that our reserves would be sufficient. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The above discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the application of accounting policies and the use of estimates. The accounting policies most important to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and estimates that require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments are described below.
Revenue Recognition:
Revenues are generated from the sale of products. Performance obligations are met and revenue is recognized upon transfer of control to the customer, which is generally upon shipment. When contract terms require transfer of control upon delivery at a customer’s location, revenue is recognized on the date of delivery. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for shipped product. Sales, value-added and other taxes billed and collected from customers are excluded from revenue. Customers, including distributors, do not have a general right of return. For products shipped under vendor managed inventory arrangements, revenue is recognized and billed when the product is consumed by the customer, at which point control has transferred and there are no further obligations by the Company.
Our contracts with customers generally have an original expected duration of less than one year. Pursuant to Topic 606, we have applied the practical expedient with respect to disclosure of the deferral and future expected timing of revenue recognition for transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations.
Valuation of Inventory:
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined using the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method. Our inventory includes raw materials, work in process and finished goods. We recognize provisions for excess, obsolete or slow-moving inventory. Inherent in our estimates of net realizable value in determining inventory valuation are assumptions related to expectations of future demand for our products, product lifecycles, product support, technical obsolescence, regulatory requirements, and economic and market conditions. Estimates related to the valuation of inventory are susceptible to changes as the underlying assumptions are continuously evaluated. If our assumptions are adversely different from those estimated by management, inventory adjustments to reduce inventory values would result in an increase in inventory write-offs and a decrease in gross margins.
Goodwill and Other Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets:
Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total consideration transferred to consummate the acquisition is allocated to the identified tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values as of the acquisition date with the residual amount recorded to goodwill. We do not amortize goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, but instead evaluate these assets for impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist.
The annual impairment test for goodwill consists of a comparison of the estimated fair value for each reporting unit to which goodwill is assigned to the carrying value of the respective reporting unit. The annual impairment test for the other intangible assets with an indefinite life consists of a comparison of the estimated fair value of each asset to the carrying value of the respective asset. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit or other indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its respective carrying value, the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset is considered not impaired. If carrying value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value, the excess carrying value of the respective goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset is recognized as an impairment loss.
We conducted our annual impairment test for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets as of October 1, 2020. We identified five goodwill reporting units and four indefinite-lived intangible assets. We performed a quantitative impairment assessment of each goodwill reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit was determined using a discounted cash flow model. The estimated fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset was determined using other income-based valuation models. Significant estimates and assumptions were used to estimate fair value, including our internal operating and cash flow forecasts, excess working capital requirements, and inputs to the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows. Other key assumptions used to value the trademarks and customer relationships included royalty rates and attrition rates, respectively. The significant estimates and assumptions used in these valuations are subject to judgment based on sources utilized and the assessment of risks related to our internal forecasts. Based on the results of our impairment test, and consideration of qualitative factors, no impairments were identified. Estimated fair value exceeded carrying value for all reporting units and other indefinite-lived intangible assets by more than 10%. There is a possibility that our goodwill and other intangible assets could be impaired in the future should there be a significant change in the significant estimates and assumptions used in our impairment assessment.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:
We assess our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. This is accomplished by comparing the expected undiscounted future cash flows of the assets with the respective carrying amount as of the date of assessment. Should aggregate undiscounted future cash flows be less than the carrying value, a write-down would be required, measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset. Fair value is estimated either through the assistance of an independent valuation or as the present value of expected discounted future cash flows. The discount rate used by us in our evaluation is an industry-based weighted average cost of capital. If the expected undiscounted future cash flows exceed the respective carrying amount as of the date of assessment, no impairment charge is recognized.
Income Taxes:
We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Pursuant to ASC 740, a valuation allowance is recognized when the realizability of deferred tax assets is not more likely than not, on the basis of all available evidence, both positive and negative, weighted based on objective verifiability.
As of December 31, 2020, we concluded that it is more likely than not that our U.S. deferred tax assets will be fully realized on the basis of management’s assessment. In evaluating the realizability of our U.S. deferred tax assets, management considered all available evidence and concluded that positive factors, including our sustained profitability and continued improvement in our ability to achieve internal earnings forecasts, outweighed all negative factors, including our history of operating losses (prior to 2015) and historical operating volatility. Our assessment also considered our ability to fully utilize before expiration our domestic net operating loss carryforwards, which expire 2021 thru 2035, and our general business tax credit carryforwards, which expire 2028 thru 2039. As of December 31, 2020, our domestic net operating loss carryforwards and general business tax credits were $47,755 and $2,070, respectively.
As of December 31, 2020, for certain past operations in the U.K., we continue to report a valuation allowance for net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $11,000, nearly all of which can be carried forward indefinitely. Management has concluded that utilization of the U.K. net operating losses may be limited due to the change in the past U.K. operation, and that they cannot currently be used to reduce taxable income of our other U.K. subsidiary, Accutronics Ltd. As of December 31, 2020, we have not recognized a valuation allowance against our other foreign deferred tax assets, as we believe that it is more likely than not that they will be realized. We will continue to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets in future periods.
Stock-Based Compensation:
We recognize compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions in our financial statements. The cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense over the employee’s requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the equity award). We calculate implied volatility for stock options based on an average of historical volatility over the expected life of the awards. The computation of expected term is determined based on historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms of the awards and the vesting period. The interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant. Our awards are generally valued using the Black-Scholes method. If required, our market-based awards are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation.
Business Combinations:
We account for businesses acquired using the acquisition method of accounting. Under this method, all acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred, and the total consideration transferred to consummate the acquisition is allocated to the identified tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values as of the acquisition date with the residual amount recorded to goodwill. As part of this process, we identify and attribute values and estimated lives to property and equipment and intangible assets acquired. These determinations involve significant estimates and assumptions, including those with respect to future cash flows, discount rates and asset lives, and therefore require considerable judgment. These determinations affect the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recognized in future periods. The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income beginning on the respective acquisition date.
Warranties:
We generally offer standard warranties against product defects. We do not offer separate service-type warranties. We estimate future warranty costs to be incurred for product failure rates, material usage and service costs in the development of our warranty obligations. Estimated future costs and related reserves are based on actual past experience and are generally estimated as a percentage of sales over the warranty period.
Environmental Issues:
Environmental expenditures, if any, that relate to current operations, are generally expensed. Remediation costs that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations are accrued when it is probable that these costs will be incurred and can be reasonably estimated.
