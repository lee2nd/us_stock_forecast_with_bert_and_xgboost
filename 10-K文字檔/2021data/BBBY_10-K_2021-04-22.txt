ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
OVERVIEW
We are an omnichannel retailer that makes it easy for our customers to feel at home. We sell a wide assortment of merchandise in the Home, Baby, Beauty & Wellness markets and operate under the names Bed Bath & Beyond ("BBB"), buybuy BABY ("BABY"), and Harmon, Harmon Face Values, or Face Values (collectively, "Harmon"). We also operate Decorist, an online interior design platform that provides personalized home design services. In addition, we are a partner in a joint venture, which operates retail stores in Mexico under the name Bed Bath & Beyond.
For fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, we accounted for our operations as two operating segments: North American Retail and Institutional Sales, the latter of which did not meet the quantitative thresholds under GAAP and, therefore, was not a reportable segment. The Institutional Sales operating segment was comprised of Linen Holdings, which was divested in October 2020. We will continue to account for our operations as one North American Retail reporting segment going forward.
We have undertaken significant changes over the past year, including extensive changes to executive leadership, as well as development of essential strategies and plans to focus on positioning our business for long-term success. During the past year, as the world responded to the unparalleled challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken aggressive and thoughtful steps to safeguard our people and communities while we continue to serve our customers. Similar to many other businesses, the COVID-19 pandemic served as a catalyst to accelerate the pace of change and innovation across our Company, advancing ongoing efforts to reset our cost structure and build a modern, durable model for long-term profitable growth.
We are driving a digital-first, omni-always growth strategy and optimizing our digital and physical store channels to provide our customers with a seamless omni-channel shopping experience. Digital purchases, including web and mobile, can be shipped to a customer from our distribution facilities, directly from vendors, or from a store. Store purchases are primarily fulfilled from that store's inventory or may also be shipped to a customer from one of our distribution facilities, from a vendor, or from another store. Customers can also choose to pick up orders using our newly introduced Buy Online Pickup In Store ("BOPIS") and contactless Curbside Pickup services, as well as return online purchases to a store. Customers can also make purchases through one of our customer contact centers and in-store through The Beyond Store, our proprietary web-based platform. These capabilities allow us to better serve our customers across various channels.
Restructuring and Business Transformation
As part of our business transformation plan, we are pursuing a comprehensive cost restructuring program, to drive improved financial performance over the next two-to-three years. We expect to reinvest a portion of the expected cost savings into future growth initiatives. Key components of the expected financial improvement include:
•Approximately $100 million in annual savings from our previously disclosed store network optimization project which includes the planned closure of approximately 200 mostly BBB stores by the end of fiscal 2021. During fiscal 2020, we closed 144 BBB stores. We continue to believe that our physical store channel is an asset for our transformation into a digital-first company, especially with new omni-fulfillment capabilities in BOPIS, Curbside Pickup and Same Day Delivery;
•Approximately $200 million in annual savings from product sourcing, through renegotiations with existing vendors; and
•Approximately $100 to $150 million in annual selling, general and administrative expense savings from continued optimization of our corporate overhead cost structure and reductions in other discretionary expense. During the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we implemented a workforce reduction of approximately 2,800 roles from across our corporate headquarters and retail stores, designed to further reduce layers at the corporate level, significantly reposition field operations to better serve customers in a digital-first environment, and realign technology, supply chain and merchandising teams to support our strategic growth initiatives.
In connection with the above restructuring and transformation initiatives, we recorded $149.3 million within cost of sales and restructuring and transformation initiative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2020 for costs associated with our planned store closures as part of the network optimization program for which the store closure process has commenced, workforce reduction and other transformation initiatives. At this point, we are unable to estimate the amount or range of amounts expected to be incurred in connection with future store closures and will provide such estimates as they become available.
Divestitures and Other Cash Generating Activities
On December 14, 2020, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to sell Cost Plus World Market to Kingswood Capital Management, a Los Angeles-based private equity firm. The transaction closed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, generating approximately $63.7 million in proceeds, subject to certain working capital and other adjustments.
On October 11, 2020, we entered into definitive agreements to sell Christmas Tree Shops ("CTS") to Handil Holdings LLC and to sell one of the CTS distribution facilities to an institutional buyer, with a leaseback term of nine months, to provide business continuity for some of our operations currently using the facility. These transactions were completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2020, generating approximately $233.3 million in proceeds, subject to certain working capital and other adjustments.
On October 11, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell Linen Holdings to The Linen Group, LLC, an affiliate of Lion Equity Partners. On October 24, 2020, we completed the sale of Linen Holdings for approximately $10.1 million, subject to certain working capital and other adjustments.
On February 14, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell PersonalizationMall.com ("PMall") to 1-800-FLOWERS.COM for $252 million, subject to certain working capital and other adjustments. The buyer was required to close the PMall transaction on March 30, 2020, but failed to do so. Accordingly, we filed an action to require the buyer to close the transaction. On July 20, 2020, we entered into a settlement agreement with respect to the litigation. Under this agreement, 1-800-FLOWERS.COM agreed to move forward with its purchase of PMall for $244.6 million, subject to certain working capital and other adjustments. The transaction closed on August 3, 2020.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we also sold One Kings Lane to a third party for an amount that was not material.
During the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter, we completed a sale-leaseback transaction with respect to approximately 2.1 million square feet of owned real estate, generating over $250 million in net proceeds.
The net proceeds from these transactions and any other potential cash-generating transactions are expected to be used to reinvest in our core business operations to drive growth, fund share repurchases, reduce our outstanding debt, or some combination of these uses.
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic. The pandemic has materially disrupted our operations to date. In compliance with relevant government directives, we temporarily closed all of our retail banner stores across the U.S. and Canada as of March 23, 2020, except for most stand-alone BABY and Harmon stores, which were categorized as essential given the nature of their products. In May 2020, we announced a phased approach to reopen our stores in compliance with relevant government directives, and as of the end of July 2020, nearly all of our stores reopened. We cannot predict, however, whether reopened stores will remain open, particularly as the regions in which we operate are experiencing a resurgence of reported new cases of COVID-19 and hospitalizations. In response to the health risks caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we expanded our recently rolled out BOPIS, contactless Curbside Pickup and Same Day Delivery services to cover the vast majority of our stores.
In conjunction with the temporary store closures, we implemented additional cost reductions, including a furlough of the majority of store associates and a portion of corporate associates. We provided impacted store associates with applicable pay and benefits through April 3, 2020, and impacted corporate associates with pay and benefits through April 18, 2020. In addition, we had continued to pay 100% of the cost of healthcare premiums for all associates who participated in our health plan. Nearly all of the associates who were subject to furlough returned to work as of the third quarter of fiscal 2020. We also implemented a temporary reduction in salaries of our executive team by 30% through May 16, 2020, and a temporary reduction in the quarterly cash compensation of the independent members of the Board of Directors by 30% for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. We also modified our fiscal 2020 capital investment plan, focusing on our core business and key projects that support our digital and omni fulfillment capabilities, including the introduction of BOPIS and contactless Curbside Pickup services, omni inventory management, and digital marketing and personalization.
We have and will continue to seek opportunities to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including, among others, renegotiating payment terms for goods, services and rent, managing inventory levels, and reducing discretionary spending such as business travel and advertising and expense associated with the maintenance of stores that were temporarily closed. The COVID-19 pandemic materially adversely impacted our results of operations and cash flows in fiscal 2020, and could continue to materially impact results of operations and cash flows as well as our financial condition. Given the uncertainties regarding the spread of the virus, the timing of the economic recovery and the resurgence of the virus, the related financial impact cannot be reasonably predicted or estimated at this time.
On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) was enacted in the United States. The CARES Act is an emergency economic aid package to help mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Among other things, the CARES Act provides certain changes to tax laws, which may impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We are currently implementing certain provisions of the CARES Act, such as deferring employer payroll taxes and utilizing the ability to carry back and deduct losses to offset prior income in previously filed tax returns. As of February 27, 2021, we have deferred $3.1 million of employer payroll taxes, of which 50% are required to be deposited by December 2021 and the remaining 50% by December 2022. During the fiscal year ended February 27, 2021, under the CARES Act, we recorded an additional $41.0 million benefit as a result of the fiscal 2019 net operating losses and a $111.0 million benefit as a result of the fiscal 2020 net operating losses, both of which can now be carried back to prior years during which the federal tax rate was 35%. In addition, we recorded a credit of $33.3 million as an offset to selling, general and administrative expenses as a result of the employee retention credits made available under the CARES Act for U.S. employees and under the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy for Canadian employees during fiscal 2020.
Summary of Financial Performance
The following represents an overview of our financial performance for the periods indicated, all of which were comprised of fifty-two weeks:
•Net sales in fiscal 2020 decreased approximately 17.3% to $9.233 billion over net sales of $11.159 billion in fiscal 2019; net sales in fiscal 2019 decreased approximately 7.2% to $11.159 billion over net sales of $12.029 billion in fiscal 2018. As noted above, the majority of our stores were temporarily closed beginning March 23, 2020, except for most stand-alone BABY and Harmon stores, which remained open through July 2020, subject to state and local regulations. Nearly all stores reopened as of July 2020. The decline in net sales in fiscal 2020 also reflected the impact of the business divestitures and store closures described above.
•Net sales consummated through digital channels increased approximately 83% and 2%, respectively, and net sales consummated in-store declined approximately 34% and 14%, respectively, in fiscal 2020 and 2019, relative to the previous year. Net sales consummated through digital channels represented approximately 38% of our net sales for fiscal 2020, approximately 17% of our net sales for fiscal 2019, and approximately 16% of our net sales for fiscal 2018.
•As a result of the extended closure of the majority of our stores due to the COVID-19 pandemic and our policy of excluding extended store closures from our comparable sales calculation, we believe that comparable sales was not a meaningful metric for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and, therefore, not a meaningful metric for fiscal 2020. Comparable sales decreased approximately 6.8% for fiscal 2019 and approximately 1.1% for fiscal 2018.
Comparable sales include sales consummated through all retail channels that have been operating for twelve full months following the opening period (typically four to six weeks). As an omnichannel retailer, customers are able to use more than one channel when making a purchase, including in-store, online, with a mobile device or through a customer contact center, and have it fulfilled, in most cases, either through in-store customer pickup or by direct shipment to the customer from one of our distribution facilities, stores or vendors.
Sales consummated on a mobile device while physically in a store location and BOPIS orders are recorded as customer facing digital channel sales. Customer orders taken in-store by an associate through The Beyond Store, our proprietary, web-based platform, are recorded as in-store sales. Prior to implementation of BOPIS and contactless Curbside Pickup services, customer orders reserved online and picked up in a store were recorded as in-store sales. Sales originally consummated from customer facing digital channels and subsequently returned in-store are recorded as a reduction of in-store sales.
Stores relocated or expanded are excluded from comparable sales if the change in square footage would cause meaningful disparity in sales over the prior period. In the case of a store to be closed, such store’s sales are not considered comparable once the store closing process has commenced. Stores impacted by unusual and unexpected events outside our control, including the COVID-19 pandemic, severe weather, fire or floods, are excluded from comparable sales for the period of time that such event would cause a meaningful disparity in sales over the prior period. Due to their divestitures, One Kings Lane and PMall are excluded from the comparable sales calculation beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, Christmas Tree Shops is excluded from the comparable sales calculation beginning in fiscal November 2020, and Cost Plus World Market is excluded from the comparable sales calculation beginning in fiscal January 2021. Linen Holdings has always been excluded from the comparable sales calculation, as it represents non-retail activity.
•Gross profit for fiscal 2020 was $3.118 billion or 33.8% of net sales, compared with $3.542 billion or 31.7% of net sales for fiscal 2019 and $4.104 billion or 34.1% of net sales for fiscal 2018.
•SG&A for fiscal 2020 was $3.224 billion or 34.9% of net sales, compared with $3.732 billion or 33.4% of net sales for fiscal 2019 and $3.681 billion or 30.6% of net sales for fiscal 2018.
•Goodwill and other impairments for fiscal 2020 were $127.3 million or 1.4% of net sales compared with $509.2 million or 4.6% of net sales for fiscal 2019 and $509.9 million or 4.2% of net sales for fiscal 2018.
•Restructuring and transformation initiative expenses for fiscal 2020 were $102.2 million, or 1.1% of net sales.
•Loss on sale of businesses, including impairment of assets held for sale, for fiscal 2020 was $1.1 million and represented the total net loss recognized on divestiture of our One Kings Lane, PMall, Linen Holdings, Christmas Tree Shops, and Cost Plus World Market businesses, which is inclusive of a $54.0 million loss recorded upon classification of certain assets of Cost Plus World Market as held for sale during the third quarter of fiscal 2020.
•Interest expense, net was $76.9 million, $64.8 million, and $69.5 million in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
•Gain on extinguishment of debt of $77.0 million in fiscal 2020 related to partial repayment of senior unsecured notes in August 2020.
•The effective tax rate was 55.2%, 19.7%, and 12.4% for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For fiscal 2020, the effective tax rate includes the impact of a number of items, including tax planning strategies we deployed in order to increase our expected net operating loss carryback for fiscal 2020, the benefits relating to the divestitures of CTS, Linen Holdings and Cost Plus, partially offset by the impact of impairment charges for tradename and certain store-level assets and the gain on the divestiture of PMall. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 also includes a benefit related to fiscal 2019 net operating loss carry-back under the CARES Act. For fiscal 2019, the effective tax rate reflects the impact of charges, portions of which are non-deductible for tax purposes, for goodwill and other impairments, an incremental charge for markdowns, severance costs, shareholder activity costs and a loss from a sale-leaseback transaction, including transaction costs. For fiscal 2018, the effective tax rate reflects the impact of charges, portions of which are non-deductible for tax purposes, for goodwill and other impairments, severance costs and a gain from the sale of a building.
For fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, the effective tax rate included net benefit of approximately $2.1 million, net expense of approximately $4.3 million and net benefits of approximately $12.1 million, respectively, due to the recognition of discrete federal and state tax items.
•For fiscal 2020, net loss per diluted share was $1.24 ($150.8 million) and included the unfavorable impact of $0.23 per diluted share related to restructuring and transformation initiative expenses, non-cash impairment charges related to tradename and certain store-level assets and the net loss on sales of businesses, partially offset by the gain on extinguishment of debt and a benefit from the reduction of non-recurring inventory reserves. For fiscal 2019, net loss per diluted share was $4.94 ($613.8 million) and included the unfavorable impact of approximately $5.40 per diluted share from goodwill and other impairments, an incremental charge for markdowns, severance costs, shareholder activity costs and a loss from a sale-leaseback transaction, including transaction costs. For fiscal 2018, net earnings per diluted share was $1.02 ($137.2 million) and included the unfavorable impact of approximately $2.99 per diluted share from goodwill and other impairments, severance costs and a gain from the sale of a building.
For fiscal 2020, the decrease in net loss per diluted share is a result of the decrease in net loss due to the items described above, partially offset by the impact of repurchases of our common stock. For fiscal 2019, the increase in net loss per diluted share was a result of the increase in net loss due to the items described above, partially offset by the impact of repurchases of our common stock.
Capital expenditures for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $183.1 million, $277.4 million and $325.4 million, respectively. Approximately 60% of the current year capital expenditures related to pre-planned technology projects, including inventory and warehouse management capabilities such as advanced allocation logic and replenishment strategies to meet changing customer needs. The remaining capital expenditures were primarily related to investments in existing stores.
We continue to review and prioritize our capital needs and remain committed to making the required investments in our infrastructure to help position us for continued growth and success. Key areas of investment include: continuing to improve the presentation and content as well as the functionality, general search and navigation across our customer facing digital channels; improving customer data integration and customer relations management capabilities; continuing to enhance service offerings to
our customers; continuing to strengthen and deepen our information technology, analytics, marketing and e-commerce groups; and creating more flexible fulfillment options designed to improve our delivery capabilities and lower our shipping costs. These and other investments are expected to, among other things, provide a seamless and compelling customer experience across our omnichannel retail platform. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are prioritizing essential capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 to drive strategic growth plans, including investments in digital, BOPIS and Curbside Pickup service offerings, and have postponed certain previously planned capital expenditures, including some store remodels.
During fiscal 2020, we opened a total of nine new stores and closed 144 stores. We plan to continue to actively manage our real estate portfolio in order to permit store sizes, layouts, locations and offerings to evolve over time to optimize market profitability and will renovate or reposition stores within markets when appropriate. Over the past several years, the pace of our store openings has slowed, and we have increased the number of store closings. We have more than 120 store leases up for renewal in fiscal 2021, which provide the opportunity to evaluate additional store closures and relocations. Some portion of these stores will be included in our store network optimization program discussed above.
During fiscal 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a quarterly dividend program. During fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, total cash dividends of $23.1 million, $85.5 million and $86.3 million were paid, respectively. In March 2020, we suspended our future quarterly declarations of cash dividends as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Any future quarterly cash dividend payments on our common stock will be subject to the determination by the Board of Directors, based on an evaluation of our earnings, financial condition and requirements, business conditions and other factors, including the restrictions on the payment of dividends under the secured asset-based revolving credit facility (see "Long Term Debt," Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements).
In October 2020, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement ("ASR Agreement") with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association ("JP Morgan") to repurchase $225.0 million of our common stock. Pursuant to the ASR Agreement, we paid $225.0 million to JP Morgan and received an initial delivery of approximately 4.5 million shares of common stock. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we received an additional 6.3 million shares under this ASR Agreement. In January 2021, we entered into a second accelerated share repurchase agreement ("ASR Agreement 2") to repurchase an aggregate of $150.0 million of our common stock, subject to market conditions. Pursuant to ASR Agreement 2, we paid $150.0 million to JP Morgan, and received an initial delivery of 5.0 million shares, which was accounted for as a treasury stock transaction and resulted in a $102.5 million increase in treasury stock and reduced the weighted average shares outstanding. We also recorded a $47.6 million decrease in additional paid in capital upon the inception of ASR Agreement 2. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2020, final settlement under ASR Agreement 2 occurred and we received an additional 0.2 million shares. In addition, subsequent to the end of fiscal 2020, our Board of Directors expanded the existing share repurchase authorization by an additional $175 million, which increased the total share repurchase authorization to $12.950 billion.
In addition, during fiscal 2020, we repurchased approximately 0.6 million shares of our common stock to cover employee related taxes withheld on vested restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance stock unit awards, at a total cost of approximately $5.1 million. During fiscal 2019 and 2018, we repurchased 6.8 million, and 9.1 million shares, respectively, of our common stock at a total cost of approximately $99.7 million and $148.1 million, respectively.
Decisions regarding share repurchases are within the discretion of the Board of Directors, and are influenced by a number of factors, including the price of our common stock, general business and economic conditions, our financial condition and operating results, the emergence of alternative investment or acquisition opportunities, changes in business strategy and other factors. Our share repurchase program could change, and could be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions, such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our stock price. We review our alternatives with respect to our capital structure on an ongoing basis. Any future share repurchases will be subject to the determination of the Board of Directors, based on an evaluation of our earnings, financial condition and requirements, business conditions and other factors, including the restrictions on share repurchases under the secured asset-based revolving credit facility (see "Long Term Debt," Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements).
Operating in the highly competitive retail industry, our performance, along with other retail companies, is influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: general economic conditions including the housing market, unemployment levels and commodity prices; the overall macroeconomic environment and related changes in the retailing environment; consumer preferences, spending habits and adoption of new technologies; unusual weather patterns and natural disasters, including pandemics; competition from existing and potential competitors across all channels; potential supply chain disruption; the ability to find suitable locations at acceptable occupancy costs and other terms to support our plans for new stores; and the ability to assess and implement technologies in support of our development of our omnichannel capabilities. We cannot predict whether, when or the manner in which these factors could affect our operating results.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The fiscal years discussed below were each comprised of 52 weeks. The following table sets forth for the periods indicated (i) selected statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of net sales and (ii) the percentage change in dollar amounts from the prior year in selected statement of operations data:
(1) - As a percentage of sales, loss on sale of businesses, including impairment of assets held for sale, is less than 0.1% for the year ended February 27, 2021.
Net Sales
Net sales in fiscal 2020 were $9.233 billion, a decrease of $1.926 billion or approximately 17.3%, compared to $11.159 billion of net sales in fiscal 2019, which decreased $870.2 million or 7.2% from $12.029 billion of net sales in fiscal 2018. The decrease in net sales for fiscal 2020 was primarily due to the temporary nationwide closure of the majority of our stores beginning on March 23, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, except for most stand-alone BABY and Harmon stores, which remained open during such period, subject to state and local regulations. Nearly all of our stores reopened as of July 2020. The declines in net sales in fiscal 2020 also reflected the impacts of the business divestitures and store closures described above. For fiscal 2019, the decrease in net sales was primarily attributable to a decrease in comparable sales.
During fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, net sales consummated through digital channels increased approximately 83% and 2%, respectively, and net sales consummated in-store declined approximately 34% and 14%, respectively from the corresponding period in the prior year. Net sales consummated through digital channels represented approximately 38% of our net sales for fiscal 2020, approximately 17% of our net sales for fiscal 2019, and approximately 16% of our net sales for fiscal 2018.
As a result of the extended closure of the majority of our stores due to the COVID-19 pandemic and our policy of excluding extended store closures from our comparable sales calculation, we believe that comparable sales was not a meaningful metric for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and, therefore, are not a meaningful metric for fiscal 2020. Comparable sales decreased approximately 6.8% for fiscal 2019.
Our comparable sales metric considers sales consummated through all retail channels - in-store, online, with a mobile device or through a customer contact center. Our omnichannel environment allows our customers to use more than one channel when making a purchase. We believe in an integrated and seamless customer experience. A few examples are: a customer may be assisted by an in-store associate to create a wedding or baby registry, while the guests may ultimately purchase a gift from our websites; or a customer may research a particular item, and read other customer reviews on our websites before visiting a store to consummate the actual purchase; or a customer may buy an item online for in-store or curbside pickup; or while in a store, a customer may make the purchase on a mobile device for in home delivery from either a distribution facility, a store or directly from a vendor. In addition, we accept returns in-store without regard to the channel in which the purchase was consummated, therefore resulting in reducing store sales by sales originally consummated through customer facing digital channels. As our retail operations are integrated and we cannot reasonably track the channel in which the ultimate sale is initiated, we can however, provide directional information on where the sale was consummated.
Domestics merchandise includes categories such as bed linens and related items, bath items and kitchen textiles. Home furnishings include categories such as kitchen and tabletop items, fine tabletop, basic housewares, general home furnishings (including furniture and wall décor), consumables and certain juvenile products. Sales of domestics merchandise accounted for approximately 34.7%, 35.2% and 35.4%, of net sales in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, of which we estimate that bed linens accounted for approximately 11% of net sales in each of fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018. The remaining net sales in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 of 65.3%, 64.8%, and 64.6%, respectively, represented sales of home furnishings. No other individual product category accounted for 10% or more of net sales during fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018.
Gross Profit
Gross profit in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $3.118 billion or 33.8% of net sales, $3.542 billion or 31.7% of net sales, and $4.104 billion or 34.1% of net sales, respectively. The increase in the gross profit margin as a percentage of sales between fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 was primarily attributable to the increase in product mix and the leverage of distribution and fulfillment costs, partially offset by the impact of channel mix, including higher net-direct-to-customer shipping expense. In addition, our gross margin for fiscal 2020 included a net benefit of $20.2 million from the reduction of incremental markdown reserves taken in the prior year, partially offset by restructuring and transformation initiatives. Our gross profit margin in the prior year reflected an incremental reserve for future markdowns of approximately $169.8 million related to our transformation initiatives, which was an incremental charge to the actual markdowns recorded in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2019.
In addition, our cost of sales includes cost of merchandise, buying costs and costs of our distribution network, including inbound freight charges, distribution facility costs, receiving costs, internal transfer costs and shipping and handling costs. During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we reevaluated the costs included in cost of sales as we continue our focus on our digital and omni fulfillment capabilities, including the introduction of BOPIS and contactless Curbside Pickup services. The reevaluation of the costs included in cost of sales favorably impacted the change in gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales by approximately 200 basis points during fiscal 2020. This favorable impact was fully offset by a corresponding unfavorable impact in the change in SG&A as a percentage of net sales and resulted in no net impact to the consolidated statement of operations.
The decrease in the gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 was primarily attributable to a decrease in merchandise margin, as a result of promotional activity and the above-mentioned charge of approximately $169.8 million for incremental markdowns related to our transformation initiatives. This incremental charge for markdowns was the result of our strategic decision to reduce inventory by up to $1.0 billion at retail from the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2019 through the end of fiscal 2020, driven by our inventory rationalization efforts, including reductions of aged and duplicative SKUs within our assortment. This action was taken to reset our inventory levels in both stores and distribution centers, as well as refresh our assortment, providing for newness and higher-margin products, all in an effort to drive customer traffic and support top-line performance.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
SG&A was $3.224 billion or 34.9% of net sales in fiscal 2020, $3.732 billion or 33.4% of net sales in fiscal 2019, and $3.681 billion or 30.6% of net sales in fiscal 2018. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increases in fixed costs such as rent and occupancy and depreciation, and consulting costs related to our strategic initiatives, partially offset by decreases in payroll and payroll-related expenses and advertising.
The increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales between 2019 and 2018 was primarily attributable to, in order of magnitude, increases in payroll and payroll-related expenses (primarily due to severance expense); technology-related expenses, including depreciation; advertising, due in part to the growth in digital advertising; and occupancy expense. Fixed costs, such as occupancy and technology-related expenses, including depreciation, as a percentage of net sales were impacted by the lower sales base in fiscal 2019.
Goodwill and Other Impairments
Goodwill and other impairments were $127.3 million in fiscal 2020, $509.2 million in fiscal 2019, and $509.9 million in fiscal 2018. For fiscal 2020, impairment charges included $92.9 million related to certain store-level assets (including leasehold improvements and operating lease assets) and tradename impairments of $35.1 million. For fiscal 2019, impairment charges included goodwill impairments of $391.1 million, tradename impairments of $41.8 million, long-lived assets impairments of $75.1 million and other impairments of $1.2 million. For fiscal 2018, goodwill impairments were $325.2 million, tradename impairments were $161.7 million and long-lived assets impairments were $23.0 million. The non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charges were primarily the result of a sustained decline in our market capitalization.
Restructuring and Transformation Initiative Expenses
During fiscal 2020, we recorded charges of $102.2 million in connection with our restructuring and transformation initiatives, primarily related to severance costs recorded in connection with the workforce reduction and store network optimization programs described above as well as other restructuring activities. (see "Restructuring Activities," Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements).
Loss on Sale of Businesses, Including Impairment of Assets Held for Sale
Total net loss recognized on the sale of businesses during fiscal 2020 was $1.1 million, comprised of the following transactions:
•On April 13, 2020, we completed the sale of One Kings Lane. Proceeds from the sale were not material.
•On August 3, 2020, we completed the sale of PMall for approximately $244.6 million in proceeds, and recognized a gain on the sale of $189.3 million.
•On October 24, 2020, we completed the sale of Linen Holdings for approximately $10.1 million in proceeds, and recognized a loss on the sale of $64.6 million.
•During the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we completed the sale of Christmas Tree Shops for approximately $233.3 million in proceeds, and recognized a loss on the sale of approximately $53.8 million.
•On January 15, 2021, we completed the sale of Cost Plus World Market for approximately $63.7 million in proceeds, and recognized a loss on the sale of $72.0 million, which is inclusive of a $54.0 million charge recorded during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 to remeasure the disposal group that was classified as held for sale to the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell.
Operating Loss
Operating loss for fiscal 2020 was $336.9 million or 3.6% of net sales, $700.1 million or 6.3% of net sales for fiscal 2019, and $87.1 million or 0.7% of net sales in fiscal 2018. The favorable change in operating loss as a percentage of net sales between fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 was primarily due to an increase in the gross margin, lower goodwill and other impairments compared to the prior year period, partially offset by increased SG&A expenses and restructuring and transformation initiative expenses. The current year reductions of net sales reflected the impact of the temporary nationwide closure of the majority of our stores due to COVID-19, nearly all of which reopened as of July 2020, as well as the impact of the divestitures.
The increase in operating loss as a percentage of net sales between fiscal 2019 and 2018 was the result of the reductions in gross profit margin, the increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales and goodwill and other impairments, as described above.
Interest Expense, net
Interest expense, net was $76.9 million, $64.8 million and $69.5 million in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For fiscal 2020, the increase in interest expense, net was primarily driven by lower interest income on investments and increased interest costs attributable to our revolving credit facilities, primarily relating to the new ABL Facility, partially offset by lower interest expense primarily related to the repurchase of a portion of the senior unsecured notes in August 2020. For fiscal 2019 and 2018, interest expense, net primarily related to interest on the senior unsecured notes issued in July 2014. Included in interest expense, net was an expense of $2.7 million for fiscal 2018 related to changes in our nonqualified deferred compensation plan ("NQDC") investments, which was fully offset by the corresponding change in the NQDC liability recorded in SG&A, with no net impact to the consolidated statement of earnings. On December 27, 2017, we terminated our nonqualified deferred compensation plan and during fiscal 2018, all participants' balances were liquidated and disbursed to those participants.
Gain on Extinguishment of Debt
During fiscal 2020, we recorded a $77 million gain on the repurchase of $75 million principal amount of 4.915% senior unsecured notes due August 1, 2034 and $225 million principal of 5.165% senior unsecured notes due August 1, 2044 (see "Long Term Debt," Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements).
Income Taxes
The effective tax rate was 55.2% for fiscal 2020, 19.7% for fiscal 2019 and 12.4% for fiscal 2018.
For fiscal 2020, the effective tax rate reflects our expectation to carry back the net operating loss to a year in which the tax rate was 35%, and includes the impact of the benefit of certain tax planning strategies the Company deployed, in addition to the losses from the divestitures of CTS, Linen Holdings and Cost Plus, partially offset by the impact of impairment charges for tradename and certain store-level assets, the gain on the divestiture of PMall, a benefit related to fiscal 2019 net operating loss carry-back under the CARES Act, and other discrete tax items resulting in net after tax benefits.
For fiscal 2019, the effective tax rate reflects the impact of charges, portions of which are non-deductible for tax purposes, for goodwill and other impairments, an incremental charge for markdowns, severance costs, shareholder activity costs and a loss from a sale-leaseback transaction, including transaction costs. For fiscal 2018, the effective tax rate reflects the impact of charges, portions of which are non-deductible for tax purposes, for goodwill and other impairments, severance costs and a gain from the sale of a building.
For fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, the effective tax rate included net benefit of approximately $2.1 million, net expense of approximately $4.3 million and net benefit of approximately $12.1 million, respectively, due to the recognition of discrete federal and state tax items.
Potential volatility in the effective tax rate from year to year may occur as we are required each year to determine whether new information changes the assessment of both the probability that a tax position will effectively be sustained and the appropriateness of the amount of recognized benefit.
Net Loss
As a result of the factors described above, the net loss for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, was $150.8 million, $613.8 million and $137.2 million, respectively.
Transformation
We are executing on a comprehensive plan to transform our business and position us for long-term success under the leadership of our President and CEO Mark Tritton, who joined the Company on November 4, 2019. Mr. Tritton has been assessing our operations, portfolio, capabilities and culture and is developing and implementing the initial stages of a strategic plan designed to re-establish our leading position as the preferred omnichannel home destination, which is grounded in five key pillars: product, price, promise, place and people. With these five pillars as our framework, and a singular purpose to make it easy for customers to feel at home, we are embracing a commitment to build and manage a modern, durable omnichannel model.
Early actions include the extensive restructure of our leadership team. Interim leaders were appointed in merchandising, marketing, digital, stores, operations, finance, legal and human resources. During fiscal 2020, we announced the hiring of a new leadership team, consisting of the following:
•On March 4, 2020, Joe Hartsig joined the Company as Executive Vice President, Chief Merchandising Officer of the Company and President of Harmon Stores Inc.;
•On May 4, 2020, Gustavo Arnal joined the Company as Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer;
•On May 11, 2020, Rafeh Masood joined the Company as Executive Vice President, Chief Digital Officer;
•On May 11, 2020, Gregg Melnick assumed the role of Executive Vice President, Chief Stores Officer. Previously, Mr. Melnick served as the Company’s interim Chief Digital Officer;
•On May 18, 2020, John Hartmann joined the Company as Chief Operating Officer of the Company and President, buybuy BABY;
•On May 18, 2020, Arlene Hong joined the Company as Executive Vice President, Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary;
•On May 26, 2020, Cindy Davis joined the Company as Executive Vice President, Chief Brand Officer of the Company and President, Decorist; and
•On September 28, 2020, Lynda Markoe joined the Company as Executive Vice President, Chief People and Culture Officer.
As discussed in "Overview" above, as part of our business transformation, we are also pursuing deliberate actions as part of our restructuring program to drive profit improvement over the next two-to-three years. We expect to reinvest a portion of the expected cost savings into future growth initiatives.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We have been able to finance our operations, including our growth and acquisitions, substantially through internally generated funds. As previously described, we began temporary store closures in March 2020 and the majority of our stores were temporarily closed during the first quarter 2020. Subsequently, we began a measured approach to re-opening our stores, subject to state and local regulations, and nearly all of our stores reopened as of July 2020. During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we elected to draw down the remaining $236.4 million of available funds under our $250 million revolving credit facility (the "Revolver"), which was refinanced with our $850 million secured asset-based revolving credit facility entered into on June 19, 2020 (the "ABL Facility"). These borrowings were subsequently repaid during the second quarter of fiscal 2020. The new ABL Facility matures on June 19, 2023 and provides us with additional liquidity. Our ability to borrow under the ABL Facility is based upon a specified borrowing base consisting of a percentage of our eligible inventory and credit card receivables as defined in the ABL Facility, net of applicable reserves (See "Long Term Debt," Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements).
During fiscal 2020, we divested of One Kings Lane, PMall, CTS, Linen Holdings and Cost Plus World Market, generating aggregate net proceeds of approximately $534 million, which are expected be used to reinvest in our core business operations to drive growth, fund share repurchases, reduce our outstanding debt, or some combination of these.
During the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we paid approximately $220.9 million to repurchase $300 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 4.915% Senior Notes due 2034 and 5.165% Senior Notes due 2044.
In October 2020, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement ("ASR Agreement") with JP Morgan to repurchase $225.0 million of our common stock. Pursuant to the ASR Agreement, we paid $225.0 million to JP Morgan and received an initial delivery of approximately 4.5 million shares of common stock. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we received an additional 6.3 million shares under this ASR Agreement. In January 2021, we entered into a second accelerated share repurchase agreement ("ASR Agreement 2") to repurchase an aggregate of $150.0 million of our common stock, subject to market conditions. Pursuant to ASR Agreement 2, we paid $150.0 million to JP Morgan, and received an initial delivery of 5.0 million shares, which was accounted for as a treasury stock transaction and resulted in a $102.5 million increase in treasury stock and reduced the weighted average shares outstanding. We also recorded a $47.6 million decrease in additional paid in capital upon the inception of ASR Agreement 2. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2020, final settlement under ASR Agreement 2 occurred and we received an additional 0.2 million shares. In addition, subsequent to the end of fiscal 2020, our Board of Directors expanded the existing share repurchase authorization by an additional $175 million, which increased the total share repurchase authorization to $12.950 billion.
We ended fiscal 2020 in a strong cash position, which we anticipate maintaining, to provide us the flexibility to fund our ongoing initiatives and act upon other opportunities that may arise. As of February 27, 2021, we had approximately $1.373 billion in cash and investment securities, a decrease of approximately $33.9 million compared with $1.406 billion as of February 29, 2020. We believe that we can continue to finance our operations through existing and internally generated funds for the next twelve months. In addition, if necessary, we have the ability to borrow under our ABL Facility, subject to customary conditions, including no default, the accuracy of representations and warranties, and borrowing base availability. The ABL Facility contains an anti-cash hoarding provision which limits the availability of loans under the credit facility to $600 million (plus the amount of any incremental first-in-last-out loans) if, after giving effect to any borrowing and the application of proceeds thereof, we have greater than $100 million in unrestricted cash or cash equivalents in the aggregate as of the date of such borrowing. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, for fiscal 2020, we have and continue to take measures to preserve our liquidity, including the suspension of the payment of dividends; postponement of certain capital expenditures and, among other things, renegotiating payment terms for goods, services and rent, managing to lower inventory levels, and reducing discretionary spend such as business travel, advertising and expense associated with the maintenance of stores that were temporarily closed. Similar to other retailers, we withheld portions of and/or delayed payments to certain of our business partners as we seek to renegotiate payment terms, in order to further maintain liquidity given the temporary store closures. In some instances, the renegotiations of lease terms have led to agreements with landlords for rent abatements or rental deferrals. Total payments withheld and/or delayed or deferred as of February 27, 2021 were approximately $9.6 million and are included in current liabilities. During fiscal 2020, we
recognized reduced rent expense of $10.3 million related to rent abatement concessions. Additional negotiations of payment terms are still in process, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully renegotiate payment terms with all such business partners, and the ultimate outcome of these activities including the responses of certain business partners are not yet known. We are also executing on our business transformation program, which is designed to improve our profitability and includes the planned closure of 200 mostly Bed Bath & Beyond stores under our store network optimization program and workforce reductions as part of our restructuring program.
Fiscal 2020 compared to Fiscal 2019
Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2020 was $268.1 million, compared with $590.9 million in fiscal 2019. The year-over-year decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the net decrease in cash provided by components of working capital (primarily merchandise inventories and other current assets, partially offset by accounts payable). This decrease was partially offset by a decrease in net loss, adjusted for non-cash expenses.
Retail inventory, which includes inventory in our distribution facilities for direct to customer shipments, was approximately $1.7 billion at February 27, 2021, a decrease of approximately 18.0% compared to retail inventory at February 29, 2020, which is primarily related to the fiscal 2020 divestitures. We continue to focus on our inventory optimization strategies.
Net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2020 was $737.9 million, compared with $91.4 million net cash used in fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2020, net cash provided by investing activities included $386.5 million of redemptions of investment securities and $534.5 million in proceeds from sale of businesses, partially offset by $183.1 million of capital expenditures. In fiscal 2019, net cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to $267.3 million of proceeds from a sale-leaseback transaction and $101.5 million of redemptions of investment securities, net of purchases, partially offset by $277.4 million of capital expenditures.
Net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2020 was $632.3 million, compared with $182.8 million in fiscal 2019. The increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to net debt repayments of $221.4 million, primarily associated with the repurchase of a portion of the outstanding senior notes during the second quarter of fiscal 2020, an increase of $232.8 million in treasury stock repurchases, and an increase of $47.6 million related to prepayment under share repurchase agreement, partially offset by lower dividend payments of $62.4 million.
Fiscal 2019 compared to Fiscal 2018
Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2019 was $590.9 million, compared with $918.3 million in fiscal 2018. Year over year, we experienced a decrease in net earnings and an increase in cash provided by the net components of working capital (primarily merchandise inventories and accrued expenses and other current liabilities, partially offset by trading investment securities and other current assets).
Retail inventory, which includes inventory in our distribution facilities for direct to customer shipments, was approximately $2.1 billion at February 29, 2020, a decrease of approximately 20.0% compared to retail inventory at March 2, 2019, as we continued our focus on our inventory optimization strategies.
Net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2019 was $91.4 million, compared with $509.7 million net cash used in fiscal 2018. In fiscal 2019, net cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to $267.3 million of proceeds from a sale-leaseback transaction and $101.5 million of redemptions of investment securities, net of purchases, partially offset by $277.4 million of capital expenditures. In fiscal 2018, net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to $325.4 million of capital expenditures and $195.5 million of purchases of investment securities, net of redemptions.
Net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2019 was $182.8 million, compared with $238.6 million in fiscal 2018. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to a year over year decrease in common stock repurchases of $48.4 million.
Other Fiscal 2020 Information
Between December 2004 and December 2020, our Board of Directors authorized, through several share repurchase programs, the repurchase of $12.775 billion of our common stock. Since 2004 through the end of fiscal 2020, we have repurchased approximately $11.0 billion of our common stock through share repurchase programs. We have approximately $1.7 billion remaining of authorized share repurchases as of February 27, 2021. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2020, our Board of Directors expanded the existing share repurchase authorization by an additional $175 million, which increased the total share repurchase authorization to $12.950 billion. Our share repurchase program could change, and any future share repurchases will be subject to
the determination of the Board of Directors, based on an evaluation of our earnings, financial condition and requirements, business conditions and other factors, including the restrictions on share repurchases under the Credit Agreement (see "Long Term Debt" Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements)
During fiscal 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a quarterly dividend program. During fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, total cash dividends of $23.1 million, $85.5 million and $86.3 million were paid, respectively. In March 2020, we suspended our future quarterly declarations of cash dividends as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Any future quarterly cash dividend payments on our common stock will be subject to the determination by the Board of Directors, based on an evaluation of our earnings, financial condition and requirements, business conditions and other factors, including the restrictions on the payment of dividends under the secured asset-based revolving credit facility (see "Long Term Debt," Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements).
We have contractual obligations consisting mainly of principal and interest related to the senior unsecured notes, operating leases for stores, offices, distribution facilities and equipment, purchase obligations, and other long-term liabilities which we are obligated to pay as of February 27, 2021 as follows:
(1) On July 17, 2014, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.749% senior unsecured notes due August 1, 2024, $300 million aggregate principal amount of 4.915% senior unsecured notes due August 1, 2034 and $900 million aggregate principal amount of 5.165% senior unsecured notes due August 1, 2044. In fiscal 2020, we purchased and retired approximately $75.0 million of the 4.915% senior unsecured notes due 2034 and approximately $225.0 million of the 5.165% senior unsecured notes due 2044.
(2) The amounts presented represent the undiscounted future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases, inclusive of a financing obligation in the amount of $20.6 million related to operating leases entered into as a result of a sale-leaseback transaction completed during fiscal 2019. In addition to minimum rent, certain of the Company's leases require the payment of additional variable costs for insurance, maintenance and other costs. These additional amounts are not included in the table of contractual commitments as the timing and/or amounts of such payments are not known. As of February 27, 2021, we have entered leases which have not yet commenced for two new or relocated locations planned for opening in fiscal 2021, for which aggregate minimum rental payments over the term of the leases are approximately $7.7 million. Such amounts are included in the table above, but have not been recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as of February 27, 2021.
(3) Purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders for merchandise.
(4) Other long-term liabilities are primarily comprised of income taxes payable, workers' compensation and general liability reserves and various other accruals and are recorded as Other Liabilities and Income Taxes Payable in the consolidated balance sheet as of February 27, 2021. The amounts associated with these other long-term liabilities have been reflected only in the total column in the table above as the timing and / or amount of any cash payment is uncertain.
SEASONALITY
Our business is subject to seasonal influences. Generally, our sales volumes are higher in the calendar months of August, November, and December, and lower in February.
INFLATION
We do not believe that our operating results have been materially affected by inflation during the past year. There can be no assurance, however, that our operating results will not be affected by inflation in the future.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to establish accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be relevant under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. In particular, judgment is used in areas such as inventory valuation, impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets, accruals for self-insurance and income and certain other taxes. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Inventory Valuation: Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventory costs are primarily calculated using the weighted average retail inventory method.
Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail values of inventories. The inputs associated with determining the cost-to-retail ratio include: merchandise purchases, net of returns to vendors, discounts and volume and incentive rebates; inbound freight expenses; duty, insurance and commissions.
The retail inventory method contains certain management judgments that may affect inventory valuation. At any one time, inventories include items that have been written down to our best estimate of their realizable value. Judgment is required in estimating realizable value and factors considered are the age of merchandise, anticipated demand based on factors such as customer preferences and fashion trends, as well as anticipated markdowns to reduce the price of merchandise from its recorded retail price to a retail price at which it is expected to be sold in the future. These estimates are based on historical experience and current information about future events which are inherently uncertain. Actual realizable value could differ materially from this estimate based upon future customer demand or economic conditions, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic.
We estimate our reserve for shrinkage throughout the year based on historical shrinkage and any current trends, if applicable. Actual shrinkage is recorded at year end based upon the results of our physical inventory counts for locations at which counts were conducted. For locations where physical inventory counts were not conducted in the fiscal year, an estimated shrink reserve is recorded based on historical shrinkage and any current trends, if applicable. Historically, our shrinkage has not been volatile.
We accrue for merchandise in transit once we take legal ownership and title to the merchandise; as such, an estimate for merchandise in transit is included in our merchandise inventories.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: We review long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may exceed their current fair values. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. Judgment is required in estimating the fair value of the assets including assumptions related to sales growth rates and market rental rates. These estimates are based on historical experience and current information about future events which are inherently uncertain. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated.
In fiscal 2020 and 2019, we recorded $92.9 million and $75.1 million, respectively, of non-cash pre-tax impairment charges within goodwill and other impairments in the consolidated statement of operations for certain store-level assets, including leasehold improvements and operating lease assets. In fiscal 2018, we recorded a $23.0 million non-cash pre-tax impairment charge within goodwill and other impairments in the consolidated statement of operations for certain store-level assets. Of the stores impaired during fiscal 2020, partial impairments were recorded at 136 stores, of which 41 were subsequently divested during 2020, resulting in a remaining net book value of long-lived assets at risk of $89.7 million as of February 27, 2021, inclusive of leasehold improvements and right-of-use assets. We will continue to monitor these stores closely. If actual results differ from the estimated undiscounted future cash flows or the estimated price market participants would be willing to pay to sublease store operating leases and acquire remaining store assets, which among other factors, may be impacted by the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may be exposed to additional impairment losses that may be material. If events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that a long-lived asset is impaired, we will adjust the carrying value of these long-lived assets in the period in which the impairment occurs.
Goodwill and Other Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets: We review goodwill and other intangibles that have indefinite lives for impairment annually as of the end of the fiscal year or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. Impairment testing is based upon the best information available, including estimates of fair value which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value. Significant assumptions and estimates are required, including, but not limited to, projecting future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates, margins, growth rates, and other assumptions, to estimate the fair value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. Although we believe that the assumptions and estimates made are reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results. In addition, sustained declines in our stock price and related market capitalization could impact key assumptions in the overall estimated fair values of our reporting units and could result in non-cash impairment charges that could be material to our consolidated balance sheet or result of operations. Prior to fiscal 2018, we had not recorded an impairment to our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets.
In fiscal 2018, we recognized non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of $285.1 million and $40.1 million for the North American Retail and Institutional Sales reporting units, respectively. As of June 1, 2019, we completed a quantitative impairment analysis of goodwill related to our reporting units by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. We performed a discounted cash flow analysis and market multiple analysis for each reporting unit. Based upon the analysis performed, we determined that goodwill was fully impaired and recognized a non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $391.1 million for the North American Retail reporting unit. The non-cash pre-tax impairment charge was primarily the result of a sustained decline in our market capitalization.
Other indefinite lived intangible assets were recorded as a result of acquisitions and primarily consist of tradenames. We value our tradenames using a relief-from-royalty approach, which assumes the value of the tradename is the discounted cash flows of the amount that would be paid by a hypothetical market participant had they not owned the tradename and instead licensed the tradename from another company. For fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, for certain other indefinite lived intangible assets, we completed a quantitative impairment analysis by comparing the fair value of the tradenames to their carrying value and recognized non-cash pre-tax tradename impairment charges of $35.1 million, $41.8 million and $161.7 million, respectively, within goodwill and other impairments in the consolidated statement of operations. For the remaining other indefinite lived intangible assets, we assessed qualitative factors as of February 27, 2021 in order to determine whether any events and circumstances existed which indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of these other indefinite lived assets did not exceed their carrying values and concluded no such events or circumstances existed which would require an impairment test be performed. As of February 27, 2021, we have $22.0 million of remaining other indefinite lived intangible assets. If actual results differ from the estimated future cash flows, which, among other factors, may be impacted by the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may be exposed to additional impairment losses that may be material. In the future, if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired, we will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs.
Self-Insurance: We utilize a combination of insurance and self-insurance for a number of risks including workers’ compensation, general liability, cyber liability, property liability, automobile liability and employee related health care benefits (a portion of which is paid by our employees). Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Although our claims experience has not displayed substantial volatility in the past, actual experience could materially vary from our historical experience in the future. Factors that affect these estimates include but are not limited to: inflation, the number and severity of claims and regulatory changes. In the future, if we conclude an adjustment to self-insurance accruals is required, the liability will be adjusted accordingly.
Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we began insuring portions of our workers' compensation and medical insurance through a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary (the "Captive") to enhance our risk financing strategies. The Captive is subject to regulations in Vermont, including those relating to its levels of liquidity. The Captive was in compliance with all regulations as of February 27, 2021. As of February 27, 2021, the cash and cash equivalents at the Captive were $43.1 million.
Taxes: We account for our income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date.
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Act. The Tax Act included a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and as a result, all previously
unremitted earnings for which no U.S. deferred tax liability had been previously accrued has now been subject to U.S. tax. Notwithstanding the U.S. taxation of these amounts, we intend to continue to reinvest the unremitted earnings of our Canadian subsidiary. Accordingly, no additional provision has been made for U.S. or additional non-U.S. taxes with respect to these earnings, except for the transition tax resulting from the Tax Act. In the event of repatriation to the U.S., it is expected that such earnings would be subject to non-U.S. withholding taxes offset, in whole or in part, by U.S. foreign tax credits.
We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is at least more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the taxing authorities.
Potential volatility in the effective tax rate from year to year may occur as we are required each year to determine whether new information changes the assessment of both the probability that a tax position will effectively be sustained and the appropriateness of the amount of recognized benefit.
We also accrue for certain other taxes as required by our operations.
Judgment is required in determining the provision for income and other taxes and related accruals, and deferred tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, our various tax returns are subject to audit by various tax authorities. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates.
