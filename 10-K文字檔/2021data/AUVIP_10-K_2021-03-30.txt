The Company acquired all of the capital stock of SteriLumen in March of 2019 pursuant to two exchange agreements in which all of the stockholders of SteriLumen exchanged their shares in SteriLumen for shares of common stock in the Company. The Company acquired all of the equity of MunnWorks in July of 2019 pursuant to an exchange agreement in exchange for shares of common stock in the Company.

Sterilumen was formed to engage in the design, manufacture, assembly and distribution of the SteriLumen Disinfecting System for use in hospitals and other healthcare facilities. The Company has received several patent approvals for the SteriLumen Disinfecting System from the United States and the European Union and is in the process of receiving approval from various countries including China, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and the Gulf Cooperation Council.

Principal Factors Affecting Our Financial Performance

• our ability to offer competitive product pricing;
• our ability to broaden product offerings;
• industry demand and competition; and
• market conditions and our market positions
Results of Operations
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019
Net sales and gross profit are the most significant drivers of our operating performance. Net sales consist of all sales to customers, net of returns. Our net sales for year ended 2020 decreased by 58.7% to $5,732,734 from $9,095,150 in year ended 2019. All net sales for all periods presented were substantially generated from our MunnWorks subsidiary. Revenues and margins were significantly impacted from the suspension of operations of hotels and the impact to the hospitality industry from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Accordingly, gross profit expressed as a percentage of net sales can be influenced by many factors including overall sales performance. For year ended 2020, gross profit decreased 205.7% to $1,009,336 from $3,085,420 for year ended 2019. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 17.6% for year ended 2020 from 33.9% in year ended 2019, primarily driven by a significant decrease in sales generated from our domestic manufacturing. Major components and cost drivers of our cost of sales is influenced by the cost of materials, freight, overhead, and labor costs. In order to comply with the payroll protection program foregiveness requirements, the company kept many of their employees and there was significant downtime charged to cost of sales. Direct overhead costs from year to year remained consistent which resulted in higher overhead costs as a percentage of revenue. In addition, the company lowered its prices in order to stay competitive within the market.
Operating expenses, including the costs of operating our corporate office, are also an important component of our operating performance. Compensation and benefits comprise the majority of our operating expenses. Operating expenses contain fixed and variable costs and managing the operating expense ratio (operating expenses expressed as a percentage of net sales) is an important focus of management as we seek to increase our overall profitability. Operating expenses include cash costs as well as non-cash costs, such as stock based compensation and depreciation and amortization associated with corporate and property and equipment and impairment of long-lived assets. Operating expenses can also include certain costs that are of a one-time or non-recurring nature. For year ended 2020, Operating expenses increased 55.67% to $4,322,228 from $1,916,386 in year ended 2019. The change was primarily driven from an increase in professional fees, office salaries, research and development costs and stock based compensation. During 2020, the company hired a Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operations Officer, Vice President of Global Sales, and Vice President of Product Marketing and Corporate Development. The president of the company also took a $400,000 salary in 2020 that was not taken in 2019.
Net other income was $10,936 in year ended 2020, compared to net other income of $1,504,663 in year ended 2019, representing a decrease of $1,493,727. The decrease from 2019 was primarily due to a gain on settlement of $1,520,399 from the Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Case that was recorded in 2019. As a result of settlement in the bankruptcy case, the Company was able to settle certain liabilities at a significantly reduced amount. The difference between the carrying amount of the liability and the settled amount was recorded as a gain on settlement as other income.
Income tax expense was $66,854 in year ended 2020, compared to income tax expense of $106,801 in year ended 2019, representing a decrease of $40,007. The Company did not have income in 2020 and the amount expensed in 2020 related to a true up adjustment for 2019 taxes owed.
