GENERAL
The Company has 72 franchised and 7 licensed units with 1 unit under development at the end of 2020. Units in operation and under development at the end of 2019 included 72 franchised and 7 licensed units and 2 units under development. System-wide revenues were $28.6 million in 2020 and $34.3 million in 2019.
The Company's revenues are derived primarily from the ongoing royalties paid to the Company by its franchisees and from receipt of initial franchise fees. Additionally, the Company derives revenue from the sale of licensed products (My Favorite Muffin mix, Big Apple Bagels cream cheese and Brewster's coffee) to franchisees, licensees and other approved customers.
YEAR 2020 COMPARED TO YEAR 2019
Total revenues from all sources decreased $698,000, or 22.7%, to $2,372,000 in 2020 from $3,070,000 in the prior year. Marketing revenue decreased $316,000 in 2020 compared to 2019, franchise fee revenue decreased $12,000 in 2020 versus 2019, royalty revenue decreased $267,000 and licensing and other revenue decreased $103,000 in 2020 compared to 2019.
Royalty revenue from franchise stores decreased $267,000, or 16.2%, to $1,379,000 in 2020 as compared to $1,646,000 in 2019. The decrease in royalty revenue was primarily a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in temporary store closings and reduced customer traffic. Franchise fee revenue decreased $12,000, or 35.3%, to $22,000 in 2020 as compared to $34,000 in 2019. During fiscal 2020 there were 4 transfers of which $5,000 was recognized and 3 were amortizable compared to 5 transfers recognizing $20,000 in 2019 with 1 being amortizable. Licensing fees and other income decreased $103,000, or 25.6%, to $299,000 in 2020 compared to $402,000 in 2019. Marketing fund revenues decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 because of a decrease in sales due to the COVID-19 pandemic and because the Company waived marketing fees from franchises. In order for the Company to assist its franchises during COVID-19, from week ending March 22, through May 31, 2020 marketing fees were waived and a graduated return to the original 3% fees was reinstated with 1.5% in June, 2% in July and then 3% week ending August 2, 2020.
Total operating expenses in 2020 were $2,138,000, or 90.2% of revenues, compared to $2,596,000, or 84.6% of revenues in 2019. Total operating expenses in 2020 decreased $458,000, or 17.6%, in 2020 compared to 2019.
The decrease in operating expenses of $458,000 in 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in marketing expenses of $316,000, which was due to COVID-19 and reduced marketing fund revenues. In addition, the Company responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by reducing several variable expenses such as advertising expense, which decreased $37,000. Additionally, an employee retired in May 2020 without replacement and no bonuses were paid in 2020 reducing employee benefit expense and payroll and payroll tax expenses by $100,000. Our professional service providers worked with us during the pandemic to assist us in reducing accounting fees by $4,000 and we reduced legal and consulting fees by $13,000. The pandemic also restricted travel and the expense was reduced by $29,000. In 2020 compared to 2019. These reductions in expenses were offset by fixed cost increases in 2020 of $14,000 in occupancy expense, $10,000 in general tax expense, $4,000 in insurance expense and general expenses of $13,000 compared to 2019.
Interest income was less than $1,000 in 2020 and $1,000 in 2019.
There was an income tax expense in 2020 of $300,000, which includes $285,000 of noncash deferred tax expense and $15,000 of state income tax expense in 2020 compared to $25,000 of state income tax expense in 2019. There was a net loss of $66,000 in 2020 versus net income of $449,000 in 2019. The fiscal 2020 net loss included a deferred tax adjustment related to utilized and projected unutilized federal net operating losses which reduced the deferred tax asset for expiring federal NOL’s.
Total operating income was $233,000 in 2020 or 9.8% of revenue as compared to $473,000 or 15.4% of revenue in the prior year. In 2020 there was a $0.01 loss per share for basic and diluted outstanding shares and $.06 per share income for basic and diluted outstanding shares in 2019.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
At November 30, 2020, the Company had working capital of $732,000 and unrestricted cash of $1,236,000, which includes the proceeds of a Payroll Protection Program loan of $228,155. At November 30, 2019, the Company had working capital of $813,000 and unrestricted cash of $1,095,000.
During fiscal 2020, the Company had a net loss of $66,000 and operating activities which provided cash of $213,000. The principal adjustments to reconcile the net loss to cash provided by operating activities were depreciation and amortization of $4,000, deferred tax expense of $285,000 and noncash lease expense of $99,000, less the provision for uncollectible accounts of $7,000. In addition, changes in other operating assets and liabilities decreased cash a total of $88,000. During fiscal 2019, the Company had net income of $449,000 and operating activities which provided cash of $432,000. The principal adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities were depreciation and amortization of $2,000, deferred tax expense of $48,000 and noncash lease expense of $75,000, less the provision for uncollectible accounts of $15,000. In addition, changes in other operating assets and liabilities decreased cash a total of $128,000.
During fiscal 2020, the Company used $13,000 for investing activities for equipment purchases and trademark renewal. During fiscal 2019, the Company used $9,000 for investing activities for equipment purchases and trademark renewals.
Financing activities in fiscal 2020 included funds increasing cash flow of $228,155 for a PPP loan and cash distributions/dividend payments to common stockholders of $291,000 and in 2019, $436,000 was used for cash distributions/dividend payments to common stockholders.
Although there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to pay cash distributions/dividends in the future, it is the Company’s intent that future cash distributions/dividends will be considered based on profitability expectations and financing needs and will be declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors. It is the Company’s intent going forward to declare and pay cash distributions/dividends on a quarterly basis if warranted.
Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company suspended dividends through the fourth quarter of 2020. Future cash distributions/dividends will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs for fiscal 2021. On January 27, 2021 the Board of Directors declared a $0.01 dividend payable February 2021.
Determination of whether distributions are considered a cash distribution, cash dividend or combination of the two will not be made until after December 31, 2020, as the classification or combination is dependent upon the Company’s earnings and profits for tax purposes for its fiscal year ending November 30, 2020.
The Company believes execution of its cash distribution/dividend policy will not have any material adverse effects on its ability to fund current operations or future capital investments.
The Company was granted a Payroll Protection Program loan in May 2020 in the amount $228,155. The loan was forgiven through the SBA on December 8, 2020 and will be reflected in other income during our fiscal year 2021 first quarter.

OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
The Company has no off balance sheet arrangements.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Company's significant accounting policies are presented in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (see Note 2 of the audited consolidated financial statements included herein). While all of the significant accounting policies impact the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, some of the policies may be viewed to be more critical. The more critical policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations and that require management's most difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments and estimates. Management bases its judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of judgments and estimates form the basis for making judgments about the Company's value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the following are its most critical accounting policies because they require more significant judgments and estimates in preparation of its consolidated financial statements.
Long-Lived Assets
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Improvements and replacements are capitalized, while expenditures for maintenance and routine repairs that do not extend the life of the asset are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Property, equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Estimated useful lives for the purpose of depreciation and amortization are 3 to 7 years for property and equipment and 10 years, or the term of the lease if less, for leasehold improvements.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Following the guidelines contained in ASC 350, the Company tests goodwill and intangible assets that are not subject to amortization for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that impairment is possible. The Company has elected to conduct its annual test during the first quarter. During the quarters ended February 28, 2020 and 2019 management qualitatively assessed goodwill to determine whether testing was necessary. Factors that management considers in this assessment include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, overall financial performance (both current and projected), changes in management and strategy, and changes in the composition and carrying amounts of net assets. If this qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative assessment is then performed.
Although the COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruption to our industry, the Company has been able to recover much quicker than expected and 2020 total revenues, excluding marketing fund revenues were 81.6% of fiscal 2019 total revenues. Management reviewed and updated the qualitative assessment conducted during the first quarter 2020 and at year end and does not believe that any impairment exists at November 30, 2020.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Certain financial instruments potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk. These financial instruments consist primarily of royalty and wholesale accounts receivables. The Company believes it has maintained adequate reserves for doubtful accounts. The Company reviews the collectability of receivables periodically taking into account payment history and industry conditions.

Valuation Allowance and Deferred Taxes
A valuation allowance is the portion of a deferred tax asset for which it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.
The Company routinely reviews the future realization of tax assets based on projected future reversals of taxable temporary differences, available tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income. As of November 30, 2020, the net operating loss carryforwards which it believes it will utilize are approximately $756,000, expiring between 2021 and 2029 for U.S. federal tax purposes.
Leases
The company accounts for leases under ASC 842. Lease arrangements are determined at the inception of the contract. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, other current liabilities and long-term operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. As most leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Franchise and related revenue
The Company sells individual franchises. The franchise agreements typically require the franchisee to pay an initial, non-refundable fee prior to opening the respective location(s), and continuing royalty fees on a weekly basis based upon a percentage of franchisee net sales. The initial term of franchise agreements are typically 10 years. Subject to the Company’s approval, a franchisee may generally renew the franchise agreement upon its expiration. If approved, a franchisee may transfer a franchise agreement to a new or existing franchisee, at which point a transfer fee is typically paid by the current owner which then terminates that franchise agreement. A franchise agreement is signed with the new franchisee with no franchise fee required. If a contract is terminated prior to its term, it is a breach of contract and a penalty is assessed based on a formula reviewed and approved by management. Revenue generated from a contract breach is termed settlement income by the Company and included in licensing fees and other income.
Under the terms of our franchise agreements, the Company typically promises to provide franchise rights, pre-opening services such as blueprints, operational materials, planning and functional training courses, and ongoing services, such as management of the marketing fund. The Company considers certain pre-opening activities and the franchise rights and related ongoing services represent two separate performance obligations. The franchise fee revenue has been allocated to the two separate performance obligations using a residual approach. The Company has estimated the value of performance obligations related to certain pre-opening activities deemed to be distinct based on cost plus an applicable margin, and assigned the remaining amount of the initial franchise fee to the franchise rights and ongoing services. Revenue allocated to preopening activities is recognized when (or as) these services are performed. Revenue allocated to franchise rights and ongoing services is deferred until the store opens, and recognized on a straight line basis over the duration of the agreement, as this ensures that revenue recognition aligns with the customer’s access to the franchise right.
Royalty income is recognized during the respective franchise agreement based on the royalties earned each period as the underlying franchise store sales occur.
There are two items involving revenue recognition of contracts that require us to make subjective judgments: the determination of which performance obligations are distinct within the context of the overall contract and the estimated stand alone selling price of each obligation. In instances where our contract includes significant customization or modification services, the customization and modification services are generally combined and recorded as one distinct performance obligation.

Nontraditional and rebate revenue
As part of the Company’s franchise agreements, the franchisee purchases products and supplies from designated vendors. The Company may receive various fees and rebates from the vendors and distributors on product purchases by franchisees. In addition, the Company may collect various initial fees, and those fees are classified as deferred revenue in the balance sheet and straight lined over the life of the contract as deferred revenue in the balance sheet. The Company does not possess control of the products prior to their transfer to the franchisee and products are delivered to franchisees directly from the vendor or their distributors. The Company recognizes the rebates as franchisees purchase products and supplies from vendors or distributors and recognizes the initial fees over the contract life and the fees are reported as licensing fees and other income in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.
Gift card breakage revenue
The Company sells gift cards to its customers in its retail stores and through its Corporate office. The Company’s gift cards do not have an expiration date and are not redeemable for cash except where required by law. Revenue from gift cards is recognized upon redemption in exchange for product and reported within franchisee store revenue and the royalty and marketing fees are paid and shown in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Until redemption, outstanding customer balances are recorded as a liability. An obligation is recorded at the time of sale of the gift card and it is included in accrued expenses on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Included in accounts payable and accrued expenses at November 30, 2020 and 2019 were liabilities of $183,800 and $170,900, respectively for unredeemed gift cards.
The liability is reduced when the gift cards are redeemed by a franchise. Although there are no expiration dates for our gift cards, based on our analysis of historical gift card redemption patterns, we can reasonably estimate the amount of gift cards for which redemption is remote, which is referred to as “breakage.” The Company recognizes gift card breakage proportional to actual gift card redemptions on a quarterly basis and the corresponding revenue is included in licensing fees and other revenue. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the breakage rate and will be reassessed each quarter.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The standard’s main goal is to improve financial reporting by requiring earlier recognition of credit losses on financing receivables and other financial assets in scope, including trade receivables. The amendments in this update broaden the information that an entity must consider in developing its expected credit loss estimate for assets measured either collectively or individually. The guidance in ASU 2016-13 is effective for public companies for fiscal years and for interim periods with those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company will adopt ASU 2019-12 for fiscal year ending November 30, 2021.
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes,” which is intended to simplify various aspects related to accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and also clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. The amendments in ASU 2019-12 are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods therein. Early adoption of the standard is permitted, including adoption in interim or annual periods for which financial statements have yet been issued. The Company will adopt ASU 2019-12 for fiscal year ending November 30, 2022.
Management does not believe that there are any recently issued and effective or not yet effective accounting pronouncements as of November 30, 2020 that would have or are expected to have any significant effect on the Company’s financial position, cash flows or income statement.
