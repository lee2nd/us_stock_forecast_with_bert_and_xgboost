Results of Operations
Results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 include the operations of Func Food for the entire year, while results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 include the operations for Func Food beginning only as of the date of acquisition, October 25, 2019.
Year ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019
Revenue
For the year ended December 31, 2020, revenue was approximately $130.7 million, an increase of $55.6 million or 74.0% from $75.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Approximately 64% of this growth was as a result of increased revenues from North America where 2020 revenues were $95.5 million, an increase of $35.8 million or 60.0% from 2019. The balance of the increase was largely attributable to a 35% growth in European revenues to $33.7 million in 2020 from $14.5 million in 2019. 2020 results reflect the full financial impact of the consolidation of the results of operations of Func Food, which Celsius acquired in October 2019. Asian revenues (which primarily consist of royalty revenues from our China licensee) for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $1.1million, an increase of 30.0% from $840,648 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Other international markets generated $425,323 in revenues during the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $234,379 from $190,944 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The total increase in revenue from 2019 period to 2020 was primarily attributable to increases in sales volume, as opposed to increases in product pricing. The primary factors behind the increase in North American sales volume were related to growth in e-commerce channel, which accounted for 20.0% of the growth and expansion in our DSD distributor network which generated significant revenue increases when compared to 2019. As noted above, the full consolidation of Func Food revenue in 2020 as well as the favorable impact of the strengthening of the Euro also beneficially impacted revenues. We estimate that the strengthening of the Euro accounted for approximately 5.0% of the increase in European revenue in 2020 as compared to 2019.
The following table sets forth the amount of revenues by category and changes therein for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019:
Gross profit
For the year ended December 31, 2020, gross profit increased by approximately $29.7 million or 94.8% to $61.0 million, from $31.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Gross profit margins increased to 46.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 41.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in gross profit dollars and gross profit margins is mainly related to increases in volume, as opposed to increases in product pricing. Specifically, we estimate that increases in volume account for approximately 90% of the growth in gross profit (expressed in dollars) from 2019 to 2020. The impact of lower promotional allowances, together with supply chain savings or synergies as well as the favorable impact of the strength of the Euro accounted for the remaining approximately 10% of increase in gross profit dollars in 2020 when compared to 2019.
Sales and marketing expenses
Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were approximately $34.9 million, an increase of approximately $13.7 million or 65.1% from approximately $21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase reflects the impact of the consolidation of the operating results of Func Food following its October 2019 acquisition by the Company. As a result, our marketing investments increased by 81.3% or $6.4 million from 2019 to 2020. Similarly, all other sales and marketing expenses give effect to increases related to the consolidation of Func Food’s operations. Specifically, employee costs for 2020, which also include investments in human resources to properly service our markets, increased by $4.1 million or 62.1% from 2019. We estimated the currency impact to account for approximately $230,000 of the increase regarding employee costs when compared to the prior year. Moreover, due to the increase in business volume, our support to distributors, investments in trade activities and storage and distribution costs increased by $3.2 million from 2019 to 2020.
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were approximately $18.2 million, an increase of $6.6 million or 56.5% from $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase similarly reflects the full impact of the consolidation of Func Food’s operations for the entire 2020 year, which was present only for part of 2019 following the acquisition date on October 25, 2019. As such, administrative expenses reflected an increase of $2.6 million, which included an increase of approximately $260,000 in our bad debt reserve, to cover potential collectability risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Employee costs for the year ended December 31, 2020, reflect an increase of $1.6 million or 54.5%, not only attributable to the consolidation of Func Food’s operations, but also additional investments in resources in order to properly support our higher business volume. Additionally, we estimated the currency impact to account for 2% of the increase in employee costs when compared to the prior year. All other increases for general and administrative expenses from 2019 to 2020 amounted to $2.4 million. These increases are mainly the result of higher stock option expense of $1.5 million, depreciation and amortization of $835,000 and net increases in all other administrative expenses of $82,000.
Other Income/(expense)
Total net other Income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $730,000 which reflects a variance of 10.6 million when compared to net total other income of $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The variance of $10.6 million is mainly related to the recognition of a gain of $12.2 million pertaining to a note receivable from our Chinese licensee. The note receivable is the part of an agreement executed with our China distributor, related to the restructuring of our business relationship to a royalty-based model, which requires the repayment, over a five-year period, pursuant to an unsecured, interest-bearing note, of the investment the Company made in the China market during 2017 and 2018.
Net Income/Loss
As a result of all of the above, for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had net income of $8.5 million or $0.12 per share based on a weighted average of 70,195,085 shares outstanding and $0.11 per share based on a weighted average of 74,443,601 shares outstanding, which includes the dilutive impact of outstanding stock options to purchase 4,248,516 shares. In comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2019 there was net income of $10.0 million or $0.16 per share based on a weighted average of 60,761,995 shares outstanding, and after adding back interest expense on convertible notes of $348,493 and the amortization on discount on notes payable of $239,570, a diluted net income of $10.6 million or $0.16 per share based on a weighted average of 64,183,399 shares outstanding, which includes the dilutive impact of the stock options of 1,153,231 shares and the dilutive effect of the convertible notes of 2,268,173 shares.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, we had cash of approximately $43.2 million and $23.1 million, respectively, and working capital of approximately $64.9 million and $24.8 million, respectively.
In addition to cash flow from operations, our primary sources of working capital have been private placements and public offerings of our securities (including a private placement of 1,437,909 shares at a price of $15.30 completed on August 25, 2020 and an underwritten public offering of 7,986,110 shares at an offering price of $3.60 per share completed on September 16, 2019).
Our current operating plan for the next twelve (12) months reflects sufficient financial resources, notwithstanding the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic nevertheless; we do not contemplate obtaining additional financing.
Cash flows provided by operating activities
Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $3.4 million in 2020, representing a $2.4 million increase from $1.0 million in 2019. The increase was primarily driven by operating income adjusted for non-cash-items. The increase was further driven by efficient management of accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities.
Partially offsetting the increase in cash flows from operating activities was an increase in expenditures for prepaid expenses and other assets mainly related to deposits for inventory production, an increase accounts receivable mainly related to increase in sales volume and elimination of accounts receivable financing in Europe, as well as increased inventory levels to properly service demand for our products.
Cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities
Cash flows provided by investing activities totaled $0.8 million in 2020, representing a $15.1 million increase from net cash used in investing activities of $14.3 million in 2019. The increase was primarily due to the fact that 2019 included $14.2 million of cash consideration paid for the Func Food acquisition. The increase was further driven by collections of $1.3 million under a note receivable, which began in 2020.
Partially offsetting the increase in cash flows provided by investing activities was an increase in capital expenditures of $0.5 million, primarily attributable to the purchase of computer equipment and equipment utilized for trade-marketing and merchandising.
Cash flows provided by financing activities
Cash flows provided by financing activities totaled $15.6 million for 2020, representing a $13.1 million decrease from $28.7 in 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the fact that the Company fully repaid bonds in 2020 for $9.6 million and a $5.0 million difference in the amount of proceeds raised from common stock issuances in 2019 versus 2020. The decrease was further driven by the fact that 2019 included $1.5 million of proceeds received from a related party note and 2020 included cash paid for taxes on restricted stock of $0.7 million. Additionally, principal payments under finance leases increased by $0.255 million in 2020 mainly because Func Food was included in the Company’s consolidated results for the entire year, as opposed to only part of Q4 in 2019, as well as increased leasing activity.
Partially offsetting the decrease in cash flows provided by financing activities was a $3.9 million increase in proceeds from stock option exercises, primarily driven by increased stock price and vesting of options.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2020, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.
