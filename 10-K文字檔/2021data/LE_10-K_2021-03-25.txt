Executive Overview
Description of the Company
Lands' End, Inc. is a leading uni-channel retailer of casual clothing, accessories, footwear and home products. Operating out of America’s heartland, we believe our vision and values make a strong connection with our core customers. We offer products online at www.landsend.com, on third-party online marketplaces and through our own Company Operated store locations and third-party retail stores. We are a classic American lifestyle brand with a passion for quality, legendary service and real value. We seek to deliver timeless style for women, men, kids and the home.
Lands’ End was founded in 1963 by Gary Comer and his partners to sell sailboat hardware and equipment by catalog. While our product focus has shifted significantly over the years, we have continued to adhere to our founder’s motto as one of our guiding principles: "Take care of the customer, take care of the employee and the rest will take care of itself."
Lands’ End seeks to provide a common customer experience regardless of whether our customers are interacting with us on our company websites, third-party marketplaces, at Company Operated stores or other points of distribution.
We have one external reportable segment and identify our operating segments according to how our business activities are managed and evaluated. Our operating segments consist of: U.S. eCommerce, Outfitters, Europe eCommerce, Japan eCommerce, Third Party, and Retail. We have determined that each of our operating segments share similar economic and other qualitative characteristics, and therefore, the results of our operating segments are aggregated into one external reportable segment.
Product Channels
Lands’ End identifies five separate distribution channels for revenue reporting purposes:
U.S. eCommerce offers products through the Company's eCommerce website utilizing digital marketing and direct mail catalogs.
International offers products primarily to consumers located in Europe and Japan through eCommerce international websites, and third-party affiliates.
Outfitters sells products to end consumers, located primarily in the U.S., through negotiated arrangements to make specific styles or customized products available to employees and members of client organizations, as well as through the Company's eCommerce websites.
Third Party sells the same products as U.S. eCommerce but to domestic wholesale customers or direct to consumers through third-party marketplaces and websites.
Retail sells products and services through Company Operated stores.
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
A novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) surfaced in late 2019 and in March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
Health and Safety of Employees and Consumers
From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company’s priority has been the safety of employees and customers. On March 16, 2020, the Company temporarily closed its 26 U.S. Company Operated stores. These Company Operated stores reopened during Second Quarter 2020. Additionally, the Company opened four new Company Operated stores in Second Quarter 2020 and one new Company Operated store in Third Quarter 2020. These new Company Operated stores were already planned and construction underway prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has implemented extra precautions in its Company Operated stores, offices and distribution centers. These precautions were developed in line with guidance from global, federal and state health authorities, including work from home policies, social distancing, thermal scanning and partitions in all facilities.
Customer Demand
The eCommerce channel experienced a decline in customer demand in First Quarter 2020, which rebounded in Second Quarter 2020 and continued to be strong the remainder of the year. Consequently, Fiscal 2020 eCommerce revenue increased compared to prior year. Fiscal 2020 revenue in the Outfitters and Retail channels was lower than in Fiscal 2019 due to the reduction in customer demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Retail revenue also declined due to lengthy store closures. The ultimate timing and impact of customer demand levels will depend on the duration and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic, overall economic conditions and consumer preferences.
Supply Chain
The Company has not experienced significant supply chain disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company continues to place a priority on business continuity and contingency planning. The Company may experience disruptions in the supply chain as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, though the Company cannot reasonably estimate the potential impact or timing of those events, and the Company may not be able to mitigate such impact.
Expense Reduction
Beginning in First Quarter 2020, the Company took the following actions to reduce overall expenses as a response to decreased customer demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic:
•
Temporarily reduced base salaries, including a reduction of 50% in the base salary of its Chief Executive Officer, 20% reductions in the base salaries of the Company’s other senior management members and scaled salary reductions throughout the Company. All salaries were reinstated during Third Quarter 2020.
•
Furloughed approximately 70% of corporate employees from March 28, 2020 to April 13, 2020. As work demand increased, the remaining workforce returned to work on an as needed basis with all furloughs ending by mid-Second Quarter 2020. When the Company Operated stores temporarily closed nearly 100% of Company Operated store employees were furloughed until reopening.
•
Fiscal 2020 merit increases were eliminated.
•
The Board of Directors compensation was temporarily reduced. This compensation was reinstated in Third Quarter 2020.
•
The Company's 401(k) matching contribution was suspended from April 16, 2020 until January 30, 2021.
•
Other discretionary operating expenses were significantly reduced.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company’s planned capital expenditures for Fiscal 2020 were significantly reduced.
Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset
The Company considered the COVID-19 pandemic to be a triggering event in First Quarter 2020 for its Outfitters and Japan eCommerce reporting units and therefore completed an interim test for impairment of goodwill for these reporting units as of May 1, 2020. This testing resulted in no impairment of the Company’s Outfitters reporting unit and full impairment of the $3.3 million of goodwill allocated to the Company’s Japan eCommerce reporting unit recorded in the First Quarter 2020. There were no triggering events or impairment charges for any reporting unit in the remainder of Fiscal 2020.
Corporate Restructuring
The Company reduced approximately 10% of corporate positions during the Second Quarter 2020. The Company incurred total severance costs of approximately $2.9 million related to the reduction of corporate positions which was recorded in Other operating expense (income), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of January 29, 2021, approximately $0.2 million of the severance costs had yet to be paid. In Fiscal 2019, the Company closed five school uniform showrooms.
Basis of Presentation
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and include the accounts of Lands' End, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
Related party
Following the Separation, we began operating as a separate, publicly traded company, independent from Sears Holdings. At the time of the Separation, ESL beneficially owned significant portions of both the Company's and Sears Holdings' outstanding shares of common stock and therefore, Sears Holdings, the Company's former parent company, was considered a related party both prior to and after the Separation. On February 11, 2019, Transform Holdco acquired from Sears Holdings substantially all of the go-forward retail footprint and other assets and component businesses of Sears Holdings as a going concern. We believe that ESL holds a significant portion of the membership interests of Transform Holdco and therefore consider that entity to be a related party as well.
Seasonality
We experience seasonal fluctuations in our net revenue and operating results and historically have realized a significant portion of our net revenue and earnings for the year during our fourth fiscal quarter. We generated 37.7% and 37.9% of our net revenue in the fourth fiscal quarter of Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019 respectively. Thus, lower than expected fourth quarter net revenue could have an adverse impact on our annual operating results.
Working capital requirements typically increase during the second and third quarters of the fiscal year as inventory builds to support peak shipping/selling periods and typically decrease during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year as inventory is shipped/sold. Cash provided by operating activities is typically higher in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to reduced working capital requirements during that period.

Depreciation and amortization are not included in our cost of sales because we are a reseller of inventory and do not believe that including depreciation and amortization is meaningful. As a result, gross profit may not be comparable to other entities that include depreciation and amortization related to the sale of their product in their gross profit measure.
Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA
We recorded Net income of $10.8 million and $19.3 million for Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, respectively. In addition to our Net income determined in accordance with GAAP, for purposes of evaluating operating performance, we use an Adjusted EBITDA measurement. Adjusted EBITDA is computed as Net income appearing on the Consolidated Statements of Operations net of Income tax expense, Interest expense, Depreciation and amortization and certain significant items set forth below. We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the operating performance of our business for comparable periods and as the basis for an executive compensation metric. The methods we use to calculate our non-GAAP financial measures may differ significantly from methods other companies use to compute similar measures. As a result, any non-GAAP financial measures presented herein may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA should not be used by investors or other third parties as the sole basis for formulating investment decisions as it excludes a number of important cash and non-cash recurring items.
While Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measurement, management believes that it is an important indicator of operating performance, and useful to investors, because:
•
EBITDA excludes the effects of financings, investing activities and tax structure by eliminating the effects of interest, depreciation and income tax.
•
Other significant items, while periodically affecting our results, may vary significantly from period to period and have a disproportionate effect in a given period, which affects comparability of results. We
have adjusted our results for these items to make our results more comparable and therefore more useful to investors as the items are not representative of our ongoing operations.
▪
Corporate restructuring - Severance costs associated with the reduction in corporate positions in Fiscal 2020 and closure of five school uniform showrooms in Fiscal 2019.
▪
Goodwill and long-lived asset impairment - charges associated with the non-cash write-down of goodwill and certain long-lived assets in Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019.
▪
Gain or loss on disposal of property and equipment - management considers the gains or losses on asset valuation to result from investing decisions rather than ongoing operations in Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019.

Discussion and Analysis
Fiscal 2020 Compared to Fiscal 2019
Net revenue
Total Net revenue for Fiscal 2020 was $1.43 billion, a decrease of $22.8 million or 1.6% from Fiscal 2019. U.S. eCommerce and International saw increased demand as customers reacted positively to the continued enhancements in our seasonal product assortments and digital capabilities, along with an increase in Third Party revenues with the launch of our product with Kohl’s. However, this was more than offset by the decrease across our entire Outfitters and Retail channels due to decreased customer demand related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

U.S. eCommerce Net revenue was $961.9 million in Fiscal 2020, an increase of $51.8 million or 5.7% from $910.1 million during the same period of the prior year. The increase in U.S. eCommerce was largely attributable to an increase in online shopping as customers reacted positively to the continued enhancements in our seasonal
product assortments and digital capabilities, which drove a year over year increase in our new customers acquired and overall customer file.
International Net revenue was $222.9 million in Fiscal 2020, an increase of $41.8 million or 23.1% from $181.1 million during the same period of the prior year. The increase in International was largely attributable to an increase in online shopping as customers reacted positively to the U.S. eCommerce digital capabilities leveraged globally and the continued enhancements in our seasonal product assortments, which drove a year over year increase in new customers acquired and overall customer file.
Outfitters Net revenue was $174.3 million in Fiscal 2020, a decrease of 39.0% from $285.8 million during the same period of the prior year. Excluding the approximately $36 million net impact from the American Airlines launch, net revenue would have decreased 30.7%. The remaining decrease in Outfitters was largely attributable to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic due to the decrease in travel that impacted the national account clients, as over 50% of these sales are to travel-related companies. Additionally, reduced customer demand from our small and medium sized businesses and temporary closures of schools impacted the Outfitters product channel.
Net revenue in Third Party was $39.9 million in Fiscal 2020, an increase of $26.3 million or 192.6% from $13.7 million during the same period of the prior year. The increase was primarily attributed to the launch of Lands’ End product on Kohls.com and at 150 Kohl’s retail locations. Due to the early success with Kohl’s, the Company plans to expand to 300 Kohl’s retail locations by the end of Fiscal 2021.
Net revenue in Retail was $28.5 million in Fiscal 2020, a decrease of $31.1 million or 52.2% from $59.6 million during the same period of the prior year. Approximately $21.3 million of the decrease was attributed to the closure of all Lands’ End Shops at Sears in Fiscal 2019 and the remaining attributable to the temporary closures of our retail stores and lower traffic since reopening due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On January 29, 2021 there were 31 U.S. Company Operated stores compared to 25 U.S. Company Operated stores on January 31, 2020.
Gross Profit
In Fiscal 2020, total gross profit decreased 2.6% to $605.9 million compared with $621.9 million for Fiscal 2019. Gross margin decreased 50 basis points to 42.4% of total Net revenue in Fiscal 2020 from 42.9% of total Net revenue in Fiscal 2019 due to increased shipping costs and surcharges partially offset by improved promotional strategies and continued use of analytics.
Selling and Administrative Expenses
Selling and administrative expenses were $518.9 million, or 36.4% of total Net revenue in Fiscal 2020 compared with $544.0 million, or 37.5% of total Net revenue in Fiscal 2019. The approximately 110 basis points decrease was primarily due to strong controls to manage non-essential operating expenses and structural costs in response to the initial uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic partially offset by increases in digital marketing.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization were $37.3 million in Fiscal 2020, an increase of $6.2 million or 19.9%, compared with $31.1 million in Fiscal 2019. The increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily attributable to the depreciation associated with our Enterprise Order Management system implementation, continued investment in our digital infrastructure and an increased number of Company Operated stores.
Other Operating Expense, Net
Other operating expense, net was $8.5 million in Fiscal 2020 compared to $1.4 million in Fiscal 2019. The increase of $7.1 million was primarily related to the $3.3 million impairment charge of goodwill allocated to the
Company’s Japan eCommerce reporting unit and $2.9 million of severance costs paid as part of the restructuring of corporate positions.
Operating Income
Operating income was $41.1 million in Fiscal 2020, compared with $45.4 million in Fiscal 2019. The decrease of $4.3 million was primarily due to the reduction in gross profit, increased depreciation and certain other operating expenses, partially offset by reductions in overall selling and administrative expenses.
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $27.8 million in Fiscal 2020, compared with $26.0 million in Fiscal 2019. The increase of $1.8 million in interest expense was driven by higher interest rates associated with the Current Term Loan Facility.
Other Expense (Income)
Other expense was $0.8 million in Fiscal 2020 compared to Other income of $1.9 million in Fiscal 2019. The increase in Other expense was attributed to less interest income and the final payment to an affiliate of Transform Holdco associated with the transitioning of a sourcing office.
Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense of $1.8 million was recorded for Fiscal 2020 which resulted in an effective tax rate of 13.9%. This compared to income tax expense of $2.1 million in Fiscal 2019 which resulted in an effective tax rate of 9.7%. The Fiscal 2020 tax rate reflected a $3.1 million benefit as a result of the CARES Act. The Fiscal 2019 tax rate reflected a $3.4 million benefit related to the Company’s election to treat certain foreign entities as a U.S. Branch.
Net Income
As a result of the above factors, Net Income was $10.8 million, or $0.33 per diluted share in Fiscal 2020 compared to $19.3 million, or $0.60 per diluted share in Fiscal 2019.
Adjusted EBITDA
As a result of the above factors, Adjusted EBITDA increased 11.6% to $87.0 million in Fiscal 2020, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $77.9 million in Fiscal 2019.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary need for liquidity is to fund working capital requirements of our business, capital expenditures, debt service and for general corporate purposes. Our cash and cash equivalents and the ABL Facility serve as sources of liquidity for short-term working capital needs and general corporate purposes. The revolving ABL Facility had a balance outstanding of $25 million at January 29, 2021, other than for letters of credit. Cash generated from our net revenue and profitability, and somewhat to a lesser extent our changes in working capital, are driven by the seasonality of our business, with a significant amount of net revenue and operating cash flows generally occurring in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year. We expect that our cash on hand and cash flows from operations, along with borrowings on the ABL Facility, will be adequate to meet our capital requirements and operational needs for at least the next 12 months.
Description of Material Indebtedness
Debt Arrangements
In Fiscal 2020, the Company exercised the “accordion” feature under the ABL Facility increasing the maximum borrowings available under the facility from $175 million to $275 million, subject to a borrowing base (the “Loan Cap”). This was completed in two transactions. The first was a $25 million increase effective March 19, 2020, and the second a $75 million increase effective September 9, 2020. The latter was completed through the Second Amendment to the ABL Facility executed on August 12, 2020. The revolving ABL Facility has a letter of credit sublimit of $70.0 million and matures on November 16, 2022, subject to customary extension provisions provided for therein, and is available for working capital and other general corporate liquidity needs. The balance outstanding on January 29, 2021, was $25 million. There was no balance outstanding as of January 31, 2020. The balance of outstanding letters of credit was $27.1 million and $23.3 million on January 29, 2021, and January 31, 2020, respectively.
On September 9, 2020, the Company entered into the Current Term Loan Facility which provides a term loan facility of $275 million, the proceeds of which were used, along with borrowings of $125 million under the Company’s revolving ABL Facility, to repay all the indebtedness under the Former Term Loan Facility and pay fees and expenses in connection with the financing. Origination costs, including an Original Issue Discount (OID) of 3% and $5.0 million in debt origination fees were paid upon entering into the Current Term Loan Facility.
Maturity; Amortization and Prepayments
The Current Term Loan Facility matures on September 9, 2025 and will amortize at a rate equal to 1.25% per quarter. It is subject to mandatory prepayments in an amount equal to a percentage of the borrower’s excess cash flows in each fiscal year, ranging from 0% to 75% depending on the Company’s total leverage ratio, and with the proceeds of certain asset sales, casualty events and extraordinary receipts. The loan may not be voluntarily prepaid during the first two years of its term, without significant penalties. A prepayment premium is applicable to voluntary prepayments and certain mandatory prepayments made prior to the fourth anniversary of the closing date of the Current Term Loan Facility.
Guarantees; Security
All obligations under the Debt Facilities are unconditionally guaranteed by the Company and, subject to certain exceptions, each of its existing and future direct and indirect subsidiaries. The ABL Facility is secured by a first priority security interest in certain working capital of the borrowers and guarantors consisting primarily of accounts receivable and inventory. The Current Term Loan Facility is secured by a second priority security interest in the same collateral, with certain exceptions.
The Current Term Loan Facility is secured by a first priority security interest in certain property and assets of the borrowers and guarantors, including certain fixed assets such as real estate, stock of the subsidiaries and intellectual property, in each case, subject to certain exceptions. The ABL Facility is secured by a second priority interest in the same collateral, with certain exceptions.
The Former Term Loan Facility, which was replaced by the Current Term Loan Facility on September 9, 2020, had the same priority security interest in the same collateral, with certain exceptions.
Interest; Fees
The interest rates per annum applicable to the loans under the Current Term Loan Facility are based on a fluctuating rate of interest measured by reference to, at the borrower’s election, either (1) and adjusted LIBOR (with a minimum rate of 1%) plus 9.75% or (2) an alternative base rate (which is the greater of (i) the prime rate published in the Wall Street Journal, (ii) the federal funds rate, which shall be no lower than 0% plus ½ of 1%, and (iii) the one month LIBOR rate plus 1% per annum) plus 8.75%.
The borrowing margin under the ABL Facility is subject to adjustment based on the average daily total loans outstanding under the ABL Facility for the preceding fiscal quarter. For LIBOR loans, the interest rate is LIBOR (subject to an interest rate floor of 0.75%) plus a borrowing margin which is, where the average daily total loans outstanding for the previous quarter are (i) less than $50.0 million, 1.75%, (ii) equal to or greater than $50.0 million but less than $100.0 million, 2.00%, (iii) equal to or greater than $100.0 million but less than $200.0 million, 2.25%, and (iv) greater than $200.0 million, 3.50%. For Base Rate loans, the borrowing margin is, where the average daily total loans outstanding for the previous quarter are (i) less than $50.0 million for the previous quarter, 1.00%, (ii) equal to or greater than $50.0 million but less than $100.0 million, 1.25%, (iii) equal to or greater than $100.0 million but less than $200.0 million, 1.50%, and (iv) greater than $200.0 million, 2.75%.
The ABL Facility includes (i) commitment fees which range from 0.25% to 0.375% based upon the average daily unused commitment (aggregate commitment less loans and letters of credit outstanding) under the ABL Facility for the preceding fiscal quarter and (ii) customary letter of credit fees.
Customary agency fees are payable in respect of the Debt Facilities.
Representations and Warranties; Covenants
Subject to specified exceptions, the Debt Facilities contain various representations and warranties and restrictive covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries ability to incur indebtedness (including guarantees), grant liens, make investments, make dividends or distributions with respect to capital stock, make prepayments on other indebtedness, engage in mergers or change the nature of their business.
The Current Term Loan Facility contains certain financial covenants, including a quarterly maximum total leverage ratio test, a weekly minimum liquidity test and an annual maximum capital expenditure amount.
If excess availability under the ABL Facility falls below the greater of 10% of the Loan Cap amount or $15.0 million, the Company will be required to comply with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0 to 1.0. The ABL Facility also has a cash maintenance provision, which applies a limit of $75 million on the amount of cash and cash equivalents (subject to certain exceptions) that the Company may hold when outstanding loans under the ABL Facility are equal to or exceed $125 million.
The Debt Facilities contain certain affirmative covenants, including reporting requirements such as delivery of financial statements, certificates and notices of certain events, maintaining insurance and providing additional guarantees and collateral in certain circumstances.
As of January 29, 2021, the Company was in compliance with all covenants related to the Debt Facilities.
Events of Default
The Debt Facilities include customary events of default including non-payment of principal, interest or fees, violation of covenants, inaccuracy of representations or warranties, cross defaults related to certain other material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency events, invalidity or impairment of guarantees or security interests and material judgments and change of control.
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Operating activities generated net cash of $91.6 million and $27.3 million in Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, respectively. Our primary source of operating cash flows is the sale of merchandise goods and services to customers, while the primary use of cash in operations is the purchase of merchandise inventories.
In Fiscal 2020, net cash provided by operating activities increased $64.3 million compared to Fiscal 2019 primarily due to a reduction in accounts receivable balances related to the timing of the American Airlines launch in Fiscal 2019, higher deferred revenue and the timing of expense accruals.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $30.1 million and $38.0 million for Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, respectively. Cash used in investing activities for all periods was primarily used in investing in information technology infrastructure, Company Operated stores and property and equipment.
For Fiscal 2021, we plan to invest approximately $26 million in capital expenditures for strategic investments and infrastructure, primarily in technology and general corporate needs.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities was $103.1 million and $105.9 million for Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, respectively. The financing activities in Fiscal 2020 resulted in the Current Term Loan Facility which was approximately $100 million less than the Former Term Loan Facility. The financing activities in Fiscal 2019 consisted primarily of a $100 million voluntary prepayment of the Former Term Loan Facility.
Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements
We have no material off-balance-sheet arrangements other than the guarantees and contractual obligations that are discussed below.

Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk
In Fiscal 2020, the Company exercised the “accordion” feature under the ABL Facility increasing the maximum borrowings available under the facility from $175 million to $275 million, subject to a borrowing base. This was completed in two transactions. The first was a $25 million increase effective March 19, 2020, and the second a $75 million increase effective September 9, 2020. The latter was completed through the Second Amendment to the ABL Facility executed on August 12, 2020. The ABL Facility has a letter of credit sublimit of $70.0 million and matures on November 16, 2022, subject to customary extension provisions provided for therein. The revolving ABL Facility is available for working capital and other general corporate liquidity needs. The balance outstanding on January 29, 2021, was $25 million. There was no balance outstanding as of January 31, 2020. The balance of outstanding letters of credit was $27.1 million and $23.3 million on January 29, 2021, and January 31, 2020, respectively.
Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements
and accompanying notes. While our estimates and assumptions are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from our estimates and assumptions. Our estimation processes contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and apply judgment to make these estimates. Should actual results be different than our estimates, we could be exposed to gains or losses from differences that may be material.
For a summary of our significant accounting policies, please refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of our Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe the accounting policies discussed below represent the accounting policies we apply that are the most critical to understanding our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Inventory Valuation
Our inventories consist of merchandise purchased for resale and are recorded at the lower of cost or market. The nature of our business requires that we make a significant amount of our merchandising decisions and corresponding inventory purchase commitments with vendors several months in advance of the time in which a particular merchandise item is intended to be included in the merchandise offerings. These decisions and commitments are based upon, among other possible considerations, historical sales with identical or similar merchandise, our understanding of then-prevailing trends and influences, and an assessment of likely economic conditions and various competitive factors.
For financial reporting and tax purposes, the Company's United States inventory, primarily merchandise held for sale, is stated at last-in, first-out ("LIFO") cost, which is adjusted to the lower of cost or market. The Company accounts for its non-United States inventory on the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method. The United States inventory accounted for using the LIFO method as of percentage of the total inventory was 87% at January 29, 2021 and 90% at January 31, 2020.
The Company continually makes assessments as to whether the carrying cost of inventory exceeds its market value and, if so, by what dollar amount. Excess inventories may be disposed of through our normal course of business. Based on historical results experienced through various methods of disposition, the Company will write down the carrying value of inventories that are not expected to be sold at or above cost. The excess and obsolete reserve balances were $22.8 million and $11.0 million as of January 29, 2021, and January 31, 2020, respectively. The $11.8 million increase in the excess and obsolescence reserve is primarily due to the Company’s limited ability throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to sell through returned embroidered, hemmed or damaged product compared to prior years. For the inventory marked down to net realizable value, a one percentage point increase in our assumed recovery rates at January 29, 2021, would have had an immaterial impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Goodwill and Trade Name Impairment Assessments
Goodwill and the trade name indefinite-lived intangible asset are tested separately for impairment annually, during the fourth quarter, or are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Frequently our impairment loss calculations contain multiple uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting cash flows under different scenarios. We perform goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests on an annual basis and update these annual impairment tests mid-year if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying amount. If actual results fall short of our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material.
Goodwill impairment assessments
The Company tests goodwill for impairment using a one-step quantitative test. The quantitative test compares the reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying value. An impairment is recorded for any excess carrying value above the reporting unit's fair value, not to exceed the amount of goodwill. The Company estimates fair value of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow model, commonly referred to as the income approach. The income approach uses a reporting unit's projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that is discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions appropriate to the Company's reporting unit. The discounted cash flow model uses projections based on management's best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period using the best information available, including growth rates in revenues, costs and estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures. Other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value growth rates, weighted average cost of capital and changes in future working capital requirements.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, during First Quarter 2020 the Company tested its Outfitters and Japan eCommerce reporting units for goodwill impairment. The testing resulted in no impairment of the Outfitters reporting unit and full impairment of the $3.3 million of goodwill allocated to the Company’s Japan eCommerce reporting unit. The Company completed its Fiscal 2020 annual goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth fiscal quarter and determined that the fair value of the U.S. eCommerce and Outfitters reporting units exceeded their carrying values by 61.7% and 108.8%, respectively. In Fiscal 2019, the fair value of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values and as such, the Company did not record a goodwill impairment charge.
Goodwill impairment charges may be recognized in future periods to the extent changes in factors or circumstances occur, including deterioration in the macroeconomic environment, retail industry or in the equity markets, deterioration in our performance or our future projections, or changes in our plans for the reporting unit.
Indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessments
The Company's indefinite-lived intangible asset is the Lands' End trade name. The Company reviews the trade name for impairment on an annual basis during our fourth fiscal quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The fair value of the trade name indefinite-lived intangible asset is estimated using the relief-from-royalty valuation method. The relief from royalty method of the income approach was most appropriate for analyzing the Company's indefinite-lived asset. This method is based on the assumption that, in lieu of ownership, a firm would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of this asset class. The relief from royalty method involves two steps: (1) estimation of reasonable royalty rates for the assets and (2) the application of these royalty rates to a forecasted net revenue stream and discounting the resulting cash flows to determine a present value. The Company multiplied the selected royalty rate by the forecasted net revenue stream to calculate the cost savings (relief from royalty payment) associated with the asset. The cash flows are then discounted to present value using the selected discount rate and compared to the carrying value of the asset.
In Fiscal 2020 the Company performed the annual testing of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, the Lands’ End trade name. The fair value exceeded the carrying value by 61.2% and as such, no trade name impairment charges were recorded in Fiscal 2020. The fair value of the Lands’ End trade name exceeded its carrying value by 19.1% in Fiscal 2019 and as such, no trade name impairment charges were recorded.
See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 8, Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information about these assets and the related impairment charges.
Revenue Recognition
While revenue recognition for the Company does not involve significant judgment, it represents an important accounting policy. For sales shipped from our distribution centers, we recognize revenue and the related cost of goods sold at the time the products are expected to be received by the customers. For sales transacted at stores, revenue is recognized when the customer receives and pays for the merchandise at the register. We record an allowance for estimated returns based on our historical return patterns and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable.
We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our sales return allowance. However, if the actual rate of sales returns increases significantly, our operating results could be adversely affected. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to estimate future sales returns in the past three fiscal years.
Provision for Income taxes
We record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future income, taxable income and the mix of income or losses in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may also be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of income or losses, changes in the expected outcome of audits, or changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance.
At any point in time, many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities. To the extent our estimates of settlements change, or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. Our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. Determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and circumstances, issuance of new regulations, and resolution of tax audits. The Company performed an evaluation over its deferred tax assets and determined that a valuation allowance is considered necessary. See Note 9, Income Taxes, for further details on the valuation allowance.
We believe the judgments and estimates discussed above are reasonable. However, if actual results fall short of our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
