Our discussion includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors. We use words such as anticipate, estimate, plan, project, continuing, ongoing, expect, believe, intend, may, will, should, could, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements.

Revenues
We earned $49,438,115 in revenues during the year ended September 30, 2021, as compared with $10,028,701 in revenues for the year ended September 30, 2020.

We hope to generate more significant revenue from customers through the sale and licensing of our Software platforms and services in the future. However, we are unable to estimate with any degree of certainty the amount of future revenues, from existing or future software contracts. Also, we do not anticipate earning significant revenues from our Gasifier business until such time that we have fully developed our technology and are able to market our products.

Non-GAAP Measures
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS is not a measurement of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of equity instruments that can impact a company's non-cash operating expenses, CleanSpark management believes that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes non-cash and non-recurring expenses allows for meaningful comparisons between the Company's core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing the Company with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating its own core business operating results over different periods of time.
The Company's adjusted EBITDA measure may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in its industry, as other companies in its industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to non-recurring, unusual items. The Company's adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or as an indication of operating performance or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. Our management does not consider adjusted EBITDA to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial results.
We are providing supplemental financial measures for (i) non-GAAP adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or (“adjusted EBITDA”) that excludes the impact of interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, our share-based compensation expense, and impairment of assets, unrealized gains/losses on securities, certain financing costs, other non-cash items, certain non-recurring expenses, and impacts related to discontinued operations; and (ii) non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP earnings per share that excludes the impact of interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, our share-based compensation expense, and impairment of assets, unrealized gains/losses on securities, certain financing costs, other non-cash items, and impacts related to discontinued operations. These supplemental financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) and, as a result, these supplemental financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to help understand, manage, and evaluate our business performance and to help make operating decisions.
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are also useful to investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis. The first supplemental financial measure excludes (i) impacts of interest, taxes, and depreciation; (ii) significant non-cash expenses such as our share-based compensation expense, unrealized gains/losses on securities, certain financing costs, other non-cash items that we believe are not reflective of our general business performance, and for which the accounting requires management judgment, and the resulting expenses could vary significantly in comparison to other companies; (iii) significant impairment losses related to long-lived and digital assets, which include our bitcoin for which the accounting requires significant estimates and judgment, and the resulting expenses could vary significantly in comparison to other companies; and (iv) and impacts related to discontinued operations that would not be applicable to our future business activities.
Non-GAAP financial measures are subject to material limitations as they are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, measurements prepared in accordance with GAAP. For example, we expect that share-based compensation expense, which is excluded from the first two non-GAAP financial measures, will continue to be a significant recurring expense over the coming years and is an important part of the compensation provided to certain employees, officers, and directors.
We have also excluded impairment losses on assets, including impairments of our digital currency our non-GAAP financial measures, which may continue to occur in future periods as a result of our continued holdings of significant amounts of bitcoin. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation and should be read only in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. We rely primarily on such Consolidated Financial Statements to understand, manage, and evaluate our business performance and use the non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally.
The following is a reconciliation of our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP, which excludes the impact of (i) interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization; (ii) our share-based compensation expense; (iii) impairment expense; (iv) unrealized gains/losses on securities; (v) and (vi) impacts related to discontinued operations, to its most directly comparable GAAP measures for the periods indicated:
The following is a reconciliation of our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA earnings per share, in each case excluding the impact of (i) interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization; (ii) our share-based compensation expense; (iii) impairment expense; (iv) unrealized gains/losses on securities; (v) certain financing costs and other non-cash items; (vi) certain non-recurring expenses; and (vii) impacts related to discontinued operations:
The following is a reconciliation of fair market value of our digital currency holdings to the current carrying value at September 30, 2021. We did not hold any digital currency as of September 30, 2020:
(1) Value per coin is the average book value per coin determined by the number of coins held as of the balance sheet date divided by the carrying value.
(2) Value per coin is the quoted market price as of the balance sheet date.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
For the year ended September 30, 2021, our primary sources of liquidity came from existing cash and proceeds from share offerings. On March 18, 2021, the Company consummated a fully underwritten public offering of shares of its common stock, which resulted in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $187,200,000. On June 3, 2021, the Company entered into an At the Market Offering Agreement (the “ATM”) with H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC (“HCW”), pursuant to which it may, from time to time, offer and sell up to an aggregate of $500,000,000 of shares of its common stock to or through HCW. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, the Company issued an aggregate of 3,443,379 shares of the Company’s common stock under the ATM for net proceeds of $46.4 million. The shares were sold pursuant to a prospectus dated March 15, 2021 and a prospectus supplement dated June 3, 2021 filed with the SEC. Based on our current plans and business conditions, we believe that existing cash, cash generated from operations and our ATM will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements until we reach profitability, and we are not aware of any trends or demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to result in a decrease in liquidity of our assets. However, our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of our sales and marketing, the timing of new product introductions and the continuing market acceptance of our products and services. If cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our capital requirements, we may open a revolving line of credit with a bank, or we may have to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities. In the event such financing is needed in the future, there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us, or, if available, that it will be in amounts and on terms acceptable to us. If cash flows from operations became insufficient to continue operations at the current level, and if no additional financing was obtained, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.
As of September 30, 2021, we had total current assets of $57,726,321, consisting of cash, accounts receivable, inventory, digital currency, investments, prepaid expenses and other current assets, and total assets in the amount of $317,473,121. Our total current liabilities as of September 30, 2021 were $10,063,022. We had a working capital surplus of $47,663,299 as of September 30, 2021.
Operating activities used $35,429,342 in cash for the year ended September 30, 2021, as compared with $6,642,734 for the same period ended September 30, 2020. Our net loss of $21,812,010 was the main component of our negative operating cash flow for the year ended September 30, 2021, offset mainly by stock-based compensation of $8,546,712, impairment expense of $12,885,786 and depreciation and amortization of $12,244,368. Our net loss of $23,346,143 was the main component of our negative operating cash flow for the year ended September 30, 2020, offset mainly by amortization of debt discount of $9,010,547, depreciation and amortization of $2,672,331, shares issued as interest of $2,050,000, amortization of capitalized software of $163,918 and stock-based compensation of $2,053,232.
Cash flows used by investing activities during the year ended September 30, 2021 was $217,714,926, as compared with $2,383,623 for the year ended September 30, 2020. Our acquisitions of Solar watt Solutions for $1,000,136, purchase of fixed assets of $139,234,948, and deposits on mining equipment of $87,959,910 were the main components of our negative investing cash flow for the year ended September 30, 2021. The negative cash flow from investing activities is offset by sale of digital currencies of $11,443,132, acquisition of ATL Data Center, net of cash received of $45,783 and sale of equity securities of $373,121.
For the year ended September 30, 2020, our investment in the capitalized software of $84,924, acquisition of P2K Labs of $1,141,990, acquisition of Grid Fabric of $371,812, purchase of fixed assets of $34,897, and investment in equity and debt security of $750,000 were the main components of our negative investing cash flow.
Cash flows provided by financing activities during the year ended September 30, 2021 amounted to $268,058,393, as compared with $4,313,702 for the year ended September 30, 2020. Our positive cash flows from financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2021 consisted of $270,656,118 in proceeds from offerings, $3,750,932 in proceeds from the exercise of warrants and options offset by repayments of $5,882,553 on promissory notes and $288,602 in finance leases. Our positive cash flows from financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2020 consisted of $4,000,000 in proceeds from the sale of common stock, $531,169 in proceeds from promissory notes offset by repayments of $217,467 on promissory notes.
Contractual Obligations
The Company has purchase commitments for approximately $203.6 million related to purchase of miners as of September 30, 2021, and the Company has paid $144.7 million towards these commitments as of the end of this period.
The Company has purchase commitments for infrastructure assets and other mining equipment of approximately $6,512,000 as of September 30, 2021 and the Company has paid $4,576,000 towards these commitments during this period.
The following table sets forth certain information concerning our obligations to make contractual future payments towards our agreements as of September 30, 2021:
Contingent consideration
GridFabric: On August 31, 2020, the Company acquired GridFabric, LLC. Pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement, additional shares of the Company’s common stock valued at up to $750,000 were issuable if GridFabric achieves certain revenue and product release milestones. On September 30, 2021, the contingent consideration was re-measured to $500,000.
Subsequent to September 30, 2021, the Company settled all contingent consideration due to GridFabric resulting in the issuance of 8,404 shares of Company common stock valued at $150,000.
Solar Watt Solutions: On February 24, 2021, the Company acquired Solar Watt Solutions, Inc. Pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement, additional cash consideration of up to $2,500,000 and up to 310,018 shares of the Company’s common stock may be payable if Solar Watt Solutions achieves certain revenue milestones. As of September 30 2021, none of the contingent consideration had been earned.
Known Trends or Uncertainties
Although we have not seen any significant reduction in revenues to date, we have seen some consolidation in our industry during economic downturns. These consolidations have not had a negative effect on our total sales; however, should consolidations and downsizing in the industry continue to occur, those events could adversely impact our revenues and earnings going forward.
As discussed in the Risk Factors section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the world has been affected due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Until the pandemic has passed, there remains uncertainty as to the effect of COVID-19 on our business in both the short and long-term.
We believe that the need for improved productivity in the research and development activities directed toward developing new products and/or software will continue to result in increasing adoption of energy solution tools such as those we produce. New product and/or software developments in the energy business segment could result in increased revenues and earnings if they are accepted by our markets; however, there can be no assurances that new products and/or software will result in significant improvements to revenues or earnings. For competitive reasons, we do not disclose all of our new product development activities.
Our continued quest for acquisitions could result in a significant change to revenues and earnings if one or more such acquisitions are completed.
The potential for growth in new markets is uncertain. We will continue to explore these opportunities until such time as we either generate sales or determine that resources would be more efficiently used elsewhere.
Inflation
We have not been affected materially by inflation during the periods presented, and no material effect is expected in the near future.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as if it had originated the contracts. Under the current business combinations guidance, such assets and liabilities are recognized by the acquirer at fair value on the acquisition date. This new guidance is effective for the Company for its fiscal year beginning February 1, 2023 and interim periods within that fiscal year, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating its potential impact but does not expect the new standard to have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or cash flows.
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting and issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance (collectively, “Topic 848”). Topic 848 became effective immediately and expires on December 21, 2022. Topic 848 allows eligible contracts that are modified to be accounted for as a continuation of those contracts, permits companies to preserve their hedging accounting during the transition period and enables companies to make a one-time election to transfer or sell held-to-maturity debt securities that are affected by rate reform. Topic 848 provides optional expedients and exceptions for contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The adoption of ASU 2020-04 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements or disclosures.
The Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments on October 1, 2020 (“ASU 2016-13”). ASU 2016-13 requires entities to use a new forward-looking “expected loss” model that reflects expected credit losses, including credit losses related to trade receivables, and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates, which generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. As the Company was a Smaller Reporting Company at the time of issuance of the ASU, the Company expects to adopt the ASU effective October 1, 2023, including the interim periods within the fiscal year. In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU2020-06, “Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (subtopic 815-40),” which reduces the number of accounting models in ASC 470-20 that require separate accounting for embedded conversion features. As a result, a convertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost as long as no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. By removing those separation models, the effective interest rate of convertible debt instruments will be closer to the coupon interest rate. Further, the diluted net income per share calculation for convertible instruments will require the Company to use the if-converted method. The treasury stock method should no longer be used to calculate diluted net income per share for convertible instruments. The amendment will be effective for the Company with annual periods beginning January 1, 2022 and early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2020-06 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements or disclosures.

The Company has evaluated all other recent accounting pronouncements and believes that none of them will have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Critical Accounting Policies
In December 2001, the SEC requested that all registrants list their most critical accounting policies in the Management Discussion and Analysis. The SEC indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of a Company’s financial condition and results, and requires managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
Our accounting policies are discussed in detail in the footnotes to our financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2021 however we consider our critical accounting policies to be those related to revenue recognition, long-lived assets, accounts receivable, fair value of financial instruments, cash and cash equivalents, digital currency and stock-based compensation.
Our significant estimates include estimates used to review the Company’s goodwill and digital currency impairment, intangible assets acquired, impairments and estimations of long-lived assets, revenue recognition on percentage of completion type contracts, revenue recognition from digital currency mining, valuation of derivative assets and liabilities, available-for-sale investments, allowances for uncollectible accounts, valuation of digital currencies, valuation of contingent consideration, warranty, and the valuations of share based awards. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions including, but not limited to, the ultimate impact that COVID-19 may have on the Company’s operations.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of September 30, 2021, there were no off-balance sheet arrangements.
