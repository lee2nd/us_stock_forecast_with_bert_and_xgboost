ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) should be read in conjunction with the financial statements included herein. Further, this MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Financial Statements and Notes to Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the years ended January 31, 2021 and 2020, as well as the “Business” and “Risk Factors” sections within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company's financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis may contain various “forward looking statements” within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, regarding future events or the future financial performance of the Company that involve risks and uncertainties. Certain statements included in this Form 10-K, including, without limitation, statements related to anticipated cash flow sources and uses, and words including but not limited to “anticipates”, “believes”, “plans”, “expects”, “future” and similar statements or expressions, identify forward looking statements. Any forward-looking statements herein are subject to certain risks and uncertainties in the Company’s business and any changes in current accounting rules, all of which may be beyond the control of the Company. The Company has adopted the most conservative recognition of revenue based on the most astringent guidelines of the SEC. Management will elect additional changes to revenue recognition to comply with the most conservative SEC recognition on a forward going accrual basis as the model is replicated with other similar markets (i.e. SBDC). The Company’s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth therein. Undue reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.
Any future equity financing will cause existing shareholders to experience dilution of their interest in our Company. In the event we are not successful in raising additional financing, we anticipate that we will not be able to proceed with our business plan. In such a case, we may decide to discontinue our current business plan and seek other business opportunities in the resource sector. Any business opportunity would require our management to perform diligence on possible acquisitions.
During this period, we will need to maintain our periodic filings with the appropriate regulatory authorities and will incur legal and accounting costs. In the event no other such opportunities are available and we cannot raise additional capital to sustain operations, we may be forced to discontinue business. We do not have any specific alternative business opportunities in mind and have not planned for any such contingency.
The Company's MD&A is comprised of significant accounting estimates made in the normal course of its operations, overview of the Company's business conditions, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources and contractual obligations.
The discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (or "GAAP"). The preparation of those financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of its financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Results of Operations
Critical Accounting Policies
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to uncollectible receivables, inventory valuation, deferred compensation and contingencies.
We base our estimates on historical performance and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates allow us to make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
We believe the following accounting policies are our critical accounting policies because they are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require critical management judgments and estimates about matters that may be uncertain. If actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates, our reported financial condition and results of operations for future periods could be materially affected.
Revenue Recognition Policies
Our revenue is derived from the subscription, non-software related hosted services, term-based and perpetual licensing of software products, associated software maintenance and support plans, consulting services, training, and technical support. Most of our customer arrangements involve multiple solutions and various license rights, bundled with post-contract customer support and other meaningful rights that together provide a complete end-to-end solution to the customer.
We recognize revenue when all guidelines establish through the five-step process to govern contract revenue reporting are met. This 5 step process consists of:
1.
Identify the contract(s) with a customer
2.
Identify the performance obligations in the contract
3.
Determine the transaction price
4.
Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
5.
Recognize revenue when or as you satisfy a performance obligation (rather than on final delivery, as in the past)
Components of Revenue
Services revenue. We generate substantially all our services revenue via consulting services and software development. The transaction fee earned is based on the price and quantity of any crypto asset that is used as part of payment.
Subscription revenue. We primarily generate revenue from subscriptions is through mining and staking of our current and non-current crypto assets. We derive staking revenue from transaction validation on a proof-of-stake blockchain when one of our nodes successfully creates or validates a block. Revenues are recognized at the point when the block creation or validation is complete, and the rewards are available for transfer. Staking revenue is driven by quantity, price, and rewards rate of the staked crypto asset. Mining is the process by which new blocks are created, and thus new transactions are added to the blockchain.
Other revenue. Other revenue includes the sale of crypto assets. We record the total value of the sale as revenue and the cost of the crypto asset in operating expense. Other revenue also includes interest income earned primarily on our cash and cash equivalents. Interest income is calculated using the interest method and depends on the balance of cash and cash equivalents as well as the prevailing interest rate environment. It also includes the gain or loss of our crypto assets at fair market value, as adjusted.
