We define various terms to simplify the presentation of information in this Report. All share amounts are presented in thousands.
Factors Impacting Comparability of Our Financial Results
Our historical results of operations and cash flows are not indicative of results of operations and cash flows to be expected in the future, principally for the following reasons:
•Acquisition of Eagle Proppants Holdings. In September 2020, we acquired from Eagle Materials Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Eagle”), all of the issued and outstanding interests in Eagle Oil and Gas Proppants Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Eagle (“Eagle Proppants Holdings”). The primary assets of Eagle Proppants Holdings and its subsidiaries include two frac sand mines and related processing facilities in Utica, Illinois and New Auburn, Wisconsin, with approximately 3.5 million tons of total combined annual processing capacity, 1.6 million tons of which has access to the BNSF Class I rail line through the Peru, Illinois transload facility. We began operating the Utica, Illinois mine and Peru, Illinois transload facility in October 2020. We currently have no intention of operating the New Auburn, Wisconsin mine. The estimated aggregate fair value of the net assets acquired was $41.7 million which exceeded the total consideration and resulted in a bargain purchase gain of $39.6 million.
•Increased supply and reduced demand. At the beginning of the second quarter of 2020, demand dropped dramatically as a result of the decline in oil prices to all-time lows caused by the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic and a temporary increase in global oil supply driven by disagreements with respect to oil pricing between Russia and members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”), particularly Saudi Arabia. The COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic has caused a global decrease in all means of travel, the closure of borders between countries and a general slowing of economic activity worldwide which has decreased the demand for oil. In early March, discussions between Russia and Saudi Arabia deteriorated and the countries ended a three-year supply level agreement, which resulted in each country increasing its oil production. Subsequently, Russia and OPEC agreed to certain production cuts to mitigate the decline in the price of oil; however, such cuts may not be sufficient to stabilize the oil market over the long term if the decline in demand due to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic continues. Oil and natural gas prices are expected to continue to be volatile as a result of these events, and we cannot predict when prices will stabilize.
•Impairment loss. In 2020, we recorded an impairment loss of $5.1 million to fully write down the value of our long-lived assets in the Permian basin as we have no intentions to develop these properties in the foreseeable future. In 2019, we recorded impairment losses of $15.5 million, of which $7.6 million related to our finite-lived developed technology intangible assets and $7.9 million relates to our Hixton, Wisconsin property. In 2018, we recorded an impairment loss of $17.8 million, which related to our goodwill and indefinite-lived trade name intangible asset.

These amounts were recorded as an operating expense on the consolidated income statement. See our discussion in the section entitled “GAAP Results of Operations” for additional information regarding these transactions.
•Market Trends. From early 2017 through the second quarter of 2018, improvements in oil and natural gas prices created a more stable market environment. During the second half of 2018, the demand for Northern White sand decreased, which we believe was due primarily to insufficient takeaway capacity for the incremental oil and natural gas production coming online in the Permian Basin, along with increased availability of regional sand as a source of proppant in the Permian basin. Additionally, oil and natural gas companies reduced their spending in the latter portion of the year due to strong spending in the first half of 2018 and lower oil prices, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2018. Demand briefly recovered during the summer of 2019 before declining toward the end of 2019 as oil and gas companies exhausted their budgets and managed their capital spending to be in line with their expected operating cash flows. During the first quarter of 2020, demand again briefly increased before declining as a result of the decline in oil prices to all-time lows caused by the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic and an increase in global oil supply driven by disagreements with respect to oil pricing between Russia and members of OPEC. Supply side pressure has subdued while the effects of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic continue to drive reduced demand leading to volatility in oil prices.
Increased supply of sand coupled with lower oil demand has resulted in lower demand for our products and has led to reduced interest in long term contracts as customers are disinclined to enter into long-term contracts for their frac sand supply and have instead trended toward purchasing their frac sand supply in the spot market at market prices.
Overview
We are a fully integrated frac sand supply and services company, offering complete mine to wellsite proppant supply and logistics solutions to our customers. We produce low-cost, high quality Northern White frac sand, which is a premium proppant used to enhance hydrocarbon recovery rates in the hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells. We also offer proppant logistics solutions to our customers through our in-basin transloading terminal and our SmartSystemsTM wellsite proppant storage capabilities. We market our products and services, as one operating segment, primarily to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies and oilfield service companies, sell our sand under a combination of long-term take-or-pay contracts and spot sales in the open market, and provide wellsite proppant storage solutions services and equipment under flexible contract terms custom tailored to meet customers’ needs. We believe that, among other things, the size and favorable geologic characteristics of our sand reserves, the strategic location and logistical advantages of our facilities, our proprietary SmartDepotTM portable wellsite proppant storage silos, SmartPathTM transloader and the industry experience of our senior management team make us as a highly attractive provider of frac sand and proppant logistics services from the mine to the wellsite.
We own and operate a frac sand mine and related processing facility near Oakdale, Wisconsin, at which we have approximately 315 million tons of proven recoverable sand reserves as of December 31, 2020. We incorporated in Delaware in July 2011 and began operations with 1.1 million tons of annual nameplate processing capacity in July 2012. After several expansions, our current annual processing capacity at our Oakdale facility is approximately 5.5 million tons of frac sand. Our integrated Oakdale facility, with on-site rail infrastructure and wet and dry sand processing facilities, has access to two Class I rail lines and enables us to process and cost-effectively deliver products to our customers.
In September 2020, we acquired from Eagle all of the issued and outstanding interests in Eagle Proppants Holdings. The primary assets of Eagle Proppants Holdings and its subsidiaries include two frac sand mines and related processing facilities in Utica, Illinois and New Auburn, Wisconsin, with approximately 3.5 million tons of total combined annual processing capacity, 1.6 million tons of which has access to the BNSF Class I rail line through the Peru, Illinois transload facility. We began operating the Utica, Illinois mine and Peru, Illinois transload facility in October 2020. We currently have no intention of operating the New Auburn, Wisconsin mine for the foreseeable future.
We operate a unit train capable transloading terminal in Van Hook, North Dakota to service the Bakken Formation in the Williston Basin. We operate this terminal under a long-term agreement with Canadian Pacific Railway to service the Van Hook terminal directly along with the other key oil and natural gas exploration and production basins of North America. The Van Hook terminal became operational in April 2018. Since operations commenced, we have been providing Northern White sand in-basin at this terminal to our contracted and spot sales customers. This terminal allows us to offer more efficient delivery options to customers operating in the Bakken Formation in the Williston Basin.

We also offer to our customers portable wellsite proppant storage and management solutions through our SmartSystems products and services. Our SmartSystems provide our customers with the capability to unload, store and deliver proppant at the wellsite, as well as the ability to rapidly set up, takedown and transport the entire system. This capability creates efficiencies, flexibility, enhanced safety and reliability for customers.
Assets and Operations
Oakdale, Wisconsin
Our sand reserves in Oakdale include a balanced concentration of coarse sand, (19% 20/40 and coarser), finer sand (41% of 40/70 mesh) and fine sand (40% 60/140 gradation, which we refer to in this annual report as “100 mesh”). Our 30/50 gradation is a derivative of the 20/40 and 40/70 blends. We believe that this mix of coarse and fine sand reserves, combined with contractual demand for our products across a range of mesh sizes, provides us with relatively higher mining yields and lower processing costs than frac sand mines with predominantly coarse sand reserves. In addition, our approximate 315 million tons of proven recoverable reserves implies a reserve life of approximately 57 years based on our current annual nameplate processing capacity of 5.5 million tons. This long reserve life enables us to better serve demand for different types of frac sand as compared to mines with shorter reserve lives.
Our Oakdale facility is purpose-built to exploit the reserve profile in place and produce high-quality frac sand. Unlike some of our competitors, our primary processing and rail loading facilities are located in close proximity to the mine site, which limits the need for us to truck sand on public roads between the mine and the production facility or between wet and dry processing facilities. Our on-site transportation assets include approximately nine miles of rail track in a triple-loop configuration and four railcar loading facilities that are connected to a Class I rail line owned by Canadian Pacific. This enables us to simultaneously accommodate multiple unit trains and significantly increases our efficiency in meeting our customers’ frac sand transportation needs. Our unit train capable transload facility approximately three miles from the Oakdale facility in Byron Township, Wisconsin, provides us with the ability to ship sand to our customers on the Union Pacific rail network. We believe that we are the only sand facility in Wisconsin that has dual served rail capabilities, which should create competition among our rail carriers and allow us to provide more competitive logistics options for our customers.
Utica & Peru, Illinois
Our Utica facility also has a large high-quality reserve base of primarily fine-mesh sand that is contiguous to the production facility and in close proximity to our Peru transload facility located on the BNSF railway. We have a minimum proven and probable reserve life of approximately 81 years based on our current annual processing capacity of 1.6 million tons at our Utica facility.
This recently acquired sand mine and processing facility adds significant logistics assets that further increases our logistics advantage, including access to BNSF, a Class I rail line, through our owned Peru transload facility. Additionally, the CSX and NS rail lines and barge access on the Illinois River to access the Mississippi River are available within short trucking distances. This facility is also capable of handling multiple unit trains simultaneously. These additional logistics options give us greater access to operating basins in the Western United States allowing us to offer more competitive pricing to existing and new customers in these markets.
Logistics
Through our transloading terminal in Van Hook, North Dakota, we provide one of the most efficient and lowest-cost sources of Northern White sand in-basin to customers operating in the Bakken Formation in the Williston Basin.
Through our SmartSystems offering, we have the technology, production capacity and management team to compete further in the frac sand supply chain for our customers by offering logistics services from the mine all the way to the wellsite. Our SmartSystems consist of our SmartDepot proppant storage silos, transload technology, and rapid deployment trailer system.
We believe our patented SmartDepot silos will outperform our competitors in that they can be set up or taken down rapidly, they include industry-leading passive and active dust suppression technology, they have the capability of gravity-fed operation and they can be filled by both pneumatic and gravity dump trailers. Our trailers detach, which reduces their footprint on the wellsite. In 2020, we developed a self-contained SmartPath transloader, which is a mobile sand transloading system designed to work with bottom dump trailers and features a drive over conveyor, surge bin, and dust collection system, and we

(UNAUDITED)
believe the system has the ability to keep up with any hydraulic fracturing operation. Our rapid deployment trailers are designed for quick setup, takedown and transportation of the entire SmartSystem, and they detach from the wellsite equipment, which allows for removal from the wellsite during operation. We have also developed a proprietary software program, the SmartSystem TrackerTM, which allows our SmartSystems customers to monitor silo-specific information, including location, proppant type and proppant inventory.
Through the expansion of our SmartSystems fleet and other logistics options, we continue evaluating ways to reduce the landed cost of our products in-basin and to the wellsite for our customers while increasing our customized service offerings to provide additional delivery and pricing alternatives, including selling product on an “as-delivered” basis to the wellsite.
In 2020, we significantly expanded our existing logistics infrastructure through the acquisition of Eagle Proppants Holdings by adding new origination and destination points to our existing capabilities. We expect to continue to capitalize on our Oakdale facility’s ability to simultaneously accommodate multiple unit trains on-site with the Canadian Pacific rail network and ship on two Class I rail carriers to maximize our product shipment rates, increase our railcar utilization and lower our transportation costs. Through our transloading facility located on the Union Pacific rail network approximately three miles from our Oakdale facility, we have the ability to ship our frac sand directly to our customers on a second Class I rail carrier. Our newly acquired Peru transload terminal, located just minutes away from our Utica mine and frac sand processing facility, offers additional capability to ship products on a third Class I rail carrier, the BNSF. Additionally, the CSX and NS rail line and barge access on the Illinois River to access the Mississippi River are available within short trucking distances.
How We Generate Revenue
We generate revenue by excavating and processing frac sand, which we sell to our customers under long-term price agreements or as spot sales at prevailing market rates. In some instances, revenues also include a charge for transportation services provided to customers. Our transportation revenue fluctuates based on a number of factors, including the volume of product transported and the distance between the plant and our customers. Our contracts contain a minimum volume purchase requirement and provide for delivery of frac sand from one of our processing facilities, our Van Hook transloading terminal in the Bakken, or another location specified by our customers. Revenue is generally recognized as products are delivered in accordance with the contract.
We generate revenue on our SmartSystems by renting equipment to our customers under contract terms tailored to meet the short-term or long-term needs with any number of SmartDepots, SmartPaths or trailers they require. We recognize rental revenue when the equipment is made available for the customer to use or other obligations in the contract are met.
Costs of Conducting Our Business
The principal direct costs involved in operating our business are freight charges, which consist of transportation, railcar rental and storage, labor, maintenance, utility costs, equipment, excavation and depreciation of our property, plant and equipment. We incur labor costs associated with employees at our processing facility which represent the most significant cost of converting frac sand to finished product. Our sand processing and logistics facilities undergo maintenance to minimize unscheduled downtime and ensure the ongoing quality of our frac sand and ability to meet customer demands. We incur utility costs in connection with the operation of our processing and logistics facilities, primarily electricity and natural gas, which are both susceptible to market fluctuations. We lease equipment in many areas of our operations including our mining and hauling equipment and logistics services. Excavation costs relate to the blasting and excavation of sand and other materials in order to retrieve desirable sand products from which we derive revenue. In addition, other costs including processing costs, overhead allocation, depreciation and depletion are capitalized as a component of inventory and are reflected in cost of goods sold when inventory is sold.
Overall Trends and Outlook
Demand Trends
According to Spears, the North American proppant market, including frac sand, ceramic and resin-coated proppant, was approximately 46 million tons in 2020, which is approximately 50% decrease from the 94 million tons Spears reported for 2019. Spears estimates that 2021 demand will be flat with 2020 estimated demand.
Supply Trends
SMART SAND, INC.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
(UNAUDITED)
There has been consolidation activity including mergers, acquisitions, closures of mines and bankruptcy filings among our peers. Additional consolidation activity is expected in 2021 in the mining, transloading and logistics businesses. Many large oil and natural gas exploration and production companies have continued to integrate vertically by sourcing their own proppant and some own their own sand mines.
Supplies of high-quality Northern White frac sand are limited to select areas, predominantly in western Wisconsin and limited areas of Minnesota and Illinois. We believe the ability to obtain large contiguous reserves in these areas is a key constraint and can be an important supply consideration when assessing the economic viability of a potential frac sand facility. Further constraining the supply and throughput of Northern White frac sand is that not all of the large reserve mines have on-site excavation, processing or logistics capabilities. Historically, much of the capital investment in Northern White frac sand mines was used for the development of coarser deposits in western Wisconsin, which is inconsistent with the increasing demand for finer mesh frac sand in recent years. As such, we’ve seen competitors in the Northern White frac sand market reduce their capacity by shuttering or idling operations as the shift to finer sands in hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells erodes the ongoing economic viability of producing coarser grades of sand.
Management’s Outlook
We expect the demand for frac sand in 2021 to be flat or slightly increase from 2020 levels. Demand for both frac sand and our SmartSystems is influenced by the volume of oil and natural gas well drilling and completion activity, as well as the types of wells that are completed. Demand in 2020 was significantly impacted by oil oversupply by OPEC and reduced demand driven by COVID-19. The industry trends continue towards drilling and completing wells with longer laterals and more frac stages per lateral foot drilled. This trend is leading to higher volumes of sand per well and the need for oil and natural gas exploration companies to manage larger volumes of sand at the wellsite. We believe these trends support continued demand for frac sand and increased demand for SmartSystems as customers look to create synergies in the time and cost of managing their sand needs at the wellsite.
We generally expect the price of raw frac sand to fluctuate based on the level of drilling and completions activity for oil and natural gas as well as overall supply for frac sand relative to demand. In recent years, an increasing supply of sand has kept the price depressed. We believe the supply of sand to be stabilizing or contracting as consolidation in the industry continues. The willingness of exploration and production companies to engage in new drilling is determined by a number of factors, the most important of which are the prevailing and projected prices of oil and natural gas, the cost to drill, complete and operate a well, the availability and cost of capital and environmental and government regulations, as well as their ability to acquire the sand at the wellsite. We generally expect the level of drilling to correlate with long-term trends in commodity prices. Similarly, oil and natural gas production levels nationally and regionally generally tend to correlate with drilling activity.

GAAP Results of Operations
Year Ended December 31, 2020 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019:
Revenue
Revenue was $122.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, during which we sold approximately 1,886,000 tons of sand. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $233.1 million, during which we sold approximately 2,462,000 tons of sand. The key factors contributing to the decrease in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 were as follows:
•Sand sales revenue decreased from $109.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $70.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of lower total volumes sold. The volumes sold in 2020 were negatively impacted by depressed oil prices driven by continued oversupply relative to the decreased demand due to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.
•We had $23.3 million of contractual shortfall revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $49.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, respectively. Our contracts with customers dictate whether shortfall is earned quarterly or at the end of their respective contract year. We recognize revenue to the extent of the unfulfilled minimum contracted quantity at the shortfall price per ton as stated in the contract. In 2020 and 2019, shortfall

revenue of $14.0 million and $24.8 million, respectively, was from a customer with which we have pending litigation.
•Logistics revenue, which includes freight for certain mine gate sand sales, railcar usage, logistics services and SmartSystems rentals, was $28.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $46.0 million when compared to logistics revenue of $74.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in logistics revenue was due primarily to lower in basin sales due to the drop in demand caused by the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.
Cost of Goods Sold
Cost of goods sold was $104.2 million and $152.0 million, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Cost of goods sold decreased primarily due to expense reduction efforts put in place and due to lower production costs and freight expense from lower sales volumes due to lower demand caused by the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.
Gross Profit
Gross profit was $18.1 million and $81.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The decrease in gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to lower total sales volumes and reduced shortfall revenue.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses were $31.1 million and $37.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Salaries, benefits and payroll taxes were reduced to $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, respectively, as we reduced headcount and suspended certain variable cash compensation programs for all employees. Depreciation and amortization decreased from $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of reduced amortization of certain intangible assets that were previously impaired in 2019. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased from $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of increased professional fees related to ongoing litigation, acquisition costs related to our purchase of Eagle Proppants Holdings in the amount of $0.9 million and settlement of a multi-year sales tax audit in the amount of $1.3 million.
Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 included an impairment charge of $5.1 million related to the full impairment of long-lived assets in the Permian basin as we have no intentions to develop these properties in the foreseeable future. Operating expenses for year ended December 31, 2019 include an impairment charge of $7.6 million related to the Quickload system that we acquired in connection with our acquisition of Quickthree in 2018 and $7.9 million related to our Hixton, Wisconsin property in property, plant and equipment, net on the balance sheet. We had no plans to actively market the Quickload system, which resulted in the impairment charge. All developed technology intangible assets related to the Quickload system have been impaired of as of December 31, 2019.
Gain on Bargain Purchase
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a gain on bargain purchase of $39.6 million related to our acquisition of Eagle Proppants Holdings. The gain was a result of the total fair value of net assets acquired in the transaction of $41.7 million, which exceeded the total consideration of $2.1 million paid to Eagle for such assets.
Interest Expense
We incurred $2.1 million and $3.6 million of net interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in net interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to reduced interest rates on lower average total debt outstanding.
In 2019, we also recognized $0.6 million of costs due to the extinguishment of the Former Credit Facility. Our borrowings and total debt were reduced late in 2019 as a result of the payment in full and termination of the Former Credit Facility and our entry into the ABL Credit Facility.

Income Tax (Benefit) Expense
Income tax benefit was $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to income tax expense of $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our effective tax rate was approximately (52.0)% and 19.8%, respectively, based on the annual effective tax rate net of discrete federal and state taxes. The computation of the effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 included modifications from the statutory rate such as income tax credits, depletion deductions, carrybacks as a result of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, and state apportionment changes, among other items. The bargain purchase gain related to our acquisition of Eagle Proppants Holdings that we recorded during the third quarter of 2020 is not taxable.
Net Income
Net income was $38.0 million for year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in net income was primarily due to the gain on bargain purchase related to our acquisition of Eagle Proppants Holdings, current year income tax benefit and the impairment of intangible assets in the prior period, offset by the lower tons sold during 2020 driven largely by the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.
Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018:

Revenue
Revenue was $233.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, during which we sold approximately 2,462,000 tons of sand. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $212.5 million, during which we sold approximately 2,995,000 tons of sand. Revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 as a result of higher sales volumes and higher average selling prices.
The key factors contributing to the increase in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 were as follows:
•We had $49.3 million in contractual shortfall revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, respectively. Our contracts with customers dictate whether shortfall is earned quarterly or at the end of their respective contract year. We recognize revenue to the extent of the unfulfilled minimum contracted quantity at the shortfall price per ton as stated in the contract. In 2019, shortfall revenue of $24.8 million was from a customer with which we have pending litigation.
•Logistics revenue, which includes freight for certain mine gate sand sales, railcar usage, logistics services and SmartSystems rentals, was $74.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $11.3 million when compared to logistics revenue of $62.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in logistics revenue was due to higher in-basin sales and rentals of our SmartSystems equipment. At December 31, 2019, we had four fleets of SmartSystems in the field.
•Sand sales revenue decreased to $109.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $143.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to decreased sales volumes.
Cost of Goods Sold
Cost of goods sold was $152.0 million and $143.1 million, or $61.75 and $47.78 per ton sold, for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Cost of goods sold increased in December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018 primarily due to higher transportation costs as a result of increased in-basin sales volumes and increased depreciation and amortization due to our Oakdale expansion project being operational for the full year, partially offset by decreases in labor and equipment costs on lower total volumes sold.
Gross Profit
Gross profit was $81.1 million and $69.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to higher shortfall and logistics revenue, partially offset by increased transportation costs as a result of increased in-basin sales volumes and lower total sales volumes.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses were $37.6 million and $41.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Operating expenses are primarily comprised of wages and benefits, professional services fees and other administrative expenses, all of which were relatively consistent year over year. Salaries, benefits and payroll taxes were $11.6 million and $11.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of wellsite storage solution acquisition-related costs in the prior year. We recorded a decrease in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration related to our acquisition of Quickthree, which resulted in an offset to operating expenses in the amount of $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. In 2019, we recorded an impairment charge of $15.5 million of which $7.6 million related to our finite-lived developed technology intangible assets in intangible assets, net on the balance sheet and $7.9 million related to our Hixton, Wisconsin property in property, plant and equipment, net on the balance sheet. The impairment of the finite-lived intangible assets is from our developed technology allocated to the Quickload acquired in connection with the acquisition of Quickthree in 2018. We have developed and tested a new transload technology and no longer plan to actively market the Quickload and as such, all developed technology intangible assets related to the Quickload were fully impaired during the third quarter of 2019. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we determined that the carrying amount of the Hixton, Wisconsin property may not be fully

recoverable as we have no current plans to further develop the site. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we recorded an impairment charge of $17.8 million related to goodwill and an other indefinite-lived intangible asset. The impairment charge was primarily due to the decline in our stock price in 2018 and the relationship between the resulting market capitalization and the equity recorded on our balance sheet.
Other Income (Expense)
We incurred $3.6 million and $2.3 million of net interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in net interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to higher average borrowings under the Former Credit Facility to fund acquisition activities in 2018. In 2019, we also recognized $0.6 million of costs due to the extinguishment of the Former Credit Facility. Our borrowings and total debt were reduced late in 2019 as a result of the payment in full and termination of the Former Credit Facility and our entry into the ABL Credit Facility.
Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense was $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to a benefit of $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, our effective tax rate was approximately 19.8% and 21.5%, respectively, based on the statutory federal rate net of discrete federal and state taxes. The computation of the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 included modifications for income tax credits, among other items.
For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a net operating loss for tax purposes due to the significant amount of capital expenditures we incurred, which were eligible for 100% expensing available under the Tax Reform Act. There are additional provisions in the Tax Reform Act that could impact us that will continue to be monitored as additional guidance is released and any necessary adjustments will be recorded in the period that the guidance is released.
Net Income
Net income was $31.6 million for year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $20.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in net income was primarily due to higher shortfall revenue from customers that did not take their contractual minimum volumes of sand, higher logistics revenue from increased volumes shipped through our Van Hook terminal and rented SmartSystems equipment and lower impairment charges in 2019 compared to 2018.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, contribution margin and free cash flow are not financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures will provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. Net income is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, gross profit is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to contribution margin and net cash provided by operating activities is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to free cash flow. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures has important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. You should not consider EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, contribution margin or free cash flow in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, contribution margin and free cash flow may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
We define EBITDA as net income, plus: (i) depreciation, depletion and amortization expense; (ii) income tax expense (benefit); (iii) interest expense; and (iv) franchise taxes. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, plus: (i) gain or loss on sale of fixed assets or discontinued operations; (ii) integration and transition costs associated with specified transactions; (iii) equity compensation; (iv) acquisition and development costs; (v) non-recurring cash charges related to restructuring, retention and other similar actions; (vi) earn-out, contingent consideration obligations and other acquisition and development costs; and (vii)

non-cash charges and unusual or non-recurring charges. Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors and commercial banks, to assess:
•the financial performance of our assets without regard to the impact of financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis of our assets;
•the viability of capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities;
•our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures;
•our operating performance as compared to those of other companies in our industry without regard to the impact of financing methods or capital structure; and
•our debt covenant compliance, as Adjusted EBITDA is a key component of critical covenants to the ABL Credit Facility.
We believe that our presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA will provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. Net income is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered alternatives to net income presented in accordance with GAAP. Because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility. The following table presents a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net income for each of the periods indicated.
(1) Represents the non-cash expenses for stock-based awards issued to our employees and employee stock purchase plan compensation expense.
(2) Represents costs incurred related to the business combinations and current development project activities. The year ended December 31, 2020 includes $891 of costs related to the acquisition of Eagle Proppants Holdings and $1,410 decrease in the estimated fair value of our contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Quickthree. The year ended December 31, 2019 includes $3,272 decrease in the estimated fair value of our contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Quickthree and $225 of development project activities. The year ended December 31, 2018 includes $1,858 decrease in the estimated fair value of our contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Quickthree, partially offset by $1,146 of costs related to the acquisition of Quickthree and $494 related to development project activities.
(3) The year ended December 31, 2020 represents a $5,115 full impairment of long-lived assets in the Permian basin. The year ended December 31, 2019 includes an impairment charge of $7,628 related to the Quickload system and $7,914 related to our Hixton Wisconsin property. The year ended December 31, 2018 represents a $17,835 impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets.

Adjusted EBITDA was $20.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $87.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the prior year, was primarily due to lower total volumes sold and decreased shortfall revenue in the current period.
Adjusted EBITDA was $87.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $67.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the prior year, was primarily due to higher shortfall and logistics revenue, partially offset by increased transportation charges and lower overall volumes of sand sold.
Contribution Margin
We also use contribution margin, which we define as total revenues less costs of goods sold excluding depreciation, depletion and accretion of asset retirement obligations, to measure our financial and operating performance. Contribution margin excludes other operating expenses and income, including costs not directly associated with the operations of our business such as accounting, human resources, information technology, legal, sales and other administrative activities.
Gross profit is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to contribution margin. Contribution margin should not be considered an alternative to gross profit presented in accordance with GAAP. Because contribution margin may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of contribution margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility. The following table presents a reconciliation of contribution margin to gross profit.
Contribution margin was $39.1 million, or $20.75 per ton sold, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $106.5 million, or $43.24 per ton sold, for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in overall contribution margin and contribution margin per ton sold for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the prior year, was primarily due to lower volumes sold during the period and decreased shortfall revenue.
Contribution margin was $106.5 million, or $43.24 per ton sold, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $85.7 million, or $28.60 per ton sold, for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in contribution margin and contribution margin per ton sold for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the prior year, was primarily due to higher in-basin sales volumes through our Van Hook terminal and higher shortfall revenue.
Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment, is used as a supplemental financial measure by our management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors and commercial banks, to measure the liquidity of our business.
Net cash provided by operating activities is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to free cash flows. Free cash flows should not be considered an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities presented in accordance with GAAP. Because free cash flows may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of free cash flows may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility. The following table presents a reconciliation of free cash flows to net cash provided by operating activities.
Free cash flow was $16.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $19.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in free cash flow was attributable to lower total volumes sold as a result of the decreased demand due to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. This decrease was offset by our reduction in our 2020 capital expenditure budget to align with slowdown of well completion activities by the exploration and production companies and oilfield service companies during 2020.
Free cash flow was $19.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to negative free cash flow of $45.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we invested substantial capital expenditures to acquire the Van Hook terminal as well as a complete the expansion of our Oakdale facility.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow generated from operations and availability under our ABL Credit Facility and other equipment financing sources. As of December 31, 2020, cash on hand was $11.7 million and we had $9.5 million in undrawn availability on our ABL Credit Facility and $5.0 million in undrawn availability on the Acquisition Liquidity Support Facility.
As a result of the decline in the price of frac sand and instability in the market, we took steps to mitigate near term liquidity issues in 2020, including a reduction to our budgeted capital expenditures and cost cutting measures, including headcount reductions at our Oakdale and Saskatoon operating facilities and suspension of certain variable cash compensation programs.
Based on our balance sheet, cash flows, current market conditions, including the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, and information available to us at this time, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity and other available capital resources, to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months, including continued investment in our SmartSystems wellsite proppant storage solutions and other capital projects.
Working Capital
Working capital is a measure of our ability to pay our liabilities as they become due. The following table presents the components of our working capital as of December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019.
Our working capital was $74.8 million at December 31, 2020 compared to working capital of $52.2 million at December 31, 2019. The increase in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to cash collections and reductions in spending as certain vendor and lease contracts were modified. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, $54.6 million and $37.4 million, respectively, of accounts receivable is attributable to a customer with which we have pending litigation.
Summary Cash Flows
The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated:
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities was $25.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which included income of $38.0 million, partially offset by non-cash items of $10.8 million, and $1.6 million in changes in operating assets and liabilities.
SMART SAND, INC.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
(UNAUDITED)
Net cash provided by operating activities was $44.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which included net income of $31.6 million and net non-cash expenses of $47.8 million, partially offset by $34.8 million in changes in operating assets and liabilities.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $50.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which included net income of $20.1 million and net non-cash expenses of $39.9 million, partially offset by $9.1 million in changes in operating assets and liabilities.
Net Cash Used In Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was primarily for manufacturing of our SmartSystems.
Net cash used in investing activities was $25.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, of which $12.8 million was used to expand our SmartSystems operations and $12.7 million was used to expand our Van Hook terminal and capital improvements at our Oakdale facility.
Net cash used in investing activities was $126.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, of which approximately $45.5 million was used for our acquisitions of the Van Hook terminal and Quickthree, and the remainder of which was used for the completion of the Oakdale expansion project which began in 2017.
Net Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities
Net cash used in by financing activities was $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which consisted primarily of $2.5 million of net repayments on our ABL Credit Facility, $4.0 million of net repayments for notes payable and finance leases, $1.2 million of share repurchases, and paid $0.3 million of payments of contingent consideration related to the manufacture of our SmartSystems equipment.
Net cash used in by financing activities was $18.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. In 2019, we repaid a net $42.0 million on our revolving credit facilities, paid $2.3 million of deferred financing and debt issuance costs and paid $2.0 million of contingent consideration, partially offset by receipt of $23.0 million in proceeds from the Oakdale Equipment Financing and $5.4 million of net proceeds from other notes payable.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $41.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which was primarily related to net draws on our Former Credit Facility of $44.5 million, partially offset by repurchases of our common shares of $2.2 million and repayments of notes payable of $0.6 million.
Indebtedness
The follow summarizes the maturity of our material debt facilities:
Oakdale Equipment Financing
On December 13, 2019, we entered into an equipment financing arrangement with Nexseer, secured by substantially all of the assets at our Oakdale facility. We received $23.0 million of net proceeds, of which we used $19.3 million to repay in

full and terminate our Former Credit Facility, $3.0 million for general working capital purposes and $0.7 million to pay transaction fees associated with the debt refinancing. The Oakdale Equipment Financing amortizes over 5 years and bears interest at 5.79%. A majority of the Oakdale Equipment Financing will mature on December 13, 2024 and the remaining portion will mature on March 31, 2025 due to financial relief provided as a result of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic in 2020.
ABL Credit Facility
On December 13, 2019, we entered into a $20.0 million five-year senior secured asset-based credit facility with Jefferies Finance LLC. The available borrowing amount under the ABL Credit Facility is based upon our eligible accounts receivable and inventory. The ABL Credit Facility contains various reporting requirements, negative covenants and restrictive provisions and requires maintenance of specified financial covenants under certain conditions, including a fixed charge coverage ratio, as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the ABL Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2020, there were no amounts outstanding under the ABL Credit Facility, $0.7 million letters of credit and $9.5 million was available to be drawn. We use this facility primarily as a source for working capital needs. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 3.31%.
Notes Payable
We have entered into various financing arrangements secured primarily by our manufactured SmartSystems equipment. Title to the equipment is held by the financial institutions as collateral, though the equipment is included in the Company’s property plant and equipment. In June 2020, we executed a note payable to defer certain near-term minimum royalty payments. All notes payable bear interest at rates between 4.00% and 7.49%.
Acquisition Liquidity Support Facility
In connection our acquisition of Eagle Proppants Holdings, the Company, as borrower, also entered into a Loan Agreement with Eagle, as lender, secured by certain property rights and assets of the acquired business, whereby the Company may draw loans in an aggregate amount up to $5.0 million during the twelve month period ending September 18, 2021. Beginning with the calendar quarter ending December 31, 2021, any amounts outstanding will amortize over the following three years. The facility bears interest at 6.00% during the draw period and 8.00% during the repayment period. There were no borrowings outstanding on this facility as of December 31, 2020.
Capital Requirements
We expect full year 2021 capital expenditures to be between $10 million and $15 million, which are anticipated to primarily support incremental growth in our SmartSystems and to maintain our mining facilities. These expenditures exclude any potential acquisitions. We expect to fund these capital expenditures with cash from operations, equipment financing options available to us or borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility.
Share Repurchases
We are not currently authorized to repurchase additional shares. The previously authorized program terminated on September 11, 2020. The following table presents specified information about the Company’s repurchases of ordinary shares for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We had $10.0 million and $7.9 million of outstanding performance bonds as of each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These performance bonds assure our performance under our reclamation plan, maintenance and restoration of public roadways.
Contractual Obligations
The following table presents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020:
Environmental Matters
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing, among other things, hazardous materials, air and water emissions, environmental contamination and reclamation and the protection of the environment and natural resources. We have made, and expect to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures.
Seasonality
Our business is affected to some extent by seasonal fluctuations in weather that impact the production levels for a portion of our wet sand processing capacity. While our dry plants are able to process finished product volumes evenly throughout the year, our excavation and our wet sand processing activities have historically been limited to primarily non-winter months. As a consequence, we have experienced lower cash operating costs in the first and fourth quarter of each calendar year, and higher cash operating costs in the second and third quarter of each calendar year when we overproduced to meet demand in the winter months. These higher cash operating costs were capitalized into inventory and expensed when these tons are sold, which can lead to us having higher overall cost of production in the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year as we expense inventory costs that were previously capitalized. We have indoor wet processing facilities at each of our plant locations which allow us to produce wet sand inventory year-round to support a portion of our dry sand processing capacity, which may reduce certain of the effects of this seasonality. We may also sell frac sand for use in oil and natural gas producing basins where severe weather conditions may curtail drilling activities and, as a result, our sales volumes to those areas may be reduced during such severe weather periods.
Customer Concentration
For the year ended December 31, 2020, Rice Energy (a subsidiary of EQT Corporation), Liberty, and U.S. Well Services accounted for 28.1%, 21.7%, and 14.0%, respectively, of total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2019, Liberty, Rice Energy (a subsidiary of EQT Corporation), Hess Corporation, and U.S. Well Services accounted for 23.8%, 19.0%, 15.5%, and 14.7%, respectively, of total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2018, Liberty, EQT, WPX Energy, and Hess accounted for 22.8%, 21.4%, 11.6%, and 10.6%, respectively, of total revenue.
SMART SAND, INC.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
(UNAUDITED)
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Our actual results may materially differ from these estimates.
Listed below are the accounting policies we believe are critical to our financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved, and that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operations.
Revenue Recognition
Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, the amount of which reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Generally, sales are made at the origination point at our facility, and title passes as the product is loaded into railcars hired by the customer or provided by us. Deliveries of in-basin sand have shipping terms of FCA, DAT or DAP; and we recognize this revenue when the sand is delivered to the destination.
We derive our revenue by mining and processing sand that our customers purchase for various uses. Our revenues are primarily a function of the price per ton realized and the volumes sold. In some instances, our revenues also include transportation costs we charge to our customers, a monthly charge to reserve sand capacity and shortfall payments due from customers for minimum volume commitments. Our transportation revenue fluctuates based on a number of factors, including the volume of product we transport and the distance between our plant and our customers. Our reservation and shortfall revenue fluctuates based on individual contract terms.
We sell sand through short-term price agreements, at prevailing market rates, and long-term take-or-pay contracts. The expiration dates of these contracts range from 2021 through 2023. These agreements define, among other commitments, the volume of product that our customers must purchase, the volume of product that we must provide and the price that we will charge and that our customers will pay for each ton of contracted product.
SmartSystems revenues consist primarily of the rental of our patented SmartSystems equipment to customers, which is typically earned under fixed monthly fees, services related to delivery, proppant management and maintenance on the equipment. Revenues are recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied under the terms of the customer contract.
Accounts and Unbilled Receivables
Accounts receivable represents customer transactions that have been invoiced as of the balance sheet date; unbilled receivables represent customer transactions that have not yet been invoiced as of the balance sheet date. Accounts receivable are due within 30 days, or in accordance with terms agreed upon with customers, and are stated at amounts due from customers net of any allowance for doubtful accounts. We consider accounts outstanding longer than the payment terms past due. We determine the allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due, previous loss history, the customer’s current ability to pay its obligation, and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. Accounts receivable are written off when they are deemed uncollectible, and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to bad debt expense. We have not had material allowances or bad debt expense
Asset Retirement Obligation
We estimate the future cost of dismantling, restoring and reclaiming operating excavation sites and related facilities in accordance with federal, state and local regulatory requirements and recognize reclamation obligations when extraction occurs and record them as liabilities at estimated fair value. In addition, a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related
SMART SAND, INC.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
(UNAUDITED)
asset is recorded and depreciated over such asset’s useful life or the estimated number of years of extraction. The reclamation liability is accreted to expense over the estimated productive life of the related asset and is subject to adjustments to reflect changes in value resulting from the passage of time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation costs. Changes in estimates at inactive mines or mining areas are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised. If the asset retirement obligation is settled for more or less than the carrying amount of the liability, a loss or gain will be recognized, respectively.
Inventory Valuation
Sand inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the average cost method. Costs applied to inventory include direct excavation costs, processing costs, overhead allocation, depreciation and depletion. Stockpile tonnages are calculated by measuring the number of tons added and removed from the stockpile. Tonnages are verified periodically by a survey. Costs are calculated on a per ton basis and are applied to the stockpiles based on the number of tons in the stockpile.
Spare parts inventory includes critical spare parts. We account for spare parts on a first-in first-out basis, and value the inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
Leases
On January 1, 2019 we adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), and related amendments, which replaced the existing guidance in ASC 840, Leases. ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets as lease liabilities with corresponding right-of-use assets. The lease standard does not substantially change lessor accounting.
Estimates used in the calculation of our operating lease liabilities include the incremental borrowing rate and lease options reasonably certain to be exercised. We determine our incremental borrowing rate based on an average of our actual collateralized borrowing rates offered by our lenders. We considered the nature of the assets and the life of the leases and determined that there is no significant difference in the incremental borrowing rate among differing classes of assets. There are no significant options that are reasonably certain to be exercised, residual value guarantees or restrictions or covenants in our lease contracts and, therefore, no such terms have been included in our accounting for the leases.
Depletion
We amortize the cost to acquire land and mineral rights using a units-of-production method, based on the total estimated reserves and tonnage extracted each period.
Impairment of Assets
In applying the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, amounts assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities acquired were based on estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition, with the remainder recorded as goodwill. Intangible assets are initially valued at fair value using generally accepted valuation methods appropriate for the type of intangible asset. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment if indicators of impairment arise. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 we did not have goodwill or other indefinite lived intangibles assets on our balance sheet.
We periodically evaluate whether current events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our long-lived assets may not be recoverable. If circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, we estimate future undiscounted net cash flows, estimated future sales prices (considering historical and current prices, price trends and related factors) and anticipated operating costs and capital expenditures. If the carrying value of our long-lived assets is less than the undiscounted cash flows, the assets are measured at fair value and an impairment is recorded if that fair value is less than the carrying value.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded an impairment charge of $5.1 million related to the full impairment of long-lived assets in the Permian basin as we have no intentions to develop these properties in the foreseeable future. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded impairment loss of $15.5 million, of which $7.6 million relates to our finite-lived developed technology intangible assets and $7.9 million relates to our Hixton, Wisconsin property. The impairment of the finite-lived intangible assets is from our developed technology allocated to the Quickload acquired in connection with the acquisition of Quickthree in 2018.
SMART SAND, INC.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
(UNAUDITED)
We recorded an impairment charge of $17.8 million related to goodwill and an other indefinite-lived intangible asset for the year ended December 31, 2018, all of which was driven by the decline in our stock price in 2018 and the relationship between the resulting market capitalization and the equity recorded on our balance sheet.
Income Taxes
Under the balance sheet approach to provide for income taxes, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of net operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible. If we determine it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize the benefits of the deductible temporary differences, we would record a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset.
We recognize the impact of uncertain tax positions at the largest amount that, in our judgment, is more-likely-than-not to be required to be recognized upon examination by a taxing authority.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation expense is recorded based upon the fair value of the award at grant date. Such costs are recognized as expense over the corresponding requisite service period. We use the actual public market price of our shares or an adjusted price using a Monte Carlo simulation for awards subject to the Company’s performance as compared to a defined peer group as the grant date fair value for restricted stock awards.
The following is a summary of the restricted stock awards granted and the related grant date fair value in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Emerging Growth Company
We qualify as an “emerging growth company” pursuant to the provisions of the JOBS Act, enacted on April 5, 2012. Section 102 of the JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. However, we are choosing to “opt out” of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Our election to “opt-out” of the extended transition period is irrevocable.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In October 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-10, Codification Improvements, which updates various codification topics by clarifying or improving disclosure requirements to align with the SEC’s regulations. We will adopt ASU 2020-10 as of the reporting period beginning January 1, 2021. The adoption of this update is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, which intends to simplify the guidance by removing certain exceptions to the general principles and clarifying or amending existing guidance. ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Although we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2019-12, we do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), which modifies how companies recognize expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by an entity at each reporting date. Existing GAAP requires an “incurred loss” methodology whereby companies are prohibited from

recording an expected loss until it is probable that the loss has been incurred. ASU 2016-13 requires companies to use a methodology that reflects current expected credit losses (“CECL”) and requires consideration of a broad range of reasonable and supportable information to record and report credit loss estimates, even when the CECL is remote. Companies will be required to record the allowance for credit losses and deduct that amount from the basis of the asset and a related expense will be recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses on the income statement, similar to bad debt expense under existing GAAP. There is much latitude given to entities in determining the methodology for calculating the CECL. The guidance is effective for our Company for financial statement periods beginning after December 15, 2022, although early adoption is permitted. While we are still in the process of evaluating the effects of ASU 2016-13 and its related updates on the consolidated financial statements, at the time of adoption, we believe the primary effect will be any applicable allowance recorded against our accounts and unbilled receivables on our balance sheet and related expense on our income statement at that time. We cannot determine the financial impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption as our accounts and unbilled receivables balances are affected by ongoing transactions with customers.
