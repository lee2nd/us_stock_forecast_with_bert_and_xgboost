Overview
We are a biotechnology company developing regenerative tissue products and biomaterials. Our first regenerative tissue product is SkinTE, which is intended for the repair, reconstruction, replacement, and supplementation of skin in patients who have a need for treatment of acute or chronic wounds, burns, surgical reconstruction events, scar revision, or removal of dysfunctional skin grafts. Given our significant real-world experience with the application of SkinTE and several supporting publications, we believe SkinTE can be successful in closing full-thickness complex wounds, such as DFUs penetrating to tendon, capsule, and bone classified Wagner Grades 2 through 4; Stage 3 and 4 pressure injuries; and, acute wounds. We believe that SkinTE could significantly improve clinical outcomes versus the standards of care for these wounds.
Since the beginning of 2017, we have incurred substantial operating losses and our operations have been financed primarily by public equity financings. Our plan is to file an IND for SkinTE in the second half of 2021 and commence clinical trials under our BLA by the first quarter of 2022, but this timing will depend on when we obtain FDA approval of our IND. The clinical trials and regulatory process will likely result in an increase in our expenses. We will continue to incur substantial operating losses as we pursue an IND and BLA, and we expect to seek financing from external sources over the next several years to fund our operations.
In May 2020 we reduced head count as a result of our decision to file an IND for SkinTE, and this decision was also influenced by what we believed would be adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the end of 2020 we had 85 full and part-time employees compared to 157 at the end of 2019. This 46% reduction in personnel is the primary driver for the 47% reduction of total operating costs and expenses in 2020. We will continue to search for opportunities to lower our operating expenses in 2021 and thereby lower the rate at which we use capital obtained from external sources.
We have generated revenue from the sale of SkinTE as a 361 HCT/P product since 2018. In addition, we have generated revenue from our laboratory testing and research service business. Revenue from these activities has been helpful in lowering the rate at which we use capital obtained from external sources.
Gross profit from the sale of SkinTE covered 5% of our total operating costs and expenses in 2020. However, if the FDA allows enforcement discretion for regenerative tissue products to expire at the end of May 2021, we may need to cease selling SkinTE until the FDA approves a BLA, and then we will only be able to market SkinTE for the indications that have been approved in the BLA. Consequently, it is possible that SkinTE sales may not continue to contribute to our capital resources in 2022. We are actively seeking opportunities to continue the process of reducing our operating expenses, and if SkinTE sales end in the future we intend to re-double our efforts to reduce costs of operations to make up for the loss of revenues.
Revenues generated from our laboratory testing and research services have also been helpful in lowering the rate at which we use capital obtained from external sources. Gross margin from services in 2020 covered 6% of our total operating costs and expenses in 2020. Gross profit from services was 39% higher in 2020 than in 2019 due to the revenues generated through COVID-19 testing that began at the end of May 2020. COVID-19 testing is a relatively new business activity, and 96% of COVID-19 testing revenues in 2020 were obtained under 30-day renewable testing agreements with multiple nursing home and pharmacy facilities in the state of New York controlled by a single company. On March 26, 2021, we were advised by the company that controls the New York nursing homes and pharmacy facilities we service that the state of New York is allowing on-site employee testing and that on-site testing will be implemented for the New York facilities we service, which will likely have the effect of substantially diminishing our revenues from COVID-19 testing after the first quarter of 2021. We are a relatively unknown testing laboratory, so we have relied on word of mouth and management relationships to connect with prospects and vied for new business on the basis of price and service, and we cannot predict how well this marketing approach will work in finding new customers for Arches’ testing services. Even if we are able to find new customers for the COVID-19 testing business there remain substantial uncertainties around the COVID-19 testing business due to rapid developments in testing and vaccines.
Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending upon the timing of our clinical trials and our expenditures for satisfying all the conditions of obtaining FDA market approval for SkinTE. Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay these expenses, as reflected in the change in our accounts payable and accrued research and development and other current liabilities.
Recent Developments
Capital Formation
We raised capital in December 2020 and January 2021 to fund our operations. We previously reported in November 2020 that at September 30, 2020, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $23.186 million, which would not be adequate to fund our operations beyond the first quarter of 2021. We embarked on a plan to raise capital to fund our operations that began with a restructuring in November 2020 of warrants sold in a public offering in February 2020, which we believed had a chilling effect on our ability to attract institutional investors and depressed the public trading price of our common stock.
After the warrant restructuring we sold 5,450,000 shares of common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 5,238,043 shares of common stock (with an exercise price of $0.001), and accompanying common warrants to purchase up to 10,688,043 shares of common stock to a single healthcare-dedicated institutional investor in a registered direct offering. Each common share and pre-funded warrant were sold together with a common warrant. The combined offering price of each common share and accompanying common warrant was $0.7485 and for each pre-funded warrant and accompanying common warrant was $0.7475. The pre-funded warrants were subsequently exercised in January 2021 and the net proceeds we received from the offering were $7.2 million. In January 2021, the holder of the common warrants exercised all 10,688,043 warrants at an exercise price of $0.624 per share resulting in gross proceeds of $6.7 million. In exchange for the agreement of the holder to exercise those common warrants we issued to the holder new common stock purchase warrants at a price of $0.125 per new warrant to purchase up to 8,016,033 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $1.20 per share. Gross proceeds from the sale of the new warrants was $1.0 million.
Also in January 2021 we sold to the same institutional investor who participated in the December registered direct offering 6,670,000 shares of common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 2,420,910 shares of common stock (with an exercise price of $0.001), and accompanying common warrants to purchase up to 9,090,910 shares of common stock in another registered direct offering. Each common share and pre-funded warrant were sold together with a common warrant. The combined offering price of each common share and accompanying common warrant was $1.10 and for each pre-funded warrant and accompanying common warrant was $1.099. The pre-funded warrants were subsequently exercised so the gross proceeds of the offering were $10.0 million. The common warrants sold in the registered direct offering have an exercise price of $1.20 per share.
We believe this capital infusion from the foregoing offerings will enable us to fund our IND filing and the start of at least two clinical trials under the BLA for SkinTE.
Business Effects of COVID-19
The current COVID-19 pandemic has presented a substantial public health and economic challenge around the world and is affecting our employees, patients, clinicians, communities, and business operations, as well as the U.S. economy and financial markets. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact the timing and cost of pursuing FDA approval of SkinTE under a BLA is highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. We will need to engage contract research organizations (“CROs”) for our future clinical trials and the COVID-19 pandemic and response efforts may have an impact on the ability of CROs to timely perform the trials we need for SkinTE.
We saw a decrease in SkinTE cases in March 2020 and procedures scheduled for April 2020 postponed or not being scheduled, which was a trend we expected would continue and adversely affect our results of operations. As a result of our decision to file an IND for SkinTE and the disturbing trend in SkinTE cases, in May 2020 we reduced our workforce within our regenerative medicine business segment, which is engaged primarily in the commercialization of SkinTE. We also refocused our commercialization effort on the territories where we have current and repeat users of SkinTE, and this new focus resulted in a quarter over quarter increase in the average wound size treated and a concomitant increase in revenues, which we did not expect.
In the contract services segment COVID-19 had a significant adverse effect on pre-clinical research business from March through the end of 2020, so we expected our contract services business would also suffer as a result of COVID-19. However, we unexpectedly received inquiries in April 2020 from third parties acquainted with our management team regarding our laboratory and its ability to perform COVID-19 testing, which we attribute to the surge in COVID-19 testing throughout the United States and what we believe to be a lack of laboratory testing capacity to meet the surging demand. Management evaluated Arches’ resources and found that it has the capability of performing molecular polymerase chain reaction testing for COVID-19. Management decided that COVID-19 testing offered an opportunity to use existing resources to generate additional revenue in the contract services segment and thereby help defray our operating expenses. We began providing COVID-19 testing services at the end of May 2020, and from then to the end of 2020 COVID-19 testing generated $4.3 million in net revenues. These developments notwithstanding, there is great uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic that makes it impossible to accurately predict how the pandemic may directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused us to modify our business practices including, but not limited to, curtailing or modifying employee travel, moving to partial remote work, and cancelling physical participation in meetings, events, and conferences. We may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, patients, clinicians, and business partners. The majority of our office-based employees have been working from home since March 2020, while ensuring essential staffing levels to support our operations remain in place, including maintaining key personnel in our laboratories.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, we had $25.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, and working capital of approximately $22.7 million. In January 2021, we raised an additional $17.7 million in gross proceeds before offering expenses in a registered direct offering and through a warrant exercise agreement.
We believe the net revenues we generate internally together with the cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet will fund our business activities through the end of 2021 and into the third quarter of 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2020 cash used in operating activities was $5.6 million, or an average of $1.9 million per month. After our IND is filed and then accepted by the FDA, we will move to begin clinical trials as soon as possible. Preliminary estimates indicate one clinical trial could cost approximately $5.0 million over two years, and we believe we will need to conduct at least two clinical trials for SkinTE. Clinical trials are the major expense we see in the near and long term, and while we are pursuing clinical trials we will continue to incur the costs of maintaining our business. In addition to clinical trials, the most significant uses of cash to maintain our business going forward are compensation and costs of occupying our facilities. If we need to discontinue commercial sales of SkinTE, we will lose net revenues from the sale of SkinTE, but we will also focus on eliminating operating expenses related to the SkinTE service. We cannot predict how this will impact our cash flows and working capital.
We will need to raise additional capital to fund our effort to obtain FDA approval of SkinTE and maintain our operations in the future. Although we have been successful in raising capital in the past, financing may not be available on terms favorable to us, if at all, so there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining additional financing. For the foreseeable future we will continue to pursue fundraising opportunities when available. If adequate funds are not available to us in the future, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate our plans for obtaining regulatory approval for SkinTE or be unable to continue operations over a longer term.
Results of Operations
* Not meaningful
Net Revenues
Net revenues increased by 79% to $10.126 million in 2020. The increase in net revenues for sale of products was the result of a sales strategy adopted in May 2020 to focus on regions and facilities where we had repeat users of SkinTE. For 2020 the average wound size treated with SkinTE was 219 cm2 compared to 120 cm2 in 2019, which corresponds with the difference in revenue between those years. The increase in net revenues for services was the result of $4.324 million in new COVID-19 testing services we began to offer through Arches at the end of May 2020. In 2019 services net revenues was derived primarily from pre-clinical testing services provided through IBEX, which were adversely impacted by COVID-19 in 2020.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales increased by 78% to $4.424 million in 2020, which is attributable to the cost of sales of $2.417 million for providing COVID-19 testing services that were added in 2020. The cost of sales for products were lower in 2020 by 22% over 2019 due to the economies of scale gained from selling SkinTE for larger wounds.
Operating Costs and Expenses
Total operating costs and expenses decreased to $51.642 million in 2020 from $96.566 million in 2019, or 47%. This is the most significant change in our results of operations period over period and is attributable to the 46% reduction in personnel from the end of 2019 to the end of 2020. The reduction in personnel substantially reduced salary and benefit costs across the Company. Salary and benefits totaled $19.721 in 2020 compared to $28.812 in 2019. In addition, stock-based compensation decreased by 77% from $31.402 million in 2019 to $7.258 million in 2020. The decrease in salary and benefits in 2020 accounts for 20% of the decrease in total operating costs and expenses in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease in stock-based compensation in 2020 accounts for 54% of the decrease in total operating costs and expenses in 2020 compared to 2019. The reduction in personnel also allows us to make incremental reductions in the cost of infrastructure required to support the activities of employees.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses decreased by 30% in 2020 to $11.532 million, which is attributable to the reduction in salary and benefits and stock compensation costs from 2019.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses decreased by 56% in 2020 to $27.557 million. In addition to reductions in salary and benefits and stock compensation costs from 2019, travel and related costs decreased to $0.243 million in 2020 from $1.318 million in 2019. Expenses for our leased facilities were $2.094 million in 2020. Lease expenses for our corporate office facility was $0.357 million in 2020, which will not recur in 2021 because the lease expired in 2020. Our lease expense for our manufacturing facility in Utah was $1.251 million in 2020, and we remain obligated under the terms of the lease for that facility until the end of November 2022.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses decreased by 49% in 2020 to $8.719 million. In addition to reductions in salary and benefits and stock compensation costs from 2019, promotional consulting and expense was reduced to $0.834 million in 2020 from $5.270 in 2019, and travel and related costs decreased to $0.444 million in 2020 from $1.440 million in 2019.
Restructuring and other charges
We recorded $3.834 million in restructuring and other charges in 2020. The main components of the restructuring charges are capitalized costs in the amount of $0.518 million for the development of a vivarium project at our Salt Lake City facility we abandoned in 2020, abandonment of equipment purchased in prior periods in the amount of $1.014 million, and severance payments in the amount of $1.025 million associated with the reduction of personnel in 2020.
In addition, when we were pursuing an aggressive commercialization plan for SkinTE in 2019 we entered into a lease agreement for establishing a manufacturing node at the Joseph M. Still Burn Center in Augusta, Georgia. The node lease has a term of five years and a monthly base rent of $10,286. In 2020 we spent $0.606 million on node operations, including rent of $0.119 million. In the fourth quarter of 2020 we decided to abandon operations at the node, which resulted in the recognition of a charge in the amount of $1.175 million comprised of equipment, leasehold improvements, and a right of use asset. We continue to make payments on the lease for the node and are seeking opportunities to sublease the space.
Other income (expense), net - Change in Fair Value of Common Stock Warrants
We have issued and outstanding warrants classified as liabilities. The amount of the liabilities attributable to the warrants are remeasured as of the end of each fiscal quarter and adjusted accordingly through an increase or decrease recorded on our consolidated statement of operations for the period. At December 31, 2020, the total common stock warrant liability was $5.975 million reflecting a fair value change of $2.914 million under other income.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
For a description of our significant accounting policies, see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.
Revenue Recognition. With respect to revenue recognition in contract services provided by IBEX, revenues generally consist of a single performance obligation that IBEX satisfies over time using an input method based on costs incurred to date relative to the total costs expected to be required to satisfy the performance obligation. We believe that this method provides a faithful depiction of the transfer of services over the term of the performance obligation based on the remaining services needed to satisfy the obligation. This requires that our services personnel at IBEX make reasonable estimates of the extent of progress toward completion of the contract and, as a result, unbilled receivables and deferred revenue are recognized based on payment timing and work completed.
Stock-Based Compensation. The fair value for options issued is estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The risk-free rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. The volatility factor is determined based on our historical stock prices.
Common Stock Warrant Liability. The fair value of the common stock warrant liability is estimated using the Monte Carlo simulation model, which involves simulated future stock price amounts over the remaining life of the commitment. The fair value estimate is affected by our stock price as well as estimated change of control considerations.
