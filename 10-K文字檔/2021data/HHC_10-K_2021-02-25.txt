MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OVERVIEW
OVERVIEW
Please refer to Item 1. Business for a general discussion of our business strategy, competitive strengths and a general description of the assets contained in our four business segments and Item 2. Properties for details regarding the asset type, size, location and key metrics about our various properties.
The following highlights significant activities during 2020 for the Company and each of our business segments. While the impact of COVID-19 affected all of our business segments, we saw notable performance improvements during the second half of the year. Performance for each of our business segments is more fully described hereinafter (all items are pre-tax unless otherwise noted).
In the fourth quarter of 2019, we announced our intent to execute a Transformation Plan to reduce annual overhead expenses by $45 - $50 million, sell approximately $2 billion of non-core assets and accelerate the growth in our core MPC assets. We have made significant progress on the execution of our Transformation Plan commitments with meaningful reductions in overhead and the disposition of several non-core properties. Since the announcement of the Transformation Plan, we have executed on the sale of eight non-core assets generating approximately $213.8 million of net proceeds after debt repayment. The COVID-19 pandemic has made additional non-core asset sales more challenging to execute and we expect this to continue into 2021. We have continued horizontal development in our MPCs to keep pace with homebuilder demand given the strong underlying home sales in our communities. Additionally, we have commenced modest investments in pre-development work for the next vertical development opportunities in our core MPCs.
The outbreak of COVID-19 impacted global economic activity in early 2020 and caused significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets. The impact of COVID-19 and the wide variety of government-issued control measures, including states of emergency, required business and school closures, shelter-in-place orders and travel restrictions, resulted in a negative impact on our financial performance in 2020, particularly in our Operating Asset and Seaport District segments. Many states began easing quarantine protocols near the end of the second quarter of 2020 which allowed most of our retail and hospitality properties to resume operations. While the impact of COVID-19 affected all of our business segments in the first half of the year, we saw notable performance improvements and significant sales momentum during the second half of the year. For a discussion of the risks and uncertainties related to the impact of COVID-19, refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.
COVID-19 Impacts by Segment
Operating Assets
Office and Multifamily Throughout the pandemic, we have seen continued strength in our office and multifamily assets. We are closely monitoring our rental revenue, and based on collections from the second quarter through year end, we have collected 96.7% of our office portfolio billings, 97.8% of our multi-family portfolio billings and 83.8% of our other portfolio billings. Additionally, as a result of assets being placed in service during 2020 and the second half of 2019, revenues from our office and multi-family properties, which accounted for 13.1% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019, have increased 38.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Retail Retail locations at our properties, which accounted for 8.2% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019, were significantly negatively impacted by the pandemic. Beginning in April 2020, we experienced the temporary closure of all non-essential retail in Summerlin, Houston and Ward Village, and the complete closure of the Outlet Collection at Riverwalk. Several of our tenants were able to resume limited operations with phased reopenings beginning in May and June 2020 and the majority of our tenants had reopened by the end of the third quarter. As a result of these closures, retail revenue decreased 23.2% for the year ended December 31, 2020, and collections of our retail portfolio billings reached a low of 49.7% during the three months ended June 30, 2020. Our analysis of collections determined that full collection of outstanding receivables for certain retail tenants was not probable. As a result, during 2020, we recognized a total impact of $24.6 million in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, comprised of a $18.7 million charge against Rental revenue and a $5.9 million charge to the Provision for (recovery of) doubtful accounts. Refer to Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.
HHC 2020 FORM 10-K | 36
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OVERVIEW
Despite these negative impacts, we saw notable improvements in the performance of our retail assets during the fourth quarter. Collections of our retail billings increased to 72.6% for the three months ended December 31, 2020, and net operating income (NOI) increased 44.2% quarter over quarter from $6.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020, to $10.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of increased collections and the positive impact of the holiday season in the fourth quarter.
Hospitality At the onset of the pandemic, we experienced significant cancellations and declines in occupancy in our three hotel properties, which accounted for 6.8% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019, and temporarily closed all three of our hotel properties in March 2020. The Woodlands Resort reopened in May 2020, with 54% of the rooms available and the Embassy Suites reopened in June 2020, with 100% of the rooms available. Both hotels continued to operate with this initial percentage of available rooms through the end of 2020. At The Westin at The Woodlands, we reopened the bar and restaurant in April 2020, subject to local guidance, and reopened 100% of the guest rooms on July 1, 2020. As a result of these reopenings, occupancy levels have risen since the second quarter of 2020, however, total occupancy for 2020 declined, compared to levels achieved prior to the impact of the pandemic, resulting in a 59.9% decrease in total revenue for our hospitality properties for the year ended December 31, 2020.
As announced in late June, the Minor League Baseball season was canceled for 2020, which impacted the Las Vegas Aviators, our Triple-A professional baseball team, which accounted for 1.9% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019. In February 2021, Major League Baseball announced that it was restructuring the organization and operation of Minor League Baseball. We are in the process of analyzing the effect this new structure may have on the value and profitability of our baseball assets. Refer to Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.
MPC In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, during the first quarter of 2020, we took steps to reduce expenses and preserve cash, including ceasing development of MPC land that was not under contract for sale or where we did not have a post-closing requirement, and reducing or postponing voluntary capital expenditures. In addition, homebuilders implemented new model home practices by adding 3D virtual tours of interactive floor plans, live chat capabilities with sales staff, and increased photographs on their websites conducive to social distancing and hygiene recommendations.
For our MPC segment, new home sales, a leading indicator of land sales, dropped considerably in April as a result of stay-at-home orders, but experienced large upticks in May through December as local economies began to re-open. In response, we restarted horizontal development to maintain a sufficient supply of lots and superpads to keep up with the strong home sales. Overall in 2020, new homes sales increased by 80.2% in The Woodlands Hills, 18.1% in Bridgeland and 8.1% in Summerlin. The Woodlands Hills and Bridgeland saw improved land sales revenue due to higher volume of acres sold and price per acre despite the impacts of COVID-19. Land sales revenues at Summerlin decreased compared to the prior period, however this was due to timing of superpad closings and not a decrease in homebuilder demand for our land.
Seaport District In response to the pandemic, we completely closed the Seaport District and halted construction on the Tin Building in mid-March. Social distancing restrictions also resulted in cancellation of our Seaport summer concert series. The city gradually eased restrictions in July, with dining limited to only outdoor spaces. Indoor dining resumed at minimum capacities in late September but due to a surge in COVID-19 cases late in the year, restrictions related to indoor dining were re-imposed in December. Many of the businesses within the Seaport District resumed operations, on a limited basis, in the third quarter of 2020, including The Fulton, Cobble & Co. and Malibu Farm. Construction on the Tin Building resumed in May and is expected to be substantially complete in the fourth quarter of 2021 and open in early 2022, with an expanded focus on in-person dining, retail shopping, mobile ordering and delivery.
In August, in place of the summer concert series, we launched a new concept at the Pier 17 rooftop called The Greens, which allowed groups of up to eight people to reserve their own socially distanced, mini-lawn space. We served over 55,000 guests, had an average wait list of over 20,000 people and generated $1.4 million in revenue through October. In November, the lawn spaces were converted to individual dining cabins for guests to enjoy throughout the winter months. Each cabin is 12 feet by 10 feet and seats up to 10 people. During November and December, we served over 24,000 guests, had an average wait list of over 4,000 people and generated $1.3 million in revenue. These concepts meaningfully increased the Seaport District’s exposure across social and media platforms with a significant increase in new social followers and media impressions earned. This concept also helped us fulfill obligations under our sponsorship agreements which might have been drastically reduced without the summer concert series.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OVERVIEW
We are closely monitoring our revenues, and based on collections from the second quarter through year end, we have collected 96.4% of our office portfolio billings and 30.7% of our retail portfolio billings. Based on our analysis of collections throughout the year, we determined that full collection of outstanding receivables for certain tenants was not probable. As a result, during 2020, the Company recognized a total impact of $3.2 million in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, comprised of a $3.1 million charge against Rental revenue and a $0.1 million charge to the Provision for (recovery of) doubtful accounts. Refer to Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.
Strategic Developments Given the challenges presented by this new environment, we launched digital sales efforts, including virtual tours to sell condominiums in Hawai’i, which we will maintain until social distancing recommendations are lifted. We have also implemented new model home practices by adding 3D virtual tours of interactive floor plans, live chat capabilities with sales staff, and increased photographs on their websites conducive to social distancing recommendations. As a result, overall progress at our condominium projects remains strong as of December 31, 2020, with Victoria Place, our newest project, 77% presold.
We have not experienced any delays in our existing construction as a result of COVID-19, other than the brief delay of construction on the Tin Building discussed above. We placed six assets in service upon completion of construction as planned and transferred 1.7 million square feet of office and retail space and 931 multi-family units to the Operating Assets segment in 2020. In the third quarter, following strong home sales and continued market demand, we commenced modest investments in pre-development work and in December, we broke ground on Starling at Bridgeland, a luxury multi-family development in Bridgeland. Additionally, we expect to begin construction on a new residential building in the Merriweather District in Downtown Columbia and the next residential tower at Ward Village in the first quarter of 2021, and an office building and luxury apartment complex in Downtown Summerlin in the second quarter of 2021.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OVERVIEW
As described above, the pandemic has negatively impacted the economy in most of the regions in which we operate, as well as directly impacted sectors that have historically been meaningful contributors to HHC, such as hospitality, retail and sports ventures. In direct response to the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic and the impacts on our four business segments, as well as the economy and capital markets in general, we initiated measures to increase our liquidity. As a result, we were able to maintain a strong balance sheet, and ensure we maintain the financial flexibility and liquidity necessary to fund future growth.
During 2020, we enhanced our liquidity profile through a successful common stock offering, which generated $593.6 million in proceeds, and the issuance of $750 million in senior notes due August 2028. The Company used the net proceeds from the debt issuance, together with cash on hand, for the repayment of existing indebtedness of approximately $807.9 million. Additionally, the Company sold four non-core assets during the year, which generated a total of $102.3 million in net proceeds and received an additional $44.5 million related to the 2019 sales of West Windsor and Cottonwood Mall. Our liquidity was further enhanced during the year by obtaining approximately $400.2 million of new construction financings and $177.0 million in other financings. As of December 31, 2020, we had $1.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents, available capacity of $185.0 million on the revolver portion of our credit facilities, and approximately $321.7 million of debt payments due in 2021 based on extended maturity dates.
On February 2, 2021, the Company issued $650 million in 4.125% senior notes due 2029 and $650 million in 4.375% senior notes due 2031. The Company will use the net proceeds from the offering, as well as available cash on hand, to repurchase all of its $1 billion 5.375% senior notes due 2025, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, pursuant to a tender offer announced in January 2021; repay all of the approximately $280 million outstanding under its loans for 1201 Lake Robbins and The Woodlands Warehouse maturing June 2021; and pay all premiums, fees and expenses related to the foregoing. On February 2, 2021, the Company repurchased $512.5 million of its $1 billion 5.375% senior notes and intends to repurchase the remainder of these notes on March 15, 2021. In February 2021, the Company repaid all of the approximately $280 million outstanding under its loans for 1201 Lake Robbins and The Woodlands Warehouse maturing June 2021.
As discussed above, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the temporary closure of some of the Company’s Operating Assets, primarily retail and hospitality properties. As a result of the decline in interim operating results, the Company did not meet the debt service coverage ratios for some of its debt instruments during the year and subsequently cured these failures with either the repayment of the related debt instrument or modification of the existing terms of the debt instrument. As of December 31, 2020, the Company did not meet the debt service coverage ratio for the $615.0 million Term Loan portion of the Senior Secured Credit Facility and as a result, the excess net cash flow after debt service from the underlying properties became restricted. The restricted cash cannot be used for general corporate purposes but can continue to be used to fund operations of the underlying assets. The cash restrictions do not materially impact our operations. Apart from the Term Loan portion of the Senior Secured Credit Facility, as of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all remaining financial covenants included in the agreements governing its indebtedness. Please refer to Note 7 - Mortgages, Notes and Loans Payable, Net in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OVERVIEW
Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2020, to the year ended December 31, 2019
Operating Assets
-Net operating income (NOI) decreased $26.0 million due to decreases of $25.9 million in our hospitality properties, $22.5 million in our retail properties and $7.8 million in our other properties, partially offset by an increase of $29.5 million in our office properties. These decreases are primarily due to rent deferrals and collection reserves related to our retail properties, declines in occupancy at our hospitality properties and cancellation of the Las Vegas Aviators 2020 baseball season, all as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in office properties is primarily related to new assets placed in service during 2020 and at the end of 2019.
-Retail asset NOI increased 44.2% quarter over quarter from $6.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020, to $10.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of increased collections and the positive impact of the holiday season in the fourth quarter.
-We continue to see strong demand for our newly completed multi-family assets, which have leased at or above our expectations.
MPC
-Segment Earnings Before Taxes (EBT) decreased by $54.4 million, primarily due to lower land sales revenues in Summerlin due to lower superpad sales and SID bond assumptions, partially offset by an increase in land sales revenues in Bridgeland due to an increase in acres sold and price per acre. The decrease in superpad sales in 2020 was primarily due to the accelerations of sales into 2019 as a result of increased demand from homebuilders and homebuyers.
-New home sales, a leading indicator of future land sales, increased 80.2% at The Woodlands Hills, 18.1% at Bridgeland and 8.1% at Summerlin.
-Bridgeland sold 169.1 residential acres compared to 150.3 acres in 2019. The average price per residential acre increased $31,000 to $439,000 per acre.
Seaport District
-Segment EBT decreased $40.7 million primarily due to a decrease in segment revenues and operating expense as a result of business closures and cancellations of events related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and an $11.6 million loss on extinguishment of debt upon retirement of the $250 million Seaport District loan in August 2020.
-Seaport District NOI decreased $1.5 million primarily due to a $2.5 million decrease in our events, sponsorships and catering business, partially offset by a $1.5 million increase in our managed business entities. The decrease in NOI was primarily the result of business closures and cancellation of events related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
-The total NOI loss from the Seaport District segment decreased by 50.1% to a loss of $3.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020, compared to a loss of $6.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020, primarily due to increased operations and sponsorship revenue recognized in the fourth quarter as a result of reopenings.
Strategic Developments
-Segment EBT increased $76.7 million primarily due to a $267.5 million gain on the deconsolidation of 110 North Wacker attributable to the initial fair value step-up of the retained equity method investment at the time of deconsolidation and an additional $15.4 million recognized upon deconsolidation attributable to previously eliminated 110 North Wacker development fees upon deconsolidation, partially offset by a $97.9 million charge in 2020 related to our expected funding of costs to correct alleged construction defects at Waiea and a $78.4 million decrease in Condominium rights and unit sales, net of costs, driven by the timing of condominium closings. The Company closed on 596 units at Ke Kilohana and Ae’o in 2019, with no new condominium towers completed in 2020.
-Despite the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced strong condominium unit sales in Ward Village, evidenced by the 302 condominium units we contracted to sell during 2020. Victoria Place, our newest project that began public pre-sales in December 2019, accounted for 268 of the units contracted during the year and was 76.8% presold as of December 31, 2020. We expect to begin construction on Victoria Place in the first quarter of 2021.
-During 2020, we placed the following assets in service upon substantial completion of construction: (i) 8770 New Trails, an office building in The Woodlands; (ii) 110 North Wacker, an office building in Chicago; (iii) Two Lakes Edge, an apartment complex in The Woodlands; (iv) Juniper Apartments, a multi-family property in Columbia, (v) Merriweather District Area 3 Standalone Restaurant, part of the retail amenity for Merriweather’s Area 3 in

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OVERVIEW
Columbia; and (vi) The Lane at Waterway, a multi-family property in The Woodlands. As a result, we transferred 1.7 million square feet of office and retail space and 931 multi-family units to the Operating Assets segment in 2020.
In addition to the required presentations using GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP performance measures, as we believe these measures improve the understanding of our operational results and make comparisons of operating results among peer companies more meaningful. Management continually evaluates the usefulness, relevance, limitations and calculation of our reported non-GAAP performance measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public, and thus such reported measures could change.
Because our four segments, Operating Assets, MPC, Seaport District and Strategic Developments, are managed separately, we use different operating measures to assess operating results and allocate resources among them. The one common operating measure used to assess operating results for our business segments is EBT. EBT, as it relates to each business segment, represents the revenues less expenses of each segment, including interest income, interest expense, depreciation and amortization and equity in earnings of real estate and other affiliates. EBT excludes corporate expenses and other items that are not allocable to the segments. See discussion herein at Corporate income, expenses and other items for further details. We present EBT for each segment because we use this measure, among others, internally to assess the core operating performance of our assets.
EBT should not be considered an alternative to GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders or GAAP net income, as it has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations of EBT are that it does not include the following in our calculations:
-cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments
-corporate general and administrative expenses
-interest expense on our corporate debt
-income taxes that we may be required to pay
-any cash requirements for replacement of fully depreciated or amortized assets
-limitations on, or costs related to, the transfer of earnings from our real estate and other affiliates to us
Segment operating results are as follows:

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders decreased $100.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019 and increased $16.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018.
For the year ended December 31, 2020:
Total segment EBT decreased $139.1 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to the following:
-lower Operating Asset EBT primarily due to decreases in operating revenues due to rent deferrals and collection reserves related to our retail properties, declines in occupancy at our recently reopened hospitality properties and cancellation of the Las Vegas Aviators 2020 baseball season as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic
-lower MPC EBT primarily due to lower MPC land sales revenues, driven by timing of Summerlin superpad sales
-lower Seaport EBT primarily due to decreases in segment revenues and operating expenses primarily as a result of business closures and cancellations of events related to the COVID-19 pandemic
-loss on extinguishment of debt due to the early retirement of Seaport and Operating loans
-higher Strategic Developments EBT primarily due a gain on deconsolidation of 110 North Wacker attributable to the initial fair value step-up of the retained equity method investment at the time of deconsolidation and the recognition of previously eliminated 110 North Wacker development fees upon deconsolidation, partially offset by a charge in the 2020 related to our expected funding of costs to correct alleged construction defects at Waiea, and lower Condominium rights and unit sales, net of costs, driven by the timing of condominium closings
Net expenses related to Corporate income, expenses and other items decreased $61.6 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to the following:
-decrease in General and administrative expenses primarily related to the reduction of labor costs due to workforce reductions as part of an overall plan to reduce recurring overhead costs, and lower travel and entertainment costs, which are attributable to COVID-19 travel restrictions
-decrease in Income tax expense (benefit) primarily due to a decrease in Income before income tax
-increase in corporate interest expense, net primarily due to the $750 million issuance of senior notes in 2020
For the year ended December 31, 2019:
Total segment EBT increased $53.5 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to the following:
-higher MPC EBT primarily due to higher superpad sales at Summerlin and higher lot sales and the mix of lots sold at Bridgeland, The Woodlands and The Woodland Hills
-higher Operating Asset EBT primarily due to increases in operating revenues at our office, retail and multi-family properties due to placing six properties into service in the latter half of 2018 and early 2019, as well as increased our office, multi-family and hospitality properties and higher Other land, rental and property revenues due to placing the Las Vegas Ballpark into service in 2019
-higher Strategic Developments EBT primarily due to an increase in Gain (loss) on sale or disposal of real estate and other assets, net related to gains on the sales of West Windsor and Cottonwood Mall in 2019, partially offset by a loss on the sale of the Bridges at Mint Hill joint venture in 2019 and lower Condominium rights and unit sales, net of costs, driven by closings at Ke Kilohana in 2019, a workforce tower, compared to closings at Ae’o in 2018
-lower Seaport EBT primarily due to an increase in Interest expense for debt related to the acquisition of 250 Water Street, the Seaport District term loan that closed in the second quarter of 2019, and a reduction of interest capitalized to assets that were under development during 2018 but have since been placed in service, and an increase in Operating costs primarily due to start-up costs for new business openings and costs directly associated with increases in revenue at our businesses
Net expenses related to Corporate income, expenses and other items increased $36.9 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to the following:
-increase in General and administrative expenses primarily due to corporate restructuring costs and consulting fees for technology and data integration projects
-increase in Income tax expense (benefit) primarily due to an increase in Income before tax
-partially offsetting decrease in Demolition costs primarily related to 2018 costs at 110 North Wacker and Tin Building that did not recur in 2019 and increase in Corporate other income related to the receipt of insurance proceeds related to Superstorm Sandy

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Segment EBT The following table presents segment EBT for Operating Assets for the years ended December 31:
For the year ended December 31, 2020:
Operating Assets segment EBT decreased $120.6 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to the following:
-increase in the Provision for impairment of $48.7 million for Outlet Collection at Riverwalk, partially offset by an increase in Gain (loss) on sale or disposal of real estate related to the sale of 100 Fellowship Drive, in The Woodlands, Texas, in the first quarter of 2020. Please refer to Note 3 - Acquisitions and Dispositions and Note 4 - Impairment in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.
-net decreases in our Other land, rental and property revenues and related Operating expenses primarily due to declines in occupancy at our recently reopened hospitality properties and cancellation of the Las Vegas Aviators 2020 baseball season, all as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic
-net decreases in Rental revenue and related Operating expenses primarily due to rent deferrals and collection reserves related to our retail properties
-decrease in Selling profit from sales-type leases attributable to the commencement of a lease at our 100 Fellowship Drive property in the third quarter of 2019
-increase in Depreciation and amortization expense, Rental property real estate taxes, Interest expense, net, and Operating expenses, partially offset by Rental revenue related to office and multi-family assets recently acquired or placed in service, but still in the lease-up period
For the year ended December 31, 2019:
Operating Assets segment EBT increased $30.8 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to the following:
-increase in Rental Revenues primarily due to increases at our office, retail and multi-family properties due to placing Aristocrat, Two Summerlin, Two Merriweather and Lakefront North office properties and Lake Woodlands Crossing Retail property in service in the latter half of 2018, placing Creekside Park Apartments into service in 2019, as well as increased occupancy and continued stabilization at Millennium Waterway Apartments, Three Hughes Landing, 1725 Hughes Landing, 2201 Lake Woodlands Drive, 50 Columbia Corporate Center and One Merriweather
-increase in Other land, rental and property revenues primarily due to opening the Las Vegas Ballpark in 2019
-increase in Operating costs primarily due to costs associated with opening the Las Vegas Ballpark in 2019 as well as placing various office, retail and multi-family properties in service in 2019 or late 2018
HHC 2020 FORM 10-K | 44
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
-increase in Depreciation and amortization primarily due to the transfers of the Las Vegas Ballpark, 6100 Merriweather, 100 Fellowship Drive, Tanager Apartments and Hughes Landing Daycare from Strategic Developments to Operating Assets in 2019 or late 2018
-increase in Interest income (expense), net primarily due to the Las Vegas Ballpark, Two Summerlin, Aristocrat, Lakefront North, Creekside Park Apartments and Three Hughes Landing being placed in service in 2019 or late 2018
Net Operating Income We believe that NOI is a useful supplemental measure of the performance of our Operating Assets and Seaport District segments because it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and operating real estate properties and the impact on operations from trends in rental and occupancy rates and operating costs as variances between years in NOI typically result from changes in rental rates, occupancy, tenant mix and operating expenses. We define NOI as operating revenues (rental income, tenant recoveries and other revenue) less operating expenses (real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance, marketing and other property expenses). NOI excludes straight-line rents and amortization of tenant incentives, net; interest expense, net; ground rent amortization; demolition costs; other income (loss); amortization; depreciation; development-related marketing costs; gain on sale or disposal of real estate and other assets, net; provision for impairment and equity in earnings from real estate and other affiliates. We use NOI to evaluate our operating performance on a property-by-property basis because NOI allows us to evaluate the impact that property-specific factors such as lease structure, lease rates and tenant base have on our operating results, gross margins and investment returns.
Projected annual stabilized NOI is initially projected prior to the development of the asset based on market assumptions and is revised over the life of the asset as market conditions evolve. On a quarterly basis, each asset’s annualized NOI is compared to its projected stabilized NOI and stabilization date in conjunction with forecast data to determine if an adjustment is needed. Adjustments to an asset’s stabilized NOI are made when changes to the asset's long-term performance are thought to be more than likely and permanent. Projected stabilized dates are adjusted when the asset is believed to reach its stabilized NOI prior to or later than originally assumed.
Although we believe that NOI provides useful information to investors about the performance of our Operating Assets and Seaport District segments, due to the exclusions noted above, NOI should only be used as an additional measure of the financial performance of such assets and not as an alternative to GAAP net income. A reconciliation of Operating Assets segment EBT to Operating Assets NOI is presented in the table below. Refer to the Seaport District section for a reconciliation of Seaport District segment EBT to Seaport District NOI.

Office Properties Our office properties are located in Summerlin in Las Vegas, Nevada; Columbia, Maryland; and The Woodlands, Texas. Leases related to our office properties are generally triple net leases in The Woodlands, gross leases in Summerlin and modified gross leases in Columbia.
The following discussions summarize our recently completed or acquired office properties, which were placed in service in 2020:
The Woodlands
8770 New Trails This build-to-suit office building was placed in service in the first quarter of 2020. We entered into this build-to-suit arrangement with Alight Solutions, a national health and welfare benefits administrator, in the first quarter of 2019. The building, which is 100% leased, is a four-story, 180,000 rentable square foot office building. Total development costs of approximately $46.0 million was partially financed with a $35.5 million construction loan. We expect to reach projected annual stabilized NOI of $4.4 million in 2021.
Other
110 North Wacker This 1,492,940 square foot office building was placed in service in the third quarter of 2020. This triggered a reconsideration event that resulted in the deconsolidation of 110 North Wacker and the recognition of the retained equity method investment at fair value. The equity method investment was transferred from the Strategic Development segment to the Operating Asset segment, however NOI for equity method investments is not disclosed in the table above. As of December 31, 2020, the asset is 77% leased.
Retail Properties Some of the leases related to our retail properties are triple net leases, which generally require tenants to pay their pro-rata share of property operating costs, such as real estate taxes, utilities and insurance, and the direct costs of their leased space. We also enter into certain leases which require tenants to pay a fixed rate per square foot reimbursement for common area costs which is increased annually according to the terms of the lease. Given the unique nature of many of our retail properties, the mix of tenant lease agreements and related lease terms executed during the year ended December 31, 2020, may differ significantly from those entered into in prior periods.
The following discussions summarize our retail properties which were completed and transferred from Strategic Developments to Operating Assets in 2020:
Columbia
Merriweather District Area 3 Standalone Restaurant In the third quarter of 2020, this standalone restaurant project in Merriweather District Area 3 which is 100% pre-leased to Busboys and Poets, was placed in service. This project is one of two separate retail buildings, the other being a standalone kiosk. These two projects will serve as amenities to Area 3’s residents and office workers and launch us into the next phase of transforming Area 3 into an urban, mixed-use regional attraction. Total development cost for the standalone restaurant project was approximately $5.6 million. We expect to reach projected annual stabilized NOI of $0.4 million in the first half of 2021.
Multi-family Properties The following are multi-family properties which were transferred from Strategic Developments to Operating Assets during the year ended December 31, 2020:
Columbia
Juniper Apartments This seven-story, 382-unit multi-family property in Columbia was placed in service in the first quarter of 2020. The building includes 56,683 square feet of retail on the ground level, a parking garage, a fitness center and yoga studio, a clubroom with an outdoor terrace and a swimming pool, along with other amenities. Total development costs of approximately $116.4 million were partially financed with a $85.7 million construction loan. We expect to reach projected annual stabilized NOI of $9.2 million in 2023.
The Woodlands
The Lane at Waterway This multi-family development was placed in service in the fourth quarter of 2020. The project is the third phase of the Millennium Apartment portfolio, following the success of Millennium Waterway and Millennium Six Pines. The community includes 163 luxury units situated on 1.67 acres, with one, two and three-bedroom units as well as townhomes. Total development costs were approximately $45.0 million which was partially financed with a $30.7 million construction loan. We expect to reach projected annual stabilized NOI of $3.5 million in 2022.

Two Lakes Edge This eight-story, Class-A, 386-unit multi-family development was placed in service in the second quarter of 2020. The mixed-use development in The Woodlands is our second apartment complex in Hughes Landing. The project includes 11,448 square feet of retail and restaurant space on the ground level and community amenities that include a resort-style pool and outdoor entertainment area overlooking Lake Woodlands, a Sky Lounge, built-in wine storage, a fitness center with a large yoga room and an outdoor fitness lawn. Total development costs were approximately $107.7 million which was partially financed with a $74.0 million construction loan. We expect to reach projected annual stabilized NOI of $8.5 million in 2024.
Other The properties that are included in Other Properties in our Operating Assets NOI and EBT table for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 include the Las Vegas Ballpark, Kewalo Basin Harbor, HHC 242 Self-Storage, HHC 2978 Self-Storage, Hughes Landing Daycare, Woodlands Warehouse and the ground lease for our NHL hockey practice facility in Downtown Summerlin. The decrease in NOI in Other Properties for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019 is primarily related to the cancellation of the Las Vegas Aviators 2020 baseball season, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in NOI for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018, is primarily related to placing assets such as Las Vegas Ballpark, Kewalo Basin Harbor and Hughes Landing Daycare into service as well as continued stabilization of various assets.
Other Transferred Properties The following discussions summarize our properties which were transferred to Operating Assets from Strategic Developments or acquired in 2019 and 2018:

The Las Vegas Ballpark, inclusive of the results from both the stadium operations and those of the Las Vegas Aviators, is expected to contribute approximately $8.1 million to our NOI annually. This expected NOI was not achieved during 2020 due to the cancellation of the Las Vegas Aviators 2020 baseball season, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic
Two Summerlin This Class-A office building was completed in the third quarter of 2018. Total development costs were approximately $50.9 million.
Tanager Apartments In the fourth quarter of 2019, we opened this multi-family development in Downtown Summerlin. Total development costs were approximately $59.3 million. We expect to reach projected annual stabilized NOI of approximately $4.4 million by the first quarter of 2022.

Segment EBT The following table presents segment EBT for MPC Assets for the years ended December 31:
(a)Land sales include deferred revenue from land sales closed in a previous period which met criteria for recognition in the current period.
(b)Builder price participation revenue is based on an agreed-upon percentage of the sales price of homes closed relative to the base lot price which was paid by the homebuilders to us. This revenue fluctuates based upon the number and the prices of homes closed that qualify for builder price participation payments.
(c)Interest expense, net reflects the amount of interest that is capitalized at the project level. Negative interest expense amounts relate to interest capitalized relating to debt assigned to our Operating Assets segment and corporate debt.
(d)Equity in earnings in real estate and other affiliates reflects our share of earnings in The Summit joint venture.
(e)The negative MPC segment EBT in Columbia in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was due to real estate taxes and administrative expenses.
(f)Commercial land sales in The Woodlands in 2018 consisted of a 1.6-acre site that was acquired in 2014 at market value, as the original purchaser did not proceed with construction, our holding costs exceeded the 2018 sale price.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
MPC revenues vary between periods based on economic conditions and several factors including location, availability of land for sale, development density and residential or commercial use. Gross margin for each MPC will vary from period to period based on the locations of the land sold and the related costs associated with developing the land sold. Reported results differ significantly from actual cash flows generated principally because cost of sales for GAAP purposes is derived from margins calculated using carrying values, projected future improvements and other capitalized project costs in relation to projected future land sale revenues. Carrying values generally represent acquisition and development costs reduced by any previous impairment charges. Development expenditures are capitalized and generally not reflected in the Statements of Operations in the current period. Accordingly, Cost of sales - land includes both actual and estimated future costs allocated based upon relative sales value to the lots or land parcels in each of the villages and neighborhoods in our MPCs.
For the year ended December 31, 2020:
MPC Segment EBT decreased $54.4 million to $209.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to the following results by MPC:
Bridgeland
-Residential land sales revenues increased $12.9 million primarily due to an increase in acres sold and price per acre. Bridgeland sold 169.1 residential acres compared to 150.3 acres in 2019. The average price per residential acre increased by $31,000 to $439,000 per acre.
-Commercial land sales increased $2.2 million from the sale of 16.6 acres compared to no commercial site sales in 2019.
Summerlin
-Land sales revenues decreased $101 million primarily due to lower superpad sales and SID bond assumptions, partially offset by an increase in custom lot sales. The decrease in land sales revenues was partially offset by a decrease in associated MPC cost of sales of $38 million. The decrease in superpad sales in 2020 was primarily due to the acceleration of sales into 2019 as a result of increased demand from homebuilders and homebuyers.
-Revenues from custom lot sales increased due to an increase in quantity of lots sold despite a decrease in average price for custom lots, which averaged approximately $34.50 per square foot in 2020 compared to $39.00 per square foot in 2019.
-Summerlin’s residential land sales totaled 126.9 acres compared to 319.4 for the same period in 2019. The average price per acre for superpad sites for the year increased by $90,000 to $738,000 per acre compared to the same period in 2019 due to the mix of lots sold.
-Equity earnings at The Summit decreased due to an increase in projected amenity costs and the 2020 sales consisting of a greater mix of built units which have a lower margin than custom lot sales.
The Woodlands
-Land sales revenues decreased $16.6 million primarily due to a decrease in acres sold due to availability of land as the community reaches completion. The Woodlands sold 24.6 residential acres compared to 60.9 acres in 2019. The average price per residential acre increased $384,000 to $1.1 million per acre, primarily due to an increase in land sales in a high-end, exclusive section of The Woodlands community that generates significantly higher value per acre in comparison.
The Woodlands Hills
-Land sales revenues increased $6.3 million due to an increase in acres sold and price per acre. The Woodlands Hills sold 56.1 residential acres compared to 40.2 acres in 2019. The average price per acre increased $34,000 to $310,000 per acre.
For the year ended December 31, 2019:
MPC Segment EBT increased $55 million to $263.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the following results by MPC:
Bridgeland
-Land sales revenues increased $11.3 million as a result of higher residential land sales and the recognition of revenues deferred in previous periods.
-Residential land sales were higher due to an increase in acres sold and price per acre. For the year ended December 31, 2019, Bridgeland sold 150.3 residential acres compared to 125.3 acres in 2018. The average price per residential acre increased $23,000 to $408,000 per acre as a result of contractual escalations in lot prices.
-Commercial land sales decreased as there were no commercial sites sales compared to one commercial site totaling 2.4 acres sold at an average price of $583,000 per acre in 2018.
HHC 2020 FORM 10-K | 52
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
-Builder price participation increased 61.7% due to an increase in the number of homes closed.
-Other land revenues decreased $1.1 million due to easement sales that did not reoccur.
Summerlin
-Land sales revenues increased $46.5 million due to an increase in superpad sales and SID bond assumptions related to debt for a new SID formed in the fourth quarter of 2019. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in average price for custom lot sales from $1,414,000 per lot in 2018 to $744,000 per lot in 2019. The decrease in average price for custom lots is a result of selling smaller lots in 2019, which averaged $39.00 per square foot in 2019 compared to $47.34 per square foot in 2018.
-Summerlin’s residential land sales totaled 319.4 acres compared to 244.8 acres for the same period in 2018. The average price per acre for superpad sites for the year increased $82,000 to $648,000 per acre compared to the same period in 2018 due to the mix of lots sold.
-There were no commercial land sales in 2019 and in 2018 the Company sold a 5.9-acre church site for $399,000 per acre.
-Builder price participation revenue increased 30.9% and 20.8% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, primarily due to increases in the prices of new homes and associated options, upgrades and lot premiums.
The Woodlands
-Land sales revenues increased $8.3 million. Residential land sales revenues were up $9.7 million, primarily due to the quantity and mix of lots sold, including 3.9 acres of superpad sales. Commercial land sales decreased $1.4 million as there were no commercial parcel sales in the current year period.
-The Woodlands sold 60.9 residential acres in 2019 compared to 53.7 acres in 2018. The average price per residential acre for single-family lots increased $71,000 to $689,000 per acre in 2019 while the average price per acre for superpad sites was $923,000 in 2019. The increase in price per residential acre is primarily due to product mix.
-In 2018, The Woodlands sold a 1.6-acre commercial retail site for $850,000 per acre. The higher price per acre was due to the location being on a major thoroughfare.
-Builder price participation revenue increased 16.0% as contractual terms with our homebuilders were adjusted to align with the current Houston market.
The Woodlands Hills
-Land sales revenues increased $2.2 million due to volume and product mix of lots sold.
-The Woodlands Hills sold 40.2 residential acres compared to 32.4 acres in 2018.
-Other land revenues decreased $0.5 million due to funds received for a construction easement in 2018 that did not recur in 2019.
The Summit
Land development began at The Summit, our joint venture with Discovery Land, in the second quarter of 2015, and the development continues to progress. The golf course and related amenities were completed and opened to the members of the golf club in October 2017. The Club Tower Suites broke ground in March of 2019 with construction on schedule to be completed in 2021. Construction of the clubhouse has commenced with an expected delivery in 2022. Lot closings began in the second quarter of 2016, and a total of 158 lots have closed for $577.1 million through December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, 29 residential lots closed for $155.7 million, compared to 20 residential lots closed for $76.4 million in 2019 and 32 lots closed for $104.8 million in 2018 at The Summit, which offers a mix of custom lots, single family homes and clubhouse suites, sold by the joint venture. We recognized $17.8 million, $28.3 million and $36.3 million in equity in earnings and cash distributions of $6.0 million, $16.1 million and $10.0 million were received in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Although our business does not involve the sale or resale of homes, we believe that net new home sales are an important indicator of future demand for our superpad sites and finished lots. Therefore, we use this statistic where relevant in our discussion of MPC operating results herein. Net new home sales reflect home sales made by homebuilders, less cancellations. Cancellations generally occur when a homebuyer signs a contract to purchase a home but later fails to qualify for a home mortgage or is unable to provide an adequate down payment to complete the home sale.
Reconciliation of MPC Land Sales Closed to GAAP Land Sales Revenue The following table reconciles Total residential and commercial land sales closed in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 to Land sales revenue for the respective periods. Total net recognized (deferred) revenue includes revenues recognized in the current period which are related to sales closed in prior periods, offset by revenues deferred on sales closed in the current period.
Population growth, coupled with low mortgage interest rates, have led to continued demand for new homes in the Summerlin and Houston markets. Summerlin was ranked the third highest selling master planned community in the nation and also recognized as the “Best Selling MPC in Las Vegas” by RCLCO. Bridgeland was ranked the ninth highest selling master planned community in the nation and also recognized as the “Best Selling MPC in Texas” by RCLCO for 2020. We expect demand to continue as home sales in high quality suburban communities continue to grow in 2021.
MPC Net Contribution In addition to MPC segment EBT, we believe that certain investors measure the value of the assets in this segment based on their contribution to liquidity and capital available for investment. MPC Net Contribution is defined as MPC segment EBT, plus MPC cost of sales, Depreciation and amortization and net collections from SID bonds and Municipal Utility District (MUD) receivables, reduced by MPC development expenditures, land acquisitions and Equity in earnings from real estate and other affiliates, net of distributions. MPC Net Contribution is not a GAAP-based operational metric and should not be used to measure operating performance of the MPC assets as a substitute for GAAP measures of such performance nor should it be used as a comparison metric with other comparable businesses. A reconciliation of segment EBT to MPC Net Contribution is presented below.

(b)SID collections are shown net of SID transfers to buyers in the respective periods.
MPC Net Contribution decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to the land sales changes explained in the EBT section above, partially offset by higher MUD and SID bonds collections, net and lower MPC development expenditures. MPC Net Contribution increased for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the land sales changes explained in the EBT section above. MPC development expenditures at Bridgeland and Summerlin increased in 2019 to accommodate projected land sales.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The revitalization of Lower Manhattan into a media and entertainment hub continues in our Seaport District, which encompasses several city blocks along the East River waterfront and includes (i) the Historic Area/Uplands, which is west of the FDR Drive and consists of approximately 187,000 square feet of retail space, including the 105,000 square foot Fulton Market Building, a portion of which was placed in service in the fourth quarter of 2016, and (ii) approximately 213,000 square feet of experiential retail, studio and creative office space at Pier 17, which opened in 2018, with an additional 53,000 square feet at the Tin Building located east of the FDR Drive, which is under development and discussed further below.
The Seaport District is part non-stabilized operating asset, part development project and part operating business. As such, the Seaport District has a greater range of possible outcomes than our other projects. The greater uncertainty is largely the result of (i) seasonality; (ii) potential sponsorship revenue; (iii) potential event revenue; and (iv) business operating risks from various start-up businesses. We operate and own, either directly, through license agreements or in joint ventures, many of the tenants in the Seaport District, including retail stores such as SJP by Sarah Jessica Parker and restaurants such as The Fulton by Jean-Georges, Bar Wayō, Malibu Farm, two concepts by Andrew Carmellini, R17 and the marketplace operated by Jean-Georges. As a result, the revenues and expenses of these businesses, as well as the underlying market conditions affecting these types of businesses, will directly impact the NOI of the Seaport District. This is in contrast to our other retail properties where we primarily receive lease payments and are not as directly impacted by the operating performance of the underlying businesses. This causes the financial results and eventual stabilized yield of the Seaport District to be less predictable than our other operating real estate assets with traditional lease structures. Further, as we open new operating businesses, either owned entirely or in partnership with third parties, we expect to incur pre-opening expenses and operating losses until those businesses stabilize, which likely will not happen until the Seaport District reaches its critical mass of offerings. We expect the time to stabilize the Seaport District will be primarily driven by the construction, interior finish work and stabilization to occur at the Jean-Georges marketplace in the Tin Building. As a result of impacts related to COVID-19, there were delays in construction on the Tin Building, however construction is still on track for completion in the fourth quarter of 2021, with an expanded focus on experiences including in-person dining, retail shopping, mobile ordering and delivery. As a result of COVID-19, we expect stabilization to take at least 18 months. Given the factors and uncertainties listed above combined with potential future impacts related to COVID-19, we do not currently provide guidance on our expected NOI yield and stabilization date for the Seaport District. As we move closer to opening a critical mass of offerings at the Seaport District, we will re-establish goals for yield on costs and stabilization dates when the uncertainties and range of possible outcomes are clearer.
We primarily categorize the businesses in the Seaport District segment into three groups: landlord operations, managed businesses and events and sponsorships. Real Estate Operations (Landlord) represents physical real estate we have developed and own, either wholly or through joint ventures, and is inclusive of our office, retail and multi-family properties. Managed Businesses represents retail and food and beverage businesses that HHC owns, either wholly or through partnerships with third parties, and operates, including license and management agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our managed businesses include, among others, The Fulton, SJP by Sarah Jessica Parker, R17, Cobble & Co. and Malibu Farm. In July 2020, Seaport entered into management agreements with Creative Culinary Management Company, LLC (Creative Culinary), a Jean-Georges company, to manage and operate its food and beverage operations for the Fulton, R17, Cobble & Co. and Malibu Farm. Creative Culinary is responsible for employment and supervision of all employees providing services for the food and beverage operations and restaurant as well as day-to-day operations and accounting for food and beverage operations.
Our events and sponsorship businesses have historically included our concert series, Winterland skating and bar, event catering, private events and sponsorships. With the cancellation of the 2020 summer concert series and the Winterland skating and bar, in August, we launched a new concept at the Pier 17 rooftop called The Greens, which allows groups of up to eight people to reserve their own socially distanced, mini-lawn space. In November, the lawn spaces were converted to individual dining cabins for guests to enjoy throughout the winter months. The Greens generated high customer demand for the outdoor venue and helped to fulfill obligations under our sponsorship agreements, which would have been drastically reduced without the concert series.

Segment EBT The following table presents segment EBT for the Seaport District for the years ended December 31:
For the year ended December 31, 2020:
Seaport District segment EBT decreased $40.7 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to the following:

For the year ended December 31, 2019:
Seaport District segment EBT decreased $35.4 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to the following:
-increase in segment revenues primarily due to existing businesses including Cobble & Co., Garden Bar and 10 Corso Como Retail and Café, and new business openings such as The Fulton and Malibu Farm
-increase in Operating costs primarily due to start-up costs and costs directly associated with increases in revenue at our businesses including Garden Bar, The Lookout, Malibu Farm, The Fulton and our summer concert series
-increase in Depreciation and amortization primarily due to the transfers of assets such as The Lookout, Malibu Farm and The Fulton from Strategic Developments to Seaport District
-increase in Interest expense, net primarily due to debt related to the acquisition of 250 Water Street, the Seaport District term loan that closed on June 20, 2019, and a reduction of interest capitalized to assets that were under development during 2018 but have since been placed into operations
-$4.9 million gain on extinguishment of debt in 2019 due to the acquisition of the 250 Water Street loan at a discount

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Net Operating Income A reconciliation of Seaport District segment EBT to Seaport District NOI is presented below:
(a)Includes miscellaneous development-related items as well as the loss related to the write-off of inventory due to the permanent closure of 10 Corso Como Retail and Café in the first quarter of 2020, and income related to inventory liquidation sales in the third quarter of 2020.
The below table presents Seaport District NOI by category:
Seaport District NOI decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019, primarily as a result of business closures and cancellations of events related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Seaport District NOI decreased for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018, primarily driven by the opening of new businesses as mentioned above and continued investment in the development of the Seaport District, particularly as it relates to funding of the start-up costs related to the retail, food and beverage and other operating assets.
Including managed businesses, events, sponsorships, catering and the Tin Building, the Seaport District is approximately 52% leased. We may continue to incur operating expenses in excess of rental revenues while the remaining available space is in lease-up. Additionally, rental revenue earned from businesses we own and operate is eliminated in consolidation. We expect to incur operating losses for our landlord operations, managed business entities and event and sponsorship until businesses in New York are able to safely reopen at full capacity, the economy recovers from the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Seaport District reaches its critical mass of offerings.
The following describes the status of our major construction projects at the Seaport District as of December 31, 2020:
Tin Building In January 2017, we executed a ground lease amendment with the City of New York, incorporating the Tin Building into our leased premises and modifying other related provisions. The project includes construction of a turn-key, interior fit-out for the marketplace space, leased by a joint venture with Jean-Georges Vongerichten, which will feature a variety of fresh specialty foods, seafood, exceptional dining experiences and other products. As part of the asset’s redevelopment, important historical elements were salvaged and catalogued during the building’s deconstruction. We have completed the reconstruction of the platform pier where the Tin Building previously stood and restoration of the building is well under way. As a result of impacts related to COVID-19, there were delays in construction on the Tin Building, however construction is expected to be substantially complete in the fourth quarter of 2021.

250 Water Street We acquired 250 Water Street in the second quarter of 2018. This one-acre site, currently used as a parking lot, is at the entrance of the Seaport District and encompasses a full city block bounded by Peck Slip, Pearl Street, Water Street and Beekman Street. On November 19, 2019, we closed on a $100.0 million note for 250 Water Street. See Note 7 - Mortgages, Notes and Loans Payable, Net for more details. In October 2020, the Company announced its comprehensive proposal for this site and submitted to the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission its plans, which includes the transformation of this underutilized full-block surface parking lot into a mixed-use development that would include affordable housing, condominium units, community-oriented spaces and office space. While the Company moves forward with the planning and continues to seek LPC and additional governmental approvals for this strategic site, it will continue to be used as a parking lot.
Our Strategic Developments assets generally require substantial future development to maximize their value. Other than our condominium properties, most of the properties and projects in this segment do not generate revenues. Our expenses relating to these assets are primarily related to costs associated with constructing the assets, selling condominiums, marketing costs associated with our Strategic Developments, carrying costs including, but not limited to, property taxes and insurance and other ongoing costs relating to maintaining the assets in their current condition. If we decide to redevelop or develop a Strategic Developments asset, we would expect that with the exception of the residential portion of our condominium projects, upon completion of development, the asset would likely be reclassified to Operating Assets when the asset is placed in service and NOI would become a meaningful measure of its operating performance. All development costs discussed herein are exclusive of land costs.
Segment EBT The following table presents segment EBT for Strategic Developments for the years ended December 31:
For the year ended December 31, 2020:
Strategic segment EBT increased $76.7 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to the following:
-increase in Equity in earnings (losses) from real estate and other affiliates primarily due to a $267.5 million gain on deconsolidation of 110 North Wacker attributable to the initial fair value step-up of the retained equity method investment at the time of deconsolidation. Please refer to Note 2 - Real Estate and Other Affiliates in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.
-increase in Other land, rental and property revenues primarily due to the recognition of $15.4 million of previously eliminated 110 North Wacker development fees upon deconsolidation.
HHC 2020 FORM 10-K | 60
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
These increases were partially offset by the following:
-increase in Condominium rights and unit cost of sales primarily driven by a $97.9 million charge in the first quarter of 2020, related to our expected funding of costs to correct alleged construction defects at Waiea. Please refer to Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies in our Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.
-decrease in net condominium sales (condominium unit sales net of condominium cost of sales) of $78.4 million driven by the timing of condominium closings. The Company closed on 596 units in 2019, primarily at Ke Kilohana and Ae’o, with no new condominium towers scheduled for completion in 2020. As highlighted below, the overall pace of sales at Ward Village remains strong, and as of December 31, 2020, we have entered into contracts for 82.1% of the units in our two under construction towers.
-increase in Condominium rights and unit cost of sales of $7.6 million driven by a reduction in the estimated net sales price of certain condominium units, including the remaining penthouse inventory, to better align the expected price with recently contracted final sales prices
-decrease in Gain (loss) on sale or disposal of real estate and other assets, net of $5.4 million as a result of 2020 activity that included the receipt of an $8.0 million termination payment related to the 2019 sale of West Windsor and a $13.7 million gain on the sale of Elk Grove, compared to 2019 activity related to the sales of Cottonwood Mall, West Windsor and Bridges at Mint Hill
For the year ended December 31, 2019:
Strategic District segment EBT increased $3.2 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to the following:
-increase in Gain (loss) on sale or disposal of real estate and other assets, net driven by 2019 activity that included a $24.1 million gain on the sale of Cottonwood Mall and a $12.0 million gain on the sale of West Windsor, partially offset by an $8.8 million loss on the sale of the Bridges at Mint Hill, compared to no dispositions in 2018
-increase in Condominium rights and unit sales due to closings at Ke Kilohana, which began in the second quarter of 2019, partially offset by lower closings at Ae‘o, which began in the fourth quarter of 2018. We closed on 596 condominium units during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 315 units during the year ended December 31, 2018.
-increase in Condominium rights and unit costs of sales primarily represent development, construction and sales costs relating to the revenues recognized at Ke Kilohana, which began closing on units in the second quarter of 2019, partially offset by lower closings at Ae‘o, which began in the fourth quarter of 2018.
Strategic Developments Projects The following describes the status of our major construction projects and announced Strategic Developments projects as of December 31, 2020. For projects that have been under construction for a substantial period and are nearing completion, please refer to the Projects under Construction table below for an update on the project’s individual metrics and associated timeline for completion. For information on the construction financings on our projects, please refer to Note 7 - Mortgages, Notes and Loans Payable, Net in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Downtown Columbia Redevelopment District
We continued to execute on our redevelopment strategy in the Downtown Columbia Redevelopment District during 2020. The Master Plan and zoning for Downtown Columbia, as amended in 2017, allows for a total of approximately 14,000,000 square feet for all of Downtown Columbia and has densities for the future development of up to 6,200 residential units, 4,300,000 square feet of commercial office space, 1,300,000 square feet of retail space and 640 hotel rooms. The majority of the properties will be developed on raw land, surface parking lots and other assets controlled by us. Based on the Development Rights and Responsibilities Agreement, signed in 2018 with the County, the existing Master Plan, zoning and project approval process cannot be amended for a period of 30 years. Additionally, pursuant to a 2010 development agreement, we have a preferred residential and office development covenant that provides us the right of first offer for new development densities of both residential and office space within the Columbia Mall Ring Road. This covenant expires in 2030.
We are currently focusing on the redevelopment of the Merriweather and Lakefront Districts. At the Merriweather District, we completed the construction of Juniper Apartments, a 382-unit multi-family property and Merriweather District Area 3 Standalone Restaurant in 2020 and we expect to begin construction on Marlow, a 472-unit multi-family property, in the first quarter of 2021. At the Lakefront District, we received final approvals in 2019 for approximately 2,000,000 square feet of net new mixed-use development which will include office, retail and residential assets. This future development district also includes three acres of land related to Ridgley Building, Sterret Place and American City Building, all of which have been demolished.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Bridgeland
Starling at Bridgeland Starling at Bridgeland is the second phase of multi-family development in Bridgeland. The project will be 358-unit, luxury development, situated on approximately 15.2 acres and will be comprised of one, two and three-bedroom units. Total development costs are expected to be approximately $58.1 million which will be partially financed with a $38.6 million construction loan that we expect to close in late first quarter or early second quarter of 2021. We began construction in December 2020 and anticipate project completion in the second quarter of 2022. We expect to reach projected annual stabilized NOI of $4.4 million in 2024.
The Woodlands
Creekside Park The Grove Creekside Park The Grove is the second phase of multi-family development in Creekside Park. The project will be a 360-unit, luxury development, situated on approximately 14.0 acres and will be comprised of one, two and three-bedroom units at an average of 973 square feet each. Total development costs are expected to be approximately $57.5 million which will be partially financed with a $43.4 million construction loan which closed on January 7, 2020. We began construction in the third quarter of 2019 and anticipate project completion in the second quarter of 2021. We expect to reach projected annual stabilized NOI of $4.7 million in 2023.
Other
Century Park On December 30, 2019, we acquired Century Park, a 63-acre, 1,302,597 square foot campus with 17 office buildings in the West Houston Energy Corridor as a part of the $565.0 million transaction to acquire The Woodlands Towers at The Waterway; a warehouse space and 9.3 acres of land in The Woodlands, TX. We plan to remarket Century Park. See Note 3 - Acquisitions and Dispositions for additional information regarding this acquisition.
Ward Village
We continue to transform Ward Village into a vibrant neighborhood offering unique retail experiences, dining and entertainment, along with exceptional residences and workforce housing set among open public spaces and pedestrian-friendly streets. We believe we have found the optimal mix of price point and product in the Honolulu market for condominium development as evidenced by the demand for our condominium projects discussed below. The ongoing and completed construction at our mixed-use condominium projects includes 171,307 square feet of retail to serve our new residents and the community at large. In addition, during the last half of 2017, we removed 226,466 square feet of dated retail space from service to prepare it for redevelopment. Many of the tenants occupying these locations were relocated within Ward Village. As we progress the buildout of the master plan, which ultimately contemplates a total of approximately 1,000,000 million square feet of commercial space at completion, we will periodically redevelop, reposition, or replace the existing retail spaces as part of new mixed-use projects.
Condominium revenue is recognized when construction of the condominium tower is complete and unit sales close, leading to variability in revenue recognized between periods. As a result of significantly lower available inventory, we closed on zero condominium units during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 596 condominium units for the year ended December 31, 2019. However, as discussed below, overall progress at our condominium projects remains strong.
Sales contracts for condominium units are subject to a 30-day rescission period, and the buyers are typically required to make an initial deposit at signing and an additional deposit 30 days later at which point their total deposit becomes non-refundable. Buyers are typically then required to make a final deposit within approximately 90 days of our receipt of their second deposit. Certain buyers are required to deposit the remainder of the sales price on a predetermined pre-closing date, which is specified in the sales contracts for each condominium project. Contracted amounts disclosed below represent sales that are past the 30-day rescission period.
Completed Condominiums As of December 31, 2020, our four completed towers are 99.6% sold with only five units remaining to be sold at Waiea and one unit remaining to be sold at Anaha. Both Ae‘o and Ke Kilohana are completely sold. In January 2021, we closed on the two units under contract at Waiea and closed on an additional two units in February 2021, resulting in only three units remaining to be sold at Waiea as of February 19, 2021. Additionally, in February 2021, the remaining unsold unit at Anaha went under contract and closed. The last unit remains under contract as of February 19, 2021.
Under Construction Condominiums As of December 31, 2020, 82.1% of the units at our two under construction towers, ‘A‘ali‘i and Kō'ula, are under contract. We launched public sales for ‘A‘ali‘i in January 2018 and broke ground in October 2018. ‘A‘ali‘i will be a 42-story, 750-unit mixed-use condominium project located off of Queen Street next to Ae’o and will consist of studio, one and two-bedroom residences and 150 workforce units. We launched public sales of our sixth

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
condominium project, Kō'ula, in January 2019 and broke ground in July 2019. Kō'ula will be a 41-story, 565-unit, mixed-use condominium project located on Auahi Street that will consist of studio, one, town and three-bedroom residences.
Predevelopment Condominiums As a result of strong demand demonstrated by sales at ‘A‘ali‘i and Kō'ula, we launched public sales of our seventh condominium project in December 2019. Victoria Place will be a 40-story, 349-unit condominium project located between Auahi Street and Ala Moana Boulevard, immediately to the west of Waiea and adjacent to Victoria Ward Park. The project will consist of one, two and three-bedroom residences with units ranging from approximately 750 square feet to 1,850 square feet. Additionally, there will be approximately 15,600 square feet of ground level open space, and 64,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor recreational space. We have entered into contracts for 281 units as of February 19, 2021 which represent 80.5% of total units.
The following provides further details for Ward Village as of December 31, 2020:
(a)The retail portions of these projects are 100% leased and have been placed in service.
(b)The retail portion of the project, which is primarily comprised of the 57,000-square-foot flagship Whole Foods Market, is 97.9% leased and has been placed into service.
(c)There will be approximately 12,000 square feet of new street level retail space as part of this project.
(d)There will be approximately 37,000 square feet of retail space as part of this project. During the year ended December 31, 2020, two purchasers defaulted on their obligations to purchase condominiums.
Projects Under Construction The following table summarizes our projects under construction and related debt held in Operating Assets, the Seaport District and Strategic Developments as of December 31, 2020. Projects that are substantially complete and which have been placed into service in the Operating Assets or the Seaport District segment are included in the following table if the project has more than $1.0 million of estimated costs remaining to be incurred. Typically, these amounts represent budgeted tenant allowances necessary to bring the asset to stabilized occupancy. Tenant build-out costs represent a significant portion of the remaining costs for the following properties in the Operating Assets and Seaport District segments:
-Creekside Park West
-Two Lakes Edge
-Merriweather District Area 3 Standalone Restaurant
-6100 Merriweather
-Pier 17
The total estimated costs and costs paid are prepared on a cash basis to reflect the total anticipated cash requirements for the projects. This table does not include projects for which construction has not yet started. We expect to be able to meet our cash funding requirements with a combination of existing and anticipated construction loans, condominium buyer deposits, free cash flow from our Operating Assets and MPC segments, net proceeds from condominium sales and our existing cash balances.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following table contains certain corporate related and other items not related to segment activities and that are not otherwise included within the segment analyses. Variances related to income and expenses included in NOI or EBT are explained within the previous segment discussions. Significant variances for consolidated items not included in NOI or EBT are described below.
For the year ended December 31, 2020:
Corporate income, expenses and other items was favorably impacted compared to the prior year period by the following:
-decrease in General and administrative expenses primarily related to the reduction of labor costs due to workforce reductions, which are part of an overall plan to reduce recurring overhead costs, and lower travel and entertainment costs, which are attributable to COVID-19 travel restrictions
-decrease in Income tax (expense) benefit primarily due to a decrease in Income before income taxes
-decrease in Development-related marketing costs primarily related to a reduction in the number of projects under development
Corporate income, expenses and other items was unfavorably impacted compared to the prior year period by the following:
-increase in corporate interest expense, net primarily due to the $750 million issuance of senior notes in August 2020, as well as a decrease in interest income due to lower interest rates
-decrease in corporate other income (loss), net due to the receipt of Superstorm Sandy insurance proceeds in the second quarter of 2019, which did not recur in 2020
For the year ended December 31, 2019:
Corporate income, expenses and other items was favorably impacted compared to the prior year period by the following:
-decrease in Demolition costs primarily related to 2018 costs at 110 North Wacker and Tin building that did not recur in 2019
-increase in Corporate other income (loss), net primarily due to the receipt of insurance proceeds related to our claim for Superstorm Sandy in 2019
-decrease in Development-related marketing costs primarily related to the reduction of costs at the Seaport District and parts of Ward Village, including ‘A‘ali‘i
Corporate income, expenses and other items was unfavorably impacted compared to the prior year period by the following:
-increase in General and administrative expenses primarily due to corporate restructuring costs and consulting fees for technology and data integration projects

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Income Taxes
The Company’s effective tax rate is typically impacted by non-deductible executive compensation and other permanent differences as well as state income taxes, which cause the Company’s effective tax rate to deviate from the federal statutory rate.
The Company’s effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020, was 137.4% as compared to 28.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to a valuation allowance of $4.7 million on a capital loss generated by the sale of the Company’s 50% equity method investment in Circle T Ranch and Power Center (refer to Note 3 - Acquisitions and Dispositions for additional details), a valuation allowance of $1.8 million on our charitable contribution carryover and a tax expense of $1.7 million related to the recapture of federal and state historic preservation credits due to the sale of our interest in Mr. C Seaport (refer to Note 3 - Acquisitions and Dispositions for additional details), offset by a $4.8 million tax impact related to the noncontrolling interest share of the gain on the deconsolidation of 110 North Wacker (refer to Note 2 - Real Estate and Other Affiliates for additional details).
The Company’s effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019, was 28.2% as compared to 21.2% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily related to permanent differences related to stock compensation deductions and non-deductible executive compensation. The year ended December 31, 2018, was also impacted by a tax benefit due to federal and state historic preservation credits related to our interest in Mr. C Seaport.
For additional information on income taxes, see Note 12 - Income Taxes in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Capitalized Internal Costs The following table presents our capitalized internal costs by segment for the years ended December 31:
Capitalized internal costs (which include compensation costs) decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019, primarily related to workforce reductions in the Strategic Developments segment. The capitalized internal costs for the Seaport segment increased due to tenant buildouts and escalated work on the Tin building. In the MPC segment, capitalized internal costs decreased in 2020 due to fluctuations in the level of development activity at our newer MPCs.
Capitalized internal costs (which include compensation costs) decreased for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018, primarily due to fewer projects under development in the current year at the Seaport District segment. In the MPC segment, capitalized internal costs decreased for the year ended December 31, 2019, due to fluctuations in the level of development activity at our newer MPCs.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
In direct response to the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic and the impacts on our four business segments, as well as the economy and capital markets in general, we initiated measures to increase our liquidity. As a result, we were able to maintain a strong balance sheet, and ensure we maintain the financial flexibility and liquidity necessary to fund future growth.
As previously reported, we generated $593.6 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock in the first quarter of 2020. In the second quarter 2020, we entered into an agreement to extend the existing Downtown Summerlin loan and the bridge loan for The Woodlands Towers at the Waterway and The Woodlands Warehouse. On August 18, 2020, the Company issued $750 million in 5.375% senior notes due August 2028. These senior notes are unsecured senior obligations of the Company and are guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the Company. The Company used the net proceeds from this issuance, together with cash on hand, for the repayment of existing indebtedness of approximately $807.9 million in the third quarter of 2020 in order to extend the average maturity date of our indebtedness. Our liquidity was further enhanced during the year by obtaining approximately $400.2 million of new construction financings and $177.0 million in other financings. Additionally, the Company sold four non-core assets during the year, which generated a total of $102.3 million in net proceeds and received an additional $44.5 million related to the 2019 sales of West Windsor and Cottonwood Mall. As of December 31, 2020, we had $1.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents, available capacity of $185.0 million on the revolver portion of our credit facilities and approximately $321.7 million of debt payments due in 2021 based on extended maturity dates.
On February 2, 2021, the Company issued $650 million in 4.125% senior notes due 2029 and $650 million in 4.375% senior notes due 2031. The Company will use the net proceeds from the offering, as well as available cash on hand, to repurchase all of its $1 billion 5.375% senior notes due 2025, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, pursuant to a tender offer announced in January 2021; repay all of the approximately $280 million outstanding under its loans for 1201 Lake Robbins and The Woodlands Warehouse maturing June 2021; and pay all premiums, fees and expenses related to the foregoing. On February 2, 2021, the Company repurchased $512.5 million of its $1 billion 5.375% senior notes and intends to repurchase the remainder of these notes on March 15, 2021. In February 2021, the Company repaid all of the approximately $280 million outstanding under its loans for 1201 Lake Robbins and The Woodlands Warehouse maturing June 2021.
Our primary sources of cash include cash flow from land sales in MPC, cash generated from our operating assets, condominium closings, deposits from condominium sales (which are restricted to funding construction of the related developments), equity offerings, first mortgage financings secured by our assets and the corporate bond markets. The sale of our non-core assets may also provide additional cash proceeds to our operating or investing activities. Our primary uses of cash include working capital, overhead, debt service, property improvements, acquisitions and development costs. Uses of cash also include one-time charges associated with relocation expenses, retention and severance payments. We believe that our sources of cash, including existing cash on hand, will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our existing obligations and anticipated ordinary course operating expenses for at least the next 12 months, even after taking into account the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic discussed above. The development and redevelopment opportunities in Operating Assets and Strategic Developments are capital intensive and will require significant additional funding, if and when pursued. Any additional funding, if available, would be raised with a mix of construction, bridge and long-term financings, by entering into joint venture arrangements, through the sale of non-core assets at the appropriate time, and lastly future equity raises. We cannot provide assurance that financing arrangements for our properties will be on favorable terms or occur at all, which could have a negative impact on our liquidity and capital resources. In addition, we typically must provide completion guarantees to lenders in connection with their providing financing for our projects. We also provided completion guarantees to the City of New York for the redevelopment of Pier 17 and the Tin Building, as well as the Hawai’i Community Development Authority for reserve condominium units at Ward Village.
Total outstanding debt was $4.3 billion as of December 31, 2020. Certain mortgages may require paydowns in order to exercise contractual extension terms. Please refer to Note 7 - Mortgages, Notes and Loans Payable, Net in our Consolidated Financial Statements for a table showing our debt maturity dates. Our proportionate share of the debt of our real estate and other affiliates totaled $274.5 million as of December 31, 2020.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The following table summarizes our net debt on a segment basis as of December 31, 2020. Net debt is defined as Mortgages, notes and loans payable, net, including our ownership share of debt of our real estate and other affiliates, reduced by liquidity sources to satisfy such obligations such as our ownership share of Cash and cash equivalents and SID, MUD and TIF receivables. Although net debt is a non-GAAP financial measure, we believe that such information is useful to our investors and other users of our financial statements as net debt and its components are important indicators of our overall liquidity, capital structure and financial position. However, it should not be used as an alternative to our debt calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Operating Activities Each segment’s relative contribution to our cash flows from operating activities will likely vary significantly from year to year given the changing nature of our development focus. Other than our condominium properties, most of the properties and projects in our Strategic Developments segment do not generate revenues and the cash flows and earnings may vary. Condominium deposits received from contracted units offset by other various cash uses related to condominium development and sales activities are a substantial portion of our operating activities in 2020.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Operating cash continued to be utilized during the year ended December 31, 2020, to fund ongoing development expenditures in our Strategic Developments, Seaport District and MPC segments, consistent with prior years.
The cash flows and earnings from the MPC business may fluctuate more than from our operating assets because the MPC business generates revenues from land sales rather than recurring contractual revenues from operating leases. MPC land sales are a substantial portion of our cash flows from operating activities and are partially offset by development costs associated with the land sales business and acquisitions of land that is intended to ultimately be developed and sold.
The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures, among others.
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $280.6 million in 2020, compared to 2019, primarily due to a decrease of $269.2 million in condominium rights and units cost of sales due to timing, which were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of lease receivable and condominium deposits received. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $2.8 million in 2019, compared to 2018, primarily due to the timing of MPC development expenditures and receipts of condominium deposits.
Investing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash used in investing activities of $428.5 million was primarily related to property development expenditures related to ongoing development activity at 110 North Wacker, the Seaport District and 6100 Merriweather. The $243.7 million decrease in property development expenditures, as compared to 2019, was primarily attributable to temporary shut downs of construction activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in investing activities was $1.2 billion, primarily due to $674.2 million of development expenditures and $565.6 million of asset acquisition activity. For the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in investing was $841.8 million primarily due to $573.0 million of property development expenditures and $235 million of asset acquisition activity. The $101.3 million increase in property development expenditures, as compared to 2018, primarily related to ongoing development activity at 110 North Wacker, the Seaport District, 6100 Merriweather and 100 Fellowship Drive. Asset acquisitions of $565.6 million in 2019 included two Class AAA office towers, a warehouse space, 9.3 acres of land in the Woodlands, TX, a 63-acre and 1.3 million square foot campus with 17 office buildings in the West Houston Energy Corridor. Asset acquisitions of $235.0 million included Lakefront North, two Class-A office buildings and 250 Water Street, a one-acre parking lot in the Seaport District.
Financing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2020, net proceeds from new loan borrowings and refinancing activities exceeded principal payments on our debt and were used to partially fund development activity at our development projects, to increase liquidity and for the acquisition of assets. Cash provided by financing activities also included $593.6 million proceeds from the issuance of common stock.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, net proceeds from new loan borrowings and refinancing activities exceeded principal payments on our debt and were used to partially fund development activity at our development projects and for the acquisition of assets.
