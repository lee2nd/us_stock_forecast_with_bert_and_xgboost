Item 7.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Management’s discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) represents an overview of the financial condition and results of operations of FNCB and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" and Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of Part I to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
FNCB is in the business of providing customary retail and commercial banking services to individuals, businesses and local governments and municipalities through 17 full-service branch offices operated by FNCB Bank, FNCB's wholly-owned subsidiary, within its primary market area, Northeastern Pennsylvania.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
FNCB may from time to time make written or oral “forward-looking statements,” including statements contained in our filings with the SEC, in our reports to shareholders, and in our other communications, which are made in good faith by us pursuant to the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
These forward-looking statements include statements with respect to FNCB’s beliefs, plans, objectives, goals, expectations, anticipations, estimates and intentions, that are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, and are subject to change based on various factors (some of which are beyond our control). The words “may,” “could,” “should,” "will," “would,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” "project," "future" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
Readers are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumption that are difficult to predict, including those under "Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors," and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Readers are also cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which reflect management’s analysis only as of the date of this report, even if subsequently made available by FNCB on its website or otherwise. FNCB does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time by or on behalf of FNCB to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this report.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management has made estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated statements of condition and results of operations for the periods indicated. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.
FNCB’s accounting policies are fundamental to understanding management’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations. Management has identified the policies on the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses (“ALLL”), securities’ valuation and impairment evaluation, the valuation of other real estate owned (“OREO”) and income taxes to be critical, as management is required to make subjective and/or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and could be subject to revision as new information becomes available.
The judgments used by management in applying the critical accounting policies discussed below may be affected by changes and/or deterioration in the economic environment, which may impact future financial results. Specifically, subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the ALLL in future periods, and the inability to collect on outstanding loans could result in increased loan losses. In addition, the valuation of certain securities in FNCB’s investment portfolio could be negatively impacted by illiquidity or dislocation in marketplaces resulting in significantly depressed market prices thus leading to impairment losses.
Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses
Management evaluates the credit quality of FNCB’s loan portfolio on an ongoing basis, and performs a formal review of the adequacy of the ALLL on a quarterly basis. The ALLL is established through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings and is maintained at a level management considers adequate to absorb estimated probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the evaluation date. Loans, or portions of loans, determined by management to be uncollectible are charged off against the ALLL, while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the ALLL.
Determining the amount of the ALLL is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience, qualitative factors, and consideration of current economic trends and conditions, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. Banking regulators, as an integral part of their examination of FNCB, also review the ALLL, and may require, based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination, that certain loan balances be charged off or require that adjustments be made to the ALLL. Additionally, the ALLL is determined, in part, by the composition and size of the loan portfolio.
The ALLL consists primarily of two components, a specific component and a general component. The specific component relates to loans that are classified as impaired. For such loans, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows, collateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The general component covers all other loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted by qualitative factors. The general reserve component of the ALLL is based on pools of unimpaired loans segregated by loan segment and risk rating categories of “Pass”, “Special Mention” or “Substandard and Accruing.” Historical loss factors and various qualitative factors are applied based on the risk profile in each risk rating category to determine the appropriate reserve related to those loans. Substandard loans on non-accrual status above the $100 thousand loan relationship threshold and all loans considered troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) are classified as impaired. Based on its evaluations, management may establish an unallocated component that is used to cover any inherent losses that exist as of the evaluation date, but which may not have been identified under the methodology.
See Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and Note 5, “Loans” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about the ALLL.
Securities Valuation and Evaluation for Impairment
Management utilizes various inputs to determine the fair value of its investment portfolio. To the extent they exist, unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets (Level 1) or quoted prices for similar assets or models using inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly (Level 2) are utilized to determine the fair value of each investment in the portfolio. In the absence of observable inputs or if markets are illiquid, valuation techniques are used to determine fair value of any investments that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement (Level 3). For Level 3 inputs, valuation techniques are based on various assumptions, including, but not limited to, cash flows, discount rates, adjustments for nonperformance and liquidity, and liquidation values. A significant degree of judgment is involved in valuing investments using Level 3 inputs. The use of different assumptions could have a positive or negative effect on FNCB’s financial condition or results of operations. See Note 4, “Securities” and Note 15, “Fair Value Measurements” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about FNCB’s securities valuation techniques.
On a quarterly basis, management evaluates individual investment securities in an unrealized loss position for other than temporary impairment (“OTTI”). The evaluation for OTTI requires the use of various assumptions, including but not limited to, the length of time an investment’s fair value is less than book value, the severity of the investment’s decline, any credit deterioration of the issuer, whether management intends to sell the security, and whether it is more-likely-than-not that FNCB will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis. Debt investment securities deemed to have OTTI are written down by the impairment related to the estimated credit loss, and the non-credit related impairment loss is recognized in other comprehensive income. FNCB did not recognize any OTTI charges on investment securities for years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 within the consolidated statements of income.
See Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and Note 4, “Securities” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about valuation of securities and management's evaluation for OTTI.
Other Real Estate Owned
OREO consists of property acquired by foreclosure, abandonment or conveyance of deed in-lieu of foreclosure of a loan, and bank premises that are no longer used for operation or for future expansion. OREO is held for sale and is initially recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell at the date of acquisition or transfer, which establishes a new cost basis. Upon acquisition of the property through foreclosure, or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, any adjustment to fair value less estimated selling costs is recorded to the ALLL. The determination is made on an individual asset basis. Bank premises no longer used for operations or future expansion are transferred to OREO at fair value less estimated selling costs with any related write-down included in non-interest expense. Subsequent to acquisition, valuations are periodically performed, and the assets are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated cost to sell. Fair value is determined through external appraisals, current letters of intent, broker price opinions or executed agreements of sale, unless management determines that conditions exist that warrant an adjustment to the value. Costs relating to the development and improvement of the OREO properties may be capitalized; holding period costs and any subsequent changes to the valuation allowance are charged to expense as incurred.
Income Taxes
The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in FNCB’s consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could impact our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.
FNCB records an income tax provision or benefit based on the amount of tax currently payable or receivable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes. Management conducts quarterly assessments of all available positive and negative evidence to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that will more likely than not be realized. FNCB establishes a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and records a charge to income if management determines, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management considers past operating results, estimates of future taxable income based on approved business plans, future capital requirements and ongoing tax planning strategies. This evaluation process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period depending on the related circumstances. The recognition of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant assumptions and judgments about future earnings, the periods in which items will impact taxable income, future corporate tax rates, and the application of inherently complex tax laws. The use of different estimates can result in changes in the amounts of deferred tax items recognized, which may result in equity and earnings volatility because such changes are reported in current period earnings. Management’s evaluation as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 concluded that no valuation allowance was necessary for net deferred tax assets.
In connection with determining the income tax provision or benefit, management considers maintaining liabilities for uncertain tax positions and tax strategies that it believes contain an element of uncertainty. Periodically, management evaluates each of FNCB’s tax positions and strategies to determine whether a liability for uncertain tax benefits is required. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, management determined that FNCB did not have any uncertain tax positions or tax strategies and that no liability was required to be recorded.
See Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and Note 10, “Income Taxes” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about the accounting for income taxes.
New Authoritative Accounting Guidance and Accounting Guidance to be Adopted in Future Periods
For information regarding new authoritative accounting guidance adopted by FNCB during the year ended December 31, 2020 and accounting guidance that FNCB will adopt in future periods, see Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Impact of COVID-19 and FNCB's response to the pandemic
In March 2020, the outbreak of the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 ("COVID-19") was recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The spread of COVID-19 has created a global public health crisis that has resulted in, and continues to pose, unprecedented uncertainty, volatility and disruption in financial markets and in governmental, commercial and consumer activity in the United States and globally, including the markets that FNCB serves. Federal, state and local authorities have responded to the pandemic by mandating the closure of non-essential businesses and schools, travel restrictions, limitations on public gatherings, and social distancing protocols. These governmental restrictions, coupled with fear of contracting the virus, resulted in a disruption in financial markets including the rapid decline in commercial and consumer activity, loss of revenues by businesses, a severe spike in unemployment, global supply chain and market volatility. The federal government has taken several actions designed to mitigate the impact of the economic disruption. Specifically, the Federal Open Market Committee ("FOMC") responded by aggressively cutting the federal funds target rate 150 basis points in two emergency actions including a 50-basis point reduction on March 3, 2020; and a 100 basis point reduction on March 15, 2020. The federal funds target rate remained at 0.00% to 0.25% from this point through December 31, 2020. Additionally, on March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ("CARES") Act, a $2.0 trillion legislative package, was signed into law. The CARES Act contains substantial tax and spending provisions including direct financial aid to American families, extensive emergency funding for hospitals and medical providers, and economic stimulus to significantly impacted industry sectors. Additionally, on December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 ("CA Act") was signed into law and authorized more than $900 billion in additional economic relief to small businesses and consumers.
As a financial institution, FNCB is considered essential and has remained open for business and is operating under its pandemic preparedness plan. To ensure the financial needs of its customers are addressed in a safe and consistent manner, the Bank's offices are open for regular business, with administrative, lending and community branch offices adhering to federal, state, and local governmental guidelines and social distancing mandates. However, in order to limit the spread of COVID-19 customers are encouraged to utilize FNCB's drive-thru facilities, automated teller machines, Customer Care center, remote deposit capture and online banking, including online account opening and chat capabilities, and mobile banking applications. FNCB is also providing the necessary technology, when needed, to its operational staff to work remotely in a secure environment. As of December 31, 2020, FNCB did not face any material resource constraints through the implementation of its pandemic preparedness plan. Throughout the year ended December 31, 2020, FNCB incurred COVID-19-related expenses including stay-at-home pay, computer-related costs, cleaning and sanitizing facilities and safety supplies, none of which were considered material. COVID-19 related expenses are included in non-interest expense in the consolidated statements of income. Additionally, FNCB has not tested for and has not identified any material operational or internal control challenges or risks, nor does it anticipate any significant challenges to its ability to maintain its systems and controls, related to operational changes resulting from the continued implementation of the pandemic preparedness plan.
Bank regulators issued guidance and have encouraged banks to work prudently with, and provide short-term payment accommodations to, borrowers affected by COVID-19. Additionally, provisions under the CARES Act originally allowed banks providing borrowers with a COVID-19 related modification to elect to not classify any such modification as a trouble debt restructuring ("TDR") if the loan was not more than 30 days past due at December 31, 2019 and the modification was executed between March 1, 2020, the date the President of the United States declared the COVID-19 pandemic a national emergency, and the earlier of 60 days after the date of termination of this national emergency, or December 31, 2020. The CA Act extended TDR relief provided under Section 4013 of the CARES Act through January 1, 2022, or 60 days after the termination of the national emergency. FNCB has applied, and continues to apply, the provisions of Section 4013 of the CARES Act and is prudently working with borrowers affected by COVID-19 by providing payment accommodations and other modifications, including but not limited to, payment deferrals involving either interest-only or full payment deferral for periods of up to six months. While interest and fees will still accrue to income, under normal GAAP accounting, should eventual credit losses on these deferred payments emerge, interest income and fees accrued would need to be reversed. As a result, interest income in future periods could be negatively impacted. While FNCB is unable to determine the effect of such an impact on its financial condition or results of operations at this time, it recognizes that the sustained economic impact may affect its borrowers’ ability to repay in future periods.
The CARES Act includes the Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP"), a program administered by the Small Business Administration ("SBA") designed to aid small- and medium-sized businesses through federally guaranteed loans distributed through banks. These loans were intended to guarantee up to 24 weeks of payroll and other costs to help those businesses remain viable and allow their workers to pay their bills. As an SBA Lender, the Bank actively participated in PPP loans assisting our small business community in securing this important funding. As of December 31, 2020, FNCB was able to serve 1,002 small business customers with PPP loans totaling $118.6 million. The CA Act that was enacted on December 27, 2020 provides an additional $284.6 billion in PPP funding to small businesses, including borrowers that previously received a PPP loan under the first round of funding. On January 19, 2021, FNCB began originating PPP loans as part of the second round of funding and as of February 28, 2021, has underwritten, submitted and received SBA approval for 400 loans representing approximately $52.7 million in funding. It is FNCB's understanding that loans funded through the PPP are fully guaranteed by the United States government. Should those circumstances change, FNCB could be required to increase its allowance for loan and lease losses related to these loans resulting in an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses.
The initial draw period of the first round of the PPP closed on August 8, 2020, and the SBA began accepting applications for forgiveness. FNCB notified and began providing ongoing assistance to customers with the forgiveness application process. As of December 31, 2020, FNCB had submitted 338 forgiveness applications to the SBA for PPP loans totaling $53.9 million and had received approval or funding from the SBA associated with a portion of these loans totaling $40.0 million. Additionally, the CA Act contains provisions that have simplified the forgiveness process for PPP loans under $150 thousand.
The Federal Reserve Bank also provided support lending to small and mid-sized businesses and not-for-profit organizations impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic through the Main Street Lending Program. Specifically, the Main Street Business Lending Program provides for five loan facilities with total potential funding of up to $600 billion. The Main Street New Loan Facility ("MSNLF"), the Main Street Priority Loan Facility ("MSPLF") and the Main Street Expanded Loan Facility ("MSELF") are three credit facilities that provide eligible business borrowers impacted by COVID-19 with financing in amounts ranging from $250 thousand to $300 million, depending on the facility. Terms of all three facilities include Federal Reserve Bank participation of 95.0%, lender participation of 5.0%, a maturity of 5 years, principal deferral for two years, interest deferral for one year and an adjustable interest rate based on one- or three-month LIBOR plus 300 basis points. Similarly, the Nonprofit Organization New Loan Facility ("NONLF") and the Nonprofit Organization Expanded Loan Facility ("NOELF") provide eligible not-for-profit organizations with financing in amounts ranging from $250 thousand to $10 million. The Bank had received approval from the Federal Reserve Bank as a participating lender in the Main Street Lending Program. During the second half of 2020, FNCB originated five MSPLF loans with an aggregate principal balance of $85.9 million and retained 5.0% of the outstanding principal balance or $4.3 million which was outstanding as of December 31, 2020. FNCB engaged an independent third-party loan review firm to confirm satisfactory underwriting and risk management practices were employed by management in the origination of these loans.
Fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact national, regional and local economies, as the number of confirmed cases spiked at the end of 2020 into early 2021. Management continues to monitor the loan portfolio in order to identify potential weakness and track exposures to borrowers and industries that may be impacted more acutely than others. Additionally, management continues to proactively reach out to specific borrowers to provide guidance and assistance as appropriate. On a portfolio level, management continues to monitor aggregate exposures to highly sensitive segments, such as hotels and hospitality, for changes in asset quality and payment performance, and liquidity levels. Management monitors unfunded commitments such as lines of credit and overdraft protection to determine liquidity and funding issues that may arise with our customers. FNCB engaged an independent third-party consultant to perform a Credit Stress Test analysis of the loan portfolio as of March 31, 2020 to assist management with evaluating the ALLL and capital planning with regard to any potential impacts of COVID-19 on the portfolio. Should economic conditions worsen, FNCB could experience further increases in its required allowance for loan and lease losses and record additional provisions for loan and lease losses. It is possible that FNCB’s asset quality metrics could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods if the effects of COVID-19 are prolonged.
Management expects the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as certain provisions of the CARES Act, CA Act and other recent legislative and regulatory relief efforts, to have a material impact on FNCB's operations. The full impact is unknown, continues to evolve and will be contingent upon the duration and severity of the economic downturn. At this time, management cannot determine or estimate the full magnitude of the impact and cannot provide any assurances as to how the crisis may ultimately affect FNCB's results of operations or financial position. The FNCB team will continue to work diligently to address any issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic in a safe and sound manner as they arise. Management believes that FNCB's balance sheet and capital position are strong and will allow FNCB to withstand the challenges that may be presented.
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
The following overview should be read in conjunction with this MD&A in its entirety.
Results of Operations
Despite a very challenging operating environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic, FNCB exhibited strong earnings performance in 2020. Net income in amounted to $15.3 million, or $0.76 per diluted common share, an increase of $4.2 million, or 38.6%, compared to $11.1 million, or $0.56 per diluted common share, in 2019. The increase in 2020 net income compared to 2019 was primarily attributable to increases in net interest income and non-interest income and a decrease in non-interest expense. These positive factors were partially offset by increases in the provision for loan and lease losses and income tax expense. Net interest income was $40.2 million in 2020, an increase of $3.9 million, or 10.8%, from $36.3 million in 2019, which was primarily due to a $3.6 million, or 37.1% reduction in total interest expense. Net interest income was also favorably impacted by $1.2 million in net loan origination fees associated with PPP loans that was recognized upon forgiveness. Non-interest income increased $1.6 million, or 21.4%, to $9.2 million in 2020 from $7.6 million in 2019. The year over year increase in non-interest income largely reflected increases in net gains on equity securities, net gains on the sales of available-for-sale debt securities and mortgage loans held for sale, and deposit service charges, partially offset by a reduction in loan referral fees/interest rate swap revenue. Non-interest expense decreased $767 thousand, or 2.6%, to $28.9 million in 2020 from $29.7 million in 2019, which primarily reflected lower salaries and employee benefits, data processing costs and other operating expenses, partially offset by increases in occupancy, equipment and bank shares tax expenses. The provision for loan and lease losses increased $1.1 million to $1.9 million in 2020, from $0.8 million in 2019, which reflected additional credit provisioning in response to uncertainty brought on by the COVID-19 global pandemic. Income tax expense increased $0.9 million, or 38.6%, to $3.2 million in 2020 as compared to $2.3 million in 2019.
Return on average assets and return on average shareholders’ equity equaled 1.13% and 10.66%, respectively, in 2020, compared to 0.92% and 8.88%, respectively, in 2019. FNCB paid dividends to holders of common stock of $0.22 per share in 2020, an increase of $0.02 per share, or 10.0%, compared to $0.20 per share in 2019. Total dividends declared and paid in 2020 equated to a dividend yield of approximately 3.44% based on the closing stock price of $6.40 per share on December 31, 2020. The dividend payout ratio was 29.0% in 2020 compared to 36.4% in 2019.
Balance Sheet Profile
Total assets increased $262.1 million, or 21.8%, to $1.466 billion at December 31, 2020 from $1.204 billion at December 31, 2019. The balance sheet expansion primarily reflected a strong inflow of deposits, a portion of which was used to purchase investment securities, fund loans and reduce borrowed funds, with the remainder resulting in a substantial increase in cash and cash equivalents. Specifically, cash and cash equivalents increased $121.2 million, or 350.8% to $155.8 million at December 31, 2020 from $34.6 million at December 31, 2019. Available-for-sale debt securities increased $77.2 million, or 28.3%, to $350.0 million at December 31, 2020 from $272.8 million at December 31, 2019. In addition, loans, net of net deferred costs and unearned income, increased $72.6 million, or 8.8%, to $901.1 million at December 31, 2020 from $828.5 million at December 31, 2019 Total deposits increased $285.7 million, or 28.5%, to $1.287 billion at December 31, 2020 from $1.002 billion at December 31, 2019. Borrowed funds decreased $46.9 million, or 82.0% to $10.3 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $57.2 million at December 31, 2019, as FNCB used some of the excess liquidity to repay FHLB of Pittsburgh advances. FNCB had no term or overnight borrowings through the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh ("FHLB") outstanding at December 31, 2020.
Total shareholders’ equity increased $22.3 million, or 16.7%, to $155.9 million at December 31, 2020 from $133.6 million at December 31, 2019. Contributing to the increase in capital was net income in 2020 of $15.3 million and a $10.8 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income related primarily to appreciation in the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities, net of deferred taxes, partially offset by year-to-date dividends declared of $4.4 million. At December 31, 2020, FNCB Bank’s total risk-based capital ratio and the Tier 1 leverage ratio were 15.79% and 9.57%, respectively, which exceeded the 10.00% and 5.00% required to be well capitalized under the prompt corrective action provisions of the Basel III capital framework for U.S. banking organizations.
Management’s Focus in 2020
In 2020, FNCB Bank, FNCB's wholly-owned subsidiary, celebrated its 110th anniversary as a community bank serving the local communities in northeastern Pennsylvania with its mission to make the banking experience for customers "simply better". The celebration was tempered by COVID-19 as FNCB operated under its pandemic preparedness plan for the majority of 2020, which has continued into 2021. While managing the many challenges brought on by the spread of the virus, or by governmental, regulatory and customer response to the pandemic, FNCB's main focus in 2020 was to protect the health and safety of our customers and employees, provide support and assistance to businesses and others within the community, and respond to the abrupt shift in how bank products and services are delivered to the customer.
FNCB participated in the SBA's PPP, which resulted in the origination of 1,002 loans representing approximately $118.6 million in funding under the initial round of this program, that directly assisted local owners of small- and medium-sized businesses. Additionally, in the second half of 2020 when the SBA began accepting applications for forgiveness, FNCB implemented a digital, cloud-based management tool to facilitate the entire forgiveness process, providing customers with direct access to educational materials and the ability to easily upload required documents. As of December 31, 2020, FNCB had received $40.0 million in borrower forgiveness from the SBA and anticipate that the remaining PPP loan balances will qualify for borrower forgiveness under the guidelines of the program in 2021. In addition, FNCB became one of eleven select lenders in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania approved to participate in the Federal Reserve's Main Street Lending Program. In addition to these governmental programs, FNCB worked directly with borrowers to provide loan payment deferral modifications under Section 1048 of the Cares Act to qualifying commercial and consumer loan customers experiencing financial disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Initiatives to improve the customer experience included expanding and enhancing FNCB's electronic and traditional product and service offerings that became vital to our customers during this unprecedented time. In addition to already providing customers with electronic payment options including Apple Pay®, Google Pay®, and Samsung Pay®, during the third quarter of 2020, the Bank partnered with Zelle®, a fast, secure and contact free way to send and receive money between trusted parties. In addition, FNCB began expanding utilization of online account opening and facilitating the PPP loan origination and forgiveness process through the use of digital signatures. With regard to creating long-term shareholder value, management has been focused on strategic business market opportunities to drive FNCB's financial performance through efficient balance sheet and interest rate risk management, growth and diversification of non-interest revenue streams, as well as enhancing the marketability and liquidity of FNCB's stock, which has aided the strong earnings performance.
Focus for 2021
Looking ahead to 2021, maintaining a safe environment for both staff and customers will remain a top priority, as well as continuing to enhance FNCB's digital banking platforms to respond to evolving customer demands. FNCB expanded the digital cloud-based PPP forgiveness tool to include functionality for the application process for additional PPP funding that was approved under the CA Act on December 27, 2020. On January 19, 2021, FNCB began originating loans under the second round of PPP funding and as of February 28, 2021, has underwritten, submitted and received approval for 400 loans representing approximately $52.7 million in funding. FNCB will continue to assist business customers through the forgiveness process and with the second round of funding, as well as work prudently with customers requesting further payment accommodations. In 2021, FNCB expects to benefit from the recognition of approximately $3.0 million in remaining net loan origination fees from the first round of PPP loans, and will continue to focus on improving efficiency and effectively navigating impending margin compression resulting from the low-interest rate environment. Additional areas of focus for 2021 include continuing to enhance the customer experience through implementation of a comprehensive digital strategy, strengthening our customer base and building existing customer wallet share, as well as a renewed focus on leadership and organizational development. To this point, early in 2021, FNCB announced the appointment of a new Chief Banking Officer to its Executive Management Team. The Chief Banking Officer, who has extensive retail financial sales and managerial experience will oversee, FNCB's commercial lending, retail lending and retail banking units.
Stock Repurchase Program
FNCB is continuously focused on creating long-term shareholder value. With this in mind, on January 27, 2021, FNCB's Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program. The program provides for the purchase of up to 975,000 shares of FNCB's outstanding common stock in open market transactions beginning on February 3, 2021 and ending on December 31, 2021. Repurchases are made pursuant to a trading plan that was adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Acquisitions under the program will be administered through an independent broker at prevailing market prices. Repurchases are subject to SEC regulations as well as certain price, market volume and timing constraints specified in the trading plan. Under the program, the purchases will be funded from available working capital presently available to FNCB, and the repurchased shares will be returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock. There is not a guarantee as to the exact number of shares that will be repurchased by FNCB, and FNCB may discontinue purchases at any time that management determines additional repurchases are no longer warranted.
SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Net Interest Income
Net interest income is the difference between (i) interest income, interest and fees on interest-earning assets, and (ii) interest expense, interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds. Net interest income represents the largest component of FNCB’s operating income and, as such, is the primary determinant of profitability. Net interest income is impacted by variations in the volume, rate and composition of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, changes in general market rates and the level of non-performing assets. Interest income is shown on a fully tax-equivalent basis using the corporate statutory tax rate of 21.0% in 2020, 2019 and 2018.
In 2020, in response to economic fallout from the global pandemic, the Federal Open Market Committee (“FOMC”) reduced the federal funds target rate a total of 150 basis points in two emergency actions: a 50 basis point decrease on March 3, 2020 followed by another 100 basis point decrease on March 16, 2020. The federal funds target rate remained at 0.00% to 0.25% from this point through the remainder of 2020. These actions resulted in a corresponding decrease in the national prime rate to 3.25% at December 31, 2020 from 4.75% at December 31, 2019. As a result, FNCB experienced a decrease in loan yields throughout 2020, compared to 2019. In addition, loan yields were impacted by the origination and funding of low-yielding PPP loans with a rate of 1.0%, offset by the recognition of net loan origination fees associated with a portion of these loans that were forgiven by the SBA. The Bank remained competitive in deposit rate offerings, parallel to market conditions and a surplus of liquidity within the industry. As a result, FNCB experienced a decrease in funding costs across interest-bearing deposits.
Tax-equivalent net interest income increased in 2020, by $4.3 million, or 11.7%, to $41.0 million compared to $36.7 million in 2019. The increase in tax-equivalent net interest income primarily reflected a $3.6 million decrease in interest expense, coupled with a $0.6 million increase in tax-equivalent interest income. The decrease in interest expense largely reflected significant reductions in the rates paid on interest-bearing demand deposits, time deposits, and borrowed funds. Also factoring into the decrease in interest expense was a decrease in the average balance of higher-costing borrowed funds. Average borrowed funds decreased $12.3 million, or 19.4%, to $51.3 million in 2020 from $63.6 million in 2019. Due to the decrease in deposit rates, FNCB experienced some deposit migration, as customers redirected maturing time deposits into non-maturity deposits. Tax-equivalent interest income in 2020 was negatively impacted by lower rates on average earning assets, which was more than entirely offset by the increase in the overall volumes of average earning assets. FNCB’s tax-equivalent interest margin increased 6 basis points to 3.35% in 2020 from 3.29% in 2019. Tax-equivalent net interest margin, a key measurement used in the banking industry to measure income from earning assets relative to the cost to fund those assets, is calculated by dividing tax-equivalent net interest income by average interest-earning assets. Additionally, rate spread, the difference between the average yield on interest-earning assets shown on a fully tax-equivalent basis and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, increased 13 basis points to 3.21% in 2020 compared to 3.08% in 2019.
A decrease in funding costs was the driving factor that lead to the $3.6 million, or 37.1%, decrease in interest expense to $6.2 million in 2020 from $9.8 million in 2019. Rates paid on interest-bearing deposits decreased 37 basis points to 0.59% in 2020 from 0.96% in 2019, resulting in a corresponding decrease to interest expense of $2.8 million. The decrease in deposit rates was concentrated in other time deposits, which decreased 38 basis points to 1.22% in 2020, compared to 1.60% in 2019. In addition, interest-bearing demand deposits, decreased 33 basis points to 0.48% in 2020 as compared to 0.81% in 2019. The reduction in rates paid on time deposits and interest-bearing demand deposits contributed $1.9 million and $0.8 million to the overall decrease in interest expense due to changes in interest rates. The rate paid on savings deposits decreased slightly to 0.10% in 2020 compared to 0.13% in 2019 but had minimal impact on interest expense. Additionally, the rate paid on borrowed funds decreased 119 basis points to 1.47% in 2020 from 2.66% in 2019, contributing $0.6 million to the overall decrease in interest expense. Also contributing to the decrease to interest expense was a $12.3 million, or 19.4%, decrease in the average balance of other borrowed funds to $51.3 million in 2020 from $63.6 million in 2019, which led to a corresponding decrease in interest expense of $0.3 million. While FNCB experienced significant deposit growth, changes in average volumes of interest-bearing deposits resulted in only a negligible increase to interest expense, which reflected the deposit migration experienced in 2020. Total average interest-bearing deposits increased $63.7 million, or 7.5%, to $908.5 million in 2020 from $844.8 million in 2019, which resulted in an $86 thousand increase in interest expense. Specifically, the average balance of time deposits decreased $43.0 million, or 18.1%, to $195.1 million in 2020 from $238.1 million in 2019. The decrease in average time deposits resulted in a corresponding decrease to interest expense of $0.6 million, which was more than entirely offset by a $98.0 million, or 19.1%, increase in average interest-bearing demand deposits to $611.5 million in 2020 as compared to $513.5 million in 2019, which caused an increase to interest expense by $0.7 million.
Tax-equivalent interest income increased $0.6 million, or 1.4%, to $47.1 million in 2020 from $46.5 million in 2019, which reflected higher volumes of average earning assets, partially offset by lower earning asset yields. Average earning assets increased $106.2 million, or 9.5%, to $1.223 billion in 2020 from $1.117 billion in 2019, resulting in a corresponding increase to tax-equivalent interest income of $4.5 million. However, the tax-equivalent yield on earning assets fell 31 basis points to 3.85% in 2020 from 4.16% in 2019, which caused a partially offsetting decrease to tax-equivalent interest income of $3.9 million. Changes in the composition of FNCB's investments portfolio was able to mitigate the impact of lower market rates. Overall, changes in volumes and rates on the the investment portfolio contributed $1.0 million in tax-equivalent interest income. Specifically, average investments increased $22.8 million, or 8.2% to $302.2 million in 2020 from $279.4 million in 2019, primarily due to the increase in tax-free securities, which averaged $51.4 million in 2020 compared to $4.6 million in 2019. Conversely, taxable securities averaged $250.9 million in 2020, a decrease of $23.8 million, or 8.7%, from $274.7 million in 2019. The shift in composition of FNCB's investment portfolio reflected the change in its income tax position, as the majority of available NOL carryforwards were consumed in 2020. The tax-equivalent yield on the investment portfolio increased 10 basis points to 3.00% in 2020 from 2.90% in 2019. Conversely, changes in volumes and rates on the loan portfolio and interest-bearing deposits in other banks resulted in decreases to tax-equivalent interest income of $0.2 million each. Specifically, average loans increased $82.0 million, or 9.9%, to $911.4 million in 2020 compared to $829.4 million in 2019, resulting in a corresponding increase to tax-equivalent interest income of $3.6 million. The tax-equivalent yield earned on the loan portfolio decreased 43 basis points to 4.18% in 2020 from 4.61% in 2019, which caused a decrease to tax-equivalent interest income of $3.8 million. The impact on changes in loan volumes and rates largely reflected the origination of PPP loans. PPP loans, which carry an interest rate of 1.00%, averaged $76.9 million in 2020. Including amortization of net origination fees associated with PPP loans of $1.2 million, the yield on PPP loans was 2.61% in 2020. Tax-equivalent yield on average interest-bearing deposits decreased 208 basis points to 0.30% in 2020 from 2.38% in 2019, resulting in a $195 thousand decrease in tax equivalent interest income, which was slightly offset by the $1.3 million, or 16.4%, increase in volume to $9.2 million in 2020 from $7.9 million in 2019.
Non-accrual loans
The interest income that would have been earned on non-accrual and restructured loans, had these loans performed in accordance with their original terms approximated $0.4 million for both years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Additionally, interest income recognized on impaired loans based on payments received approximated $0.4 million for both years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
The following table presents the components of net interest income for the three years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:
Summary of Net Interest Income
(1)
Interest income is presented on a tax-equivalent basis using a 21% rate.
(2)
Loans are stated net of unearned income.
(3)
Non-accrual loans are included in loans within earning assets.
(4)
Interest income on loans includes net loan fees of $467 in 2020, and net loan costs of $1,467 in 2019 and $1,650 in 2018.
(5)
The yields for securities that are classified as available for sale are based on the average historical amortized cost.
(6) Information for 2019 includes revisions to average balances to reclassify certain average deposits in other banks from interest-bearing deposits in other banks to non-earning assets in the amount of $4,794.
(7)
Interest rate spread represents the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the cost of average interest bearing liabilities and is presented on a tax equivalent basis.
(8)
Net interest income as a percentage of total average interest earning assets.
The most significant impact on net income between periods is derived from the interaction of changes in the volume and rates earned or paid on interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The volume of earning assets, specifically loans and investments, compared to the volume of interest-bearing liabilities represented by deposits and borrowings, combined with the spread, produces the changes in net interest income between periods.
The following table summarizes the effect that changes in volumes of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned and paid on these assets and liabilities have on net interest income. The net change or mix component attributable to the combined impact of rate and volume changes has been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate.
Rate Volume Analysis
Provision for Loan and Lease Losses
The provision for loan and lease losses is an expense charged against net interest income to provide for probable losses attributable to uncollectible loans and is based on management’s analysis of the adequacy of the ALLL. A credit to loan and lease losses reflects the reversal of amounts previously charged to the ALLL. Management closely monitors the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the ALLL by considering the underlying financial performance of the borrower, collateral values and associated credit risks. Future material adjustments may be necessary to the provision for loan and lease losses and the ALLL if economic conditions or loan performance differ substantially from the assumptions management considered in its evaluation of the ALLL.
During 2020, management took into consideration the potential adverse impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on economic conditions in its application of FNCB's methodology on the allowance for loan and lease losses. Specifically, management tried to address this adverse impact by adjusting the qualitative factor associated with changes in national, local and business economic conditions and developments. In addition, management increased the unallocated portion of the ALLL to a maximum of 10.0% of the total allowance. Both actions have resulted in higher credit provisioning during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. FNCB recorded a provision for loan and lease losses of $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $1.1 million compared to $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Non-Interest Income
The following table presents the components of non-interest income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Components of Non-Interest Income
For the year ended December 31, 2020, non-interest income increased $1.6 million to $9.2 million compared to $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The 21.4% increase in non-interest income primarily reflected a $1.1 million increase in net gains on equity securities. Net gains on equity securities in 2020 included a $1.1 thousand gain recognized on FNCB's investment in the common stock of a privately held bank holding company as part of the completion of a merger and acquisition. Also contributing to the higher level of non-interest income were increases in the net gains realized on the sale of mortgage loans held for sale and available-for-sale debt securities, and an increase in deposit services charges. An increase in mortgage volume due to historically low interest rates, coupled with favorable pricing on the secondary market, led to a $400 thousand, or 158.1%, increase in net gains on the sale of mortgages held for sale to $653 thousand in 2020, compared to $253 thousand in 2019. Net gains on the sale of available-for-sale debt securities increased $301 thousand, or 24.5%, to $1.5 million in 2020 from $1.2 million in 2019. With regard to deposit service charges, in the second half of 2019, FNCB engaged an independent third party to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of FNCB's non-interest income and fee structure to identify opportunities for enhancement. Recommendations to the fee structure arising from this assessment were fully implemented prior to the beginning of 2020. FNCB also implemented an automated, dynamic overdraft management system in 2020. As a result, deposit service charges increased, $217 thousand, or 7.1%, to $3.2 million in 2020 compared to $3.0 million in 2019. The increase primarily reflected increases in ATM surcharge fees, service charges on consumer and business demand deposits and overdraft-related fees.
Partially offsetting the increases to non-interest income was a $313 thousand, or 44.5%, decline in loan referral fees/interest rate swap revenue to $390 thousand in 2020 from $703 thousand in 2019. Loan referral fees include fees received from third-party counterparties related to various commercial loan interest rate swap transactions and fees received for the referral of FHA residential mortgage loans to a third-party broker. The decrease in these fees reflected a reduction in both the number and volume of such transactions in 2020 as compared to 2019.
In 2019, FNCB also recorded a $114 thousand BOLI death benefit claim, included in other non-interest income. There were no BOLI death benefit claims in 2020.
Non-Interest Expense
The following table presents the major components of non-interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Components of Non-Interest Expense
Non-interest expense totaled $28.9 million in 2020, a decrease of $767 thousand, or 2.6%, from $29.7 million in 2019. The decrease resulted primarily from decreases in salaries and employee benefits, data processing expense and other operating expenses. Partially offsetting these decreases were increases in occupancy costs, equipment expenses and bank shares tax.
Salaries and employee benefits decreased $272 thousand, or 1.75%, to $15.2 million in 2020 from $15.5 million in 2019. The reduction in salaries and employee benefits was largely due to an increase in payroll-related costs that were deferred and amortized over the life of the loan under ASC 310-20, which primarily reflected the 1,002 PPP loans originated in 2020. Also impacting the decrease in salaries and employee benefits was a 7.5-person reduction in full-time equivalent employees, due primarily to COVID-19 limitations on branch operations. As a result, salary costs decreased $320 thousand, or 2.7%, to $11.7 million in 2020 from $12.0 million in 2019, and payroll taxes decreased $56 thousand, or 5.8%, to $906 thousand in 2020 from $962 thousand in 2019. Partially offsetting these factors were increases in employee incentive costs of $142 thousand, or 20.3%, health insurance expense of $121 thousand, or 10.1%, and retirement costs of $95 thousand, or 19.8%. At the end of 2020, the Board of Directors approved a special one-time bonus to each employee to convey appreciation during this unprecedented time, which included payments of $500 and $250 for each full-time and part-time employee, respectively. The total cost of this one-time incentive payment was $101 thousand, which accounted for the majority of the increase in incentive costs. In the fourth quarter of 2019, FNCB began self-insuring employee healthcare benefits through a consortium. The increase in health insurance expense reflected first year costs and timing differences of benefit billing and payments associated with the transition. The higher amount of retirement costs was due to increases in supplemental employee retirement plan ("SERP") contributions and changes in FNCB's 401(k) plan including, an increase to the percentage for employer match and institution of an auto-enrollment feature upon hire.
Other operating expenses decreased $687 thousand, or 12.7%, to $4.7 million in 2020 from $5.4 million in 2019. The decrease was predominately due to a $538 thousand favorable swing in the provision for off-balance sheet commitments due to lower commitment volumes. FNCB recorded a credit for off-balance sheet commitments of $90 thousand in 2020 compared to a provision of $448 thousand in 2019.
Occupancy costs increased $104 thousand, or 5.4%, to $2.0 million in 2020 from $1.9 million in 2019, while equipment expenses increased $158 thousand, or 11.9%, to $1.5 million in 2020, compared to $1.3 million in 2019, reflecting a full-year of depreciation expense for premises and furniture and equipment related to the new offices opened in mid-2019. In addition, COVID-19 related expenses such as the cleaning and sanitization of branch and administrative offices, the installation of health and safety equipment including hand sanitizing stations and plexiglass partitions, computer-related expenses to enable a remote work environment also factored into the increase in occupancy and equipment expense.
Bank shares tax also increased in 2020, to $786 thousand, up $220 thousand from $566 thousand recorded at December 31, 2019, which reflected an increase in capital at the Bank level.
Provision for Income Taxes
FNCB recorded income tax expense of $3.2 million in 2020, an increase of $899 thousand, or 38.6%, compared to $2.3 million in 2019. The increase in income tax expense was due to higher taxable income in 2020 as compared to 2019.
Management evaluates the carrying amount of its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis, or more frequently, as necessary, in accordance with guidance set forth in ASC Topic 740 “Income Taxes,” and applies the criteria in the guidance to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized within its life cycle, based on the weight of available evidence. If management determines based on available evidence, both positive and negative, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized in future periods, a valuation allowance is calculated and recorded. These determinations are inherently subjective and depend upon management’s estimates and judgments used in their evaluation of both positive and negative evidence.
In evaluating available evidence, management considers, among other factors, historical financial performance, expectation of future earnings, the ability to carry back losses to recoup taxes previously paid, length of statutory carry forward periods, experience with operating loss and tax credit carry forwards not expiring unused, tax planning strategies and timing of reversals of temporary differences. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management carefully weighs both positive and negative evidence currently available.
Management performed an evaluation of FNCB ’s deferred tax assets at December 31, 2020 taking into consideration both positive and negative evidence as of that date. Based on this evaluation, management believes that FNCB's future taxable income will be sufficient to utilize deferred tax assets. Accordingly, management concluded that no valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was required at December 31, 2020 or 2019.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Total assets were $1.466 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $262.1 million, or 21.8%, from $1.204 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase in total assets resulted from the increase in interest-earning assets, specifically an increase in available-for-sale debt securities of $77.2 million, or 28.3%, to $350.0 million at December 31, 2020 from $272.8 million at December 31, 2019. Loans, net of the allowance for loan and lease losses, also increased by $69.6 million, or 8.5%, to $889.2 million at December 31, 2020 from $819.5 million at December 31, 2019. The increase was largely due to the origination of PPP loans, of which $76.0 million, net of net deferred origination fees, were outstanding at December 31, 2020. Cash and cash equivalents increased $121.2 million, or 350.8% to $155.8 million at December 31, 2020 from $34.6 million at December 31, 2019. Total deposits increased $285.7 million, or 28.5%, to $1.287 billion at December 31, 2020 from $1.002 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase in deposits was primarily attributable to increases in both interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposits. Total borrowed funds decreased $46.9 million, or 82.0% to $10.3 million at December 31, 2020 from $57.2 million at December 31, 2019. FNCB had no term or overnight borrowings through the FHLB of Pittsburgh outstanding as of December 31, 2020.
Total shareholders’ equity increased $22.3 million, or 16.7%, to $155.9 million at December 31, 2020 from $133.6 million at December 31, 2019. The increase was due to net income in 2020 of $15.3 million and a $10.8 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income related to appreciation in the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities, net of deferred taxes, partially offset by year-to-date dividends declared of $4.4 million. Dividends declared and paid by FNCB on its common stock totaled $0.22 per share in 2020, an increase of $0.02 per share, or 10.0%, compared to $0.20 per share in 2019. On January 27, 2021, the Board of Directors of FNCB declared a $0.06 per share dividend for the first quarter of 2021, which was a 9.1% increase compared to the $0.055 per share dividend declared for the first quarter of 2020. The first quarter 2021 dividend is payable on March 15, 2021 to shareholders of record on March 1, 2021.
Securities
FNCB’s investment securities portfolio provides a source of liquidity needed to meet expected loan demand and interest income to increase profitability. Additionally, the investment securities portfolio is used to meet pledging requirements to secure public deposits and for other purposes. Debt securities are classified as either held-to-maturity or available-for-sale at the time of purchase based on management's intent. Held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost, while available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized holding gains and losses reported as a component of shareholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, all debt securities were classified as available-for-sale. Equity securities with readily determinable fair values are carried at fair value, with gains and losses due to fluctuations in market value included in the consolidated statements of income. Securities with limited marketability and/or restrictions, such as FHLB of Pittsburgh stock, are carried at cost. Decisions to purchase or sell investment securities are based upon management’s current assessment of long- and short-term economic and financial conditions, including the interest rate environment and asset/liability management, liquidity and tax-planning strategies.
At December 31, 2020, the investment portfolio was comprised principally of fixed-rate securities issued by U.S. government or U.S. government-sponsored agencies, which include mortgage-backed securities and residential and commercial CMOs, fixed-rate taxable and tax-free obligations of state and political subdivisions, private CMOs and corporate debt securities. Except for U.S. government and government-sponsored agencies, there were no securities of any individual issuer that exceeded 10.0% of shareholders’ equity as of December 31, 2020.
The investment portfolio is predominantly fixed-rate in nature. As such, FNCB's debt securities are inherently subject to interest rate risk, defined as the risk that an investment’s value will change due to a change in interest rates, in the spread between two rates and in the shape of the yield curve. A security’s value is usually affected inversely by changes in rates. U.S. Treasury rates fell significantly in the first quarter of 2020 in response to the outbreak of COVID-19, declaration of a national emergency and economic shutdown in March 2020. U.S. Treasury rates fluctuated slightly but hovered near historic lows for the remainder of 2020. Conversely, spreads between short- and long-term rates widened from the narrow margins exhibited in 2019, adding some minor slope to the yield curve. Specifically, the spread between the 2-year and 10-year U.S. Treasury rate, which was 0.34% at December 31, 2019 widened 46 basis points to 0.80% at December 31, 2020. The 2-year Treasury rate, which was 1.58% at December 31, 2019﻿, fell 135 basis points to 0.23% at March 31, 2020 and decreased another 10﻿ basis points to 0.13% at December 31, 2020﻿. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury rate, which was 1.92% at December 31, 2019﻿, dropped 122 basis points to 0.70% at March 31, 2020﻿, but rebounded 23 basis points to 0.93% at December 31, 2020. Due to the decrease in rates comparing December 31, 2020 and 2019, FNCB experienced significant appreciation in the fair value of its investment portfolio. FNCB reported a net unrealized holding gain on its investment portfolio of $14.0 million, net of income taxes of $3.7 million at December 31, 2020, compared to a $3.1 million net unrealized holding gain, net of income taxes of $0.8 million, at December 31, 2019. However, any further increase in interest rates could result in depreciation in the fair value of FNCB’s securities portfolio and capital position.
The following table presents the carrying value of available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities with readily determinable fair values at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:
Composition of the Investment Portfolio
Management monitors the investment portfolio regularly and adjusts the investment strategy to reflect changes in liquidity needs, asset/liability strategy and tax-planning requirements. The composition of FNCB's investment portfolio shifted in 2020, reflecting the change in its income tax position, as the majority of available NOL carryforwards were consumed in 2020. At December 31, 2020, available NOLs were approximately $2.0 million, a decrease of $18.7 million compared to $20.7 million outstanding at December 31, 2019. Because of the change in tax position, FNCB increased its holdings of tax-free investments in 2020.
Management continually monitors the investment portfolio for credit worthiness, value, and yield. Each year management engages a third-party consultant to review the municipal portfolio to determine if there is any undue credit risk within the portfolio. In 2020, management decided to increase the frequency of independent third-party reviews of its municipal investments from annually to semi-annually with the most recent credit review conducted as of December 31, 2020. As part of the independent review, each security is compared to their Portfolio Credit Benchmark to identify which securities may contain more than a minimal risk of payment default. As of December 31, 2020, the third-party report concluded that each security held within the portfolio met or exceeded the benchmark and that none of the securities required further review. The next third-party review is scheduled for June 30, 2021. Management also monitors municipal securities monthly using a third-party Municipal Surveillance Report.
Market conditions in 2020 allowed management to sell lower-yielding securities at a gain and reinvest a portion of the proceeds into higher yielding securities within FNCB's risk tolerance. FNCB sold available-for-sale securities in 2020 with an aggregate amortized cost of $66.7 million. Gross proceeds received on the sales totaled $68.2 million, with net gains of $1.5 million realized upon the sales and included in non-interest income. The securities sold had a weighted-average yield of 1.63%.
Securities purchased during the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $152.7 million, including $72.9 million in tax-free obligations of state and political subdivisions, $22.8 million in taxable obligations of state and political subdivisions, $19.8 million in private CMOs, $17.8 million in corporate debt securities, $12.1 million in CMOs of U.S. government-sponsored agencies and $7.3 million in asset-backed securities. Securities purchased during 2020 had a weighted-average yield of 2.58%.
The following table presents the maturities of available-for-sale debt securities, based on carrying value at December 31, 2020, and the weighted average yields of such securities calculated on the basis of the amortized cost and effective yields weighted for the scheduled maturity of each security. The yields on tax-exempt obligations of states and political subdivisions are presented on a tax-equivalent basis using the federal corporate income tax rate of 21.0%. Because residential, commercial and private collateralized mortgage obligations, mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities are not due at a single maturity date, they are not included in the maturity categories in the following summary.

OTTI Evaluation
There was no OTTI recognized during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. For additional information regarding management’s evaluation of securities for OTTI, see Note 4, “Securities” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Management noted no indicators of impairment for the FHLB of Pittsburgh or Atlantic Community Bankers Bank stock at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Equity Securities and Equity Securities without Readily Determinable Fair Value
At December 31, 2019, FNCB owned 201,000 shares of the common stock of a privately-held bank holding company. The common stock was purchased during 2017 for $8.25 per share, or $1.7 million in aggregate, as part of a private placement pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended for offerings not involving any public offering. The common stock of this bank holding company was not traded on any established market. FNCB had accounted for this transaction as an equity security without a readily determinable fair value. The $1.7 million investment was included in other assets at December 31, 2019.
On December 18, 2019, this privately held bank holding company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (“Merger Agreement”) with a publicly traded bank holding company. The Merger Agreement provided for the privately held bank holding company to merge with and into the publicly traded bank holding company, the company surviving the merger (“surviving company”). The surviving company's common stock trades on Nasdaq. The acquisition was completed on July 1, 2020. FNCB received $1.2 million in cash for 74,113 of the acquired shares having a cost of $611 thousand. FNCB realized a gain of $611 thousand as part of this transaction. The remaining 122,178 shares with a cost of $1.0 million were converted into 78,822 shares of the surviving company's common stock that had a fair value of $19.90 per share on July 1, 2020 or $1.6 million in aggregate, which exceeded the cost basis of $1.0 million. FNCB recognized an unrealized gain of $522 thousand on the conversion of this stock upon the acquisition.
On September 15, 2020, FNCB purchased 20,000 shares of the fixed-rate non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock of another publicly traded bank holding company pursuant to an underwritten public offering at an offering price of $25.00 per share or $500 thousand in aggregate. The preferred stock, which trades on Nasdaq, pays a quarterly dividend rate of 7.50%. Also included in equity securities at December 31, 2020 and 2019, was a $1.0 million investment in a mutual fund comprised of 1-4 family residential mortgage-backed securities collateralized by properties within FNCB's market area.
Equity securities held by FNCB with a readily determinable fair value are reported at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with unrealized gains and losses recognized in non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, equity securities had a cost basis of $2.5 million and $1.0 million, respectively. The fair value of equity securities was $3.0 million at December 31, 2020 and $0.9 million at December 31, 2019.
On December 29, 2020, FNCB purchased 20,000 shares of the fixed-rate, non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock of a privately-held bank holding company at an offering price of $25.00 per share or $500 thousand in aggregate, which is included in other assets in the consolidated statements of financial condition. The preferred stock pays quarterly dividends at an annual rate of 8.25%, commencing March 30, 2021. The preferred stock of this bank holding company is not traded on any established market and is accounted for as an equity security without a determinable fair value. Under GAAP, an equity security without a readily determinable fair value shall be written down to its fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates that the investment is impaired, and the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value. As part of its qualitative assessment, management engaged an independent third party of provide a valuation of this investment as of December 31, 2020, which indicated that the investment was not impaired. Management determined that no adjustment for impairment was required at December 31, 2020.
Loans
Total loans, gross increased by $76.9 million, or 9.3%, to $903.3 million at December 31, 2020 from $826.4 million at December 31, 2019. The increase in loan balances was largely due to the origination of PPP loans. Gross PPP loans outstanding at December 31, 2020 were $78.6 million. Additionally, FNCB experienced moderate demand for residential real estate loans, construction, land acquisition and development loans, commercial and industrial loans and loans to state and political subdivisions, while commercial real estate loans and consumer loans contracted, comparing December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Historically, commercial lending activities have represented a significant portion of FNCB’s loan portfolio. Commercial lending includes commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans and construction, land acquisition and development loans, and represented 63.3% and 57.3% of total loans at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The increase in commercial lending was largely due to increases in commercial and industrial loans, specifically PPP loans, and construction, land acquisition and development loans. Excluding PPP loans, commercial lending represented 59.8% of total loans at December 31, 2020.
From a collateral standpoint, a majority of FNCB’s loan portfolio consists of loans secured by real estate. Real estate secured loans, which include commercial real estate, construction, land acquisition and development, and residential real estate loans increased by $16.2 million, or 3.2%, to $530.0 million at December 31, 2020 from $513.8 million at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to strong demand for commercial construction loans, as construction, land acquisition and development loans increased $12.3 million, or 25.9%, to $59.8 million at December 31, 2020 from $47.5 million at December 31, 2019. Real estate secured loans as a percentage of total gross loans decreased to 58.7% at December 31, 2020 from 62.2% at December 31, 2019. Excluding PPP loans, real estate secured loans as a percentage of total gross loans at December 31, 2020 was 64.3%.
Commercial and industrial loans increased $90.8 million, or 61.5%, during the year to $238.4 million at December 31, 2020 from $147.6 million at December 31, 2019. Commercial and industrial loans consist primarily of equipment loans, working capital financing, revolving lines of credit and loans secured by cash and marketable securities and PPP loans. Excluding PPP loans, commercial and industrial loans increased $12.2 million or 8.3%. Loans secured by commercial real estate decreased $4.5 million, or 1.6%, to $273.9 million at December 31, 2020 from $278.4 million at December 31, 2019. Commercial real estate loans include long-term commercial mortgage financing and are primarily secured by first or second lien mortgages.
FNCB primarily underwrites fixed-rate purchase and refinance of residential mortgage loans for sale in the secondary market to reduce interest rate risk and provide funding for additional loans. Additionally, FNCB offers a “WOW” mortgage product, which is a non-saleable mortgage with maturity terms of 7.5 to 19.5 years, and offers customers an attractive fixed interest rate, low closing costs and a guaranteed 30-day close. FNCB also offers home equity loans and home equity lines of credit ("HELOC") with a maximum combined loan-to value ratio of 90% based on the appraised value of the property. Home equity loans have fixed rates of interest and carry terms up to 15 years, while HELOCs are variable-rate loans. Residential real estate loans totaled $196.3 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $8.4 million, or 4.5%, from $187.9 million at December 31, 2019. In 2020, FNCB experienced strong demand for its proprietary WOW mortgage product, which increased $21.9 million, or 42.9%, to $72.9 million at December 31, 2020 from $51.0 million at December 31, 2019. Partially offsetting this increase were reductions in traditional 1-4 family mortgages, home equity loans and HELOCs.
Consumer loans totaled $85.9 million at December 31, 2020, a decrease of $35.2 million, or 29.1%, from $121.1 million at December 31, 2019. The majority of the decrease was concentrated within the indirect auto loan portfolio, as FNCB did not aggressively compete for these loans in 2020. Loans to state and municipal governments increased $5.1 million, or 11.6%, to $49.0 million at December 31, 2020 from $43.9 million at December 31, 2019.
The following table presents loans receivable, net by major category at December 31, for each of the last five years:
Loan Portfolio Detail
The following table presents the maturity distribution and interest rate information of the loan portfolio by major category as of December 31, 2020:
Maturity Distribution of the Loan Portfolio
Under industry regulations, a concentration is considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. Typically, industry guidelines require disclosure of concentrations of loans exceeding 10.0% of total loans outstanding. FNCB had no such concentrations at December 31, 2020 and 2019. In addition to industry guidelines, FNCB’s internal policy considers a concentration to exist in its loan portfolio if an aggregate loan balance outstanding to borrowers within a specific industry exceeds 25.0% of capital. However, management regularly reviews loans in all industry categories to determine if a potential concentration exists.
The following table presents loans by industry, the percentage to gross loans and indicates concentrations greater than 25% of capital at December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Loan Concentrations
Asset Quality
Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are stated at the amount of unpaid principal, net of unearned interest, deferred loan fees and costs, and reduced by the ALLL. The ALLL is established through a provision for loan and lease losses charged to earnings.
FNCB has established and consistently applies loan policies and procedures designed to foster sound underwriting and credit monitoring practices. Credit risk is managed through the efforts of loan officers, the Chief Credit Officer, the loan review function, and the Credit Risk Management and the ALLL committees, as well as oversight from the Board of Directors, including the Director's Loan Committee. Management continually evaluates its credit risk management practices to ensure problems in the loan portfolio are addressed in a timely manner, although, as is the case with any financial institution, a certain degree of credit risk is dependent in part on local and general economic conditions that are beyond management’s control.
Under FNCB’s risk rating system, loans that are rated pass, special mention, substandard, doubtful, or loss are reviewed regularly as part of the risk management practices. The Credit Risk Management Committee, which consists of key members of management from the finance, legal, retail lending and credit administration units, meets monthly or more often as necessary to review individual problem credits and workout strategies and provides monthly reports to the Director's Loan Committee and full Board of Directors.
A loan is considered impaired when it is probable that FNCB will be unable to collect all amounts due (including principal and interest) according to the contractual terms of the note and loan agreement. For purposes of the analysis, all TDRs, loan relationships with an aggregate outstanding balance greater than $100 thousand rated substandard and non-accrual, and loans that are identified as doubtful or loss are considered impaired. Impaired loans are analyzed individually to determine the amount of impairment. For collateral-dependent loans, impairment is measured based on the fair value of the collateral supporting the loans. A loan is determined to be collateral dependent when repayment of the loan is expected to be provided through the operation or liquidation of the collateral held. For impaired loans that are secured by real estate, management obtains external appraisals annually, or more frequently as warranted, to ascertain a fair value so that the impairment analysis can be updated. Should a current appraisal not be available at the time of impairment analysis, management may use other valuations sources, including current letters of intent, broker price opinions or executed agreements of sale. For non-collateral-dependent loans, impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows, net of any deferred fees and costs, discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate.
Loans to borrowers that are experiencing financial difficulty that are modified and result in the granting of concessions to the borrowers are classified as TDRs and are considered to be impaired. Such concessions generally involve an extension of a loan’s stated maturity date, a reduction of the stated interest rate, payment modifications, capitalization of property taxes with respect to mortgage loans or a combination of these modifications. Non-accrual TDRs are returned to accrual status if principal and interest payments, under the modified terms, are brought current, are performing under the modified terms for six consecutive months, and management believes that collection of the remaining interest and principal is probable.
Non-performing loans are monitored on an ongoing basis as part of FNCB’s loan review process. Additionally, work-out for non-performing loans and OREO are actively monitored through the Credit Risk Management Committee. A potential loss on a non-performing asset is generally determined by comparing the outstanding loan balance to the fair market value of the pledged collateral, less estimated cost to sell.
Loans are placed on non-accrual when a loan is specifically determined to be impaired or when management believes that the collection of interest or principal is doubtful. This generally occurs when a default of interest or principal has existed for 90 days or more, unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection, or when management becomes aware of facts or circumstances that the loan would default before 90 days. FNCB determines delinquency status based on the number of days since the date of the borrower’s last required contractual loan payment. When the interest accrual is discontinued, all unpaid interest income is reversed and charged back against current earnings. Any subsequent cash payments received are applied, first to the outstanding loan amounts, then to the recovery of any charged-off loan amounts, with any excess treated as a recovery of lost interest. A non-accrual loan is returned to accrual status when the loan is current as to principal and interest payments, is performing according to contractual terms for six consecutive months and future payments are reasonably assured.
Management actively manages impaired loans in an effort to mitigate loss to FNCB by working with customers to develop strategies to resolve borrower difficulties, through sale or liquidation of collateral, foreclosure, and other appropriate means. In addition, management monitors employment and economic conditions within FNCB’s market area, as weakening of conditions could result in real estate devaluations and an increase in loan delinquencies, which could negatively impact asset quality and cause an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses. Employment conditions in FNCB’s market area worsened in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Unemployment rates across the United States and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania spiked soon after the national emergency was declared, and non-essential businesses were required to shutdown or required to operate under capacity limitations. At December 31, 2019 (prior to COVID-19) the seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate for the United States, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre/Hazleton Pennsylvania metropolitan statistical area ("MSA") were 3.6%, 4.6% and 6.0%, respectively. For April 2020, amid the closure of non-essential businesses, the unemployment rate for the entire United States jumped to 14.8%. Similarly, the unemployment rates for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre/Hazleton Pennsylvania MSA rose to 16.1% and 18.4%, respectively in April 2020. However, later in the year unemployment rates, although still elevated in comparison to December 31, 2019, returned to more normal levels as restrictions were eased. For December 2020, the unemployment rates for both the United States and Commonwealth of Pennsylvania were 6.7%, while the unemployment rate for the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre/Hazleton Pennsylvania MSA was 7.9%. Management will continue to evaluate the effects of the pandemic as they unfold and proactively address any potential impact to the credit quality of FNCB's loan portfolio.
Under the fair value of collateral method, the impaired amount of the loan is deemed to be the difference between the loan amount and the fair value of the collateral, less the estimated costs to sell. For real estate secured loans, management generally estimates selling costs using a factor of 10%, which is based on typical cost factors, such as a 6% broker commission, 1% transfer taxes, and 3% various other miscellaneous costs associated with the sales process. If the valuation indicates that the fair value has deteriorated below the carrying value of the loan, the difference between the fair value and the principal balance is either charged off or a specific reserve is established. For impaired loans for which the value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell exceeds the loan value, the impairment is determined to be zero.
The following table presents information about non-performing assets and accruing TDRs as of December 31, for each of the last five years:
Non-performing Assets and Accruing TDRs
Despite economic uncertainty and elevated unemployment due to COVID-19, FNCB's asset quality metrics improved throughout 2020. Total non-performing assets decreased $3.7 million, or 33.1%, to $7.5 million at December 31, 2020 from $11.3 million at December 31, 2019. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in non-accrual loans of $3.5 million, coupled with a $231 thousand decrease in OREO. The reduction in non-accrual loans was primarily attributable to the return of several large commercial relationships to accrual status during 2020. FNCB’s ratio of non-performing loans to total gross loans decreased to 0.62% at December 31, 2020 from 1.10% at December 31, 2019. Similarly, FNCB’s ratio of non-performing assets as a percentage of shareholders’ equity decreased to 4.8% at December 31, 2020 from 8.4% at December 31, 2019. While credit quality metrics of FNCB's loan portfolio improved comparing December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, management believes the COVID-19 pandemic may have an adverse effect on asset quality in the future. Prolonged disruption to FNCB's customers could result in increased loan delinquencies, defaults and collateral devaluations. Management actively manages problem credits through workout efforts focused on developing strategies to resolve borrower difficulties through liquidation of collateral and other appropriate means. Additionally, management continues to monitor non-accrual loans, delinquency trends and economic conditions within FNCB’s market area on an on-going basis in order to proactively address any collection-related issues and mitigate any potential losses.
The following table presents the changes in non-performing loans for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Loan foreclosures represent recorded investment at time of foreclosure not including the effect of any guarantees:
Changes in Non-performing Loans
The additional interest income that would have been earned on non-accrual and restructured loans had the loans been performing in accordance with their original terms approximated
$0.4 million for both the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
The following table presents accruing loan delinquencies and non-accrual loans as a percentage of gross loans at December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Loan Delinquencies and Non-accrual Loans
Total delinquencies as a percent of gross loans decreased to 0.99% at December 31, 2020 from 1.46% at December 31, 2019. The most predominant factor contributing to the decrease in total delinquencies was a net decrease in non-accrual loans of $3.5 million, concentrated in the commercial real estate segment. Loans 30-59 days past due increased, which surpassed the decrease in loan balances that were 60-89 days past due.
Other non-performing assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was comprised solely of a classified account receivable secured by an evergreen letter of credit in the amount of $1.9 million, received in 2011 as part of a settlement agreement for a large construction, land acquisition and development loan for a residential development project in the Pocono region of Monroe County. The agreement provides for payment to FNCB as real estate building lots are sold. The project was stalled due to a decline in real estate values in this area following the financial crisis of 2008. In 2019, economic development in this market area started to improve and management had confirmed that the developer for this project had resumed construction activity, including the completion of substantial infrastructure, and had increased marketing and sales initiatives related to the project. As of December 31, 2020, no single-unit lots have been sold, however, the construction of a seven-unit building that houses timeshare units has been completed and owners began occupying the units in the fourth quarter of 2020. Management continues to monitor this project closely and is currently in negotiations with with the developer to establish a repayment plan beginning in 2021. However, uncertainty and economic volatility associated with the COVID-19 pandemic are unknown and could negatively impact the timing of sales and payments.
TDRs at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $7.7 million and $9.1 million, respectively. Accruing and non-accruing TDRs were $7.0 million and $0.7 million, respectively at December 31, 2020 and $7.7 million and $1.4 million, respectively at December 31, 2019. Loans modified as TDRs during the year ended December 31, 2020, included three commercial and industrial loans and one residential mortgage loan. The three commercial loans with an aggregate pre- and post-modification recorded investment of $196 thousand, were modified under forbearance agreements. The modification of the residential loan involved an extension of terms and had a pre- and post-modification recorded investment of $93 thousand. In 2019, there were seven loan relationships modified as TDRs during the year, which incorporated a total of ten individual loans. There was one relationship with an aggregate post-modification recorded investment of $865 thousand that was comprised of two commercial real estate loans and one commercial and industrial loan for which terms were extended and taxes capitalized. Additional TDR's included four residential real estate loans with a post-modification recorded investment totaling $289 thousand and three other commercial and industrial loans totaling $712 thousand, involving an extension of terms. Subsequent to modification, FNCB charged-off one of the commercial loans in the amount of $235 thousand.
For additional information about TDRs, see Note 5, "Loans" of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The average balance of impaired loans was $13.8 million for both the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. FNCB recognized interest on impaired loans of $351 thousand in 2020 and $398 thousand in 2019.
Modifications Related to COVID-19
In late March 2020, the federal banking regulators issued guidance encouraging banks to work prudently with and provide short-term payment accommodations to borrowers affected by COVID-19. Additionally, Section 4013 of the CARES Act addressed COVID-19 related modifications and specified that such modifications made on loans that were current as of December 31, 2019 do not need to be classified as TDRs. FNCB has applied this guidance and made 922 such modifications, with 843 loans having an aggregate recorded investment of $151.4 million outstanding as of December 31, 2020. These initial modifications provided borrowers with a short-term, typically three-month, interest-only period or full payment deferral. FNCB extended a second payment deferral modification for 79 loans with an aggregate recorded investment of $22.0 million. Management is closely monitoring all loans for which a payment deferral has been granted and will continue to follow regulatory guidance when working with the borrowers which have been impacted by COVID-19 and apply the provisions of the CARES Act in making any TDR determinations. As of December 31, 2020, there were 45 loans with an aggregate recorded investment of $9.5 million, or 1.06% of total loans, that were still under deferral.
The following table presents information about COVID-19 related loan modifications by major loan category as of December 31, 2020.
Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses
The ALLL represents management’s estimate of probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The ALLL is analyzed in accordance with GAAP and is maintained at a level that is based on management’s evaluation of the adequacy of the ALLL in relation to the risks inherent in the loan portfolio.
As part of its evaluation, management considers qualitative and environmental factors, including, but not limited to:
●
changes in national, local, and business economic conditions and developments, including the condition of various market segments;
●
changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio;
●
changes in lending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards, collection, charge-off and recovery practices and results;
●
changes in the experience, ability and depth of lending management and staff;
●
changes in the quality of the loan review system and the degree of oversight by the Board of Directors;
●
changes in the trend of the volume and severity of past due and classified loans, including trends in the volume of non-accrual loans, TDRs and other loan modifications;
●
the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations;
●
the effect of external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the current loan portfolio; and
●
analysis of customers’ credit quality, including knowledge of their operating environment and financial condition.
Evaluations are intrinsically subjective, as the results are estimated based on management knowledge and experience and are subject to interpretation and modification as information becomes available or as future events occur. Management monitors the loan portfolio on an ongoing basis with emphasis on weakness in both the real estate market and the economy in general and its effect on repayment. Adjustments to the ALLL are made based on management’s assessment of the factors noted above.
For purposes of management’s analysis of the ALLL, all loan relationships with an aggregate balance greater than $100 thousand that are rated substandard and non-accrual, identified as doubtful or loss, and all TDRs are considered impaired and are analyzed individually to determine the amount of impairment. Circumstances such as construction delays, declining real estate values, and the inability of the borrowers to make scheduled payments have resulted in these loan relationships being classified as impaired. FNCB utilizes the fair value of collateral method for collateral-dependent loans and TDRs for which repayment depends on the sale of collateral. For non-collateral-dependent loans and TDRs, FNCB measures impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate. With regard to collateral-dependent loans, appraisals are received at least annually to ensure that impairment measurements reflect current market conditions. Should a current appraisal not be available at the time of impairment analysis, other valuation sources including current letters of intent, broker price opinions or executed agreements of sale may be used. Only downward adjustments are made based on these supporting values. Included in all impairment calculations is a cost to sell adjustment of approximately 10%, which is based on typical cost factors, including a 6% broker commission, 1% transfer taxes and 3% various other miscellaneous costs associated with the sales process. Sales costs are periodically reviewed and revised based on actual experience. The ALLL analysis is adjusted for subsequent events that may arise after the end of the reporting period but before the financial reports are filed.
The ALLL equaled $11.9 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $3.0 million, or 33.5%, from $8.9 million at December 31, 2019. The increase resulted from a provision for loan and lease losses of $1.9 million coupled with net recoveries of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in the ALLL was primarily related to economic disruption and uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Management adjusted the qualitative factors for the potential effect of economic and employment uncertainty and disruption due to the global pandemic into its evaluation.
The ALLL consists of both specific and general components. The component of the ALLL that is related to impaired loans that are individually evaluated for impairment, the guidance for which is provided by ASC 310 “Impairment of a Loan” (“ASC 310”), was $416 thousand, or 3.5%, of the total ALLL at December 31, 2020, compared to $473 thousand, or 5.3%, of the total ALLL at December 31, 2019. A general reserve of $11.5 million was established for loans analyzed collectively under ASC 450 “Contingencies” (“ASC 450”), which represented 96.5% of the total ALLL of $11.9 million at December 31, 2020. Included in the general component of the ALLL at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were unallocated reserves of $1.1 million and $426 thousand, respectively. Based on its evaluations, management may establish an unallocated component to cover any inherent losses that exist as of the evaluation date, but which may not have been identified under the methodology. The increase in the unallocated reserve was directly related to the increase in credit provisioning due to the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on these circumstances, management believes the increase and level of the unallocated reserve to be appropriate at December 31, 2020. The ratio of the ALLL to total loans at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 was 1.33% and 1.08%, respectively, based on loans, net of net deferred loan costs and unearned income of $901.1 million and $828.5 million, respectively.
The following table presents an allocation of the ALLL by major loan category and percent of loans in each category to total loans at December 31, for each of the last five years:

Reconciliation of the ALLL
Other Real Estate Owned
At December 31, 2020, there was one piece of commercial land with an aggregate carrying value of $58 thousand held in OREO, compared to two properties with an aggregate balance of $289 thousand at December 31, 2019. The two properties that were held as of December 31, 2019, included the piece of commercial land and a single family residential real estate property with carrying values of $85 thousand and $204 thousand, respectively. FNCB recorded a valuation adjustment to the carrying value of the piece of commercial land of $27 thousand in the third quarter of 2020. The residential real estate property, which was the collateral supporting an investor-owned residential mortgage loan, was sold in 2020. The agreement with the investor requires FNCB to take title of the property upon foreclosure and liquidate the property on behalf of the investor after foreclosure. FNCB did not realize any gain or loss upon the sale.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, there were five sales of properties with an aggregate carrying value of $0.8 million. Net gains realized on the sale of these properties was $20 thousand. Net gains on the sale of OREO properties were included in non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019.
FNCB actively markets OREO properties for sale through a variety of channels including internal marketing and the use of outside brokers/realtors. The carrying value of OREO is generally calculated at an amount not greater than 90% of the most recent fair market appraised value unless specific conditions warrant an exception. A 10% factor is generally used to estimate costs to sell, which is based on typical cost factors, such as 6% broker commission, 1% transfer taxes, and 3% various other miscellaneous costs associated with the sales process. This fair value is updated on an annual basis or more frequently if new valuation information is available. Deterioration in the real estate market could result in additional losses on these properties. Valuation adjustments related to OREO totaled $27 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $85 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, which are included in other operating expense in the consolidated statements of income.
The following table presents the activity in OREO for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Activity in OREO
The following table presents a distribution of OREO at December 31, for the past five years:
Distribution of OREO
The expenses related to maintaining OREO include the subsequent write-downs of the properties related to declines in value since foreclosure, net of any income received. OREO expenses amounted to $164 thousand and $231 thousand and are included in other operating expense in the consolidated statements of income, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Deposits
Management recognizes the importance of deposit growth as its primary funding source for loan products and regularly evaluates new products and strategies focused on growing commercial, consumer and municipal deposit relationships. FNCB experienced strong deposit demand in 2020, which was concentrated primarily in non-maturity deposits. The strong demand was generally caused by factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic including among others, various government stimulus initiatives, PPP funding, and changes in consumer and saving habits and business investment in response to economic uncertainty. FNCB did experience some deposit migration during 2020 as maturing time deposits were redirected into non-maturity deposits.
Total deposits in creased $285.7 million, or 28.5%, to $1.287 billion at December 31, 2020 from $1.002 billion at December 31, 2019 . Interest-bearing deposits increased $193.7 million, or 23.6%, to $1.016 billion at December 31, 2020 from $822.2 million at December 31, 2019 . In addition, non-interest-bearing demand deposits increased $92.0 million, or 51.3%, to $271.5 million at December 31, 2020 from $179.5 million at December 31, 2019 . The increase in non-interest-bearing deposits was due primarily to increases in consumer and small business demand deposit accounts, including residual balances retained from PPP loan funding. With regard to interest-bearing deposits, the increase was primarily concentrated in interest-bearing demand accounts, specifically money market transaction accounts, interest-bearing public funds and interest-bearing business checking accounts. In total, interest-bearing demand deposits increased $178.7 million, or 33.4%, to $713.4 million at December 31, 2020 from $534.7 million at December 31, 2019 . Time deposits with balances $250 thousand and over decreased $12.2 million, or 25.2%, to $36.2 million a t December 31, 2020 , from $48.4 million at December 31, 2019, while other time deposits increased $12.1 million, or 8.34%, to $156.7 million at December 31, 2020 from $144.6 million at December 31, 2019. Included in other time deposits was $20.0 million in brokered time deposits outstanding that are part of an interest rate swap transaction. Excluding brokered deposits, other time deposits would have contracted $7.9 million, or 5.5%. There were no brokered time deposits outstanding at December 31, 2019 .
Non-interest-bearing demand deposits averaged $78.0 million, or 47.5%, higher at $242.0 million in 2020 as compared to $164.0 million in 2019. Interest-bearing deposits averaged $908.5 million in 2020, an increase of $63.7 million, or 7.5%, compared to $844.8 million in 2019. The increase was concentrated in average interest-bearing demand deposits which increased $98.0 million, or 19.1% comparing 2020 and 2019. Average savings deposits increased $8.7 million, or 9.3%, to $101.8 million in 2020 from $93.1 million in 2019. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease of $43.0 million, or 18.1%, in average time deposits, to $195.1 million in 2020 from $238.1 million in 2019. FNCB’s deposit funding costs decreased 37 basis points, to 0.59% in 2020 from 0.96% in 2019. Rates on interest-bearing demand and time deposits decreased by 33 basis points and 38 basis points, respectively, while savings deposit rates decreased to a lesser extent, by 3 basis points to 0.10% comparing 2020 and 2019. The decrease in deposit costs reflected lower market interest rates and oversupply of bank liquidity in 2020.
The average balance of, and the rate paid on, the major classifications of deposits for the past three years are summarized in the following table:

Maturity Distribution of Time Deposits $100,000 or More
Borrowings
FNCB has an agreement with the FHLB which allows for borrowings, either overnight or term, up to a maximum borrowing capacity based on a percentage of qualifying loans pledged under a blanket pledge agreement. In addition to pledging loans, FNCB is required to purchase FHLB stock based upon the amount of credit extended. Loans that were pledged to collateralize borrowings under this agreement were $500.1 million at December 31, 2020 and $475.3 million at December 31, 2019. FNCB’s maximum borrowing capacity was $352.2 million at December 31, 2020. There was $75.0 million in letters of credit to secure municipal deposits outstanding at December 31, 2020 under this agreement. There were no overnight borrowings or term advances through the FHLB outstanding at December 31, 2020.
Advances through the Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window generally include short-term advances which are fully collateralized by certain pledged loans in the amount of $31.5 million under the Federal Reserve Bank’s Borrower-in-Custody (“BIC”) program. There were no advances under the BIC program outstanding at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. FNCB had available borrowing capacity of $16.4 million under this program at December 31, 2020.
The Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (“PPPLF”) was established by the Federal Reserve System on April 9, 2020 to provide participating lenders with liquidity to loan money under the PPP. PPPLF advances are collateralized by pools of PPP loans, have an interest rate of 0.35% and a maturity date equal to the term of the pool of PPP loans securing it. Repayment of PPP loans serving as collateral must be passed on to the Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window to pay down the corresponding PPPLF advance. At December 31, 2020, there were no PPPLF advances outstanding and FNCB had liquidity available of $58.3 million through this facility.
FNCB also had $10.3 million of junior subordinated debentures outstanding at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The interest rate on these debentures resets quarterly at a spread of 1.67% above the current 3-month LIBOR rate, currently 1.89% at December 31, 2020. The average interest rate paid on the junior subordinated debentures in 2020 was 2.43%, compared to 4.17% in 2019.
On September 1, 2009, FNCB offered only to accredited investors up to $25.0 million principal amount of unsecured subordinated debentures due September 1, 2019 (the "Notes"). The Notes had a fixed interest rate of 4.50%. On January 30, 2019, the Board of Directors of FNCB approved the acceleration of the final $5.0 million principal repayment on the Notes. The $5.0 million final payment, which was due and payable on September 1, 2019, was paid to Noteholders on February 8, 2019.
Average borrowed funds decreased $12.3 million, or 19.4%, to $51.3 million in 2020 from $63.6 million in 2019. The average rate paid on borrowed funds decreased 119 basis points to 1.47% in 2020 from 2.66% in 2019. The decrease in rate on borrowed funds was due to decreases in the rates paid for FHLB borrowings and junior subordinated debentures due to lower market interest rates for the majority of 2020.
See Note 8, “Borrowed Funds” of the Notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about FNCB's borrowed funds.
Liquidity
The term liquidity refers to the ability to generate sufficient amounts of cash to meet cash flow needs. Liquidity is required to fulfill the borrowing needs of FNCB’s credit customers and the withdrawal and maturity requirements of its deposit customers, as well as to meet other financial commitments. FNCB’s liquidity position is impacted by several factors, which include, among others, loan origination volumes, loan and investment maturity structure and cash flows, deposit demand and time deposit maturity structure and retention. FNCB has liquidity and contingent funding policies in place that are designed with controls in place to provide advanced detection of potentially significant funding shortfalls, establish methods for assessing and monitoring risk levels, and institute prompt responses that may alleviate a potential liquidity crisis. Management monitors FNCB’s liquidity position and fluctuations daily, forecasts future liquidity needs, performs periodic stress tests on its liquidity levels and develops strategies to ensure adequate liquidity at all times.
The statements of cash flows present the change in cash and cash equivalents from operating, investing and financing activities. Cash and due from banks and interest-bearing deposits in other banks, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, are FNCB’s most liquid assets. FNCB's liquidity position improved substantially in 2020, as an influx of cash from financing and operating activities were only partially offset by cash outflows used in investing activities. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $155.8 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $121.2 million from $34.6 million at December 31, 2019.
Financing activities provided $234.4 million in net cash, which resulted primarily from a $285.7 million net increase in deposits in 2020. This increase was slightly offset by net cash used to repay FHLB of Pittsburgh term and overnight advances of $46.9 million and pay quarterly dividends totaling $4.4 million. Operating activities include net income, adjusted for the effects of non-cash transactions including, among others, depreciation and amortization and the provision for loan and lease losses, and is the primary source for the remaining funds from operations. In 2020 operating activities provided FNCB with $22.0 million in net cash, which reflected net income of $15.3 million and non-cash adjustments to income of $6.7 million.
Net cash outflows from investing activities used $135.2 million of cash and cash equivalents during the year ended December 31, 2020, which was largely due to funding of PPP loans, resulting in a net increase in loans to customers of $73.3 million. In addition, purchases of available-for-sale debt securities in 2020 utilized $152.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, which was partially offset by the cash proceeds received from the sale of available-for-sale debt securities of $68.3 million and from maturities, calls and principal payments of available-for-sale securities of $21.7 million.
Management is actively monitoring FNCB's liquidity position and capital adequacy in light of the changing circumstances related to economic uncertainty brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. While management believes FNCB's liquidity position is favorable, they are keenly aware that changes in economic conditions related to COVID-19, or in general, could pose potential stress on liquidity should deposits begin exiting the Bank or FNCB's asset quality deteriorates. Additionally, FNCB could experience an increase in the utilization of existing lines of credit as customers manage their own liquidity needs during this time of economic uncertainty. Management believes that FNCB’s liquidity position is sufficient to meet its cash flow needs as of December 31, 2020. FNCB generally utilizes core deposits as its primary source of liquidity. Core deposits include non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing demand deposits, savings deposits and other time deposits, net of brokered deposits and one-way purchased deposits generated through the IntraFiSM Network, which include time deposits issued under CDARs program and money market accounts issued through the ICS program. Participating in the IntraFiSM Network programs allows FNCB to service and attract potential high-balance deposits customers who want the security of full-FDIC insurance but want to maintain a local deposit relationship. Reciprocal deposits issued through the IntraFiSM Network program are considered to be core deposits.﻿ As of December 31, 2020, FNCB had approximately $24.6 million placed into the reciprocal program. In addition to cash and cash equivalents of $155.8 million, FNCB had ample sources of additional liquidity including approximately $276.0 million in available borrowing capacity with the FHLB of Pittsburgh, and available borrowing capacity through The Federal Reserve Discount Window of $58.3 million under the PPPLF and $16.4 million under the BIC program. In addition, FNCB had $47.0 million in federal fund lines of credit available through correspondent banks at December 31, 2020.
Capital
A strong capital base is essential to the continued growth and profitability of FNCB and is therefore a management priority. Management’s principal capital planning goals include: providing an adequate return to shareholders; retaining a sufficient base from which to provide for future growth, and complying with applicable regulatory standards. As more fully described in Note 14, “Regulatory Matters” to the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, regulatory authorities have prescribed specified minimum capital ratios as guidelines for determining capital adequacy to help assure the safety and soundness of financial institutions.
The following schedules present information regarding the Bank’s risk-based capital at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and selected other capital ratios:
FNCB’s total regulatory capital increased $15.8 million to $149.2 million at December 31, 2020 from $133.4 million at December 31, 2019. The Bank’s risk-based capital ratios exceeded the minimum regulatory capital ratios required for adequately capitalized institutions. Based on the most recent notification from its primary regulators, the Bank was categorized as well capitalized at December 31, 2020 and 2019. There are no conditions or events since this notification that management believes have changed this category.
As of December 31, 2020, FNCB had 29,754,351 shares of common stock available for future sale or share dividends. The number of shareholders of record at December 31, 2020 was 1,671. Quarterly market highs and lows, dividends paid and known market makers are highlighted in Part I, Item 5, “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For further discussion of FNCB’s capital requirements and dividend limitations, refer to Note 15, “Regulatory Matters,” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Additionally, FNCB has available 20,000,000 authorized shares of preferred stock. There were no preferred shares issued and outstanding at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
On January 27, 2021, FNCB's Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which up to 975,000 shares of FNCB's outstanding common stock may be acquired in the open market commencing no earlier than February 3, 2021 and expiring December 31, 2021 pursuant to a trading plan that was adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The shares will be purchased from time to time at prevailing market prices, through open market transactions depending upon market conditions. Repurchases under the repurchase program are administered through an independent broker and are subject to SEC regulations as well as certain price, market volume and timing constraints specified in the trading plan. Under the program, the purchases will be funded from available working capital presently available to FNCB, and the repurchased shares will be returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock. There is not a guarantee as to the exact number of shares that will be repurchased by FNCB, and FNCB may discontinue purchases at any time that management determines additional repurchases are no longer warranted. As of December 31, 2020, FNCB had approximately 20,245,649 million shares outstanding. As of February 28, 2021, 8,188 shares were repurchased at an average price of $6.81 per share.
On February 8, 2019, FNCB completed a public offering of its shares of common stock in a firm commitment underwritten offering and issued 3,285,550 shares of its common stock, which included 428,550 shares of common stock issued upon the exercise in full of the option to purchase additional shares granted to underwriters, at a public offering price of $7.00 per share, less an underwriting discount of $0.35 per share. FNCB received net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses of $21.3 million. Following the receipt of the proceeds during the first quarter of 2019, FNCB made a capital investment in FNCB Bank, it's wholly-owned subsidiary of $17.8 million.
FNCB’s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is largely dependent on the Bank’s ability to pay dividends to FNCB. Bank regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of the Bank’s regulatory agency. Cash dividends declared and paid by FNCB during 2020 and 2019 were $0.22 per share and $0.20 per share, respectively. FNCB offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase plan ("DRP") to its shareholders. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 dividend reinvestment shares were purchased in open market transactions. However, shares under the optional cash purchase feature of the DRP were issued from authorized but unissued common shares. Shares of common stock issued under the DRP totaled 10,271 and 7,369 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, on January 27, 2021, FNCB declared a $0.06 per share dividend payable on March 15, 2021 to shareholders of record on March 1, 2021.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In the ordinary course of operations, FNCB engages in a variety of financial transactions that, in accordance with GAAP, are not recorded in our consolidated financial statements or are recorded in amounts that differ from the notional amounts. These transactions involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate and liquidity risk. Such transactions may be used for general corporate purposes or for customer needs. Corporate purpose transactions would be used to help manage credit, interest rate and liquidity risk or to optimize capital. Customer transactions are used to manage customers' requests for funding.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, FNCB did not engage in any off-balance sheet transactions that would have or would be reasonably likely to have a material effect on its consolidated financial condition. For a further discussion of FNCB’s off-balance sheet arrangements, refer to Note 12, “Commitments, Contingencies, and Concentrations” to the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The following table presents off-balance financial instruments whose contractual amounts represent credit risk at December 31, 2020 and 2019. With the exception of credit availability for certain commercial construction, land acquisition and development loans having a 24-month draw period, all of the off-balance sheet financial instruments outstanding at December 31, 2020 expire within one year of their respective contract dates.
Off-Balance Sheet Commitments
In order to provide for probable losses inherent in these instruments, FNCB recorded reserves for unfunded commitments of $613 thousand and $703 thousand at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which were included in other liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial condition.
FNCB’s Finance unit proactively monitors the level of unused commitments against the available sources of liquidity from its investment portfolio, from deposit gathering activities as well as available unused borrowing capacity from the FHLB and the Federal Reserve. The Finance unit reports the results of its liquidity monitoring regularly to FNCB’s Asset and Liability Management Committee ("ALCO"), the Investment and Liquidity Committee, the Executive Management Committee and the Board of Directors.
