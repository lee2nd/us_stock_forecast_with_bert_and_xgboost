Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 should be read in conjunction with our Financial Statements and the notes to those Financial Statements that are included elsewhere in this Form 10-K and were prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. Our discussion includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth under the “Risk Factors,” “Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Description of Business” sections and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. We use words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “plan,” “project,” “continuing,” “ongoing,” “expect,” “believe,” “intend,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “predict,” and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business, our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these statements. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future.
In the below discussion, “we,” “our,” “us,” the “Company” and similar terms in this report, as well as references to “UMED” and “Greenway” all refer to Greenway Technologies, Inc., and our wholly-owned subsidiary, Greenway Innovative Energy, Inc., unless the context requires otherwise.
Greenway Technologies, Inc. is engaged in the research and development of proprietary gas-to-liquids syngas conversion systems and micro-plants that can be scaled to meet specific gas field production requirements. The company’s patented and proprietary technologies have been realized in its first commercial G-Reformer unit, a unique component used to convert natural gas into synthesis gas, which when combined with a Fischer-Tropsch reactor and catalyst, produces fuels including gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and methanol. G-Reformer units can be deployed to process a variety of natural gas streams including pipeline gas, associated gas, flared gas, vented gas, coal-bed methane and/or biomass gas. When derived from any of these natural gas sources, the liquid fuels created are incrementally cleaner than conventionally produced oil-based fuels. Greenway’s objective is to become a material direct and licensed producer of renewable GTL synthesized diesel and jet fuels, with a near term focus on U.S. market opportunities.
The Company believes that its proprietary G-Reformer is a major innovation in gas reforming and GTL technology in general. Initial tests have demonstrated that the Company’s solution appears to be superior to legacy technologies which are more costly, have a larger footprint and cannot be easily deployed at field sites to process associated gas, stranded gas, coal-bed methane, vented gas, or flared gas - all markets the Company seeks to service.
On April 28, 2020, the Company was issued a new U.S. Patent 10,633,594 B1 for syngas generation for gas-to-liquid fuel conversion. The Company has several other pending patent applications, both domestic and international, related to various components and processes involving our proprietary GTL methods, which when granted, will further complement our existing portfolio of issued patents and pending patent applications.
On December 8, 2020, the Company announced an exclusive worldwide patent licensing agreement with the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) for all patent applications currently filed with the Patent and Trademark Office relating to GWTI’s natural gas reforming technologies developed under its sponsored research agreement with UTA.
On December 15, 2020, the Company announced additional information regarding valuable outputs produced by the company’s proprietary G-Reformer™ catalyst reactor and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) technology which combine to form the “Greer-Wright” GTL solution. Originally developed to convert natural gas into ultra-clean synthetic fuel, recent research and development activity has shown that the technology can also allow the extraction of high-value chemicals and alcohols. The chemical outputs include n-Hexane, n-Heptane, n-Octane, n-Decane, n-Dodecane, and n-Tridecane. Alcohols produced include ethanol and methanol. The company has identified worldwide industrial demand for these outputs which will significantly improve the economic return on investment (ROI) of GTL plants that are based on GWTI’s technology. GWTI is a development-stage company with plans to continue its unique and patented technology.
Further, the Company believes its technologies and processes will allow for multiple small-scale GTL plants to be built with substantially lower up-front and ongoing costs resulting in more profitable results for O&G operators. In addition, the proprietary technology based around the G-Reformer is unique in that it also allows for transportable (mobile) GTL plants with a much smaller footprint as compared to legacy large-scale technologies. Greenway is in discussions with a number of oil and gas operators and other interested parties to license and obtain joint venture or other forms of capital funding to build its first third-party customer gas-to-liquid plant.
Mining Interest
In December 2010, UMED acquired the rights to approximately 1,440 acres of placer mining claims located on Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) land in Mohave County, Arizona for 5,066,000 shares of restricted Common A stock. Early indications, from samples taken and processed, provided reason to believe that the potential recovery value of the metals located on the 1,440 acres is significant, but only actual mining and processing will determine the ultimate value which may be realized from this property holding. The Company is currently exploring strategic options to partner or sell its interest in this acreage, while it focuses on its emerging GTL technology sales and marketing efforts.
Going Concern
We remain dependent on outside sources of funding for continuation of our operations. Our independent registered public accounting firm issued a going concern qualification in their report dated April 14, 2021, which is included with our consolidated Financial Statements and raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
As of December 31, 2020, we had total liabilities in excess of assets by $8,844,210. Also, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we used net cash of $686,032 for operating activities. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
The Financial Statements included in our Form 10-K do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in existence. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient new cash flows to meet our obligations on a timely basis, to obtain additional financing as may be required, and/or ultimately to attain profitable operations. However, there is no assurance that profitable operations, financing, or sufficient new cash flows will occur in the future.
Our ability to achieve profitability will depend upon our ability to finance, manufacture, and market/operate GTL units. Our growth is dependent on attaining profit from our operations and our raising additional capital either through the sale of our Common Stock or borrowing. There is no assurance that we will be able to raise any equity financing or sell any of our products at a profit. We will be unable to pay our obligations in the normal course of business or service our debt in a timely manner throughout 2021 without raising additional debt or equity capital. There can be no assurance that we will raise additional debt or equity capital.
We are currently evaluating strategic alternatives that include (i) raising new equity capital and/or (ii) issuing additional debt instruments. The process is ongoing, lengthy and has inherent costs. There can be no assurance that the exploration of these strategic alternatives will result in any specific action to alleviate our 12-month working capital needs or result in any other transaction.
While we are attempting to commence operations and generate revenues, our cash position may not be significant enough to support our daily operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of an offering of our securities. Management believes that the actions presently being taken to further implement our business plan and generate revenues provide the opportunity for us to continue as a going concern. While we believe in the viability of our strategy to generate revenues and in our ability to raise additional funds, we may not be successful. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our capability to further implement our business plan and generate revenues.
Results of Operations
For Year Ended December 31, 2020 as Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019:
We had no revenues for consolidated operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. We reported consolidated net losses during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 of $2,541,972 and $3,661,245, respectively.
The following table summarizes consolidated operating expenses and other income and expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019:
Operating Expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2020, operating expenses decreased to $1,371,512, as compared to $2,429,431 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was due primarily to a $490,923 decrease in salaries and a $270,621 decrease in legal expense in 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. Major operating expense categories consisted of the following:
Salaries. During the year ended December 31, 2020, total salaries decreased to $530,000 as compared to $1,020,923 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease primarily reflects certain consultants becoming employees during 2019, which resulted in non-cash stock compensation expense of $420,000 in 2019, compared to $0 2020.
Consulting Fees. During the year ended December 31, 2020, consulting expense increased to $332,961, as compared to $251,377 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in reliance on the use of consultants for the development and production of the Company’s GTL technologies during 2020.
Professional Fees. During the year ended December 31, 2020, professional fees decreased to $0, as compared to $6,292 for the year ended December 31, 2109. Professional fees decreased due to elimination of certain prior vendors.
Travel Expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2020, travel expenses increased to $18,487, as compared to $11,120 in the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in travel expenses was due to increased air travel during the first quarter of 2020.
Legal Expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2020, legal expenses decreased to $206,796, as compared to $477,417 in the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in legal fees was due primarily to additional work completed in 2019 related to the dissident Shareholder actions and settlement of various matters compared to 2020.
Research and Development Costs. During the year ended December 31, 2020, research and development costs decreased to $30,000, as compared to $441,320 in the year ended December 31, 2019. The change was primarily due to the completion of the final stage of the last Sponsored Research Agreement (“SRA”) with the University of Texas at Arlington for development of the Company’s G-Reformer unit.
Interest Expense. During the year ended December 31, 2020, interest expense increased to $769,170, including interest to related parties of $562,890, as compared to $443,760 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to the increase in borrowings to fund operations and in the amortization of discounts on new convertible notes payable executed during the period.
Change in Fair Value of Derivative Liability and Derivative Expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a gain on the fair value of derivatives of $62,645, as compared to a loss of $64,899 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The change was due to the execution of the convertible notes payable in the first quarter, and the related changes under the derivative value calculations using the Cox, Ross & Rubinstein Binomial Tree model method, as well as the conversions of the convertible notes to equity which were completed during the fourth quarter of 2020.
Loss from Operations. Our net loss from operations decreased to $1,371,512 in the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $2,429,431 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was due primarily to the Company incurring $30,000 Research and Development expenses for the 2020 period, as compared to $441,320 for the same period of 2019; as well as a $490,923 decrease in salary expense for the 2020 period as compared to the same period in 2019.
Net Loss. Our consolidated net loss decreased to $2,541,972, or a negative $0.01 per basic and diluted earnings share for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $3,661,245, or a negative $0.01 per basic and diluted earnings share for the same period ended 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in Research and Development expenses, salary expenses and a non-recurring settlement expense of $765,000 during the period ended December 31, 2019. The weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock used in the earnings per share for the basic and dilutive computation was 312,854,191 for the year ended December 31, 2020, and 291,502,726 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We do not currently have sufficient working capital to fund our expected future operations. We cannot assure investors that we will be able to continue our operations without securing additional adequate funding. We had $1,628 in cash, total assets of $12,863, and total liabilities of $8,857,073 as of December 31, 2020. Total accumulated deficit at December 31, 2020, was ($33,021,801).
Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet all of its financial obligations. The following table provides certain selected balance sheet comparisons between December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019:
We are exploring various means to increase our working capital, including completing additional private stock sales and entering new debt instruments. In January 2020, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), with PowerUp Lending Group, Ltd., a Virginia corporation (“PowerUp”), that specializes in making funding commitments to small-cap public companies. PowerUp had agreed to provide up to $1,000,000 to us over a twelve (12) month period, subject to period determined stock price and trading attributes, and we borrowed $171,000 during the first quarter of 2020 under this from of Purchase Agreement. During the third and fourth quarters of 2020, the lenders converted the outstanding convertible notes to equity.
Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2020, was $686,032, as compared to $1,302,528 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Investing activities
Net cash used in investing activities for the year ending December 31, 2020 was $25,000, as compared to $387,847 for the year ended December 31, 2019, which consisted of advances made to OPMGE for deposits on a piece of specialized commercial equipment required to convert the Wharton, TX manufacturing facility for use of our GTL technology.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $696,617 for the year ended December 31, 2020, comprised of $155,000 in sales of our Common Stock, $171,000 in proceeds from convertible notes payable, $215,609 in proceeds from Notes - Related Parties, $270,008 received from Shareholder (Director) advances, less $115,000 of payments on notes payable related to legal settlements.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $1,633,207 for the year ended December 31, 2019, comprised of $360,000 in sales of our Common Stock, $1,302,188 in proceeds from Notes - Related Parties, $51,019 received from Shareholder (Director) advances, less $80,000 of payments on notes payable related to legal settlements.
Our accompanying Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Our general business strategy is to first develop our GTL technology to maintain our basic viability, while seeking significant development capital for full commercialization. As shown in the accompanying Financial Statements, we have incurred an accumulated deficit of $33,021,801 and $30,479,829 as of December 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Our ability to continue as a going concern is in doubt and dependent upon achieving a profitable level of operations and on our ability to obtain necessary financing to fund ongoing operations.
Commitments
Capital Expenditures
The last funded Scope of Work (“SOW”) under our SRA with UTA was completed in the year ended December 2019, with payments made of $120,000 to complete the work described in the prior SOW. As we move into the testing and commercialization phase of our GTL technology, we plan to update and enter into a new SOW with UTA for periods in 2021. This is anticipated to entail a financial commitment of approximately $257,000 for a full twelve-month research cycle, which we have been told can be payable in four equal installments of $64,250. However, we shall only execute such new SOW and notice UTA to start such work when we have funds available to make such payments. As described elsewhere herein this Report, we are working to raise sufficient capital to enter such new SOW, including from private stock sales, additional debt and payment from of our receivable with OPMGE. There is no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funds to enter into such new SOW.
Operational Expenditures
Employment Agreements
In August 2012, we entered into an employment agreement with Raymond Wright, for the position of president of GIE, for a term of five years with compensation of $90,000 per year. In September 2014, Mr. Wright’s employment agreement was amended to increase his annual pay to $180,000. By its terms, Mr. Wright’s employment agreement automatically renewed on August 12, 2019 and 2020, for a successive one-year periods.

Mr. Olynick elected not to renew his employment agreement and resigned as President on July 19, 2019. Upon his resignation, we agreed to pay the balance of his Employment Agreement then due and owing over time. Accordingly, we accrued $110,084 for the balance of his Employment Agreement, against which we have paid $35,000, leaving a balance remaining of $75,084 for the year ending December 2020. In addition, Mr. Olynick had previously entered into a consulting agreement (the “Olynick Agreement”) to provide general advisory services with us on April 18, 2019, and which included terms for payment of billable time at $40.00 per hour, plus approved expenses. The Olynick Agreement was terminated when Mr. Olynick became President of the Company on May 10, 2018. We have accrued $24,710 in expenses related to such prior consulting agreement expenses. See Exhibit 10.42 incorporated by reference herein.
Effective April 1, 2019, we entered into an employment agreement with Thomas Phillips, Vice President of Operations, for a term of 12 months with compensation of $120,000 per year. Mr. Phillips reports to the President of GIE. Pursuant to his employment agreement, Mr. Phillips is entitled to a no-cost grant of common stock equal to 4,500,000 shares of the Company’s Rule 144 restricted common stock, par value $.0001 per share, with such shares having been issued in February 2020. In addition, Mr. Phillips resigned from the Company effective December 15, 2020.

Mr. Turner is also entitled to certain additional stock grants based on our performance during the term of his employment and to participate in our benefit plans, when and if such plans become available. The foregoing summary of the Mr. Turner’s employment agreement is qualified in its entirety by its reference to the actual true and correct Employment Agreement by and between Ryan Turner and our Company, dated April 1, 2019, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.58 to this Form 10-K and incorporated by reference herein.
Consulting Agreements
On September 7, 2018, Wildcat, a company controlled by Shareholder Marshall Gleason, filed suit against us alleging claims arising from the Gleason Agreement, seeking to recover monetary damages, interest, court costs, and attorney’s fees. In a separate lawsuit, Wildcat filed suit claiming that the Company breached that certain Promissory Note dated on or about November 13, 2017, entered into between Wildcat as lender and Greenway as borrower, and as a result Wildcat initiated an action in County Court at Law No. 2 of Tarrant County, Texas, Cause No. 2018-006416-2. On March 6, 2019, we entered into a Rule 11 Agreement with Gleason settling both disputes, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.52 to this Form 10-K and incorporated by reference. Pursuant to the Rule 11 Agreement, the parties agreed to abate both cases until the earlier of a default of the performance of the Rule 11 Agreement or October 30, 2019, whichever be sooner. The Rule 11 Agreement provided that if we timely performed through October 15, 2019, the parties would file a joint motion for dismissal and present agreed orders of dismissal with prejudice for both lawsuits. The Company performed in all regards under the Rule 11 Agreement, however Gleason refused to sign the Wildcat Settlement Agreement at the point of the Company’s having performed its obligations. The parties’ respective counsels then mutually agreed to extend the original October 30, 2019 settlement date until at least the end of the year while the parties waited for Gleason’s signature. Gleason signed the Compromise Settlement and Release Agreement on February 4, 2020, and all litigation was dismissed by the Court on February 25, 2020. A copy of the Dismissal is incorporated by reference as Exhibit 10.59. Note 11 - Commitments and Contingencies to our Financial Statements.
Paul Alfano, a director and greater than five percent (5%) shareholder entered into a consulting agreement with us on April 19, 2018 via Alfano Consulting Services (the “Alfano Agreement”), to provide board and senior management advice, including but not limited to corporate strategy, SEC regulatory adherence, sales and marketing strategies, document and presentation preparation and fund-raising support. Terms included payment of billable time at $40.00 per hour, plus approved expenses, retroactive to January 1, 2017. A copy is available by Exhibit 10.44 incorporated by reference herein. The Alfano Agreement was terminated when Mr. Alfano became a director on June 26, 2019. The Company has accrued Consulting Fees and Expenses of $111,858 for all prior periods through the year ending December 31, 2020. There is no payment schedule agreed to by the parties, and such accrued expenses will be paid only when the Company has sufficient liquidity to make such payment, or unless or until the parties agree to some other form of payment provision.
On October 19, 2020, the Company entered into a management consulting services agreement with Dean Goekel (the “Goekel Agreement” via “Analytical Professionals”), to manage engineering and vendor relationships, assist in defining the design and cost of certain capital equipment and to manage the direction of research, development and other related engineering activities. Mr. Goekel will also support the Company’s ongoing business operations, including assistance in commercialization and market implementation, strategic planning and other services. The agreed upon start date under the agreement is July 1, 2020 and the minimum engagement term was for six (6) months. After the initial term the agreement automatically renews for subsequent six (6) month terms unless the Company or Mr. Goekel terminates the agreement. Under the agreement, in exchange for Mr. Goekel’s services he will receive a minimum monthly fee of $10,000 per month in deferred compensation until such time that adequate funds are available for payment. As of December 31, 2020, we have accrued $60,000 in compensation expense related to this agreement. Additionally, under the agreement Mr. Goekel was issued stock warrants for 3,000,000 shares at a strike price of $0.03 per share effective July 1, 2020 and expiring on June 30, 2022. The Company recognized valued and recognized compensation expense related to these warrants of $25,137 for the year ended December 31, 2020. After meeting certain deliverables set forth in the agreement, Mr. Goekel will be issued stock warrants for 1,000,000 shares at a strike price that is an average of the stock price for the 90 days that the deliverables have been met.
Other
Pursuant to the GIE Acquisition Agreement in August 2012, we agreed to: (i) issue an additional 7,500,000 shares of Common Stock when the first portable GTL unit is built and becomes operational, and is capable of producing 2,000 barrels of diesel or jet fuel per day, and (ii) pay a 2% royalty on all gross production sales on each unit placed in production, or one percent (1%) each to the founders and previous owners of GIE. On February 6, 2018, and in connection with a settlement agreement dated April 5, 2018, by and between the Greer Family Trust and us, which is the successor in interest one of the founders and prior owners of GIE, F. Conrad Greer (“Greer”), (the “Trust”, and such settlement agreement the “Trust Settlement Agreement”), we issued 3,000,000 shares of Common Stock and a convertible promissory note for $150,000 to the Trust in exchange for: (i) a termination of the Trust’s right to receive 3,750,000 shares of Common Stock in the future and 1% of the royalties owed to the Trust under the GIE Acquisition Agreement; (ii) the termination of Greer’s then current employment agreement with GIE; and (iii) the Trust’s waiver of any future claims against us for any reason. A copy of the Trust Settlement Agreement and related promissory note dated April 5, 2018, by us in favor of the Trust is filed as Exhibit 10.36 to this Form 10-K and incorporated by reference herein.
As a result of the transactions consummated by the Trust Settlement Agreement, we are committed to issue a reduced number of 3,750,000 shares of Common Stock and 1% of the royalties due on production of our GTL operational units to Ray Wright, the other founder and prior owner of GIE, pursuant to the GIE Acquisition Agreement.
Mining Leases
We have a minimum commitment during 2020 of approximately $11,880 for our annual lease maintenance fees due to Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) for the Arizona Property with such payment completed by the Company on August 31, 2020. There is no actual lease agreement with the BLM, but we file an annual maintenance fee form and pay fees to the BLM to hold our claims. The next payment will be due on September 1, 2021.

See Note 6 - Notes Payable and Convertible Notes Payable to our Financial Statements.
Seasonality
We do not anticipate that our business will be affected by seasonal factors.
Impact of Inflation
While we are subject to general inflationary trends, including for basic manufacturing production materials, our management believes that inflation in and of itself does not have a material effect on our operating results. However, inflation may become a factor in the future. However, the COVID-19 virus and its current extraordinary impact on the world economy has reduced oil consumption globally, decreasing crude oil prices, to levels not seen since the early 1980’s. The economics of GTL conversion rely in part on the arbitrage between oil and natural gas prices, with economic models for many producers, including our own models, using a range of $30-60/bbl (for WTI or Brent Crude as listed daily on the Nymex and ICE commodities exchanges) to determine relative profitability of their GTL operations. While the COVID-19 virus may run its human course in the near term, we believe (as many others in the U.S. government and media believe), that the economic impacts will be long lasting and for all practical matters, remain largely unknown at this time.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
During the year ended December 2019, we entered into a revenue interest research and development venture with Mabert and an employee, Tom Phillips, OPMGE. We account for our participation under the Equity Method, as further defined herein below, whereby we may be subject to future gains and losses that are reasonably likely to have an effect on our reported results of operations and liquidity. We are not required to invest, participate in any of the ongoing costs, financing or capital expenditures made by OPMGE. Since inception of this arrangement, we have advanced a total of $412,885 to OPMGE, and accordingly, had accrued a receivable from OPMGE. We have evaluated this receivable and have determine that collectability is uncertain. Accordingly, the Company has fully reserved the full amount of this equity method receivable with OPMGE as of December 31, 2020. Since this was a receivable and not an investment in OPMGE, this allowance expense was included as a reserve for equity method receivable investment in the statement of operations as of December 31, 2020.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our Financial Statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). Preparing our Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies include revenue recognition and impairment of long-lived assets.
We recognize revenue in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, “Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements.” Sales will be recorded when products are shipped to customers. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments will be provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded.
We evaluate our long-lived assets for financial impairment on a regular basis in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” which evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets not held for sale by measuring the carrying amount of the assets against the estimated discounted future cash flows associated with them. At the time such evaluations indicate that the future discounted cash flows of certain long-lived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets, the assets are adjusted to their fair values.
We believe that the critical accounting policies discussed below affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as guidance on the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers in May 2014 with amendments in 2015 and 2016. Revenue recognition will depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance also requires disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The guidance permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the cumulative catch-up transition method). We adopted the guidance on January 1, 2018 and applied the cumulative catch-up transition method. The transition adjustment to be recorded to stockholders’ deficit upon adoption of the new standard did not have a material effect upon the consolidated financial statements. The Company has not, to date, generated any revenues.
Equity Method Investment
On August 29, 2019, we entered into a research and development venture, OPMGE, with Mabert and an employee, Tom Phillips. We contributed a limited license to use our proprietary and patented GTL technology and a working G-Reformer refractory unit, for no actual cost basis, in exchange for 300 membership units in OPMGE, equating to an approximately a 42.8% current interest in OPMGE, pending the expected issuance of an additional 300 membership units, equating to a net 30% ownership interest in OPMGE at that time. There was not previously and is no book or asset value attributed to the contributed technology. We evaluated our interest in OPMGE and determined that we do not control OPMGE. We account for our interest in OPMGE via the equity method of accounting. To our knowledge, at December 31, 2020, OPMGE had no material business activity as of such date. As described in “Note 9 - Related Party Transactions” to our Financial Statements herein below, we maintain a related party receivable from OPMGE related to advances made to assist in certain capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has fully reserved the full amount of this equity method receivable with OPMGE.
Stock-Based Compensation
Accounting Standard 718, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (“ASC 718”) established financial accounting and reporting standards for stock-based employee compensation plans. It defines a fair value-based method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity instrument. In January 2006, we implemented ASC 718, and accordingly, we account for compensation cost for stock option plans in accordance with ASC 718. We account for share-based payments to non-employees in accordance with ASC 505-50 “Accounting for Equity Instruments Issued to Non-Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services”.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of our Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our Financial Statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ materially from the estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of 3-months or less to be cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents at December 31, 2020, or December 31, 2019. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to “dollars” in this Form 10-K are to U.S. dollars.
Income Taxes
We account for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC 740, “Income Taxes,” which requires that we recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect in the years the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred income tax benefit (expense) results from the change in net deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some or all deferred tax assets will not be realized.
We have adopted the provisions of FASB ASC 740-10-05, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (“ASC 750-10-05”). ASC 750-10-05 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Additionally, ASC 750-10-05 provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. Open tax years, subject to IRS examination include 2014 - 2019.
Net Loss per Share, Basic and Diluted
We have adopted Accounting Standards Codification Subtopic 260-10, Earnings per Share, specifying the computation, presentation and disclosure requirements of earning per share information. Basic loss per share has been computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares issued and outstanding for the period. In 2020, shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of warrants (7,000,000), shares of Common Stock convertible for debt (0) and shares of Common Stock outstanding but not yet issued (537,762) have been excluded as a Common Stock equivalent in the diluted loss per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company accounts for derivative instruments in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”), which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. ASC 815 requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value.
If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as a hedge, the objective of which is to match the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging derivative with the recognition of (i) the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk or (ii) the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transaction. For a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument, the gain or loss is recognized in income in the period of change.
Concentration and Credit Risk
Financial instruments and related items, which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, and trade receivables. We place our cash and temporary cash investments with high -credit quality institutions. At times, such investments may be in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limit.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In September 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-10, “Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation.” ASU No. 2014-10 removes all incremental financial reporting requirements from GAAP for development stage entities, including the removal of Topic 915 from the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. In addition, ASU 2014-10 adds an example disclosure in Risks and Uncertainties (Topic 275) to illustrate one way that an entity that has not begun planned principal operations could provide information about the risks and uncertainties related to our current activities. Furthermore, the update removes an exception provided to development stage entities in Consolidations (Topic 810) for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity-which may change the consolidation analysis, consolidation decision, and disclosure requirements for a company that has an interest in a company in the development stage. The update is effective for the annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, including interim periods therein. Early application with the first annual reporting period or interim period for which the entity’s financial statements have not yet been issued (Public business entities) or made available for issuance (other entities). We adopted this pronouncement as of January 1, 2019.
FASB’s new lease accounting standard, Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), as provided by FASB in ASU No. 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements, whereby we would recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption, will be applied to any new leases we enter into where this standard would otherwise apply. We do not have any lease agreements where such lease accounting standards would apply.
Impact of New Accounting Standards
We have reviewed all other recently issued, but not yet adopted, accounting standards in order to determine their effects, if any, on our results of operation, financial position or cash flows. Based on that review, we believe that none of these pronouncements are expected to have a significant effect on our Financial Statements.
Subsequent Events
On August 15, 2019, the Company issued a note to Southwest Capital Funding, Ltd. The note was issued in connection with a settlement agreement relating to a guarantee by the Company of a note payable to Southwest Capital Funding, Ltd. The note is in the amount of $525,000. Under its terms, interest is payable semiannually and the principal is due on August 15, 2022. Since the note was issued, two semiannual payments of interest have been paid. The third was due on February 15, 2021. The Company has not paid that payment, which resulted in a default on the loan.
In February 2021, the Company was issued Patent 10,907,104, the fourth patent relating to the company’s proprietary G-Reformer™ technology which allows for the conversion of natural gas into synthesis gas. The newly issued patent extends the methods and details of generating syngas using the apparatus described in a previously issued patent No. 10,633,594, the company’s third patent. As described in the patent, methane, oxygen, and steam are continuously injected into the combustion section of the apparatus to generate carbon monoxide along with unreacted methane and steam. The carbon monoxide, unreacted methane, and steam then enter the catalyst chamber where these components react to generate syngas. The pressure inside the reaction vessel is controlled at no higher than 5 psig.
Through the period ended March 31, 2021, we received $142,934 in cash and payment advances from Kevin Jones, a director and greater than 5% shareholder. Such advances and any further advances received will be accrued as “Advances - related parties” in the period received.
