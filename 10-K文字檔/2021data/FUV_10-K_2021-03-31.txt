Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, should be read together with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. The following discussion contains “forward-looking statements” that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors. We caution that assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions or beliefs about future events may, and often do, vary from actual results and the differences can be material. Please see “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
Overview
Arcimoto’s mission is to catalyze the shift to a sustainable transportation system. Since our incorporation, we have been engaged primarily in the design, development, manufacture, sale and rental of ultra-efficient three-wheeled electric vehicles. Arcimoto’s fundamental thesis: there is disconnect between the size and efficiency of a car (~4,000 pounds of material that can carry 5 to 7 people) and how people use cars on a daily basis (1 or 2 passengers driving an average of 30 miles a day with cargo). Arcimoto, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Oregon on November 21, 2007.
was a watershed year for the Company, which saw us complete compliance testing required to produce and sell retail vehicles; outfit the scalable, automated, vertically-integrated Arcimoto Manufacturing Plant for retail production; begin retail production of the Fun Utility Vehicle (FUV); develop our post-production programs including service, support, recall and supplier quality management; and deliver first vehicles to our first rental franchisee in Key West, Florida. We also expanded our product portfolio offering with the announcement of the Rapid Responder and Deliverator platform concepts targeted at fleet verticals.
Retail production began on September 19, 2019. In total, Arcimoto produced 57 model year 2019 vehicles, 46 of which were delivered to customers by December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, Arcimoto produced 117 model year 2020 vehicles, and delivered 97 vehicles to customers.
In March 2020, Arcimoto launched production pilots of the Rapid Responder and Deliverator product lines. In September 2020, the Company on-roaded its fourth product concept, the Cameo. In November 2020, the Company unveiled its fifth product concept, the Arcimoto Roadster prototype.
For portions of all four quarters of 2020, Arcimoto’s production operations were suspended in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company restarted limited production and resumed deliveries to customers in the third quarter.
The Company’s focus is now squarely on volume production planning in order to push to sustainable profitability and fulfill the thousands of pre-orders in our queue, as well as to meet the demand generated by our pilot fleet vehicles in the field. In December 2020, the Company entered into a purchase agreement for an approximately 220,000 square foot facility, which is scheduled to close on April 19, 2021, to expand production capabilities. The Company is currently preparing an application for the Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program to secure the funds necessary to execute our growth strategy.
Management Opportunities, Challenges and Risks
Demand, Production and Capital
Demand for the Retail Series Arcimoto FUV has continued to increase. As of December 31, 2020, we had 4,717 net FUV pre-orders placed with small refundable deposits or fleet order commitments, representing an increase of 520, or approximately 12%, from the 4,197 pre-orders as of December 31, 2019.
We consider pre-orders to be strong sales leads, and use these leads as an indicator of market demand. Pre-orders are made up of small refundable cash deposits from individual retail customers and distribution agreements or nonbinding letters of intent from commercial customers that may or may not have deposited cash. The distribution of pre-orders as of December 31, 2020, is presented in the table below:
In the third quarter of 2019, we completed vehicle testing. Arcimoto tested to verify robustness of its vehicle design, to demonstrate compliance with all Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards required for motorcycles, and to demonstrate proper function of voluntarily-added equipment such as the FUV’s 3+3 seat belts. Following completion of compliance testing, we initiated the sales process with our first customers. As sales are completed, pre-order and reservation fees are applied to the purchase price and balances due are collected on delivery.
We temporarily suspended production in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Though conditions in Lane County worsened over the course of the year, we resumed limited production in the second quarter of 2020, implementing significant safety measures. We resumed customer deliveries in the third quarter of 2020.
With limited FUV production through 2020 and now extending into 2021, we are focusing on pilot programs for the Deliverator and Rapid Responder , performing value engineering and planning for volume manufacture to achieve sustainable profitability, applying to the Federal Department of Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program (“ATVMLP”) to finance OEM volume production, engaging sales efforts focused on fleet deployments, building and testing our rental operations, and expanding our service network.
The average sales price, including custom upgrade options, for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $22,135, $2,615 or 13.4% above the starting price. We began taking $5,000 non-refundable reservations for the Fun Utility Vehicle in the first quarter of 2019 with a starting price point of $19,900. We secured non-refundable reservations for the first 100 FUVs in anticipation of initial retail production and delivery. In the last week of September 2019, we delivered the first two FUVs. In the third quarter of 2020, we began taking $2,500 non-refundable deposits for the second 100 FUV’s with a starting price point of $17,900. In total, Arcimoto produced 57 model year 2019 FUVs, 46 of which were delivered to customers by December 31, 2019. An additional 97 model year 2019 and 2020 FUVs were delivered to customers during the year ended December 31, 2020.
We have contracted with a lean design consultant to evaluate Arcimoto’s manufacturing processes and supply chain management in order to drive down costs and begin high-volume production of Arcimoto ultra-efficient electric vehicles. To date, substantial progress has been made understanding the cost models for future vehicles based on the current supply chain condition, ergo studies, FMEA, baseline ride-drive characteristics, mapping out EU certification, cost down for manufacturing, lean manufacturing analysis and the technology roadmap for future vehicles and marketing roadmap.
Arcimoto’s test of the Rapid Responder in a pilot program with the City of Eugene, the Eugene-Springfield Fire Department (ESFD), is scheduled to end on March 31, 2021. We are evaluating upfitters and defining the process for installation of non-compliant accessories such as lights and sirens and we released pricing and availability for the Rapid Responder in the first quarter of 2021.
We have several ongoing Deliverator pilot programs with individuals, municipalities, and corporate fleets. We have completed the first phase of tool-up for manufacture and production of the Deliverator, and we will continue to build Deliverators in low volume through the remainder of 2021, with the intent to deliver them to new pilot programs.
On September 26, 2020, Arcimoto introduced the beta Configurator, a web tool for selecting vehicle options and visualizing the final configured product. We subsequently opened $2,500 non-refundable reservations for production FUVs through the end of the year to pre-order customers in Washington, California, and Oregon, with a new starting price of $17,900, and many more configurable options than our previous offering. Average sales price as configured for the first 113 reservations is $21,893.
On February 4, 2021, the Company closed and completed the Asset Purchase Agreement with Tilting Motor Works, Inc. (“TMW”). The Company believes the TMW product line will continue to flourish under Arcimoto, as we are able to bring considerable marketing and manufacturing efforts to bear, and the underlying technology will be beneficial to future Arcimoto products. Authorized dealer/installers of the TMW products are potential partners for providing product support services to FUV owners in certain areas.
Trends in Cash Flow, Capital Expenditures and Operating Expenses
In 2019, Arcimoto generated cash flow from retail production vehicle sales for the first time. Cash inflow from vehicle sales has been substantially reduced following the suspension of production due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Our capital expenditures for low-volume production are substantially complete. We are bringing the thermo forming of body panels inhouse and ordered approximately $1,741,000 in equipment for this. Approximately $1,150,000 of this amount has been financed at interest rates ranging from 5.56% to 9.0% and terms of 60-72 months. We anticipate a savings of $780 per FUV produced with this automation. We are purchasing a multi-directional rotary brush machine at a total cost of $142,200 to automate the deburr and finishing of metal parts. This was financed at an interest rate of 9.86% and term of 60 months. We are purchasing an additional mill at a total cost of $173,860 to increase parts machining production capacity. This was financed at an interest rate of 4.11% for 60 months. We are purchasing an additional welding cell at a total cost of $286,674 for welding the sides of the upper frame together, and a wire bonding machine at a cost of $211,524 for next generation battery module production. We anticipate securing low interest debt for these equipment purchases. We anticipate a savings of $390 per FUV produced with the welding automation. The Company is preparing an ATVMLP application to finance OEM volume production.
Operating expenses decreased by approximately 9%, or $1,191,000, for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was due to manufacturing overhead being allocated to cost of goods sold with the start of production in September 2019. The number of employees increased by approximately 40%, from 95 as of December 31, 2019 to 133 employees as of December 31, 2020. The increased staff was needed to build out all parts of the Company for selling and servicing vehicles.
New Accounting Pronouncements
For a description of our critical accounting policies and estimates, please refer to the “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in Note 2 to the Financial Statements beginning at page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Disclosure About Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any outstanding derivative financial instruments, off-balance sheet guarantees, interest rate swap transactions or foreign currency forward contracts. Furthermore, we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. We do not have any variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit support to us or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. See Note 2 to our Financial Statements.
Inventory Valuation
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are reserved to reduce the carrying value to net realizable value.
We also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.
Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material increases to this reserve may be required. A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.
Warranties
We provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles we sell for the lesser of three years or thirty-six thousand miles. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls when identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales, and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is in current portion of warranty reserve, while the remaining balance is in warranty reserve on the consolidated balance sheets. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations.
Stock-Based Compensation
We use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted to employees and for our employee stock purchase plans (the “ESPP”) to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and on issuance for RSUs as these are issued at the end of each quarter for that quarters service. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period.
As we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in cost of revenues, research and development expense and selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
Income Taxes
We are subject to taxes in the U.S. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. We make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans. Tax laws, regulations and administrative practices may be subject to change due to economic or political conditions including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. The U.S. is actively considering changes in this regard. As of December 31, 2020, we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our net U.S. deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our U.S. deferred tax assets will not be realized. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted.
Results of Operations
Year ended December 31, 2020 versus year ended December 31, 2019
Revenues
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had revenues of approximately $2,176,000 and $988,000, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had revenue from the sale of our vehicles of approximately $2,040,000. We also had revenue of approximately $126,000 from merchandise and outside metal fabrication, and $10,000 from grants during the year ended December 31, 2020.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we had revenue from the sale of our vehicles of approximately $891,000, approximately $20,000 of which was with a related party. We also had revenue of approximately $2,000 from parts and service, approximately $45,000 from machining and metal work services, and approximately $50,000 from vehicle delivery charges and merchandise sales during the year ended December 31, 2019.
Cost of Goods Sold
We had approximately $8,251,000 in cost of goods sold (“COGS”), comprising approximately $4,773,000 in labor and overhead and underutilized factory capacity, $2,615,000 in FUV parts from the sale of our vehicles, approximately $24,000 in leased and used FUV sales cost, approximately $31,000 in FUV delivery cost, approximately $248,000 in service cost and warranty reserves, approximately $10,000 in COGS from merchandise and outside metal fabrication, and $550,000 for lower of cost or market reserves during the year ended December 31, 2020. We had approximately $2,911,000 in COGS for the year ended December 31, 2019 from FUV sales starting at the end of September 2019.
Operating Expenses
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development (“R&D”) expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our pre-production manufacturing, engineering and research teams, external lab testing costs, and prototyping materials expense. R&D expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were approximately $3,011,000 and $6,032,000, respectively. The primary reason for the decrease in R&D expenses of $3,021,000, or 50%, resulted from personnel costs allocated to manufacturing overhead costs, a reduction in pre-production material cost, a reduction in tools and equipment, a reduction in computer and software expense and a reduction in regulatory testing.
Sales and Marketing Expenses
Sales and marketing (“S&M”) expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were approximately $2,239,000 and $1,005,000, respectively. The primary reasons for the increase in sales and marketing expenses during the year ended December 31, 2020 of approximately $1,234,000, or 123%, as compared to the prior period was due to an increase in personnel and public relations, marketing and travel.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative (“G&A”) expenses consist primarily of personnel and facilities costs related to executives, finance, human resources, information technology, as well as legal fees for professional and contract services. G&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were approximately $6,091,000 as compared to $5,494,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of approximately $597,000, or 11%. The primary reasons for the increase in the current period was due to the increased cost of being a public company-investor relations, insurance, and professional fees.
Interest Expense
Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was approximately $721,000, as compared to $892,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in interest expense was due to paying off all non-equipment financing in June 2020. The interest expense includes amortization of a $300,000 six-month extension fee and $322,924 amortization of OID in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The OID was calculated using the relative fair value method taking into account the net proceeds after offering costs.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company has not achieved positive earnings and operating cash flows to enable the Company to finance its operations internally. Funding for the business to date has come primarily through the issuance of debt and equity securities. The Company may require additional funding to continue to operate in the normal course of business. The substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern has been alleviated based on management’s belief that current cash reserves will sustain operations in excess of 12 months.
Although the Company’s objective is to increase its revenues from the sales of its products sufficient to generate positive operating and cash flow levels, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in this regard. The Company may need to raise additional capital in order to fund its operations, which if needed, it intends to obtain through debt and/or equity offerings. Funds on hand and any follow-on capital, will be used to invest in our business to expand sales and marketing efforts, including Company-owned and franchise-rental operations and the systems to support them, enhance our current product lines by continuing research and development to enhance and reduce the cost of the FUV and to bring future variants to retail production, continue to build out and optimize our production facility, debt repayment, and fund operations until positive cash flow is achieved. The need for additional capital may be adversely impacted by uncertain market conditions or approval by regulatory bodies.
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $39,451,000 in cash and cash equivalents, representing an increase in cash and cash equivalents of approximately $33,619,000 from December 31, 2019. In June 2020 and into early July 2020, we raised approximately $15,473,000 of additional cash net of offering costs. In July 2020, we raised approximately $9,379,000 of additional cash net of offering costs. In November 2020, we raised approximately $28,095,000 of additional cash net of offering costs. We anticipate that our current sources of liquidity, including cash and cash equivalents, together with our current projections of cash flow from operating activities, will provide us with well in excess of 12 months of liquidity. The amount and timing of funds that we may raise is undetermined and could vary based on a number of factors, including our ongoing liquidity needs, our current capitalization, as well as access to current and future sources of liquidity. We continue to raise equity capital into 2021.
Since inception we have invested approximately $6,684,000 into tooling and manufacturing capital expenditures for our current FUV production facility. As we ramp up production, we may identify opportunities for reducing cost of goods sold that will require additional capital expenditures.
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash outflows to support the growth of our business in areas such as R&D, sales and marketing and G&A expenses. Our operating cash flows are also affected by our working capital needs to support personnel related expenditures, accounts payable, inventory purchases and other current assets and liabilities.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, cash used in operating activities was approximately $16,294,000, which included a net loss of approximately $18,120,000, non-cash charge related to depreciation and amortization of approximately $930,000, non-cash charge related to the amortization of debt discount of approximately $311,000, non-cash charge related to stock-based compensation of approximately $1,917,000, and changes in accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid inventory, other current assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, customer deposits, warranty reserve and deferred revenue of approximately $1,330,000, of which approximately $1,204,000 relates to inventory.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was approximately $14,291,000, which included a net loss of approximately $15,342,000, non-cash charge related to depreciation and amortization of approximately $710,000, non-cash charge related to the amortization of debt discounts of approximately $328,000, non-cash charge related to stock-based compensation of approximately $635,000, non-cash charge related to loss on scrapped Beta FUV finished goods inventory of approximately $147,000, non-cash charge related to the loss on disposal of property and equipment of approximately $710,000 and changes in accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid inventory, other current assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, customer deposits, warranty accrual and deferred revenue of approximately $1,481,000.
