Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Operations
Overview
Management’s Discussion and Analysis is provided to assist in the understanding and evaluation of Parkway Acquisition Corp’s. financial condition and its results of operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Parkway Acquisition Corp. (“Parkway” or the “Company”) was incorporated as a Virginia corporation on November 2, 2015. Parkway was formed as a business combination shell company for the purpose of completing a business combination transaction between Grayson Bankshares, Inc. (“Grayson”) and Cardinal Bankshares Corporation (“Cardinal”). On November 6, 2015, Grayson, Cardinal and Parkway entered into an agreement pursuant to which Grayson and Cardinal merged with and into Parkway, with Parkway as the surviving corporation (the “Cardinal merger”). The merger agreement established exchange ratios under which each share of Grayson common stock was converted to the right to receive 1.76 shares of common stock of Parkway, while each share of Cardinal common stock was converted to the right to receive 1.30 shares of common stock of Parkway. The exchange ratios resulted in Grayson shareholders receiving approximately 60% of the newly issued Parkway shares and Cardinal shareholders receiving approximately 40% of the newly issued Parkway shares. The Cardinal merger was completed on July 1, 2016. Grayson was considered the acquiror and Cardinal was considered the acquiree in the transaction for accounting purposes. Upon completion of the Cardinal merger, the Bank of Floyd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cardinal, was merged with and into Grayson National Bank (the “Bank’), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Grayson. Effective March 13, 2017, the Bank changed its name to Skyline National Bank.
On March 1, 2018, Parkway entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which Parkway acquired Great State Bank (“Great State”), based in Wilkesboro, North Carolina. The agreement provided for the merger of Great State with and into the Bank, with the Bank as the surviving bank (the “Great State merger”). The transaction closed and the merger became effective on July 1, 2018. Each share of Great State common stock was converted into the right to receive 1.21 shares of Parkway common stock. The Company issued 1,191,899 shares and recognized $15.5 million in surplus in the Great State merger. Parkway was considered the acquiror and Great State was considered the acquiree in the transaction for accounting purposes.
The Bank was organized under the laws of the United States in 1900 and now serves the Virginia counties of Grayson, Floyd, Carroll, Wythe, Montgomery and Roanoke, and the North Carolina counties of Alleghany, Ashe, Burke, Caldwell, Catawba, Cleveland, Davie, Watauga, Wilkes, and Yadkin, and the surrounding areas, through twenty-four full-service banking offices and two loan production offices. As an Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insured national banking association, the Bank is subject to regulation by the Comptroller of the Currency and the FDIC. Parkway is regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
For purposes of this annual report, all information contained herein as of and for periods prior to July 1, 2016 reflects the operations of Grayson prior to the Cardinal merger. Unless this report otherwise indicates or the context otherwise requires, all references to “Parkway” or the “Company” as of and for periods subsequent to July 1, 2016 refer to the combined company and its subsidiary as a combined entity after the Cardinal merger, and all references to the “Company” as of and for periods prior to July 1, 2016 are references to Grayson and its subsidiary as a combined entity prior to the Cardinal merger. All information contained herein as of and for periods prior to July 1, 2018 reflects the operations of Parkway prior to the Great State merger. Unless this report otherwise indicates or the context otherwise requires, all references to “Parkway” or the “Company” as of and for periods subsequent to July 1, 2018 refer to the combined company and its subsidiary as a combined entity after the Great State merger, and all references to “Parkway” or the “Company” as of and for periods prior to July 1, 2018 are references to Parkway and its subsidiary as a combined entity prior to the merger.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Parkway had net earnings of $5.9 million for 2020 compared to $7.2 million for 2019. Earnings in 2020 were impacted significantly by the COVID-19 pandemic and the branch expansion into North Carolina markets during 2020. Earnings for the year ended December 31, 2020 represented a return on average assets of 0.75% and a return on average equity of 7.06%, compared to 1.05% and 9.10%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019. The net interest margin was 3.96% in 2020, compared to 4.51% in 2019. The net interest margin compression is a reflection of the exceptionally low interest rate environment due to swift reductions in short term interest rates late in the first quarter of 2020 as well as continual competitive pressure on loan rates.
Forward Looking Statements
From time to time, the Company and its senior managers have made and will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements may be contained in this report and in other documents that the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such statements may also be made by the Company and its senior managers in oral or written presentations to analysts, investors, the media and others. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Also, forward-looking statements can generally be identified by words such as “may,” “could,” “should,” “would,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “seek,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan” and similar expressions.

By their nature, forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements speak only as of the date they are made. The Company does not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise after the date the forward-looking statements were made. There are a number of factors, many of which are beyond the Company’s control that could cause actual conditions, events or results to differ significantly from those described in the forward-looking statements. These factors, some of which are discussed elsewhere in this report, include:
●
any required increase in our regulatory capital ratios;
●
inflation, interest rate levels and market and monetary fluctuations;
●
the difficult market conditions in our industry;
●
trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including interest rate policies of the federal government;

●
the Company’s success at managing the risks involved in the foregoing.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Critical Accounting Policies
The Company’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). The notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2020 contain a summary of its significant accounting policies. Management believes the Company’s policies with respect to the methodology for the determination of the allowance for loan losses, and asset impairment judgments, such as the recoverability of intangible assets and other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities, involve a higher degree of complexity and require management to make difficult and subjective judgments that often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters. Accordingly, management considers the policies related to those areas as critical.
The allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in the loan portfolio. The allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting: the first of which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable, and the second, which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral, present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market, and the loan balance.
The allowance for loan losses has three basic components: (i) the formula allowance, (ii) the specific allowance, and (iii) the unallocated allowance. Each of these components is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual events occur. The formula allowance uses a historical loss view as an indicator of future losses and, as a result, could differ from the loss incurred in the future. However, since this history is updated with the most recent loss information, the errors that might otherwise occur are mitigated. The specific allowance uses various techniques to arrive at an estimate of loss. Historical loss information, expected cash flows and fair market value of collateral are used to estimate these losses. The use of these techniques is inherently subjective and our actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates. The unallocated allowance captures losses that are attributable to various economic events, industry or geographic sectors whose impact on the portfolio have occurred but have yet to be recognized in either the formula or specific allowance.

The variance in interest attributed to both volume and rate has been allocated to variance attributed to volume and variance attributed to rate in proportion to the absolute value of the change in each.
Net Interest Income
Net interest income, the principal source of Company earnings, is the amount of income generated by earning assets (primarily loans and investment securities) less the interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities (primarily deposits used to fund earning assets). Table 1 summarizes the major components of net interest income for the past three years and also provides yields and average balances.
For the year ended December 31, 2020 total interest income increased by $942 thousand compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in interest income in 2020 was primarily due to organic loan growth in new and existing markets of $44.6 million and $81.9 million of SBA-PPP loans originated in 2020; however, yields were negatively impacted by the exceptionally low interest rate environment due to swift reductions in short term interest rates late in the first quarter of 2020 as well as continual competitive pressure on loan rates. As a result interest income on loans increased by $1.6 million in 2020 compared to $4.6 million in 2019. Accretion of purchased loan discounts increased interest income by $1.2 million in 2020 compared to $1.8 million in 2019, representing a decrease of $592 thousand. The decreases in interest income on federal funds sold, investment securities, and interest-bearing deposits in banks were due to the impact of short term interest rates decreases discussed above. Interest expense on deposits increased by $495 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period last year due to the addition of $78.4 million in interest-bearing deposits from 2019 to 2020. A significant portion of the growth in interest-bearing deposits year-over-year is attributed to increased balances held by customers during the pandemic, new relationships developed from the SBA-PPP program, as well as organic growth in new and existing markets.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Amortization of premiums on acquired time deposits, which reduces interest expense, totaled $189 thousand in 2020, compared to $384 thousand in 2019, representing a decrease of $195 thousand. The effects of changes in volumes and rates on net interest income in 2020 compared to 2019, and 2019 compared to 2018 are shown in Table 2.
The aforementioned factors led to an increase in net interest income of $371 thousand or 1.33% for 2020 as compared to 2019. The net yield on interest-earning assets decreased by 55 basis points to 3.96% in 2020 compared to 4.51% in 2019.
Provision for Credit Losses
The allowance for credit losses is established to provide for expected losses in the Company’s loan portfolio. Management determines the provision for credit losses required to maintain an allowance adequate to provide for probable losses. Some of the factors considered in making this decision are the levels and collectability of past due loans, volume of new loans, composition of the loan portfolio, and general economic outlook.
The provision for loan losses was $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $655 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in loan loss provisions from 2019 to 2020 was due primarily to overall growth in the loan portfolio due to organic growth of $44.6 million in new and existing markets, excluding SBA-PPP loans originated, as well as management’s assessment of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on certain qualitative and environmental factors.
The allowance for loan losses for SBA-PPP loans originated during 2020 were separately evaluated given the explicit government guarantee. This analysis, which incorporated historical experience with similar SBA guarantees and underwriting, concluded the likelihood of loss was remote and therefore these loans were assigned a zero expected credit loss in the allowance for loan losses.
The reserve for loan losses at December 31, 2020 was approximately 0.74% of total loans, compared to 0.68% at December 31, 2019. Management’s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the acquired Great State and Cardinal loan portfolios was reflected as a purchase discount which will continue to be accreted into income over the remaining life of the acquired loans. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the remaining unaccreted discount on the acquired loan portfolios totaled $2.0 million and $3.2 million, respectively. Management believes the provision and the resulting allowance for loan losses are adequate. Additional information is contained in Tables 12 and 13, and is discussed in Nonperforming and Problem Assets.
Other Income
Noninterest income growth was a key factor in the Company’s 2020 financial results as year-over-year net interest margins were negatively impacted by the low interest rate environment, and the Fed’s lowering of rates paid on overnight funds. Noninterest income increased by $382 thousand in 2020 compared to 2019, despite the decrease of $211 thousand in service charges on deposit accounts, due to reduced consumer spending as well as increased balances held by our customers. Mortgage origination fees increased by $261 thousand in 2020 compared to 2019. The mortgage department closed approximately $43.5 million of mortgage loans for the secondary market during 2020 compared to $24.0 million in 2019. Gains from sales of available-for-sale securities totaled $315 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $49 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019. Noninterest income increased by $278 thousand in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was due to growth and expansion of fee-based products and a change in overdraft fees. Included in other income are nonrecurring gains from sale of bank premises and equipment totaling $122 thousand in 2019. There were no nonrecurring gains from sale of bank premises and equipment in 2020 or 2018.

Other Expense
The major components of noninterest expense for the past three years are illustrated at Table 4.
Total noninterest expenses increased by $1.8 million, or 7.91% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 reflecting additional costs associated with branching activities into new North Carolina markets. Salary and benefit cost increased by $1.4 million due to the increase in full time equivalent employees from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. Occupancy and equipment expenses increased by $287 thousand and data processing expenses increased by $219 thousand from 2019 to 2020, due to the addition of three branch facilities in 2020. FDIC/OCC assessments increased by $171 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 due to the Small Bank Assessment Credits received from the FDIC in 2019. This increase was offset by a decrease in amortization of core deposit intangibles of $111 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to same period in 2019.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Table 4. Sources of Noninterest Expense (dollars in thousands)
The overhead efficiency ratio of noninterest expense to adjusted total revenue (net interest income plus noninterest income) was 74.69% in 2020, 70.80% in 2019, and 79.03% in 2018. The ratio for 2018, without the effect of nonrecurring merger related costs, would have been 72.19%.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense is based on amounts reported in the statements of income (after adjustments for non-taxable income and non-deductible expenses) and consists of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes on temporary differences in the recognition of income and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. The deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future Federal income tax return consequences of those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled.
Income tax expense (substantially all Federal) was $1.4 million in 2020 and $1.8 million in 2019, resulting in effective tax rates of 19.8% and 19.9%, respectively. The decrease in income tax expense of $335 thousand in 2020 was primarily due to the decreased in income before taxes of $1.6 million in 2020 compared to 2019.
Net deferred tax assets of $1.0 million, and $985 thousand existed at December 31, 2020 and 2019 respectively. At December 31, 2020, net deferred tax assets included $155 thousand of deferred tax assets applicable to unrealized gains on investment securities available for sale, and $293 thousand of deferred tax assets applicable to unfunded projected pension benefit obligations. Accordingly, these amounts were not charged to income but recorded directly to the related stockholders’ equity account.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Analysis of Financial Condition
Average earning assets increased 15.18% from 2019 to 2020 due to asset growth primarily reflected in increased loans, including SBA-PPP loans, and higher liquid asset balances due to deposit growth. Total earning assets represented 91.02% of total average assets in 2020 and 90.77% in 2019. The mix of average earning assets changed from 2019 to 2020 as average loans increased by $86.1 million, or 15.70%, average investment securities decreased by $9.9 million, or 23.16%, average federal funds sold decreased by $8.8 million, or 93.21%, and deposits in other banks increased by $26.7 million of 139.80%.
Table 5. Average Asset Mix (dollars in thousands)
Average loans for 2020 represented 80.91% of total average assets compared to 80.32% in 2019. Average federal funds sold decreased from 1.38% to 0.08% of total average assets while deposits in other banks increased from 2.79% to 5.83% of total average assets over the same time period. Average investment securities decreased from 6.28% in 2019 to 4.20% of total average assets in 2020. The balances of nonearning assets to total average assets decreased from 9.23% to 8.98%.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Loans
Average loans totaled $634.8 million over the year ended December 31, 2020. This represents an increase of 15.70% from the average of $548.6 million for 2019. The increase was due to SBA-PPP loans originated in addition to organic growth in new and existing markets of $44.6 million during 2020. Of the $81.9 million in SBA-PPP loans originated in April through August 2020, approximately $52.5 million with net deferred fees of $1.4 million remained on the balance sheet at December 31, 2020. Average loans increased by 15.04% from 2018 to 2019 due to loans acquired from the Great State merger along with organic loan growth of $33.9 million during 2019.
The loan portfolio consists primarily of real estate and commercial loans, including SBA-PPP loans. These loans accounted for 96.97% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2020. This is up from the 95.91% that the two categories maintained at December 31, 2019. The amount of loans outstanding by type at December 31 of each of the past five years and the maturity distribution for variable and fixed rate loans as of December 31, 2020 are presented in Tables 6 and 7, respectively.
Table 6. Loan Portfolio Summary (dollars in thousands)
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Table 7. Maturity Schedule of Loans, as of December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands)
Interest rates charged on loans vary with the degree of risk, maturity and amount of the loan. Competitive pressures, money market rates, availability of funds, and government regulations also influence interest rates. On average, loans yielded 4.85% in 2020 compared to an average yield of 5.32% in 2019. The decrease in loan yields was due to increasing competition in our markets for loans, in addition to a generally lower interest rate environment and the low rate of SBA-PPP loans, as well as a reduction in the overall impact of purchase accounting adjustment as the accretion of purchase loan discounts decreased by $370 thousand during 2020.
Investment Securities
The Company uses its investment portfolio to provide liquidity for unexpected deposit decreases or loan generation, to meet the Bank’s interest rate sensitivity goals, and to generate income.
Management of the investment portfolio has always been conservative with the majority of investments taking the form of purchases of U.S. Treasury, U.S. Government Agencies, U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises and State and Municipal bonds, as well as investment grade corporate bond issues. Management views the investment portfolio as a source of income, and purchases securities with the intent of retaining them until maturity. However, adjustments are necessary in the portfolio to provide an adequate source of liquidity which can be used to meet funding requirements for loan demand and deposit fluctuations and to control interest rate risk. Therefore, from time to time, management may sell certain securities prior to their maturity. Table 8 presents the investment portfolio at the end of 2020 by major types of investments and contractual maturity ranges. Investment securities in Table 8 may have repricing or call options that are earlier than the contractual maturity date. Yields on tax exempt obligations are not computed on a tax-equivalent basis in Table 8.
The total amortized cost of investment securities decreased by approximately $46 thousand from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020, while the average balance of investment securities carried throughout the year decreased by approximately $9.9 million from 2019 to 2020. The average yield of the investment portfolio decreased to 2.30% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2.54% for 2019.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Table 8. Investment Securities - Maturity/Yield Schedule (dollars in thousands)
Deposits
The Company relies on deposits generated in its market area to provide the majority of funds needed to support lending activities and for investments in liquid assets. More specifically, core deposits (total deposits less certificates of deposit in denominations of $100,000 or more) are the primary funding source. The Company’s balance sheet growth is largely determined by the availability of deposits in its markets, the cost of attracting the deposits, and the prospects of profitably utilizing the available deposits by increasing the loan or investment portfolios. We believe that recent market conditions have resulted in depositors shopping for deposit rates more than in the past. An increased customer awareness of interest rates adds to the importance of rate management. The Company’s management must continuously monitor market pricing, competitor’s rates, and the internal interest rate spreads to maintain the Company’s growth and profitability. The Company attempts to structure rates so as to promote deposit and asset growth while at the same time increasing overall profitability of the Company.
Average total deposits for the year ended December 31, 2020 amounted to $684.5 million, which was an increase of $86.0 million, or 14.37% from 2019. A significant portion of the increase is attributed to increased balances held by customers during the pandemic, new relationships developed from the SBA-PPP program, as well as organic growth in new and existing markets. Average core deposits totaled $595.8 million in 2020 representing a 15.43% increase over the $516.2 million in 2019. The percentage of the Company’s average deposits that are interest-bearing decreased to 69.5% in 2020 compared to 73.1% in 2019 and 74.0% in 2018. This decrease is due to the average demand deposits, which earn no interest, increasing 29.64% from $160.9 million in 2019 to $208.5 million in 2020. Average deposits for the periods ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 are summarized in Table 9.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Table 9. Deposit Mix (dollars in thousands)
The average balance of certificates of deposit issued in denominations of $100,000 or more increased by $6.4 million, or 7.74%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019. The strategy of management has been to support loan and investment growth with core deposits and not to aggressively solicit the more volatile, large denomination certificates of deposit. Loan growth in 2020 was primarily funded through core deposit growth, in addition to reductions in investment securities, thus reducing management’s reliance on large denomination certificates of deposit for funding purposes. Table 10 provides maturity information relating to certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more at December 31, 2020.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Equity
Stockholders’ equity totaled $85.1 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $81.4 million at December 31, 2019. The increase of $3.7 million was due to earnings of $5.9 million, plus other comprehensive income of $403 thousand, less common stock repurchases of $1.0 million, and the payment of dividends of $1.6 million. Book value increased from $13.27 per share at December 31, 2019 to $14.08 per share at December 31, 2020.
Effective January 1, 2015, the federal banking regulators adopted rules to implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rules required the Bank to comply with the following minimum capital ratios: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6% of risk-weighted assets; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% of risk-weighted assets; and (iv) a leverage ratio of 4% of total assets. As fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the rules require the Bank to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% “capital conservation buffer” (which is added to the 4.5% common equity Tier 1 ratio, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%), (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% Tier 1 capital ratio, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%), (iii) a minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0% total capital ratio, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5%), and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets.
Under Basel III Capital requirements, a capital conservation buffer of 0.625% became effective beginning on January 1, 2016. The capital conservation buffer was gradually increased through January 1, 2019 to 2.50%. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banks are now required to maintain levels that meet the required minimum plus the capital conservation buffer in order to make distributions, such as dividends, or discretionary bonus payments. The Banks’s capital conservation buffer is 5.10% as of December 31, 2020.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Nonperforming and Problem Assets
Certain credit risks are inherent in making loans, particularly commercial and consumer loans. Management prudently assesses these risks and attempts to manage them effectively. The Bank attempts to use shorter-term loans and, although a portion of the loans have been made based upon the value of collateral, the underwriting decision is generally based on the cash flow of the borrower as the source of repayment rather than the value of the collateral. The Bank also attempts to reduce repayment risk by adhering to internal credit policies and procedures. These policies and procedures include officer and customer limits, periodic loan documentation review and follow up on exceptions to credit policies.
Nonperforming assets at December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, and 2016 are analyzed in Table 12.
Table 12. Nonperforming Assets (dollars in thousands)
Total nonperforming loans were 1.3% and 1.7% of total outstanding loans as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The majority of the decrease in nonaccrual loans from 2020 to 2019 came in the “commercial mortgage and farmland” categories. Nonaccrual loans in these categories decreased by $344 thousand. Loans are placed in nonaccrual status when, in management’s opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payments as they become due. When interest accrual is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed. Loans are removed from nonaccrual status when they are deemed a loss and charged to the allowance, transferred to foreclosed assets, or returned to accrual status based upon performance consistent with the original terms of the loan or a subsequent restructuring thereof. Management’s ability to ultimately resolve these loans either with or without significant loss will be determined, to a great extent, by general economic and real estate market conditions.
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, interest income recognized on loans in nonaccrual status was approximately $46 thousand and $47 thousand, respectively. Had these credits been current in accordance with their original terms, the gross interest income for these credits would have been approximately $210 thousand and $196 thousand, respectively for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Restructured loans represent troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) that have returned to accrual status after a period of performance in accordance with their modified terms. The decrease in restructured loans from 2019 to 2020 came primarily in the form of principal reductions. A TDR is considered to be successful if the borrower maintains adequate payment performance under the modified terms and is financially stable.
There were no foreclosed assets in 2020 and 2019. More information on nonperforming assets and loan modifications in response to COVID-19 can be found in Note 5 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” found in the company’s 2020 Annual Report.

As of December 31, 2020 and 2019 we had loans with a current principal balance of $15.1 million and $7.4 million rated “Watch” or “Special Mention”. The increase was due primarily to loan risk rating reclassifications as a result of loans that had a COVID-19 loan deferment. The “Watch” classification is utilized by us when we have an initial concern about the financial health of a borrower that indicate above average risk. We then gather current financial information about the borrower and evaluate our current risk in the credit. After this review we will either move the loan to a higher risk rating category or move it back to its original risk rating. Loans may be left rated “Watch” for a longer period of time if, in management’s opinion, there are risks that cannot be fully evaluated without the passage of time, and we want to review it on a more regular basis. Assets that do not currently expose the Bank to sufficient risk to warrant a classification such as “Substandard” or “Doubtful” but otherwise possess weaknesses are designated “Special Mention”. Loans rated as “Watch” or “Special Mention” are not considered “potential problem loans” until they are determined by management to be classified as “Substandard”. As of December 31, 2020, potential problem loans classified as substandard totaled $11.9 million compared to $13.4 million at December 31, 2019. Past due loans are often regarded as a precursor to further credit problems which would lead to future increases in nonaccrual loans or other real estate owned. As of December 31, 2020 loans past due 30-89 days and still accruing totaled $622 thousand compared to $1.1 million at December 31, 2019.
Certain types of loans, such as option ARM products, subprime loans and loans with initial teaser rates, can have a greater risk of non-collection than other loans. The Bank has not offered these types of loans in the past and does not offer them currently. Junior-lien mortgages can also be considered higher risk loans. Our junior-lien portfolio at December 31, 2020 totaled $4.0 million, or 0.61% of total loans. The charge-off rates in this category do not vary significantly from other real estate secured loans in the current year.
The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level adequate to absorb potential losses. Some of the factors which management considers in determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses are: past loss experience, an evaluation of the current loan portfolio, identified loan problems, the loan volume outstanding, the present and expected economic conditions in general, and in particular, how such conditions relate to the market area that the Bank serves. Bank regulators also periodically review the Bank’s loans and other assets to assess their quality. Loans deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance. Provisions for loan losses and recoveries on loans previously charged off are added to the allowance. The reserve for loan losses at December 31, 2020 was approximately 0.74% of total loans, compared to 0.68% at December 31, 2019. Management’s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the acquired Great State loan portfolio was reflected as a purchase discount which will continue to be accreted into income over the remaining life of the acquired loans in addition to the previously acquired loan portfolio from the merger with Cardinal Bankshares Corporation. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the remaining unaccreted discount on the acquired loan portfolios totaled $2.0 million and $3.2 million, respectively. This remaining discount can be used for credit losses if a loss occurs on individual loans in the purchased portfolios.
To quantify the specific elements of the allowance for loan losses, the Bank begins by establishing a specific reserve for larger-balance, non-homogeneous loans, which have been identified as being impaired. This reserve is determined by comparing the principal balance of the loan with the net present value of the future anticipated cash flows or the fair market value of the related collateral. If the impaired loan is collateral dependent, then any excess in the recorded investment in the loan over the fair value of the collateral that is identified as uncollectible in the near term is charged off against the allowance for loan losses at that time. The bank also collectively evaluates for impairment smaller-balance TDRs. The specific component of the allowance for smaller-balance TDR loans is calculated on a pooled basis considering historical experience adjusted for qualitative factors. The bank then reviews certain loans in the portfolio and assigns grades to loans which have been reviewed. Loans which are adversely classified are given a specific allowance based on the historical loss experience of similar type loans in each adverse grade with further adjustments for external factors. The remaining portfolio is segregated into loan pools consistent with regulatory guidelines. An allocation is then made to the reserve for these loan pools based on the bank’s historical loss experience with further adjustments for external factors. The allowance is allocated according to the amount deemed to be reasonably necessary to provide for the possibility of losses being incurred within the respective categories of loans, although the entire allowance is available to absorb any actual charge-offs that may occur.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
The provision for loan losses, net charge-offs, and the resulting allowance for loan losses, are detailed in Table 13. The allocation of the reserve for loan losses is detailed in Table 14.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk
The Bank is party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets.
The Bank’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as for on-balance sheet instruments. A summary of the Bank’s commitments at December 31, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:
Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Bank evaluates each customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Bank upon extension of credit, is based on management’s credit evaluation of the party. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, residential real estate and income-producing commercial properties.
Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. Collateral held varies as specified above and is required in instances which the Bank deems necessary.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk
The principal goals of the Bank’s asset and liability management strategy are the maintenance of adequate liquidity and the management of interest rate risk. Liquidity is the ability to convert assets to cash to fund depositors’ withdrawals or borrowers’ loans without significant loss. Interest rate risk management balances the effects of interest rate changes on assets that earn interest or liabilities on which interest is paid, to protect the Bank from wide fluctuations in its net interest income which could result from interest rate changes.
Management must insure that adequate funds are available at all times to meet the needs of its customers. On the asset side of the balance sheet, maturing investments, loan payments, maturing loans, federal funds sold, and unpledged investment securities are principal sources of liquidity. On the liability side of the balance sheet, liquidity sources include core deposits, the ability to increase large denomination certificates, federal fund lines from correspondent banks, borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank, as well as the ability to generate funds through the issuance of long-term debt and equity.
The liquidity ratio (the level of liquid assets divided by total deposits plus short-term liabilities) was 15.0% at December 31, 2020 compared to 9.9% at December 31, 2019. These ratios are considered to be adequate by management.
The Bank uses cash and federal funds sold to meet its daily funding needs. If funding needs are met through holdings of excess cash and federal funds, then profits might be sacrificed as higher-yielding investments are foregone in the interest of liquidity. Therefore management determines, based on such items as loan demand and deposit activity, an appropriate level of cash and federal funds and seeks to maintain that level.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
The primary goals of the investment portfolio are liquidity management and maturity gap management. As investment securities mature the proceeds are reinvested in federal funds sold if the federal funds level needs to be increased, otherwise the proceeds are reinvested in similar investment securities. The majority of investment security transactions consist of replacing securities that have been called or matured. The Bank keeps a portion of its investment portfolio in unpledged assets that are less than 60 months to maturity or next repricing date. These investments are a preferred source of funds in that they can be disposed of in most interest rate environments without causing significant damage to that quarter’s profits.
Interest rate risk is the effect that changes in interest rates would have on interest income and interest expense as interest-sensitive assets and interest-sensitive liabilities either reprice or mature. Management attempts to maintain the portfolios of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities with maturities or repricing opportunities at levels that will afford protection from erosion of net interest margin, to the extent practical, from changes in interest rates. Table 15 shows the sensitivity of the Bank’s balance sheet on December 31, 2020. This table reflects the sensitivity of the balance sheet as of that specific date and is not necessarily indicative of the position on other dates. At December 31, 2020 the Bank appeared to be cumulatively asset-sensitive (interest-earning assets subject to interest rate changes exceeding interest-bearing liabilities subject to changes in interest rates). However, in the one year window liabilities subject to changes in interest rates exceed assets subject to interest rate changes (non asset-sensitive).
Matching sensitive positions alone does not ensure the Bank has no interest rate risk. The repricing characteristics of assets are different from the repricing characteristics of funding sources. Thus, net interest income can be impacted by changes in interest rates even if the repricing opportunities of assets and liabilities are perfectly matched.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
The Company uses a number of tools to monitor its interest rate risk, including simulating net interest income under various scenarios, monitoring the present value change in equity under the same scenarios, and monitoring the difference or gap between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities over various time periods (as displayed in Table 15).
The earnings simulation model forecasts annual net income under a variety of scenarios that incorporate changes in the absolute level of interest rates, changes in the shape of the yield curve, and changes in interest rate relationships. Management evaluates the effect on net interest income and present value equity from gradual changes in rates of up to 400 basis points up or down over a 12-month period. Table 16 presents the Bank’s twelve-month forecasts for changes in net interest income and market value of equity resulting from changes in rates of up to 300 basis points up or down, as of December 31, 2020.

Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices
The consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this document have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all Company assets and liabilities are monetary in nature, therefore the impact of inflation is reflected primarily in the increased cost of operations. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.
