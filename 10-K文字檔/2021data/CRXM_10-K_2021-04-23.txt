ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis are intended to help you understand our financial condition and results of operations for the last three years ended December 31, 2019. You should read the following discussion and analysis together with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 in this report. Statements in the following discussion that are not historical in nature are forward looking statements, and inherently subject to risk. Our future financial condition and results of operations will vary from our historical financial condition and results of operations described below based on a variety of factors. You should carefully review the risks described under Item 1A and elsewhere in this report, which identify certain important factors that could cause our future financial condition and results of operations to vary from our historical operations and from our current expectations of future results.
Overview
We are a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on pre-clinical, clinical and commercialization of angiogenic gene therapy biotherapeutics for strategic niche markets, primarily for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Our technology platform is designed to biologically activate the human body’s innate angiogenic healing process to stimulate the growth of microvascular networks for patients with ischemic cardiovascular, cerebral, and other medical conditions and diseases, as well as for advanced tissue engineering applications. Historically, we have developed and sold various medical devices, product candidates and products.
We operated throughout the period covered by this report, with severely limited financial resources. During 2015 and 2016, prior to the period covered in this report, we took significant actions to reduce our operating expenses, including headcount reductions, downsizing offices, and suspending some operations while we sought capital to continue our business operations. In 2016 we contributed our assets related to our Generx product candidate into our Angionetics, Inc. subsidiary. We then sold a 15% preferred equity ownership interest in Angionetics, Inc. to Huapont in exchange for $3.0 million. After the filing of our quarterly report for the period ended March 31, 2017, we suspended filing our periodic reports with the SEC because we lacked the financial resources to continue the financial statement review and audits. This report covers our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.
Our current business is focused exclusively on the development of Generx, a gene therapy product candidate targeted for men and women with advanced ischemic heart disease and refractory angina. We have received FDA clearance and FAST Track designation covering our conduct of the AFFIRM Phase 3 clinical trial. We do not currently have any other products or other product candidates under clinical study, and have not generated any revenues from operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Our operations currently comprise one segment for financial reporting purposes.
Significant Developments
During the period covered by this report we entered into the following significant transactions:
● In October 2017 we entered into an agreement with Landmark to assist us in our efforts to sell our Excellagen product and assist with the strategic partnering for the development of Generx. In lieu of an initial cash engagement fee of $50,000, we assigned our residual investment in LifeAgain along with a minority equity investment in Healthy Brands to Landmark, effectively exiting those businesses. We recorded this initial engagement fee as a consulting cost and the transfer of the assets, which had a net book value of zero, as a gain on transfer of assets and licenses in other income in the statement of operations. In connection with this agreement, and in exchange for business advice and marketing of the business for the purposes of raising financing, we issued Landmark a ten-year warrant to purchase up to 2.0 million shares of our Common Stock at a price of $0.25 per share. The fair value of the warrants was determined, using the Black-Scholes-Merton model, to be $230,000 and was recorded in the statement of operations as consulting services in selling, general and administrative expenses the period in which the services were rendered.
● On November 14, 2017, we issued 700,000 warrants to a consultant for general business and scientific consulting services. The fair value of these warrants was determined to be $79,223 and was recorded in the statement of operations as consulting services in selling, general and administrative expenses in the period in which the services were rendered.
● In August 2018, we sold our Excellagen® product to Olaregen for aggregate consideration of up to $4.0 million. At closing, we received a cash payment of $650,000, plus royalty payments of 10% of all worldwide sales of Excellagen outside of China, the Russian Federation, and the CIS, up to an additional $3,350,000. We recognized the gain on sale of Excellagen® in the amount of $650,000 during our third quarter ended September 30, 2018. The remaining $3,350,000 in additional consideration will be recognized as a gain in the periods that Olaregen reports sales that are subject to royalty and collection is reasonably assured. To date no royalty payments have been received.
● During 2019, we took a number of measures to restructure our accounts payable to third party vendors, including negotiated settlements with vendors that resulted in forgiveness of a portion of the accounts payable. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized in our Statement of Operations $1,659,917 as a gain on re-negotiation of vendor payables. The total gain on re-negotiation includes $397,449 in restructured amounts that become due and payable when and if the Company receives FDA approval or when the Company commercializes. For amounts that are payable contingent upon FDA approval or commercialization, the Company has recognized included the amount in the gain on forgiveness and disclosed the contingent payable since the timing and ultimate payment is not determinable. As of December 31, 2019, we had outstanding trade payable and accrued liabilities of $3,763,816.
Subsequent Events
The following significant events took place after the period covered by this report:
● On September 10, 2019, December 30, 2019, and April 30, 2020, we issued Nostrum a promissory note in exchange for cash of $120,000 on September and December 2019 and $25,000 on April 30, 2020. These bear interest at 6% per annum and mature 24 months from the date of issuance. The cash funding related to the December 30, 2019 promissory note was not received by the Company until January 2020, so the Company recorded the note payable in the consolidated balance sheet in January 2020, upon receipt of the cash from Nostrum.
● As of December 31, 2019, we had an outstanding balance in accrued but unpaid salaries and benefits for current and former employees totaling $2,866,717. In January 2020, all affected current and former employees agreed to defer their compensation, less applicable tax withholdings, upon the earliest to occur of (a) the FDA’s approval of Generx for marketing and sale in the U.S.; (b) the EMA approval of Generx for marketing and sale in the European Union and the United Kingdom; (c) the sale of Generx to an independent third party for an aggregate value equal to or greater than $35,000,000; (d) our entry into a strategic partnership that would facilitate a capital contribution equal to or greater than $35,000,000 for the purpose of supporting the clinical and commercial development of Generx; (e) our successful completion of a public or private equity offering for the issuance of its common stock equal to $35,000,000; or (f) at such other time, as our board of directors determines that we have the financial ability to make such payments without jeopardizing our ability to operate as a going concern.
● On April 10, 2020, we entered into the Ratification Agreement with Shanxi. In connection with the Ratification Agreement, we terminated all prior agreements with Shanxi, cancelled a prepaid $600,000 equity subscription and entered into a mutual release of claims.
● On April 10, 2020, our Angionetics, Inc. subsidiary entered into the Shanxi License Agreement, granting Shanxi certain license rights with respect to our Generx product candidate. The distribution and license rights commence only after we obtain U.S. FDA approval for marketing and sale of Generx in the United States. The license rights include (a) a non-exclusive right to manufacture Generx products in China, and (b) an exclusive right to market and sell Generx products in Singapore, Macau, Hong Kong, Taiwan, any other municipality other than mainland China where Chinese (Mandarin or Cantonese) is the common language, the Russian Federation, and the CIS (i.e., Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan). The Shanxi License Agreement provided for payment of $600,000 upfront, which was paid by application of the prepaid equity subscription, and a royalty ranging from 5% up to 10% based on the level of annual net sales of the Generx product sold by Shanxi in the licensed territory.
● On April 10, 2020, our Activation Therapeutics, Inc. subsidiary entered into the Shanxi Assignment Agreement pursuant to which we transferred all of our license rights to manufacture, use, market and sell Excellagen to Shanxi. We also assigned to Shanxi a Chinese patent that we received on Excellagen. As a result, we no longer have an interest in Excellagen, other than the right to the royalty payments from Olaregen.
● In May 2020, we entered into a Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement with Nostrum, selling Nostrum 1,700,000 shares of our newly authorized Series B Convertible Preferred Stock in exchange for $1,700,000. We will use the proceeds from the sale of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock to fund working capital requirements in preparation for conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial in the U.S. for our Generx product candidate. We believe that Nostrum’s assets and experience in the formulation and commercialization of pharmaceutical products will facilitate the administration and completion of the Phase 3 clinical trial for Generx on a cost-effective basis.
● The Series B Convertible Preferred Stock financing resulted in a reset of the conversion price of our outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, such that each Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into Common Stock at a conversion rate of 88,496. In a separate but concurrent transaction, when Nostrum acquired the 1,700,000 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, it also acquired 220 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock from the current holder Sabby Healthcare Master Fund, Ltd., which is convertible into 19,469,026 shares of Common Stock. Nostrum also agreed to purchase the remaining up to 570 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock from Sabby Healthcare Master Fund Ltd. within one year of the initial acquisition. Sabby Healthcare Master Fund, Ltd. retains the right prior to any such sale, to convert the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock prior to the anniversary. Since May 2020 and through March 31, 2021 a total of 397 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock have been converted into 35,132,755 shares of Common Stock. As of March 31, 2021, there are 393 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding including 220 held by Nostrum (convertible into 19,469,026 shares of Common Stock) and 173 shares held by Sabby Healthcare Master Fund Ltd. (convertible into 15,309,735 shares of Common Stock).
● During 2020, we entered into additional settlement agreements with third party vendors resulting in additional gains on vendor payables of $68,032 on our accounts payable.
● In March 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies (“FDB”) to manufacture the Generx [Ad5FGF-4] angiogenic gene therapy product candidate for Phase 3 clinical evaluation for the treatment of refractory angina due to late-stage coronary artery disease. Manufacturing operations will be conducted at FDB’s facilities in College Station, Texas where FDB will perform technology transfer and process development activities for Phase 3 clinical and commercial-scale GMP manufacturing of Generx.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements included in this report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and their accompanying notes. Accounting estimates or assumptions are inherently subject to change, and certain estimates or assumptions are difficult to measure or value. Our estimates are based on historical experience, industry standards, and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
We believe that the following accounting policies involve the most complex judgments concerning assumptions and estimates with the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and that affect our recognition and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
While our estimates are based on assumptions that we consider reasonable at the time they were made, actual results may differ from our estimates, perhaps significantly. If results differ materially from our estimates, we will adjust our financial statements prospectively as we become aware of the necessity for an adjustment.
We believe it is important for you to understand our most critical accounting policies. These are our policies that require us to make our most significant judgments and, as a result, could have the greatest impact on our future financial results.
Preferred Stock
The Company applies the accounting standards for distinguishing liabilities from equity when determining the classification and measurement of its preferred stock. Shares that are subject to mandatory redemption (if any) are classified as liability instruments and are measured at fair value. The Company classifies conditionally redeemable preferred shares, which includes preferred shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control, as temporary equity. At all other times, preferred shares are classified as stockholders’ equity.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating losses and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income(loss) in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Due to the Company’s history of losses, a full valuation allowance has been recognized against the deferred tax assets.
The Company has adopted the provisions of ASC 740-10, which clarifies the accounting for uncertain tax positions. ASC 740-10 requires that the Company recognize the impact of a tax position in its financial statements if the position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination base on the technical merits of the position. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company had no material unrecognized tax benefits, and based on the information currently available, no significant changes in unrecognized tax benefits are expected in the next twelve months.
The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company has not recorded any interest or penalties related to income tax matters. The Company does not foresee any material changes in unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.
When tax returns are filed, there may be uncertainty about the merits of positions taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions.
Tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefit associated with tax positions taken that exceed the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. The Company believes our tax positions are all more likely than not to be upheld upon examination. As such, the Company has not recorded a liability for uncertain tax benefits.
Warrants
Warrants issued to third parties in connection with consulting and other services do not trade in an active securities market, and as such, we estimate the fair value of these warrants using an option pricing model. Following the authoritative accounting guidance, warrants with variable exercise price features or with potential cash settlement outside of our control are accounted for as liabilities, with changes in the fair value included in operating expenses, otherwise warrants determined to be equity classified are fair valued at the date of issuance, with no change in the fair value recorded in subsequent periods. We estimated the fair value of the warrants using the Black Scholes option pricing model. The Black Scholes model requires that our management make certain estimates regarding the expected stock volatility, the risk-free interest rate, the warrant’s expected life, and the expected forfeiture rate, to derive an estimated fair market value.
Results of Operations
Fiscal 2019 Compared to Fiscal 2018
The following tables sets forth our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the relative dollar and percentage change between the two years.
Research and development decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 by $11,941 or 4.7% due to a decrease in employee benefits.
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased in 2019 by $314,287 or 34.6% compared to 2018 mainly due to a reduction in employee salary costs of $152,852 resulting from a headcount reduction of two employees on a permanent basis and one employee on a temporary basis during 2019. In addition, the Company incurred consulting costs of approximately $80,000 in relation to raising capital funds for the Company in 2018 compared with $nil in 2019, and an overall reduction in legal and regulatory professional fees of $61,851, in addition to a decrease in office supplies as the Company focused time and resources on raising capital resources and putting on hold regulatory filing matters therefore reducing the selling, general and administrative expenses in 2019 when compared to 2018. In addition, the depreciation expense in 2019 was lower due to Company property and equipment becoming fully depreciated.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, the company recognized a gain on sale of Excellagen® product to Olaregen in the amount of $650,000 which also represented the cash proceeds on the sale of the technological asset. The sale of Excellagen® was consistent with management restructuring of the company’s operations in order to focus efforts on development and sale of Generx.
Other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 included a gain on debt forgiveness in the amount of $1,659,917. The debt forgiveness is the result of settlement agreements reached with certain vendors as part of the pre-financing restructuring efforts of the Company. Of these amounts, $172,449 becomes due and payable upon FDA approval of Generx, and when total cumulative net sales of Generx reach $100 million, an additional amount totaling $225,000 will be due and payable. Interest expense increased in 2019 compared to 2018 by $4,273 primarily as result of an increase in the notes payable in the third quarter ended 2019 of approximately $120,000 bearing interest at 6% per annum on advances received from Nostrum.
Fiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017
The following tables sets forth our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the relative dollar and percentage change between the two years.
Research and development decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 by $89,582 or 26 %. The decrease in spending is primarily due to the Company’s continued cash constrained position in 2018 resulting in management focusing Company resources on raising capital to provide the resources to advance the development and commercialization of Generx. The Company also discontinued further development of other product lines and focused actively on selling intellectual property developed not related to the Generx product line.
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $873,473 or 49.0% in 2018 compared to 2017 as a result of a concentrated effort to contain costs, reduction in salary expense due to a reduction in headcount, reduced legal and other professional fees as a result of the Company’s decision to suspend SEC filings beginning in 2017.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized a gain on the sale of Excellagen® product to Olaregen in the amount of $650,000. This compares to a gain on the sale of assets in 2017 of $50,000 related to the transfer of the Company’s residual investment in LifeAgain along with a minority equity investment in Healthy Brands in exchange for strategic financing consulting services.
Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 also included interest expense related to interest on notes payable with unrelated parties. The total interest expense in 2018 was $31,558 compared with $20,219 in 2017, as a result of the note payable in the principal amount of $208,500, being outstanding for the full year in 2018 compared to an increase in the note through the 2017 year.
Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016
The following tables sets forth our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the relative dollar and percentage change between the two years.
Research and development expense decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 by $296,596 0r 46.2% as a result of the Company reducing all discretionary expenses in 2017 in order to conserve cash and focus on raising capital to be used for the Company’s efforts to continue the development of their core technologies and due to a decrease in employee salary expenses as a result of a reduction in headcount.
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 by $418,103 or 19% due to the Company reducing headcount and discretionary expenditures during 2017, including suspending SEC filings to reduce legal, accounting and filing costs.
The Company recognized a gain on sale of assets in the amount of $50,000 in the year ended December 31, 2017. In October 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with Landmark to assist with the Company’s efforts to sell the Excellagen product and assist with the strategic partnering for the development of Generx. In lieu of an initial cash engagement fee of $50,000, the Company assigned our residual investment in LifeAgain along with a minority equity investment in Healthy Brands to Landmark, effectively exiting the development and commercialization of the product lines. The Company determined the fair value of the non-monetary exchange to be $50,000, since this was the negotiated third-party initial cost negotiated between two independent third parties and the transfer of the assets settled the initial fee in full.
Other income/expense includes interest expense which decreased by $152,606 in 2017 compared with 2016. In 2016 $146,996 in interest charges on unpaid license fees were expensed that were not charged in 2017. The remaining interest charges in each of 2016 and 2017 related to interest on advances and notes payable.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The following table summarizes our liquidity and working capital position on December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:
Following the period covered by this report:
● We entered into several agreements with employees, former employees, and vendors to restructure claims reducing the amount of our accounts payable and our other current liabilities and/or extending the payment terms until after commercialization and Generx products sales commence.
● In May 2020 we secured $1,700,000 financing from the sale of our newly authorized Series B Convertible Preferred Stock to Nostrum. We will use the proceeds from the sale of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock to fund working capital requirements in preparation for conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial in the U.S. for our Generx product candidate.
The following table summarizes our cash flows from (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:
The Company has not generated cash from operating activities. We did not generate revenue in any of the years covered by this report, and generally record operating losses in each of the years.
In 2018, the Company sold Excellagen for cash proceeds of $650,000 resulting in cash being generated from investing activities. The Company can also earn royalties on future sales on Excellagen, under the terms of the sales agreement.
Net cash provided by financing activities in 2019 compared to cash used by financing activities in 2018 is primarily due to Nostrum providing $120,000 in cash in exchange for a note payable, due in 24 months, bearing interest at 6%, offset by an increase in the notes payable resulting from interest accruals and payments made on the loan from officer of approximately $99,000. On December 31, 2019, we did not have any significant requirements for capital expenditures.
After the period covered by this report, we secured the $1,700,000 in financing from Nostrum as described above.
We anticipate that negative cash flows from operations will continue for the foreseeable future. We do not have any unused credit facilities. Our cash position, even after the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock financing with Nostrum, will not be sufficient to sustain our operations for more than twelve months. We intend to secure additional working capital to support our continued operations through sales of additional equity and debt securities. As long as any shares of our Preferred Stock are outstanding, we have agreed that we will not, without the consent of the holders of two-thirds of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, incur indebtedness other than specified “Permitted Indebtedness”, or incur any liens other than specified “Permitted Liens”.
Our principal business objective is to advance or Generx product candidate through the AFFIRM Phase 3 clinical trial and to begin commercialization of Generx in the United States. We expect that support from Nostrum will decrease the overall costs of the trial, but we estimate that we will still need $12.0 to $15.0 million in additional capital to complete manufacturing of Generx clinical supplies for the conduct of the planned Phase 3 AFFIRM clinical study, and administrative and operating expenses that include the costs associated with Gene Biotherapeutics remaining a public company. We plan to secure that capital through the sale of additional equity or debt securities or through other transactions that could include strategic partnering and distribution agreements. There are no agreements or arrangement for any additional financing in place at this time.
Our history of recurring losses and uncertainties as to whether our operations will become profitable raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability of assets or classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2019, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet debt, nor did we have any transactions, arrangements, obligations (including contingent obligations) or other relationships with any unconsolidated entities or other persons that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, capital resources, or significant components of revenue or expenses material to investors.

Quarterly Results of Operations
As described in the Explanatory Note, we are presenting our quarterly results of operations for each of the periods ended September 30, June 30, and March 31 for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, herein, in lieu of filing separate Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for such periods.
