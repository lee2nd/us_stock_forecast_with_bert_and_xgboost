Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
You should read the following management’s discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) in conjunction with the information set forth within the financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Overview
As discussed elsewhere in this Report, Sensus seeks to achieve profitability. However, Sensus faces a number of uncertainties in 2021 that could impact our ability to achieve this goal. These include the ongoing coronavirus epidemic and international trade issues. Either of these matters could adversely affect the Company’s ability to do business in a number of countries and geographic regions, including China.
In order to achieve profitability, the Company is reducing operational expenses where necessary in order to continue to invest in research and development related to the Company’s products.
Impact of COVID-19
The outbreak of COVID-19, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, has led to adverse impacts on the U.S. and global economies, as well as on the Company’s and its employees, operations, and customer demand. The Company has been able to continue to operate and service its customers throughout the pandemic. However, the pandemic significantly impacted the Company’s sales throughout 2020, as social distancing forced physicians to temporarily close their practices, and could further impact the Company’s operations and the operations of the Company’s customers, suppliers and vendors as a result of ongoing quarantines, facility closures, and travel and logistics restrictions. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the impact at this time. (See Note 1, Business Overview, of the consolidated financial statements).
Components of our results of operations
Sensus manages our business globally within one reportable segment, which is consistent with how management views the business, prioritizes investment and resource allocation decisions and assesses operating performance.
Results of Operations
2020 Compared with 2019
Revenues of $9,576,932 in 2020 decreased $17,686,316 from $27,263,248 in 2019, primarily reflecting the impact of COVID-19 and the decrease in the number of units sold. Due to COVID-19, the Company was unable to sell effectively to its markets due to travel restrictions and other factors. The Company believes these factors are gradually subsiding as the healthcare industry has developed and continues to develop effective vaccines and other treatments for COVID-19 and as local, state, and federal governments ease distancing restrictions. Additionally, the overall embrace of technology that enables the global business community to communicate effectively without the need for close proximity is expected to help the Company reach its potential clients for 2021.
Cost of sales of $4,327,839 in 2020 decreased by $5,378,265 from $9,706,104 in 2019, reflecting the lower number of units sold due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Gross profit decreased $12,308,051, or 70.1%, from 2019, primarily driven by continued fixed costs and depreciation and amortization expenses combined with the decline in units sold. Any increase in 2021 in gross profit or gross margin, as a percentage of revenue, is largely dependent upon the status of the COVID-19 pandemic and the market’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Selling and marketing expenses decreased $3,766,709, or 41.4%, from 2019, primarily attributable to cancellations of trade shows due to COVID-19, a decrease in commission expense due to lower sales and reduced spending on marketing activities.
Research and development expenses decreased $2,260,189 or 35.2.%, from 2019, reflecting lower spending as the SculpturaTM project entered production phase during 2020.
Other income (expense), net of $1,398,348 in 2020 increased $1,130,058 from $268,290 in 2019. The net increase was primarily attributable to the forgiveness of $757,782 of our loan under the Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program (See “Financial Condition” below and Note 5, Debt, of the consolidated financial statements) and a bargain purchase gain $588,011 which was recorded as a result of acquisitions (See Note 2, Acquisitions, of the consolidated financial statements)
Financial Condition
The Company’s cash, cash equivalent and investment balance decreased to $14,906,976 at December 31, 2020 from $15,489,695 at December 31, 2019, primarily due to cash used in operating activities and the purchase of property and equipment.
There were no borrowings under the revolving line of credit at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company took proactive steps during 2020 to manage costs and bolster liquidity. These steps included increasing borrowing availability as a precautionary measure to preserve financial flexibility in view of the uncertainty in global markets resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and obtaining a loan of $1,022,785 under the Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program enabled by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act of 2020 which was used for employee compensation and facilities costs.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
In general terms, liquidity is a measurement of the Company’s ability to meet its cash needs. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, a significant source of funding has been cash flows from investing and financing activities. The Company believes that proceeds from investment maturing, borrowing capacity and access to capital resources are sufficient to meet operating capital and funding requirements for the next 12 months from the issuance date of this annual report. The Company’s liquidity position and capital requirements may be impacted by a number of factors, including the following:
● ability to generate and increase revenue;
● fluctuations in gross margins, operating expenses and net results; and
● fluctuations in working capital.
The Company’s primary short-term capital needs, which are subject to change, include expenditures related to:
● expansion of sales and marketing activities; and
● expansion of research and development activities.
Sensus’ management regularly evaluates cash requirements for current operations, commitments, capital requirements and business development transactions, and may seek to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future.
Cash flows
The following table provides a summary of the Company’s cash flows for the periods indicated:
Cash flows from operating activities
Net cash used in operating activities was $434,180 for the year ended December 31, 2020, consisting of a net loss of $6,835,526 partially offset by an increase in net operating assets of $5,561,274 and non-cash charges of $840,072. The increase in net operating assets was primarily related to a decrease in sales and resulting in a decrease in accounts receivable, offset by an increase in inventory and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses. Non-cash charges consisted of depreciation and amortization, partially offset by the gain on bargain purchase in 2020. Net cash used in operating activities was $2,106,642 for the year ended December 31, 2019, consisting of a net loss of $1,700,003 and an increase in net operating assets of $2,212,112, partially offset by non-cash charges of $1,805,474. The increase in net operating assets was primarily due to the increase in sales and other longer payment terms on certain sales, resulting in an increase in accounts receivable, an increase in inventory and an increase in deferred revenue offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses. Non-cash charges consisted primarily of stock compensation expense, bad debt and depreciation and amortization.
Cash flows from investing activities
Net cash provided by investing activities was $7,030,862, primarily due to matured investments of $7,389,407, partially offset by $358,545 of acquisition of property and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities was $4,897,810 due the purchase of debt securities held-to-maturity of $7,797,217 and $400,593 for acquisition of property and equipment offset by matured investments of $3,300,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019.
Cash flows from financing activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $210,006 during the year ended December 31, 2020, mostly from the balance of the loan of $266,777 under the Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program. Net cash provided by financing activities was $2,620,484 during the year ended December 31, 2019, mostly from the exercise of investor warrants of $2,739,238 offset by withholding tax on stock compensation of $118,754.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. Management has identified certain accounting policies as critical to understanding the financial condition and results of operations. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see the notes to the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
JOBS Act
Sensus is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act. As such, the Company can take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies but not to “emerging growth companies,” including, but not limited to:
● being permitted to provide only two years of audited financial statements, in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements, with correspondingly reduced “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” disclosure;
● not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;
● reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in the Company’s periodic reports and proxy statements; and
● exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
Sensus is expected to remain an emerging growth company until December 31, 2021, following which it would continue to be a “smaller reporting company,” which will enable it to continue to take advantage of many of these exemptions, as discussed below. Investors may find Sensus’ common stock less attractive if the Company chooses to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find Sensus’ common stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for the Company’s common stock and the price of its common stock may be more volatile.
In addition, an emerging growth company can delay its adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, the Company have chosen to “opt out” of such extended transition period, and as a result, plans to comply with any new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which non-emerging growth companies must adopt such standards. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that the decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.
