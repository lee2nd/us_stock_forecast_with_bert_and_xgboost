COVID-19 Impact and Strategy
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the current outbreak of COVID-19 to be a global pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency. In response to these declarations and the rapid spread of COVID-19, federal, state and local governments imposed varying degrees of restrictions on business and social activities to contain COVID-19, including business shutdowns and closures, travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, shelter-in-place orders and “stay-at-home” orders in certain of our markets. State and local authorities have also implemented multi-step policies with the goal of re-opening various sectors of the economy. However, certain jurisdictions began re-opening only to return to restrictions in the face of increases in new COVID-19 cases, while other jurisdictions are continuing to re-open or have nearly completed the re-opening process despite increases in COVID-19 cases. The COVID-19 outbreak may significantly worsen in the United States during the upcoming months, which may cause federal, state and local governments to reconsider restrictions on business and social activities. In the event governments increase restrictions, the re-opening of the economy may be further curtailed. We have experienced some resulting disruptions to our business operations, as these restrictions have significantly impacted, and may continue to impact, many sectors of the economy, with various businesses curtailing or ceasing normal operations and subsequently attempting to resume operations. In March 2020, we were required to temporarily stop our construction of homes in certain markets in which we do business. Beginning in April 2020, we resumed construction of homes in those markets. Although we continued to build and sell homes in all of our markets, at that time the pace of sales declined and we experienced an increase in the rate of contract cancellations. Since May 2020, the pace of sales has rebounded and we have experienced a sustained increase in demand in our markets. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the extent to which COVID-19 will continue to spread and the extent and duration of governmental and other measures implemented to try to slow the spread of COVID-19. Such measures have caused, and may continue to cause, us, our subcontractors, suppliers and other business counterparties to experience operational delays.
Demand for our homes is dependent on a variety of macroeconomic factors, such as employment levels, interest rates, changes in stock market valuations, consumer confidence, housing demand, availability of financing for home buyers, availability and prices of new homes compared to existing inventory, and demographic trends. These factors, and in particular consumer confidence, can be significantly adversely affected by a variety of factors beyond our control. The outbreak of
COVID-19 caused the shutdown of large portions of our national economy during the first half of 2020. The spread of COVID-19 has also caused significant volatility in U.S. and international debt and equity markets, which can negatively impact consumer confidence.
In response to COVID-19, we continue to take steps to prioritize the health and safety of our employees, customers, subcontractors and suppliers, including expanded safety policies and practices based on Center for Disease Control guidelines to reduce the spread of COVID-19.
As a homebuilder and developer, we provide an important service to our customers. During the COVID-19 outbreak, our main focus beyond the health and safety mentioned above is to continue our efforts to sell homes and complete our homes under construction. In addition to the measures discussed above, beginning in March 2020, we implemented certain cash management policies, including eliminating business air travel, cancelling in-person group meetings, delaying or canceling land acquisitions, deferring new starts to manage our overall inventory, significantly reducing marketing expenditures and delaying major expenditures. In May 2020, we began to acquire land and release starts for home construction in addition to increasing marketing expenditures and later began reinstating some necessary travel. From time to time during the COVID-19 outbreak, we have had to close individual sales offices for a limited period of time, as a result of potential or actual exposure to COVID-19 by one or more of our employees. In September 2020, our employees working in our corporate headquarters returned to working under modified protocols to ensure health and safety at the office.
We cannot estimate with any degree of certainty the full impact of COVID-19 on our financial condition and future results of operations. We also cannot predict the full impact that the significant disruption and volatility currently being experienced in the markets will have on our business, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations at this time, due to numerous uncertainties. The ultimate impacts of COVID-19 and related mitigation efforts will depend on future developments, including, but not limited to, the duration and geographic spread of COVID-19, the impact of government actions designed to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the availability and timely distribution of effective treatments and vaccines, actions taken by customers, subcontractors, suppliers and other third parties, workforce availability, and the timing and extent to which normal economic and operating conditions resume. For additional discussion regarding risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. While we expect COVID-19 to continue to influence our future results, we believe that the desire for single-family homes outside of densely populated urban areas combined with historically low mortgage rates and low availability of existing homes is driving an increase in demand for new homes.
Results of Operations
The following table sets forth our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
(1)Gross margin is home sales revenues less cost of sales.
(2)Calculated as a percentage of home sales revenues.
(3)Adjusted gross margin is a non-GAAP financial measure used by management as a supplemental measure in evaluating operating performance. We define adjusted gross margin as gross margin less capitalized interest and adjustments resulting from the application of purchase accounting included in the cost of sales. Our management believes this information is useful because it isolates the impact that capitalized interest and purchase accounting adjustments have on gross margin. However, because adjusted gross margin information excludes capitalized interest and purchase accounting adjustments, which have real economic effects and could impact our results, the utility of adjusted gross margin information as a measure of our operating performance may be limited. In addition, other companies may not calculate adjusted gross margin information in the same manner that we do. Accordingly, adjusted gross margin information should be considered only as a supplement to gross margin information as a measure of our performance. Please see “-Non-GAAP Measures” for a reconciliation of adjusted gross margin to gross margin, which is the GAAP financial measure that our management believes to be most directly comparable.
(4)EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures used by management as supplemental measures in evaluating operating performance. We define EBITDA as net income before (i) interest expense, (ii) income taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization and (iv) capitalized interest charged to the cost of sales. We define adjusted EBITDA as net income before (i) interest expense, (ii) income taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) capitalized interest charged to the cost of sales, (v) loss on extinguishment of debt, (vi) other income, net and (vii) adjustments resulting from the application of purchase accounting. Our management believes that the presentation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our
results of operations because it assists both investors and management in analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA provide indicators of general economic performance that are not affected by fluctuations in interest rates or effective tax rates, levels of depreciation or amortization and items considered to be unusual or non-recurring. Accordingly, our management believes that these measures are useful for comparing general operating performance from period to period. Other companies may define these measures differently and, as a result, our measures of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to the measures of other companies. Although we use EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA as financial measures to assess the performance of our business, the use of these measures is limited because they do not include certain material costs, such as interest and taxes, necessary to operate our business. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, net income in accordance with GAAP as a measure of performance. Our presentation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our use of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA is limited as an analytical tool, and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Please see “-Non-GAAP Measures” for reconciliations of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to net income, which is the GAAP financial measure that our management believes to be most directly comparable.
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019
Homes Sales. Our home sales revenues, home closings, average sales price per home closed (ASP), average community count, average monthly absorption rate and closing community count by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows (revenues in thousands):
Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 reflect a significant rebound following the slowdown related to the COVID-19 pandemic that occurred during March and April 2020. Since May 2020, we have seen a continued and material increase in the demand for our homes driven by a renewed interest in the benefits of homeownership, low interest rates and an undersupply of new and existing homes available for sale. Despite high levels of demand, our closings in July and August 2020 were limited by our decision to pause our construction and land acquisition activities in March and April as we evaluated the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. Beginning in May 2020, we resumed construction activities and accelerated the pace of our new home starts.
Home Sales Revenues. Home sales revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $2.4 billion, an increase of $529.8 million, or 28.8%, from $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in home sales revenues is primarily due to a 21.4% increase in homes closed, a 16.8% increase in average community count and an increase in the average sales price per home closed during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. We closed 9,339 homes during 2020, as compared to 7,690 homes closed during 2019. The average sales price per home closed during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $253,553, an increase of $14,521, or 6.1%, from the average sales price per home closed of $239,032 for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase in the average sales price per home closed was primarily due to a favorable pricing environment, increased closings at higher price points in certain markets and changes in product mix. The overall increase in home closings was largely due to deepening our presence within certain markets in the Southeast and Florida reportable segments during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 and strong demand resulting in an increase in the number of homes closed on average on a per community basis.
We continued to diversify our operations outside of our Central reportable segment during 2020. We increased our home sales revenues in our reportable segments other than our Central reportable segment by $404.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, representing a 29.6% increase in the number of homes closed in these reportable segments and increased average community count on a consolidated basis during 2020 as compared to 2019.
Home sales revenues in our Central reportable segment increased by $125.4 million, or 17.3%, during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in the average sales price per home closed and increased community count at a higher absorption rate. Home sales revenues in our Southeast reportable segment increased by $211.4 million, or 60.8%, during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in community count associated with deepening our presence within existing markets and to a lesser extent our geographic expansion into certain markets in North Carolina and South Carolina at December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019. Home sales revenues in our Northwest reportable segment increased by $85.2 million, or 28.0%, during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to a 20.9% increase in the number of homes closed in this reportable segment, as a result of increased demand slightly offset by a lower average community count at a higher absorption rate. Home sales revenues in our West reportable segment increased by $14.9 million, or 5.5%, during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase of 6.8% in the average sales price per home closed in this reportable segment offset by lower home closings, largely due to close out of or transition between, and to a lesser extent available inventory in, certain active communities. Home sales revenues in our Florida reportable segment increased by $92.8 million, or 48.9%, primarily due to an increased community count with an increase of 7.6% in the average sales price per home closed during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
Cost of Sales and Gross Margin (home sales revenues less cost of sales). Cost of sales increased for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $1.8 billion, an increase of $363.2 million, or 25.9%, from $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase is primarily due to a 21.4% increase in homes closed, as well as higher vertical and lot costs recognized as a percentage of revenues during 2020 as compared to 2019. Gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $603.1 million, an increase of $166.6 million, or 38.2%, from $436.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Gross margin as a percentage of home sales revenues was 25.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 23.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase in gross margin as a percentage of home sales revenues during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 is primarily due to an increase in homes closed with a higher average sales price per home closed, which was primarily driven by a favorable pricing environment, operating leverage obtained and product mix, partially offset by an increase in wholesale home closings as a percentage of total home closings.
Selling Expenses. Selling expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $148.4 million, an increase of $16.8 million, or 12.8%, from $131.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Sales commissions increased to $89.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $68.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 largely due to a 28.8% increase in home sales revenues during 2020 as compared to 2019. Selling expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues were 6.3% and 7.2% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in selling expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues was driven primarily by cost saving measures implemented and the increased demand for our homes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as operating leverage realized from the increase in home sales revenues during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $90.0 million, an increase of $12.6 million, or 16.3%, from $77.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in the amount of general and administrative expenses is primarily due to increased personnel and other costs associated with an increase of active communities during 2020 as compared to 2019. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues were 3.8% and 4.2% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues reflects operating leverage realized from the increase in home sales revenues and cost saving measures implemented as a result of COVID-19 during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
Operating Income and Net Income before Income Taxes. Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $364.7 million, an increase of $137.2 million, or 60.3%, from $227.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Net income before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $367.8 million, an increase of $136.0 million, or 58.7%, from $231.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our reportable segments contributed the following amounts and percentages of net income before income taxes during 2020: Central - $154.8 million or 42.1%; Southeast - $79.4 million or 21.6%; Northwest - $71.3 million or 19.4%; West - $35.8 million or 9.7%; and Florida - $32.6 million or 8.8%. The increases in operating income and net income before income taxes are primarily attributed to higher gross margins during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
Income Taxes. Income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $44.0 million, a decrease of $9.3 million, or 17.4%, from income tax provision of $53.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in the amount of income tax provision is primarily due to the change in our effective tax rate to 11.9% from 23.0% effective tax provision as a result of the tax benefits relating to the federal energy efficient homes tax credits we recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020, partially offset by the 58.7% increase in net income before taxes. Federal energy efficient homes tax credits recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $41.2 million, of which $29.7 million related to homes
closed in prior open tax years. We believe this tax credit will continue, at a lesser extent, to impact our results of operations during 2021.
Net Income. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $323.9 million, an increase of $145.3 million, or 81.3%, from $178.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in net income is primarily attributed to overall stronger gross margins driven by the 28.8% increase in home sales revenues, 6.1% higher average sales price per home closed and the $41.2 million of tax benefits relating to the federal energy efficient homes tax credits recognized during 2020 as compared to 2019.
Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018
Homes Sales. Our home sales revenues, home closings, average sales price per home closed (ASP), average community count, average monthly absorption rate and closing community count by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (Revenues in thousands):
Home Sales Revenues. Home sales revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $1.8 billion, an increase of $333.8 million, or 22.2%, from $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in home sales revenues is primarily due to an 18.1% increase in homes closed and an increase in the average sales price per home closed during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. We closed 7,690 homes during 2019, as compared to 6,512 homes closed during 2018. This increase in home closings was largely due to the increase in the number of active communities in 2019. The average sales price per home closed during the year ended December 31, 2019 was $239,032, an increase of $8,012, or 3.5%, from the average sales price per home closed of $231,020 for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase in the average sales price per home closed was primarily due to changes in product mix, higher price points in certain new markets and a favorable pricing environment. The increase in homes closed was largely due to our geographic expansion in the West reportable segment and deepening our presence within certain markets in the Southeast reportable segment during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.
We continued to diversify our operations outside of our Central reportable segment during 2019. We increased our home sales revenues in our reportable segments other than our Central reportable segment by $232.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, representing a 22.7% increase in the number of homes closed in these reportable segments during 2019 as compared to 2018. Our active selling communities at December 31, 2019 increased to 106 from 88 at December 31, 2018. Seventeen of the eighteen active selling communities added during 2019 were outside of our Central reportable segment, contributing to the further geographic diversification of our business.
Home sales revenues in our West reportable segment increased by $120.1 million, or 79.5%, primarily due to an increase in community count associated with our continued geographic expansion into our California and Nevada markets. Home sales revenues in our Southeast reportable segment increased by $76.7 million, or 28.3%, during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a 20.2% increase in the number of homes closed in this
reportable segment and partially due to increased community count stemming from the acquisition of Wynn Homes in 2018. All reportable segments added communities by expanding into new markets or deepening existing markets during the year ended December 31, 2019.
Cost of Sales and Gross Margin (home sales revenues less cost of sales). Cost of sales increased for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $1.4 billion, an increase of $277.2 million, or 24.7%, from $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase is primarily due to an 18.1% increase in homes closed, higher lot costs recognized and, to a lesser extent, increased capitalized interest costs for homes closed during 2019 as compared to 2018. Gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $436.5 million, an increase of $56.6 million, or 14.9%, from $379.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Gross margin as a percentage of home sales revenues was 23.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 25.3% for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease in gross margin as a percentage of home sales revenues is primarily due to higher lot costs and higher capitalized interest costs recognized for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 and, to a lesser extent, to 583 wholesale home closings during 2019, compared to 466 wholesale home closings during 2018.
Selling Expenses. Selling expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $131.6 million, an increase of $22.1 million, or 20.2%, from $109.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Sales commissions increased to $68.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $57.3 million during 2018 largely due to a 22.2% increase in home sales revenues during 2019 as compared to 2018. Selling expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues were 7.2% and 7.3% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in selling expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues reflects operating leverage realized from the increase in home sales revenues during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.
General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $77.4 million, an increase of $7.0 million, or 10.0%, from $70.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in the amount of general and administrative expenses is primarily due to increased personnel associated with an increase of active communities during 2019 as compared to 2018. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues were 4.2% and 4.7% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues reflects operating leverage realized from the increase in retail and wholesale home sales revenues during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.
Loss on extinguishment of debt. Loss on extinguishment of debt was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to debt issuance costs previously capitalized that were associated with the Credit Agreement. Loss on extinguishment of debt was $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 due to debt issuance costs previously capitalized that were associated with our third amended and restated credit agreement, dated as of May 25, 2018 (the “2018 Credit Agreement”).
Operating Income, Net Income before Income Taxes, and Net Income. Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $227.5 million, an increase of $27.4 million, or 13.7%, from $200.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Net income before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $231.8 million, an increase of $32.7 million, or 16.4%, from $199.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our reportable segments contributed the following amounts and percentages of net income before income taxes during 2019: Central - $117.4 million or 50.6%; Northwest - $46.9 million or 20.2%; Florida - $16.0 million or 6.9%; Southeast - $30.3 million or 13.1%; and West - $28.5 million or 12.3%. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $178.6 million, an increase of $23.3 million, or 15.0%, from $155.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increases are primarily attributed to operating leverage realized from the increase in home sales revenues and higher average sales price per home closed, offset by lower gross margin percentage during 2019 as compared to 2018.
Non-GAAP Measures
In addition to the results reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), we have provided information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K relating to adjusted gross margin, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share.
Adjusted Gross Margin
Adjusted gross margin is a non-GAAP financial measure used by management as a supplemental measure in evaluating operating performance. We define adjusted gross margin as gross margin less capitalized interest and adjustments resulting from the application of purchase accounting included in the cost of sales. Our management believes this information is useful because it isolates the impact that capitalized interest and purchase accounting adjustments have on gross margin. However, because adjusted gross margin information excludes capitalized interest and purchase accounting adjustments, which have real economic effects and could impact our results, the utility of adjusted gross margin information as a measure of our operating performance may be limited. In addition, other companies may not calculate adjusted gross margin information in the same manner that we do. Accordingly, adjusted gross margin information should be considered only as a supplement to gross margin information as a measure of our performance.
The following table reconciles adjusted gross margin to gross margin, which is the GAAP financial measure that our management believes to be most directly comparable (dollars in thousands):
(1)Adjustments result from the application of purchase accounting for acquisitions and represent the amount of the fair value step-up adjustments included in cost of sales for real estate inventory sold after the acquisition dates.
(2)Calculated as a percentage of home sales revenues.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures used by management as supplemental measures in evaluating operating performance. We define EBITDA as net income before (i) interest expense, (ii) income taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization and (iv) capitalized interest charged to the cost of sales. We define adjusted EBITDA as net income before (i) interest expense, (ii) income taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) capitalized interest charged to the cost of sales, (v) loss on extinguishment of debt, (vi) other income, net and (vii) adjustments resulting from the application of purchase accounting included in the cost of sales. Our management believes that the presentation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it assists both investors and management in analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA provide indicators of general economic performance that are not affected by fluctuations in interest rates or effective tax rates, levels of depreciation or amortization and items considered to be unusual or non-recurring. Accordingly, our management believes that these measures are useful for comparing general operating performance from period to period. Other companies may define these measures differently and, as a result, our measures of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to the measures of other companies. Although we use EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA as financial measures to assess the performance of our business, the use of these measures is limited because they do not include certain material costs, such as interest and taxes, necessary to operate our business. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, net income in accordance with GAAP as a measure of performance. Our presentation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our use of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA is limited as an analytical tool, and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:
(i) they do not reflect every cash expenditure, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments, including for purchase of land;
(ii) they do not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt;
(iii) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced or require improvements in the future, and EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements or improvements;
(iv) they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows;
(v) they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; and
(vi) other companies in our industry may calculate them differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure.
Because of these limitations, our EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. We compensate for these limitations by using our EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA along with other comparative tools, together with GAAP measures, to assist in the evaluation of operating performance. These GAAP measures include operating income, net income and cash flow data. We have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments and other non-recurring charges, which are not reflected in our EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not intended as alternatives to net income as indicators of our operating performance, as alternatives to any other measure of performance in conformity with GAAP or as alternatives to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. You should therefore not place undue reliance on our EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA calculated using these measures.
The following table reconciles EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to net income, which is the GAAP measure that our management believes to be most directly comparable (dollars in thousands):
(1)Adjustments result from the application of purchase accounting for acquisitions and represent the amount of the fair value step-up adjustments included in cost of sales for real estate inventory sold after the acquisition dates.
(2)Calculated as a percentage of home sales revenues.
Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Share
Adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures used by management as supplemental measures in evaluating operating performance. We define adjusted net income as net income less the retroactive federal energy efficient homes tax credits. We define adjusted earnings per share as adjusted net income divided by weighted average shares outstanding. Our management believes that the presentation of adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share provides useful information to investors because such measures isolate the impact that material retroactive tax adjustments have on net income and earnings per share. However, because adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share information excludes the retroactive federal energy efficient homes tax credits, which have real economic effects and could impact our results, the utility of adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share as measures of our operating performance may be limited. In addition, other companies may not calculate adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share in the same manner that we do. Accordingly, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share information should be considered only as a supplement to net income and earnings per share information as measures of our performance.
The following table reconciles adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share to net income and earnings per share, respectively, which are the GAAP measures that our management believes to be most directly comparable (dollars in thousands):
Backlog
We sell our homes under standard purchase contracts, which generally require a homebuyer to pay a deposit at the time of signing the purchase contract. The amount of the required deposit is minimal (typically $1,000 to $5,000). We permit our retail homebuyers to cancel the purchase contract and obtain a refund of their deposit in the event mortgage financing cannot be obtained within a certain period of time, as specified in their purchase contract. Typically, our retail homebuyers provide documentation regarding their ability to obtain mortgage financing within 14 days after the purchase contract is signed. If we determine that the homebuyer is not qualified to obtain mortgage financing or is not otherwise financially able to purchase the home, we will terminate the purchase contract. If a purchase contract has not been cancelled or terminated within 14 days after the purchase contract has been signed, then the homebuyer has met the preliminary criteria to obtain mortgage financing. Only purchase contracts that are signed by homebuyers who have met the preliminary criteria to obtain mortgage financing are included in new (gross) orders. As a result of COVID-19, it has been, and may continue to be, more difficult for our homebuyers to qualify for and obtain mortgage financing to purchase a home.
Our “backlog” consists of homes that are under a purchase contract that has been signed by homebuyers who have met the preliminary criteria to obtain mortgage financing but have not yet closed and wholesale contracts for which vertical construction is generally set to occur within the next six to twelve months. Since our business model is generally based on building move-in ready homes before a purchase contract is signed, the majority of our homes in backlog are currently under construction or complete. Ending backlog represents the number of homes in backlog from the previous period plus the number of net orders (new orders for homes less cancellations) generated during the current period minus the number of homes closed during the current period. Our backlog at any given time will be affected by cancellations, the number of our active communities and the timing of home closings. Homes in backlog are generally closed within one to two months, although home closings have been, and may continue to be, delayed during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we may experience cancellations of purchase contracts at any time prior to closing. It is important to note that net orders, backlog and cancellation metrics are operational, rather than accounting data, and should be used only as a general gauge to evaluate performance. Backlog may be impacted by customer cancellations for various reasons that are beyond our control, and in light of our minimal required deposit, there is little negative impact to the potential homebuyer from the cancellation of the purchase contract.
As of the dates set forth below, our net orders, cancellation rate, and ending backlog homes and value were as follows (dollars in thousands):
(1)Net orders are new (gross) orders for the purchase of homes during the period, less cancellations of existing purchase contracts during the period.
(2)Cancellation rate for a period is the total number of purchase contracts cancelled during the period divided by the total new (gross) orders for the purchase of homes during the period.
(3)Ending backlog consists of homes at the end of the period that are under a purchase contract that has been signed by homebuyers who have met our preliminary financing criteria but have not yet closed and wholesale contracts for which vertical construction is generally set to occur within the next six to twelve months. Ending backlog is valued at the contract amount.
(4)As of December 31, 2020, we have 1,139 units related to bulk sales agreements associated with our wholesale business.
(5)As of December 31, 2019, we have 481 units related to bulk sales agreements associated with our wholesale business, of which 117 units and values are not included in the table above.
(6)As of December 31, 2018, we have 163 units related to bulk sales agreements associated with our wholesale business, of which 92 units and values are not included in the table above.

Seasonality
In all of our reportable segments, we have historically experienced similar variability in our results of operations and in capital requirements from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding industry. We generally close more homes in our second, third and fourth quarters. Thus, our revenues may fluctuate on a quarterly basis, and we may have higher capital requirements in our second, third and fourth quarters in order to maintain our inventory levels. Our revenues and capital requirements are generally similar across our second, third and fourth quarters.
As a result of seasonal activity, our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular quarter, especially the first quarter, are not necessarily representative of the results we expect at year end. We expect this seasonal pattern to continue in the long term.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
As of December 31, 2020, we had $35.9 million of cash and cash equivalents. Cash flows for each of our active communities depend on the status of the development cycle and can differ substantially from reported earnings. Early stages of development or expansion require significant cash outlays for land acquisitions, land development, plats, vertical development, construction of information centers, general landscaping and other amenities. Because these costs are a component of our inventory and are not recognized in our statement of operations until a home closes, we incur significant cash outflows prior to recognition of home sales revenues. In the later stages of an active community, cash inflows may exceed home sales revenues reported for financial statement purposes, as the costs associated with home and land construction were previously incurred.
Our principal uses of capital are operating expenses, land and lot purchases, lot development, home construction, interest costs on our indebtedness and the payment of various liabilities. In addition, we may purchase land, lots, homes under construction or other assets as part of an acquisition.
We generally rely on our ability to finance our operations by generating operating cash flows, borrowing under the Credit Agreement or the issuance and sale of shares of our common stock. As needed, we will consider accessing the debt and equity capital markets as part of our ongoing financing strategy. We also rely on our ability to obtain performance, payment and completion surety bonds as well as letters of credit to finance our projects.
We have an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-227012) that was filed on August 24,
2018 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, registering the offering and sale of an indeterminate amount of debt securities, guarantees of debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, depositary shares, purchase contracts and units that include any of these securities. Under the shelf registration statement, we have the ability to access the debt and equity capital markets as needed as part of our ongoing financing strategy.
While the COVID-19 pandemic and related mitigation efforts have created significant uncertainty as to general economic and housing market conditions, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that we will be able to fund our current and foreseeable liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months with our cash on hand, cash generated from operations and cash expected to be available from the Credit Agreement or through accessing debt or equity capital, as needed. However, with the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, our ability to engage in the transactions described above may be constrained by volatile or tight economic, capital, credit and financial market conditions, as well as moderated investor or lender interest or capacity and our liquidity, leverage and net worth, and we can provide no assurance as to successfully completing, the costs of, or the operational limitations arising from any one or series of such transactions.
Revolving Credit Facility
On April 30, 2020, we entered into the Second Amendment to Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Second Amendment”), which amends the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of May 6, 2019 (as amended by the Lender Addition and Acknowledgement Agreement and First Amendment to Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of December 6, 2019, the “2019 Credit Agreement” and, together with the Second Amendment, the “Credit Agreement”), with several financial institutions, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent. In the Second Amendment, certain lenders agreed to extend the maturity of their commitments, while another lender agreed to extend the maturity of its commitment subsequent to the execution of the Second Amendment. Lenders with $566.0 million, or 87%, of the $650.0 million of commitments under the 2019 Credit Agreement agreed to extend the maturity of their commitments to May 31, 2023, with the remaining lenders retaining their existing maturity of May 31, 2022. The Second Amendment also reduced the minimum EBITDA to interest expense ratio from 2.50 to 1.75, increased the sublimit for letters of credit to $40.0 million and established a London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) floor of 0.70%. The Credit Agreement
otherwise has substantially similar terms and provisions to the 2019 Credit Agreement and continues to provide for a $650.0 million revolving credit facility, which can be increased at the request of the Company by up to $100.0 million, subject to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement.
The Credit Agreement matures on May 31, 2023 with respect to 87% of the commitments thereunder and on May 31, 2022 with respect to 13% of the commitments thereunder. Before each anniversary of the Credit Agreement, we may request a one-year extension of its maturity date. The Credit Agreement is guaranteed by each of our subsidiaries that have gross assets equal to or greater than $0.5 million. The borrowings and letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement, together with the outstanding principal balance of our 6.875% Senior Notes due 2026 (the “Senior Notes”), may not exceed the borrowing base under the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, the borrowing base under the Credit Agreement was $949.6 million, of which borrowings, including the Senior Notes, of $546.6 million were outstanding, $10.5 million of letters of credit were outstanding and $392.5 million was available to borrow under the Credit Agreement.
Interest is paid monthly on borrowings under the Credit Agreement at LIBOR plus 2.35%. The Credit Agreement applicable margin for LIBOR loans ranges from 2.35% to 2.75% based on our leverage ratio. At December 31, 2020, LIBOR was 0.15%; however, the Credit Agreement has a 0.70% LIBOR floor.
The Credit Agreement requires us to maintain (i) a tangible net worth of not less than $625.0 million plus 75% of the net proceeds of all equity issuances plus 50.0% of the amount of our positive net income in any fiscal quarter after December 31, 2019, (ii) a leverage ratio of not greater than 60.0%, (iii) liquidity of at least $50.0 million and (iv) a ratio of EBITDA to interest expense for the most recent four quarters of at least 1.75 to 1.00. The Credit Agreement contains various covenants that, among other restrictions, limit the amount of our additional debt and our ability to make certain investments. At December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the Credit Agreement.
In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom (the “FCA”), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021. On November 30, 2020, the FCA and ICE Benchmark Administration, which administers LIBOR quotations, announced a consultation on the extension of the quotation of most LIBOR tenors to June 30, 2023 for legacy contracts only. At the present time, the Credit Agreement has a term that extends to May 31, 2023 with respect to 87% of the commitments thereunder and to May 31, 2022 with respect to 13% of the commitments thereunder, and borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin. The Credit Agreement provides for a mechanism to amend the Credit Agreement to reflect the establishment of an alternate rate of interest upon the occurrence of certain events related to the phase-out of any applicable interest rate. However, we have not yet pursued any technical amendment or other contractual alternative to address this matter. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the eventual replacement of the LIBOR interest rate on the Credit Agreement.
Senior Notes Offering
On July 6, 2018, we issued $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes in an offering to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in the United States pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and to certain non-U.S. persons in transactions outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. Interest on the Senior Notes accrues at a rate of 6.875% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing on January 15, 2019, and the Senior Notes mature on July 15, 2026. Terms of the Senior Notes are governed by an Indenture and First Supplemental Indenture thereto, each dated as of July 6, 2018, and a Second Supplemental Indenture thereto, dated as of April 30, 2020, as may be supplemented from time to time, among us, our subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under the Credit Agreement and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee.
Convertible Notes
On November 15, 2019, our 4.25% Convertible Notes due 2019 (the “Convertible Notes”) matured, which resulted in the principal payment of $70.0 million and the issuance of 2,381,751 shares of our common stock for the premium associated with the Convertible Notes.
Letters of Credit, Surety Bonds and Financial Guarantees
We are often required to provide letters of credit and surety bonds to secure our performance under construction contracts, development agreements and other arrangements. The amount of such obligations outstanding at any time varies in accordance with our pending development activities. In the event any such bonds or letters of credit are drawn upon, we would be obligated to reimburse the issuer of such bonds or letters of credit.
Under these letters of credit, surety bonds and financial guarantees, we are committed to perform certain development and construction activities and provide certain guarantees in the normal course of business. Outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and financial guarantees under these arrangements, totaled $143.8 million as of December 31, 2020. Although significant
development and construction activities have been completed related to the improvements at these sites, the letters of credit and surety bonds are not generally released until all development and construction activities are completed. We do not believe that it is probable that any outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds or financial guarantees as of December 31, 2020 will be drawn upon.
Stock Repurchase Program
In November 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors (the “Board”) authorized a stock repurchase program, pursuant to which we may purchase up to $50.0 million of shares of our common stock through open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise in accordance with applicable laws. On October 30, 2020, the Board approved an increase in our stock repurchase program by an additional $300.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased 718,993 shares of our common stock for $48.1 million to be held as treasury stock. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock. A total of 757,993 shares of our common stock has been repurchased since our stock repurchase program commenced. As of December 31, 2020, we may purchase up to $300.4 million of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program. The timing, amount and other terms and conditions of any repurchases of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program will be determined by our management at its discretion based on a variety of factors, including the market price of our common stock, corporate considerations, general market and economic conditions and legal requirements. Our stock repurchase program may be modified, discontinued or suspended at any time.
Cash Flows
Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities was $202.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. The primary drivers of operating cash flows are typically cash earnings and changes in inventory levels, including land acquisition and development. Net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by net income of $323.9 million, offset by cash outflows from the $70.2 million increase in the net change in real estate inventory, which was primarily related to our homes under construction and land acquisitions and development level of activity and a $59.5 million increase in the net change in accounts receivable.
Net cash used in operating activities was $41.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The primary drivers of operating cash flows are typically cash earnings and changes in inventory levels, including land acquisition and development. Net cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily driven by net income of $178.6 million, and included cash outlays for the $266.6 million increase in the net change in real estate inventory, which was primarily related to our homes under construction and land acquisitions and development level of activity, offset by changes in non-inventory balances of $46.1 million.
Net cash used in operating activities was $116.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily driven by net income of $155.3 million, and included cash outlays for the $234.7 million increase in the net change in real estate inventory, which was primarily related to our homes under construction and land acquisitions and development level of activity and additional cash outlays due to changes in non-inventory balances of $37.3 million.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $5.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, which reflects the purchase of property and equipment.
Net cash used in investing activities was $1.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, which reflects the purchase of property and equipment.
Net cash used in investing activities was $74.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to the business acquisition of Wynn Homes in 2018.
Financing Activities
Net cash used by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $198.9 million, primarily driven by $530.0 million of payments under the Credit Agreement and by the $48.1 million payment for shares of our common stock repurchased under our stock repurchase program to be held as treasury stock, offset by borrowings of $377.1 million under the Credit Agreement.
Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 was $35.4 million, primarily driven by net borrowings of $105.5 million under the Credit Agreement, offset by the principal payment of $70.0 million on the Convertible Notes upon their maturity.
Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $170.7 million, primarily driven by net borrowings from the issuance of $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes, net payments of $106.2 million under the 2018 Credit Agreement and payments of $15.0 million on the Convertible Notes, partially offset by loan issuance costs.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In the ordinary course of business, we enter into land purchase contracts in order to procure land and lots for the construction of our homes. We are subject to customary obligations associated with entering into contracts for the purchase of land and improved lots. These contracts typically require cash deposits and the purchase of properties under these contracts is generally contingent upon satisfaction of certain requirements by the sellers, which may include obtaining applicable property and development entitlements or the completion of development activities and the delivery of finished lots. We also utilize contracts with land sellers as a method of acquiring lots and land in staged takedowns, which helps us manage the financial and market risk associated with land holdings and minimize the use of funds from our corporate financing sources. Such contracts generally require a non-refundable deposit for the right to acquire land or lots over a specified period of time at pre-determined prices. We generally have the right at our discretion to terminate our obligations under purchase contracts during the initial feasibility period and receive a refund of our deposit, or we may terminate the contracts after the end of the feasibility period by forfeiting our cash deposit with no further financial obligations to the land seller. In addition, our deposit may also be refundable if the land seller does not satisfy all conditions precedent in the respective contract. As of December 31, 2020, we had $34.1 million of cash deposits pertaining to land purchase contracts for 26,236 lots with an aggregate purchase price of $663.0 million. Approximately $24.0 million of the cash deposits as of December 31, 2020 are secured by third-party guarantees or indemnity mortgages on the related property.
Our utilization of land purchase contracts is dependent on, among other things, the availability of land sellers willing to enter into contracts at acceptable terms, which may include option takedown arrangements, the availability of capital to financial intermediaries to finance the development of optioned lots, general housing conditions, and local market dynamics. Land purchase contracts may be more difficult to procure from land sellers in strong housing markets and are more prevalent in certain markets.
Inflation
Our business can be adversely impacted by inflation, primarily from higher land, financing, labor, material, and construction costs. In addition, inflation can lead to higher mortgage rates, which can significantly affect the affordability of mortgage financing to homebuyers.
Contractual Obligations
The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods.
(a)Represents borrowings under the Credit Agreement, which matures on May 31, 2023 with respect to 87% of the commitments thereunder and on May 31, 2022 with respect to 13% of the commitments thereunder. See Note 7 “Notes Payable” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our long-term debt.
(b)Represents $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.875% Senior Notes due 2026. The Senior Notes mature on July 15, 2026. See Note 7 “Notes Payable” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our long-term debt.
(c)The Company owns lots in certain communities that have Community Development Districts or similar utility and infrastructure development special assessment programs that allocate a fixed amount of debt service associated with development activities to each lot. Such obligations represent a non-cash cost of the lots.
(d)All of the outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement are at variable rates based on LIBOR, or subject to an interest rate floor. The interest rate for our variable rate indebtedness as of December 31, 2020 was LIBOR plus 2.35%. Fees under the Credit Agreement are approximately $0.1 million per year. Interest on the Senior Notes accrues at a rate of 6.875% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year. Inventory related obligations for infrastructure development attached to the land are subject to a fixed interest rate generally ranging from 3.93% to 7.32%, typically payable over a 30 year period, and are ultimately assumed by the homebuyer when home sales are closed.
Critical Accounting Policies
Discussed below are accounting policies that we believe are critical because of the significance of the activity to which they relate or because they require the use of significant judgment in their application.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled by applying the following five-step process specified in the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).”
•Identify the contract(s) with a customer
•Identify the performance obligations
•Determine the transaction price
•Allocate the transaction price
•Recognize revenue when the performance obligations are met
Our contracts with customers include a single performance obligation to transfer a completed home to the customer. We generally determine selling price per home on the expected cost plus margin. Our contracts contain no significant financing terms as customers who finance do so through a third party. Performance obligations are satisfied at a moment in time when the home is complete and control of the asset is transferred to the customer at closing. Home sales proceeds are generally received from the title company within a few business days after closing.
Sales and broker commissions are incremental costs incurred to obtain a contract with a customer that would not have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained. Sales and broker commissions are expensed upon fulfillment of a home closing. Advertising costs are costs to obtain a contract that would have been incurred regardless of whether the contract was obtained and are recognized as an expense when incurred. Sales and broker commissions and advertising costs are recorded within sales and marketing expense presented in our consolidated statements of operations as selling expenses.
Real Estate Inventory and Cost of Home Sales
Inventory consists of land, land under development, finished lots, information centers, homes in progress and completed homes. Inventory is stated at cost unless the carrying amount is determined not to be recoverable, in which case inventory is written down to fair value.
Pre-acquisition costs, land, development and other project costs, including interest and property taxes, incurred during development and home construction, and net of expected reimbursements of development costs, are capitalized to real estate inventory. Pre-acquisition costs, land development and other common costs that benefit the entire community, including field construction supervision and related direct overhead, are allocated to individual lots or homes, as appropriate, on a pro rata basis which we believe approximates the costs that would be determined using an allocation method based on relative sales values since the individual lots or homes within a community are similar in value.
Changes to estimated total development costs subsequent to initial home closings in a community are allocated to the remaining unsold homes in the community on a prospective basis. Home construction costs and related carrying charges are allocated to the cost of individual homes using the specific identification method and are capitalized as they are incurred. Capitalized interest, property taxes, and other carrying costs are generally capitalized to real estate inventory from the point development begins to the point construction is completed. Costs associated with homes closed are charged to cost of sales simultaneously with revenue recognition.
Impairment of Real Estate Inventories
In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, real estate inventory is evaluated for indicators of impairment by each community during each reporting period. In conducting our review for indicators of impairment on a community level, we evaluate, among other things, the margins on homes that have been closed, communities with slow moving inventory, projected margins on future home sales over the life of the community, and the
estimated fair value of the land. We pay particular attention to communities in which inventory is moving at a slower than anticipated absorption pace and communities whose average sales prices and/or margins are trending downward and are anticipated to continue to trend downward. Due largely to the relatively short development and construction periods for our communities and our growth, we have experienced limited circumstances during 2020, 2019 or 2018 that are indicators of impairment. Our future sales and margins may be impacted by our inability to realize continued growth, increased cost associated with holding and developing land, local economic factors, pressure on home sales prices, increased carrying costs, and insufficient access to labor and materials at reasonable costs. For individual communities with indicators of impairment, we perform additional analysis to estimate the community’s undiscounted future cash flows. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are greater than the carrying value of the asset, no impairment adjustment is required. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the asset’s carrying value, the asset is impaired and is written down to its fair value. We estimate the fair value of communities using a discounted cash flow model; changes to the expected cash flows may lead to changes in the outcome of our impairment analysis.
The life cycle of a community generally ranges from two to five years, commencing with the acquisition of land, continuing through the land development phase and concluding with the construction and sale of homes. A constructed home is used as the community information center during the life of the community and then sold. Actual individual community lives will vary based on the size of the community, the sales absorption rate and whether the property was purchased as raw land or finished lots.
Impairment of Land and Land Under Development
For raw land, land under development and completed lots that our management anticipates will be utilized for future homebuilding activities or to be sold as finished lots to individuals, the recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets based on home or lot sales, consistent with the evaluation of operating communities discussed above. As of December 31, 2020, we had not identified any raw land, land under development or completed lots that management intends to market for sale in bulk to a third-party.
Pre-acquisition Costs and Controlled Lots Not Owned
We enter into land purchase agreements in the ordinary course of business in order to secure land for the construction of homes in the future. Pursuant to these agreements, we typically provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future, usually at predetermined prices. We do not have title to the property and our obligations with respect to the contracts are generally limited to the forfeiture of the related nonrefundable cash deposits.
To the extent that any deposits are nonrefundable and the associated land acquisition process is terminated or no longer determined probable, the deposit and any related pre-acquisition costs (e.g. due diligence costs) are charged to general and administrative expense. We review the likelihood of the acquisition of contracted lots in conjunction with our periodic real estate impairment analysis.
Warranty Reserves
We typically provide homebuyers with a one-year warranty on the house and a ten-year limited warranty for major defects in structural elements. Estimated future direct warranty costs are accrued and charged to cost of sales in connection with our home sales.
Our warranty liability is based upon historical warranty cost experience on a per house basis established based on (i) trends in historical warranty payment levels, (ii) the historical range of amounts paid per house, (iii) any warranty expenditures not considered to be normal and recurring, and is adjusted as appropriate to reflect qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built, the geographic areas in which they are built, and potential impacts of our expansion. Our analysis also considers improvements in quality control and construction techniques expected to impact future warranty expenditures and the expertise of our personnel. Our warranty reserves are reviewed quarterly to assess the reasonableness and adequacy and we make adjustments to the balance of the pre-existing reserves, as needed, to reflect changes in trends and historical data as information becomes available.
Taxes
We utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities, changes in tax rate are recognized in the year of enactment. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized. Our ability to realize deferred tax assets is assessed throughout the year and a valuation allowance is established, if required. We recognize the impact of a tax position only if it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on the technical
merits of the position. We recognize potential interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense, as applicable.
