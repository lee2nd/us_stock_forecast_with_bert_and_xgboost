Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing in this Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and operations, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K captioned “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” for a discussion of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.
Management’s Focus
For the year ended December 31, 2020, management’s focus revolved around preserving and enhancing liquidity and reducing costs in light of the significant impacts of the B737 MAX grounding and COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, management focused on operational execution, with a focus on safety and quality, while working to meet our customers' requirements, and pursuing and completing organic and inorganic growth opportunities.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, management’s focus is expected to be on continued preservation and enhancement of our liquidity and cost reduction in light of the continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic; revenue growth and diversification, integrating the Belfast, Morocco and Dallas sites; repaying and/or restructuring debt; and operational execution, with a continuing focus on safety and quality.
COVID-19
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to have a significant negative impact on the aviation industry, our customers, and our business globally. In response to the pandemic, we and our customers implemented production suspensions and our customers adjusted production rates. Our customers may reduce or alter production rates again if circumstances require. A description of Airbus and Boeing's production rates on our significant programs is included below. We expect the pandemic and its effects to continue to have a significant negative impact on our business for the duration of the pandemic and during the subsequent economic recovery, which could be an extended period of time.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have enacted our crisis management and response process as part of our enterprise risk management program to help us navigate the challenges we face due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Actions that we have taken include the following:
•Organized global teams to monitor the situation and recommend appropriate actions;
•Implemented travel restrictions for our employees;
•Enforced social-distancing standards throughout the workplace and mandated mask use;
•Initiated consistent and ongoing cleaning of high-touch work space;
•Established processes aligned with CDC guidelines to work with exposed individuals on necessary quarantine periods and the process to return to work; and
•Implemented working from home where practicable.
The Company has taken several actions to reduce costs, increase liquidity and strengthen our financial position in light of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the B737 MAX grounding (further described below), including the following:
•Reduced pay for all executives by 20 percent through January 4, 2021;
•Reduced 2020-2021 term non-employee director compensation by 15 percent;
•Reduced planned capital expenditures and operating expenses;
•Suspended share repurchase program;
•Reduced quarterly dividends to one penny per share;
•Initiated multiple production worker furloughs;
•Reduced pay for all U.S based, salaried employees and implemented a correlating four-day work week, which remains in place for its salaried workforce at its Wichita, Kansas facility through January 4, 2021;
•Reduced ~6,800 employees globally including voluntary packages;
•Amended and eventually terminated our 2018 Credit Agreement and put into place current Credit Agreement for $400 million;
•Issued $1.2 billion in Second Lien 2025 Notes and $500 million in First Lien 2025 Notes; and
•Elected to defer the payment of $32.9 million of employer payroll taxes incurred through December 31, 2020, as provided by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the "CARES Act"), of which 50% is required to be deposited by December 2021 and the remaining 50% by December 2022 and accrued a pre-tax benefit related to the Employee Retention Credit related to paid employee furloughs of approximately $16.0 million. The Company will continue to evaluate its eligibility for this credit through June 2021. In addition, as of December 31, 2020 the Company recorded a deferral of $31.5 million of VAT payments until March 2022 under the United Kingdom deferral scheme and received Employee Retention Credit subsidies from U.K. government of approximately $5.4 million.
If OEM production rates decline in the future or the expected pandemic recovery timeline lengthens, the Company will evaluate further cost reduction actions, including additional workforce actions. For additional information, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”
B737 Program
The B737 MAX program is a critical program to the Company. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020, approximately 56%, 53%, and 19% of our net revenues were generated from sales of components to Boeing for the B737 aircraft, respectively. While we have entered into long-term supply agreements with Boeing to continue to provide components for the B737 for the life of the aircraft program, including commercial and military P-8 derivatives, Boeing does not have any obligation to purchase components from us for any replacement for the B737 that is not a commercial derivative model as defined by the Sustaining Agreement. The contract is a requirements contract and Boeing can reduce the purchase volume at any time.
In March 2019, the B737 MAX fleet was grounded in the U.S. and internationally following the 2018 and 2019 accidents involving two B737 MAX aircraft. On November 18, 2020, the FAA issued an order rescinding the grounding of the B737 MAX and published an Airworthiness Directive specifying design changes that must be made before the aircraft returns to service. Since November 2020, regulators from Brazil, Canada, the EU and U.K. have taken similar actions to unground the B737 MAX and permit return to service after aircraft owners and operators incorporate the required changes to the aircraft. According to Boeing, other global regulatory approvals/certifications are expected in 2021.
Due to impacts of the B737 MAX grounding and the COVID-19 pandemic on the aviation industry, the Company has experienced significant deterioration in its B737 MAX production rates that have significantly reduced the Company’s revenues. A summary of the production rate changes is below.
•On April 12, 2019, Boeing and the Company executed a Memorandum of Agreement (the “2019 MOA”) providing that the Company was to maintain its delivery rate of 52 shipsets per month with respect to the B737 MAX. Previously, the Company was expecting to increase production to a rate of 57 shipsets per month in 2019;
•On December 19, 2019, Boeing directed the Company to stop all B737 MAX deliveries to Boeing effective January 1, 2020. Accordingly, Spirit suspended all B737 MAX production beginning on January 1, 2020;
•On February 6, 2020, Boeing and Spirit entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (the “2020 MOA”) largely superseding the 2019 MOA and providing for Spirit to deliver to Boeing 216 B737 MAX shipsets in 2020;
•On May 4, 2020, Boeing and the Company agreed that Spirit would deliver 125 B737 MAX shipsets to Boeing in 2020; and
•On June 19, 2020, Boeing directed Spirit to reduce its 2020 B737 production plan from 125 to 72 shipsets (increasing to 31 shipsets per month in 2022).
Boeing's deliveries of the B737 MAX resumed in the fourth quarter of 2020 when the FAA rescinded the order that grounded B737 MAX aircraft in the U.S.. Several air carriers have resumed flights on the aircraft, and Boeing received its first orders for the B737 MAX since the grounding.
In the year ended December 31, 2021, we expect ongoing demand challenges from the 737 MAX grounding will continue to be exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic because other programs that mitigate the strain of the lower B737 MAX
production rate continue to be suspended or producing at lower rates. We expect air travel demand will improve from 2020 levels as the COVID-19 vaccinations are administered globally; however, any improvement in air travel demand will depend on, among other things, the widespread distribution, use and effectiveness of vaccines and the speed with which COVID-19 may mutate. The overall pace of any recovery of air travel demand will depend on availability and speed of vaccinations, effectiveness of the vaccine on new strains of the COVID-19 virus, government travel restrictions, availability and speed of test results. We expect that domestic air travel demand will recover sooner than international air travel demand and, as a result, we expect that the B737 MAX and other narrowbody production rates will recover to pre-pandemic levels before widebody production rates. For additional information, see Item 1A. "Risk Factors."
B787 Program
In the year ended December 31, 2020, Boeing announced B787 production rate changes from 10 aircraft per month to 5 aircraft per month. This resulted in an incremental forward loss charge of $192.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, During the year ended December 31, 2020 our focus was on achieving cost reductions in our manufacturing and supply chain.
During the fourth quarter of 2020, as Boeing was reviewing its 787 Dreamliner production system, we began analyzing our own 787 production system. That work is ongoing. With the data we have collected so far and based upon requests from Boeing, we have identified potential rework, which we will begin in order to help facilitate the resumption of deliveries by our customer. Further production rate changes or claims relating to inspection and rework costs could result in additional incremental forward loss charges.
Due to B787 production issues, in the first quarter of 2021, B787 employees were temporarily furloughed for three weeks. We expect there will be future headcount reductions to align to reduced production rates.
Airbus Programs
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact both international and global travel and, as a result, all Airbus programs have experienced production rate reductions. Current production rates for Airbus commercial programs are captured below:
•A220 Wing average production volume of ~4.2 APM for 2021;
•A320 average production volume of 40 APM;
•A350 average production volume of 3.5 APM in 2020, increasing to 5 APM end of 2021; and
•A330 average production volume of 2 APM.
As a result of customer driven production rate changes, the A350 program recorded forward loss charges of $147.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The A220 wing and mid-fuselage sections acquired from Bombardier had forward loss liabilities of $258.6 million in the opening balance sheet as a result of the application of ASC 805 Business Combinations, see Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Acquisitions.
Asco Acquisition
On May 1, 2018, the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary Spirit AeroSystems Belgium Holdings BVBA (“Spirit Belgium”) entered into a definitive agreement (as amended, the “Asco Purchase Agreement”) with certain private sellers providing for the purchase by Spirit Belgium of all of the issued and outstanding equity of S.R.I.F. N.V., the parent company of Asco Industries N.V. (“Asco”). On September 25, 2020, the Company, Spirit Belgium and the Sellers entered into an amendment to the Asco Purchase Agreement (the “Termination Agreement”) pursuant to which the parties agreed to terminate the Asco Purchase Agreement, including all schedules and annexes thereto (other than certain confidentiality agreements) (collectively with the Asco Purchase Agreement, the “Transaction Documents”), effective as of September 25, 2020. Under the Termination Agreement, the parties also agreed to release each other from any and all claims, rights of action, howsoever arising, of every kind and nature, in connection with, arising out of, based upon or related to, directly or indirectly, the Transaction Documents, including any breach, non-performance, action or failure to act under the Transaction Documents.
Bombardier Acquisition
On October 30, 2020, Spirit and Spirit AeroSystems Global Holdings Limited (“Spirit UK”), wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company, completed their previously announced acquisition of the outstanding equity of Shorts and Bombardier Aerospace North Africa SAS ("BANA"), and substantially all the assets of the maintenance, repair and overhaul business in Dallas, Texas (collectively, the “Bombardier Acquired Business”), along with the assumption of certain liabilities of Shorts and BANA (the “Bombardier Acquisition”). For further information, see Note 29 Acquisitions.
The Company, acting through certain of its subsidiaries, assumed certain liabilities of the acquired entities, including the net pension liabilities under the Shorts Pension scheme and Short’s obligations under a repayable investment agreement with the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy of the U.K. Government. On the first anniversary of closing, Shorts will pay a special contribution of £100 million to the Shorts Pension scheme. The A220 wing and mid-fuselage sections acquired from Bombardier had forward loss liability of $258.6 million in the opening balance sheet as a result of the application of ASC 805 Business Combinations.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of the Company’s financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”) requires management to use estimates and assumptions. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, including the impacts of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to inventory, revenue, income taxes, financing obligations, warranties, pensions and other post-retirement benefits, and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Management believes that the quality and reasonableness of our most critical accounting policies enable the fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations. However, the sensitivity of financial statements to these methods, assumptions, and estimates could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions. We believe application of these policies requires difficult, subjective, and complex judgments to estimate the effect of inherent uncertainties. This section should be read in conjunction with Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
Revenues and Profit Recognition
Beginning January 1, 2018, the Company adopted recognition of revenue using the principles of ASC 606 (“ASC 606”), Revenue from contracts with customers. Revenue is recognized when, or as, control of promised products or services transfers to a customer, and the amount recognized reflects the consideration that the Company expected to receive in exchange for those products or services. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for a further description of revenue recognition under ASC 606. In determining our profits and losses in accordance with this method, we are required to make significant judgments regarding our future costs, variable elements of revenue, the standalone selling price, and other variables. We continually review and update our assumptions based on market trends and our most recent experience. If we make material changes to our assumptions, we may have positive or negative cumulative catch-up adjustments related to revenues previously recognized, and in some cases, we may adjust forward loss reserves. When we experience abnormal production costs such as excess capacity costs the Company will expense the excess costs in the period incurred and report as segment costs of goods sold. These excess costs (actual and estimated future costs) are excluded from the estimates at completion of our accounting contracts with customers. For a broader description of the various types of risks we face related to new and maturing programs, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors”.
Business Combinations and Goodwill
We account for business combinations in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations. Transaction costs related to business combinations are expensed as incurred. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are measured and recognized based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date, any excess of the purchase consideration when compared to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. For material acquisitions, we have engaged independent advisory consultants to assist us with determining the fair value of assets acquired, including goodwill, and liabilities assumed based on established business valuation methodologies. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires significant judgment, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates and discount rates. In some cases, the Company used discounted cash flow analyses, which were based on our best estimate of future sales, earnings and cash flows after considering such factors as general market conditions, customer budgets, existing firm and future orders, changes in working capital, long term business plans and recent operating performance. Use of different estimates and judgments could yield materially different results. If the initial accounting for the business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the acquisition occurs, the business combination is recorded and disclosed on a preliminary basis. Subsequent to the acquisition date, and not later than one year from the acquisition date, adjustments to the initial preliminary recognized amounts are recorded to the extent new information is obtained about the measurement of assets and liabilities that existed as of the date of the acquisition.
The Company assesses goodwill for impairment annually as of the first day of the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit that includes goodwill may be lower than its carrying
value. We test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or quantitative test at the reporting unit level. In performing a qualitative assessment, we evaluate company-specific, market and industry, economic, and other relevant factors that may impact the fair value of our reporting units or the carrying value of the net assets of the respective reporting unit. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the respective reporting unit, then a quantitative test is performed. Where the quantitative test is used, we compare the carrying value of net assets to the estimated fair value of the respective reporting unit. If the fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized for the amount that the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
In accordance with our annual assessment policy, we performed a qualitative assessment of goodwill for impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter based on the goodwill balances that existed as of October 1, 2020. The goodwill balance at October 1, 2020 was $78.4 million, of which $76.0 million represents the purchase price in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition of FMI in the first quarter of year 2020. Management concluded through the assessment that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than the respective carrying value, and therefore, the Company's goodwill as of October 1, 2020 was not impaired. The variability of the factors used in our assessment depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and whether the impacts of the pandemic could result in an impairment of our goodwill. Our current estimates reflect potential production rate reduction scenarios for our primary customers that are not permanent in nature as we assume there will be an economic recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and global passenger levels will ultimately return to COVID- 19 2019 levels.
After consideration of the Bombardier Acquisition on October 30, 2020 the total amount of goodwill is $565.3 million. As of December 31, 2020, given the preliminary nature of the Bombardier Acquisition purchase price allocation, the Company has not yet allocated the Bombardier acquisition goodwill to the relevant reporting units and/or reportable segments.
Pension
Many of our employees have earned benefits under the defined benefit pension plans. Effective June 17, 2005, pension assets and liabilities were spun-off from three Boeing qualified plans into four qualified Spirit plans for each Spirit employee who did not retire from Boeing by August 1, 2005. Effective December 31, 2005, all four qualified plans were merged together. In addition, Spirit has one nonqualified plan providing supplemental benefits to executives who transferred from a Boeing nonqualified plan to a Spirit plan and elected to keep their benefits in this plan. Both plans are frozen as of the date of the Boeing Acquisition (i.e., no future service benefits are being earned in these plans). The Company intends to fund its qualified pension plan through a trust. Pension assets are placed in trust solely for the benefit of the pension plans’ participants and are structured to maintain liquidity that is sufficient to pay benefit obligations.
On April 1, 2006, as part of the acquisition of BAE Aerostructures, the Company established a U.K. defined benefit pension plan for those employees based in Prestwick that had pension benefits remaining in BAE Systems’ pension plan. Effective December 31, 2013, this Prestwick pension plan was closed and benefits were frozen and thereafter subject only to statutory pension revaluation.
On October 30, 2020, as part of the Bombardier Acquisition, the Company acquired two further defined benefit plans (including the Shorts Pension) for current and former employees at the Belfast location. These plans are currently open to the future accrual of benefits but closed to new hires. In accordance with legislation, each of the U.K. plans and their assets are managed by independent trustee companies.
Accounting guidance require an annual measurement of our projected obligation and plan assets. These measurements are based upon several assumptions, including the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of asset return. Future changes in assumptions or differences between actual and expected outcomes can significantly affect our future annual expense, projected benefit obligation and shareholders’ equity.
The projected benefit obligation and net periodic pension cost are sensitive to discount rates. The projected benefit obligation would decrease by $182.0 million or increase by $193.4 million if the discount rate increased or decreased by 25 basis points. The 2020 net periodic pension cost would increase by $3.5 million or decrease by $3.9 million if the discount rate increased or decreased by 25 basis points at each applicable measurement date. Additionally, net periodic pension cost is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. A decrease or increase of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2020 net periodic pension cost by $9.5 million.
For additional information, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors - We could be required to make future contributions to our defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans as a result of adverse changes in interest rates and the capital markets. Adverse changes in the securities markets or interest rates, changes in actuarial assumptions, and legislative or other regulatory
actions could substantially increase the costs of these plans and could result in a requirement to contribute additional funds to the plans, including the Shorts Pension acquired in the Bombardier Acquisition.”
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) authoritative guidance on accounting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future income tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts for existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Tax rate changes impacting these assets and liabilities are recognized in the period during which the rate change occurs.
Deferred tax assets are periodically evaluated to determine their recoverability and whether or not a valuation allowance is necessary. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. When determining the amount of net deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized, we assess all available positive and negative evidence. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified.
This assessment is completed on a taxing jurisdiction and entity filing basis. Based on these criteria and the relative weighting of both the positive and negative evidence available, and in particular the activity surrounding the Company’s prior earnings history including the forward losses previously recognized in the U.S. and U.K., Management determined that it was necessary to establish a valuation allowance against nearly all of its net U.S. and U.K. deferred tax assets at December 31, 2020. This determination was made as the Company anticipates it will enter into a U.S. cumulative loss position during the first half of 2021, as prior period positive earnings fall outside of the three-year measurement period. Additionally, segments of the UK operations are in cumulative loss positions after the inclusion of 2020 losses.
We record income tax provision or benefit based on the pre-tax income earned or net loss incurred in each tax jurisdiction and the tax rate applicable to that income or loss. In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. These uncertainties are accounted for in accordance with FASB authoritative guidance on accounting for the uncertainty in income taxes. The final tax outcome for these matters may be different than management's original estimates made in determining the income tax provision. A change to these estimates could impact the effective tax rate and net income or loss in subsequent periods. We use the flow-through accounting method for tax credits. Under this method, tax credits reduce income tax expense. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Income Taxes, for further discussion.
Results of Operations
The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain of our operating data:

Comparative shipset deliveries by model are as follows:
_______________________________________
(1)Airbus acquired majority ownership in the C-Series program (subsequently renamed as the A220 program) in July 2018; all C-Series deliveries prior to the third quarter of 2018 are included in business and regional jets and all A220 deliveries subsequent to the acquisition are included in A220. Also included in the business and regional jets are deliveries related to the Bombardier Acquisition.
(2)Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, total business/regional jet deliveries includes deliveries related to the Bombardier Acquisition.
For purposes of measuring production or shipset deliveries for Boeing aircraft in a given period, the term “shipset” refers to sets of structural fuselage components produced or delivered for one aircraft in such period. For purposes of measuring production or shipset deliveries for Airbus and business and regional jet aircraft in a given period, the term “shipset” refers to all structural aircraft components produced or delivered for one aircraft in such period. For the purposes of measuring wing shipset deliveries, the term “shipset” refers to all wing components produced or delivered for one aircraft in such period. Other components that are part of the same aircraft shipsets could be produced or shipped in earlier or later accounting periods than the components used to measure production or shipset deliveries, which may result in slight variations in production or delivery quantities of the various shipset components in any given period.
Net revenues by prime customer are as follows:
Changes in Estimates
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we recognized unfavorable change in estimates of $400.7 million primarily driven by Boeing announced production rate changes on the B787 program from 10 aircraft per month to 5 aircraft per month, Airbus production rate changes on the A350 program from 9 aircraft per month to 4 aircraft per month and rate reductions across all programs due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, we recognized unfavorable changes in estimates of $65.5 million primarily driven by Boeing announced production rate change on the B787 program from 14 aircraft per month to 10 aircraft per month. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, there was a negligible amount of net change in estimates.
Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2020 as Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2019
Net Revenues. Net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 were $3,404.8 million, a decrease of $4,458.3 million, or 57%, compared with net revenues of $7,863.1 million, for the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to the B737 MAX grounding and lower production activity on the B787, B777, A350, and A320 programs due to COVID-19, partially offset by increased defense activity. Approximately 83% of the Company's net revenues in 2020 came from our two largest customers, Boeing and Airbus.
Deliveries to Boeing decreased to 256 shipsets during 2020, compared to 867 shipsets delivered in the prior year, primarily driven by production decreases on the B737, B777 and B787 programs. Deliveries to Airbus decreased to 591 shipsets during 2020, compared to 869 shipsets delivered in the prior year, primarily driven by decreased production of the A320 and A350 programs. Production deliveries of business/regional jet wing and wing components increased to 73 shipsets during 2020, compared to 55 shipsets delivered in the prior year, primarily driven by the Bombardier Acquisition.
Gross (Loss) Profit. Gross (loss) profit for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was $(440.7) million, as compared to $1,076.7 million for the same period in the prior year, a decrease of $1,517.4 million. The reduction in gross profit was primarily driven by the B737 MAX grounding, forward loss charges on the B787 and A350 programs due to reduced production rates, excess capacity production costs of $278.9 million, and temporary workforce reduction costs of $33.7 million due in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, net of the U.S. employee retention credit and U.K. government subsidies.
SG&A and Research and Development. SG&A expense was $24.0 million lower for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a reduction in headcount. Research and development expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was $15.7 million lower as compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to actions to preserve liquidity in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and B737 MAX grounding.
Restructuring Costs and Disposal of Assets. Restructuring costs were $73.0 million higher for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in the prior year for cost-alignment and headcount reductions as a result of the B737 MAX grounding and COVID-19 impacts. Losses on disposals of assets were $22.9 million higher for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.
Operating (Loss) Income. Operating (loss) income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was $(812.8) million, which was $1,573.6 million lower than operating income of $760.8 million for the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by decreased margins on the B737, B777 and A320 programs, $370.3 million of forward losses mainly driven by the B787 and A350 programs, excess capacity production costs of $278.9 million, and temporary workforce reduction costs of $33.7 million due to COVID-19, net of the U.S. employee retention credit and U.K. government subsidies. The Company also recognized restructuring costs of $73.0 million for cost-alignment and headcount reductions, and a $22.9 million loss from the disposal of assets.
Interest Expense and Financing Fee Amortization. Interest expense and financing fee amortization for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 included $160.3 million of interest and fees paid or accrued in connection with long-term debt and $17.5 million in amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount compared to $78.6 million of interest and fees paid or accrued in connection with long-term debt and $3.6 million in amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount for the prior year. The increase in interest expense was primarily as a result of the issuance of $1,200 million of Spirit’s 7.500% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2025 and $500 million of Spirit’s 5.500% Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2025.
Other (Expense) Income, net. Other expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was ($77.8) million, compared to other expense of ($5.8) million for the same period in the prior year. Other expense during 2020 was primarily driven by expenses related to a voluntary retirement program offered by the Company for cost alignment and headcount reductions and foreign exchange impact on the financial payment obligation under the repayable investment agreement between Shorts and the United Kingdom's Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy acquired as part of the Bombardier Acquisition.
Benefit (Provision) for Income Taxes. The income tax provision for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, was $220.2 million compared to $(132.8) million for the prior year. The 2020 effective tax rate was 20.3% as compared to 20.0% for 2019. The difference in the effective tax rate recorded for 2020 as compared to 2019 is primarily related to a valuation allowance recorded on nearly all deferred tax assets, a benefit from the CARES Act that enabled the Company to benefit from certain US net operating losses at the former 35% corporate tax rate, the non-deductibility of the wages and benefits related to the Employee Retention Credit, the generation of state income tax credits in a loss year, and the recognition of a previously unrecognized tax benefit due to a statute of limitation expiration.

Fuselage Systems, Propulsion Systems, Wing Systems, and All Other segments represented approximately 51%, 23%, 23%, and 3%, respectively, of our net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Fuselage Systems, Propulsion Systems, Wing Systems, and All Other segments represented approximately 54%, 26%, 20%, and less than 1%, respectively, of our net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. Fuselage Systems, Propulsion Systems, Wing Systems, and All Other segments represented approximately 55%, 24%, 21%, and less than 1%, respectively, of our net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018.
Fuselage Systems. Fuselage Systems segment net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 were $1,725.9 million, a decrease of $2,480.3 million, or 59%, compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease in revenue was
primarily due to lower production volumes on the B737 MAX, B787, B777, and A350 programs due to impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and B737 MAX grounding partially offset by increased defense activity and revenues from the businesses acquired in the Bombardier Acquisition. Fuselage Systems segment operating margins were (26%) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, compared to 11% for the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower margins recognized on the B737 MAX program due to significantly less deliveries, forward losses of $265.4 million on the B787 and A350 programs, excess capacity production costs of $175.0 million, temporary workforce impact of $19.0 million due to the COVID-19 pandemic net of U.S. employee retention credit, and restructuring costs of $41.3 million for cost alignment and headcount reductions. In 2020, the segment recorded unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $17.5 million and $274.3 million of net forward loss charges. In comparison, during 2019, the segment recorded unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $1.3 million and $37.9 million of net forward loss charges primarily due to production rate changes on the B787 program.
Propulsion Systems. Propulsion Systems segment net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 were $784.5 million, a decrease of $1,273.3 million, or 62%, compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to lower production volumes on the B737 MAX, B777, B787 and BR725 programs due to impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and B737 MAX grounding. Propulsion Systems segment operating margins were (5%) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, compared to 20% for the same period in the prior year. This decrease was primarily driven by lower margins due to significantly less deliveries on the B737 MAX, and B777 programs, forward loss charges of $27 million on the B787 program, excess capacity production costs of $61.1 million, and temporary workforce impact of $7.2 million due to the COVID-19 pandemic net of U.S. employee retention credit, and restructuring costs of $15.2 million for cost alignment and headcount reductions. The segment recorded unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $7.8 million and net forward loss charges of $36.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. In comparison, during 2019, the segment recorded unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $1.2 million and net forward loss charges of $15.1 million.
Wing Systems. Wing Systems segment net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 were $798.6 million, a decrease of $789.7 million, or 50%, compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to lower production volumes on the B737 MAX, B777, B787, A320, and A350 programs due to COVID-19 pandemic and B737 MAX grounding, partially offset by increased activity from the Bombardier Acquisition. Wing Systems segment operating margins were (8%) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to 14% for the same period in the prior year. This decrease was primarily driven by lower margins due to significantly lower deliveries on the B737 and A320 programs, forward loss charges of $47.9 million on the B787 and A350 programs, excess capacity production costs of $42.9 million, temporary workforce impact of $7.5 million due to the COVID-19 pandemic net of U.S. employee retention credit, and U.K government subsidies and restructuring costs of $16.5 million for cost alignment and headcount reductions. In 2020, the segment recorded unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $5.1 million and $59.1 million of net forward loss charges. In comparison, during 2019, the segment recorded favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $0.5 million and $10.5 million of net forward loss charges.
All Other. All Other segment net revenues consist of sundry sales of miscellaneous services, tooling contracts, and natural gas revenues from the Kansas Industrial Energy Supply Company (“KIESC”), a tenancy in common with other Wichita companies established to purchase natural gas where the Company is a major participant. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. All Other segment net revenues were $95.8 million, an increase of $85.0 million compared to $10.8 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The All Other segment recorded 36% operating margins for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 31% operating margins for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, with the increase primarily driven by ventilator production.
Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2019 as Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2018
Net Revenues. Net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 were $7,863.1 million, an increase of $641.1 million, or 9%, compared with net revenues of $7,222.0 million, for the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher production on the B777, B787, A220, and A350 XWB programs, favorable model mix on B737 program, increased SAAS and defense related activity, partially offset by lower production on the A330 program, lower revenue recognized on the A350 XWB program in accordance with pricing terms and lower revenue recognized on certain Boeing nonrecurring programs. Approximately 95% of the Company's net revenues in 2019 came from our two largest customers, Boeing and Airbus.
Deliveries to Boeing increased to 867 shipsets during 2019, compared to 828 shipsets delivered in the prior year, driven by production increases on the B787 and B777 programs. Deliveries to Airbus increased to 869 shipsets during 2019, compared to 835 shipsets delivered in the prior year, primarily driven by higher production of the A320, A350 XWB, and A220 programs partially offset by decreased production on the A330 program. Production deliveries of business/regional jet wing and wing components decreased to 55 shipsets during 2019, compared to 71 shipsets delivered in the prior year, driven by the transfer of the A220 program to total Airbus deliveries in the third quarter of 2018. In total, shipset deliveries increased 3% to 1,791 shipsets in 2019 compared to 1,734 shipsets in 2018.
Gross Profit. Gross Profit for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was $1,076.7 million, as compared to $1,086.1 million for the same period in the prior year, a decrease of $9.4 million. The reduction in gross profit was primarily driven by forward loss charge on B787 due to Boeing announced production rate change from 14 aircraft per month to 12 aircraft per month in the third quarter, from 12 aircraft per month to 10 aircraft per month in the fourth quarter, and certain Boeing nonrecurring programs partially offset by increased profit recognized on the B737 due to model mix, B777, A220 and the A350 XWB program.
SG&A and Research and Development. SG&A expense was $51.0 million higher for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to costs incurred related to the Asco Acquisition and Bombardier Acquisition, increased headcount and absence of a one-time recovery of legal fees related to a court decision in 2018. Research and development expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was $12.0 million higher as compared to the same period in the prior year, due to more internal projects underway.
Operating Income. Operating income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was $760.8 million, which was $82.4 million lower than operating income of $843.2 million for the prior year. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to costs incurred related to the anticipated purchase of Asco and Bombardier, reduced profitability on the B737 program due to B737 MAX grounding and a forward loss charge on B787 due to announced production rate changes.
Interest Expense and Financing Fee Amortization. Interest expense and financing fee amortization for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 included $78.6 million of interest and fees paid or accrued in connection with long-term debt and $3.6 million in amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount, compared to $55.7 million of interest and fees paid or accrued in connection with long-term debt and $18.3 million in amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount for the prior year. The increase in interest expense is primarily a result of additional debt taken on in 2018 in anticipation of our ASRs and the planned purchase of Asco. The decrease in deferred financing costs and fees in 2019 compared to 2018 is mainly due to the 2018 Credit Agreement (as defined below) which resulted in a loss on extinguishment of existing debt of $14.4 million included in the $18.3 million of deferred financing costs.
Other (Expense) Income, net. Other expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was $(5.8) million, compared to other expense of $(7.0) million for the same period in the prior year. Other expense during 2019 was primarily driven by losses on foreign currency forward contracts as the U.S. Dollar strengthened against the Euro, expenses related to a voluntary retirement program offered by the Company in the second quarter of 2019, as well as net losses on the sale of receivables, partially offset by gain on proceeds from a litigation settlement and pension income.
Provision for Income Taxes. The income tax provision for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, was $132.8 million compared to $139.8 million for the prior year. The 2019 effective tax rate was 20.0% as compared to 18.5% for 2018. The difference in the effective tax rate recorded for 2019 as compared to 2018 is primarily related to a reduction in federal tax credits, an adjustment to our one-time transition tax liability, and an increase in income tax in the current year reflecting the finalization of the 2018 amounts related to Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income ("GILTI") and the federal R&D tax credit reported in the tax return as agreed upon with the IRS in the course of the Company’s participation in the Internal Revenue Service’s Compliance Assurance Process (“CAP”) offset by a re-measurement of our net deferred tax asset balance in 2019 and a decrease in the impact of GILTI.
The decrease from the U.S. statutory tax rate is attributable primarily to generation of state income tax and federal research tax credits, foreign rates less than the U.S. rate, and share based compensation excess tax benefit, offset by the impacts of finalizing the 2018 amounts related to GILTI and the federal R&D tax credit and estimated state income tax.
Fuselage Systems. Fuselage Systems segment net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 were $4,206.2 million, an increase of $205.4 million, or 5%, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to higher production on the B787, B777, and A350 XWB programs and increased SAAS and defense related work, partially offset by lower revenue recognized on certain non-recurring Boeing programs. Fuselage Systems segment operating margins were 11% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, compared to 14% for the same period in the prior year, with the decrease primarily driven by B737 performance, the net forward loss charges recorded on the B787 fuselage program during the third and fourth quarter of 2019 due to announced production rate changes, and decreased margins recognized on the A350 XWB program. In 2019, the segment recorded unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of ($1.3) million, as well as ($37.9) million of net forward loss charges. In comparison, during 2018, the segment recorded unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of ($5.3) million and $3.4 million of favorable changes in estimates on loss programs.
Propulsion Systems. Propulsion Systems segment net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 were $2,057.8 million, an increase of $355.3 million, or 21%, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to favorable model mix on B737, and increased production on B787, B777 and A220 programs, partially offset by lower revenue recognized on certain non-recurring Boeing programs. Propulsion Systems segment operating margins were
20% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, compared to 17% for the same period in the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by the B737, B777 and A220 programs, partially offset by net forward loss charges on B787 due to announced production rate changes. In 2019, the segment recorded unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of ($1.2) million and net forward loss charges of ($15.1) million. In comparison, during 2018, the segment recorded unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of ($0.2) million and net forward loss charges of ($0.7) million.
Wing Systems. Wing Systems segment net revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 were $1,588.3 million, an increase of $75.3 million, or 5%, compared to the same period in the prior year. This was primarily due to increased production on the B737, B777, B787, and A350 XWB programs. Wing Systems segment operating margins were 14% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 compared to 15% for the same period in the prior year mainly due to forward loss charges on B787 due to announced production rate changes, B737 performance, offset by the favorable performance on A350 XWB. In 2019, the segment recorded favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $0.5 million and net forward loss charges of ($10.5) million. In comparison, during 2018, the segment recorded favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $1.7 million and $1.2 million of favorable changes in estimates on loss programs.

In the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, All Other segment net revenues were $10.8 million, an increase of $5.1 million compared to the same period in the prior year. The All Other segment recorded 31% operating margins for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities. Our principal source of liquidity is cash flows from continuing operations. Other than cash flow from continuing operations, sources of our liquidity include cash on hand and borrowings made available by our Credit Agreement and senior notes.
Our cash flows from continuing operations generally have been adversely impacted by the B737 MAX grounding and the COVID-19 pandemic (and resulting production rate changes associated with both events) and we expect the adverse impact to continue until aviation demand recovers. Based on the actions we took in 2020, we anticipate that we will have sufficient liquidity for the next 12 months. However, if the pace and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic recovery are worse than we currently forecast, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to fund our operations and obligations.
While the Company acted quickly to reduce costs in light of lower revenue expectations, the liquidity challenges resulted in the Company needing to issue significant amounts of additional debt. As of December 31, 2019 the Company had a debt balance of approximately $2,827.8 million, most of which was unsecured debt, and a cash balance of $2,350.5 million. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had a debt balance of approximately $3,658.9 million, more than 50% was secured debt and a cash balance of $1,873.3 million. The Company's financial condition will continue to be impacted by COVID-19 for the next several years or until demand recovers. If the pandemic worsens or there is significant uncertainty on the industry’s recovery, we may find it difficult to obtain additional financing and/or fund our operations and meet our debt repayment obligations.
For purposes of assessing our liquidity needs in this section, we have assumed that our customers generally would not further reduce their production rates. For risks that may affect that assumption, see Item 1A “Risk Factors.”

Floating Rate, 2023, and 2028 Notes
On May 30, 2018, Spirit entered into an Indenture (the “2018 Indenture”) by and among Spirit, the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee in connection with Spirit’s offering of $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of its Senior Floating Rate Notes due 2021 (the “Floating Rate Notes”), $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.950% Senior Notes due 2023 (the “2023 Notes”) and $700.0 million principal amount of its 4.600% Senior Notes due
2028 (the “2028 Notes” and, together with the Floating Rate Notes and the 2023 Notes, the “2018 Notes”). Holdings guaranteed Spirit’s obligations under the 2018 Notes on a senior unsecured basis.
The Floating Rate Notes bear interest at a rate per annum equal to three-month LIBOR, as determined in the case of the initial interest period, on May 25, 2018, and thereafter at the beginning of each quarterly period as described herein, plus 80 basis points and mature on June 15, 2021. Interest on the Floating Rate Notes is payable on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2018. The 2023 Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.950% per annum and mature on June 15, 2023. The 2028 Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.600% per annum and mature on June 15, 2028. Interest on the 2023 Notes and 2028 Notes is payable on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2018. The outstanding balance of the Floating Rate Notes, 2023 Notes, and 2028 Notes was $300.0 million, $300.0 million, and $700.0 million as of December 31, 2020, respectively. The carrying value of the Floating Rate Notes, 2023 Notes, and 2028 Notes was 299.7 million, $298.8 million, and $694.6 million as of December 31, 2020, respectively.
The 2018 Indenture contains covenants that limit Spirit’s, the Company’s and certain of the Company’s subsidiaries’ ability, subject to certain exceptions and qualifications, to create liens without granting equal and ratable liens to the holders of the 2018 Notes and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. These covenants are subject to a number of qualifications and limitations. In addition, the 2018 Indenture provides for customary events of default.
On February 12, 2021, Spirit sent a notice of redemption to holders to redeem the outstanding $300 million principal amount of the Floating Rate Notes on February 24, 2021.
For additional information on our outstanding debt, please see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Debt.
Receivables Financing
The Company has two agreements to sell, on a revolving basis, certain trade accounts receivable balances with Boeing and Airbus to third party financial institutions. These programs were primarily entered into as a result of Boeing and Airbus seeking payment term extensions with the Company and continue to allow Spirit to monetize receivables prior to the payment date subject to payment of a discount. No guarantees are delivered under the agreements. Our ability to continue using such agreements is primarily dependent upon the strength of Boeing’s and Airbus’s financial condition. Transfers under this agreement are accounted for as sales of receivables resulting in the receivables being de-recognized from the Company's balance sheet. For additional information on the sale of receivables, please see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Accounts Receivable, net.
Credit Ratings
As of December 31, 2020, our corporate credit ratings were B by Standard & Poor’s Global Ratings (“S&P”), and B2 by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”). Throughout 2020, S&P and Moody’s downgraded our credit rating on a number of occasions. On January 13, 2020, Moody’s downgraded Spirit’s credit rating from Baa3 to Ba2. On January 31, 2020, S&P downgraded Spirit’s credit rating from BBB- to BB. On April 14, 2020, Moody’s further downgraded Spirit’s credit rating from Ba2 to Ba3, and on April 14, 2020, S&P downgraded Spirit’s credit rating from BB to BB-. On June 25, 2020, S&P downgraded Spirit’s credit rating to B+. On July 21, 2020, Moody’s downgraded Spirit’s credit rating to B2 with a negative outlook. On August 3, 2020, S&P downgraded Spirit’s credit rating to B with a stable outlook. On September 22, 2020, S&P affirmed its rating. On September 24, 2020, Moody’s affirmed its rating.
The ratings reflect the agencies’ assessment of our ability to pay interest and principal on our debt securities and credit agreements. A rating is not a recommendation to purchase, sell or hold securities. Each rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. Each rating agency has its own methodology for assigning ratings and, accordingly, each rating should be considered independently of all other ratings.
As compared to the Company’s prior investment grade rating, the Company’s current rating and our credit condition affects, among other things, our ability to access new capital. Further negative changes to these ratings may result in more stringent covenants and higher interest rates under the terms of any new debt.
Cash Flows
The following table provides a summary of our cash flows for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 2019, and 2018:
Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2020 as Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2019
Operating Activities.
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we had a net cash outflow of $744.9 million from operating activities, a decrease of $1,667.6 million, compared to a net cash inflow of $922.7 million for the prior year. The increase in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the B737 MAX grounding and COVID-19 pandemic that significantly impacted our deliveries across all programs and negative impacts of working capital requirements. Net tax receipts for 2020 were $62.5 million compared to net tax payments of $105.0 million during the prior year, primarily due to recognition of underlying taxable temporary differences.
Investing Activities
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we had a net cash outflow of $502.0 million from investing activities, compared to a net cash outflow of $239.9 million for the prior year primarily driven by the FMI acquisition and the Bombardier Acquisition offset by reduced capital spend.
Financing Activities
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we had a net cash inflow of $769.9 million for financing activities, a decrease in inflow of $114.5 million as compared to a net cash inflow of $884.4 million for the same period in the prior year. During 2020, the Company issued $400.0 under the Credit Agreement, $1,200.0 in Second Lien 2025 Notes, and $500.0 million in First Lien 2025 Notes, offset by the $800.0 million payment on the 2018 Revolver and $400.0 million payment of the 2018 Term Loan A and payment of debt issuance costs. During 2019, the Company drew $250.0 million on the 2018 DDTL and net draws of $800.0 million on the 2018 Revolver in December 2019. During 2020, the Company paid cash dividends totaling $15.4 million to its stockholders of record, compared to $50.4 million in 2019.
Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2019 as Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2018
Operating Activities
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, we had a net cash inflow of $922.7 million from operating activities, an increase of $152.8 million, compared to a net cash inflow of $769.9 million for the prior year. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the B737 advanced payment of $123.0 million received during the third quarter, partially offset by repayment of B787 advances of $98.0 million in 2018. Net tax payments made during 2019 were $105.0 million compared to net tax payments of $202.3 million during the prior year, primarily due to recognition of underlying taxable temporary differences.
Investing Activities
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, we had a net cash outflow of $239.9 million from investing activities, compared to a net cash outflow of $267.8 million for the prior year due to reduced spend on capital projects.
Financing Activities
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, we had a net cash inflow of $884.4 million for financing activities, an increase in inflow of $1,037.9 million as compared to a net cash outflow of $153.5 million for the same period in the prior year. During 2019, the Company has drawn $250.0 million on the 2018 DDTL and net draws of $800.0 million on the Revolver in December 2019. During 2019, the Company paid cash dividends totaling $50.4 million to its stockholders of record, compared to $48.0 million in 2018.
Future Cash Needs and Capital Spending
Impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and the B737 MAX grounding have significantly impacted our liquidity requirements and operations. Our primary future cash needs will consist of working capital, research and development, capital expenditures, debt service, dividend payments, integration activity, and potential merger and acquisition activity. We expend significant capital as we undertake new programs, which begin in the non-recurring investment phase of our business model. In addition, we expend significant capital to meet increased production rates, which we expect will happen as air travel demand normalizes to 2019 levels (which may take several years); however, we cannot give any assurances that normalization will happen soon enough for us to fund our operations and meet our debt repayment obligations. We also require capital to develop new technologies for the next generation of aircraft, which may not be funded by our customers. Historically, share repurchases and dividend payments have also been factors affecting our liquidity. As described below, our share repurchase program is paused and we have reduced our quarterly dividend to one penny per share.
While we cannot give any assurances that air travel demand will recover soon enough for us to fund our operations and meet our debt repayment obligations, we believe our cash on hand and cash flows from continuing operations coupled with our ability to vary our cost structure quickly, will provide sufficient liquidity to address the challenges and opportunities of the current market and our global cash needs for the foreseeable future, however we could experience significant fluctuations in our cash flows from period to period during the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants under our Credit Agreement.
The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant uncertainty in our industry. Air travel demand has deteriorated due to the pandemic and responsive government preventative measures. Our customers have reduced their production rates, which negatively impacts results of operations and cash flows. We are unable to predict the duration, impact or outcome of the pandemic and the resulting impact on the aviation industry and, accordingly, cannot predict the outcome on our operations. We have taken a number of actions to assist with managing the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including those described earlier in this section.
Apart from the COVID-19 pandemic, the B737 MAX grounding and its residual demand impacts created and continues to create significant liquidity challenges for the Company. Spirit delivered 71 B737 MAX shipsets in year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 606 B737 MAX shipsets in the year ended December 31, 2019. While we expect the production rate to increase in 2021 and future years, that expectation is subject to a number of risks that are described further in Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report.
If production levels are further reduced by our customers for any reason (including the COVID-19 pandemic or demand challenges for the B737 MAX program, or otherwise) beyond current expectations or if we have difficulties in managing our cost structure to take into account changes in production schedules,our liquidity position may worsen if we are unable to procure additional financing, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted.
There is $925 million remaining in the Company’s Board-approved share repurchase program. Share repurchases are currently on hold due to the impacts of the B737 MAX grounding and the COVID-19 pandemic.
On February 6, 2020, the Company announced that its Board of Directors reduced its quarterly dividend to a penny per share to preserve liquidity. The Board regularly evaluates the Company's capital allocation strategy and dividend policy. Any future determination to continue to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other factors, our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements and contractual restrictions, including the requirements of financing agreements to which we may be a party. No assurance can be given that cash dividends will continue to be declared and paid at historical levels or at all.
The Company has two agreements to sell, on a revolving basis, certain trade accounts receivable balances with Boeing and Airbus to third party financial institutions. These programs were primarily entered into as a result of Boeing and Airbus seeking payment term extensions with the Company and continue to allow the Company to monetize prior to the payment date for the receivables, subject to payment of a discount. No guarantees are delivered under the agreements. Our ability to continue using such agreements is primarily dependent upon the strength of Boeing’s and Airbus’s financial condition. If any of these financial institutions involved with these arrangements experiences financial difficulties, becomes unwilling to support Boeing or Airbus due to a deterioration in their financial condition or otherwise, or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of the factoring arrangements, we may experience significant disruption and potential liquidity issues due to the failure of such arrangements, which could have an adverse impact upon our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Transfers under this agreement are accounted for as sales of receivables resulting in the receivables being de-recognized from the Company's balance sheet. For additional information on the sale of receivables, please see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Accounts Receivable, net.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2020.
Foreign Operations
We engage in business in various non-U.S. markets. As of December 31, 2020, we have facilities in the U.K., France, Malaysia and Morocco. We are also members of two joint ventures in the People’s Republic of China.
Currency fluctuations, tariffs and similar import limitations, price controls, tax reform, and labor regulations can affect our foreign operations. Other potential limitations on our foreign operations include expropriation, nationalization, restrictions on foreign investments or their transfers, and additional political and economic risks. In addition, the transfer of funds from foreign operations could be impaired by any restrictive regulations that foreign governments could enact.
Sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks, including the impact of foreign government regulations, political uncertainties, and differences in business practices. There can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other actions that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on our business or market opportunities with such governments’ countries. Furthermore, the political, cultural, and economic climate outside the U.S. may be unfavorable to our operations and growth strategy.
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, our net revenues from direct sales to non-U.S. customers were approximately $767.2 million, or 23% of total net revenues for the same period. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, our net revenues from direct sales to non-U.S. customers were approximately $1,296.8 million, or 16% of total net revenues for the same period. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, our net revenues from direct sales to non-U.S. customers were approximately $1,254.9 million, or 17% of total net revenues for the same period.
Our foreign operations subject us to risks that are described further in Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report.
Inflation
A majority of our sales are conducted pursuant to long-term contracts that set fixed unit prices. Certain, but not all, of these contracts provide for price adjustments for inflation or abnormal escalation. Although we have attempted to minimize the effect of inflation on our business through contractual protections, the presence of longer pricing periods within our contracts increases the likelihood that there will be sustained or higher than anticipated increases in costs of labor or materials. Furthermore, if one of the raw materials on which we are dependent (e.g. aluminum, titanium, steel, or raw composite material) were to experience an isolated price increase without inflationary impacts on the broader economy, we may not be entitled to inflation protection under certain of our contracts. If our contractual protections do not adequately protect us in the context of substantial cost increases, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
The Company's contracts with suppliers currently provide for fixed pricing in U.S. dollars, while contracts with respect to our U.K. operations are denominated in U.S. dollars, British pounds sterling or Euros. In some cases, our supplier arrangements contain inflationary adjustment provisions based on accepted industry indices, and we typically include an inflation component in estimating our supply costs. In addition, the Company has long-term supply agreements for raw materials with most of its suppliers and for certain raw materials, the Company is party to collective raw material sourcing contracts arranged through Boeing and Airbus (see “
