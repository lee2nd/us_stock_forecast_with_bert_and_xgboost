ITEM 7. - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, and other financial information included in this Form 10-K. Certain statements in this "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" are forward-looking statements. See "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements."
Overview
We view each of our Integrated Resorts as an operating segment. Our operating segments in Macao consist of The Venetian Macao; The Londoner Macao; The Parisian Macao; The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Hotel Macao; and the Sands Macao. Our operating segment in Singapore is Marina Bay Sands. Our operating segments in the U.S. consist of the Las Vegas Operating Properties, which includes The Venetian Resort Las Vegas and the Sands Expo Center, and, through May 30, 2019, Sands Bethlehem.
During 2020, we had achieved milestones in advancing several of our strategic objectives. We continued progress on our key development projects in Macao for the conversion of Sands Cotai Central into The Londoner Macao and we opened The Grand Suites at Four Seasons in October 2020, featuring gaming spaces and 289 luxury suites. In Singapore, we initiated development activities associated with the MBS Expansion Project. Finally, we continued to strengthen our balance sheet with the issuance of SCL 2026 and 2030 Senior Notes to provide funds for incremental liquidity and general corporate purposes.
COVID-19 Pandemic
In early January 2020, an outbreak of a respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus was identified and the disease has since spread rapidly across the world causing the World Health Organization to declare on March 12, 2020, the outbreak of a pandemic (the “COVID-19 Pandemic”). As a result, people across the globe were advised to avoid non-essential travel. Steps were also taken by various countries, including those in which we operate, to restrict inbound international travel and implement closures of non-essential operations, including our Integrated Resorts for certain periods in 2020 in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, to contain the spread of the virus.
Visitation to Macao decreased substantially throughout 2020 as a result of various government policies limiting travel. Travel restrictions and quarantine requirements have been varying in response to changes in circumstances in other countries. A complete ban on entry, or a need to undergo enhanced quarantine requirements depending on the person’s residency and their recent travel history, remains in place for Macao residents, foreign workers residing in Macao and international travelers from countries other than mainland China.
Beginning December 21, 2020, all travelers who have been to any overseas territory, including Hong Kong, but not including mainland China or Taiwan, in the past 14 days will be subject to a 21-day compulsory quarantine at a designated location when arriving in Macao. Those travelers arriving from mainland China or Taiwan will be subject to a 14-day quarantine. People from low risk cities in China may enter Macao quarantine free, subject to them holding the appropriate travel documents, a negative COVID-19 test result and a green health-code. All other foreign nationals, including those holding a temporary work permit, are still not permitted to enter Macao. The China Individual Visit Scheme ("China IVS") recommenced for certain regions from August 12, 2020, and was extended to more jurisdictions within mainland China effective September 23, 2020. General travel restrictions within mainland China continue to exist and are updated and revised based on evolving public health consideraions within China.
Following suspension of all gaming operations on February 5, 2020 by the Macao government, our Macao casino operations resumed on February 20, 2020, except for operations at The Londoner Macao, which resumed on February 27, 2020. Additional health safeguards, such as the requirement to present a negative COVID-19 test certificate prior to entering the casino, have been implemented, as well as the ongoing limitation on the number of seats per table game, slot machine spacing, temperature checks and mandatory mask protection. Management is currently unable to determine when these measures will be modified or cease to be necessary.
Some of our Macao hotel facilities were also closed during the casino suspension in response to the drop in visitation and, with the exception of the Conrad Macao, Cotai Strip which reopened on June 13, 2020, these hotels were gradually reopened from February 20, 2020. In support of the Macao government’s initiatives to fight the COVID-19 Pandemic, we provided one tower (approximately 2,000 hotel rooms) for quarantine purposes at the Sheraton Grand Macao Hotel, Cotai Strip to the Macao government to house individuals who returned to Macao. This tower has been utilized for quarantine purposes on several occasions including from March 28 to April 30, 2020; from June 7 to August 14, 2020; from December 20, 2020 until February 6, 2021; and will resume on February 20, 2021 until further notice.
Operating hours at restaurants across our Macao properties are continuously being adjusted in line with movements in guest visitation. The majority of retail outlets in the various shopping malls are open with reduced operating hours. The timing and manner in which these areas will return to full operation are currently unknown.
The Hong Kong government temporarily closed the Hong Kong China Ferry Terminal in Kowloon on January 30, 2020, and the Hong Kong Macao Ferry Terminal in Hong Kong on February 4, 2020. In response, we have suspended our Macao ferry operations between Macao and Hong Kong. The timing and manner in which our normal ferry operations will be able to resume are currently unknown.
Our operations in Macao have been significantly impacted by the lack of visitation to Macao. The Macao government announced total visitation from mainland China to Macao decreased 83.0% for 2020, as compared to 2019. The Macao government also announced gross gaming revenue decreased by 79.3% for 2020, as compared to 2019.
Beginning on April 7, 2020, the Singapore government suspended all casino and non-essential operations, including all operations at Marina Bay Sands, due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Our Singapore operations were permitted to reopen beginning on June 19, 2020; however, this only included certain restaurants and retail mall operations. The casino operations reopened on July 1, 2020; however, entry was initially limited to annual levy holders and certain Sands Rewards Club (“SRC”) members. The casino opened to all SRC members as of July 9, 2020, and to the public as of October 23, 2020. All operations are currently subject to capacity limitations.
On May 28, 2020, in support of the Singapore government’s initiatives to fight the COVID-19 Pandemic, Marina Bay Sands entered into an agreement with the Singapore government to utilize all three hotel towers to house Singapore residents for quarantine upon their initial return from other jurisdictions. The government’s use of the first tower ceased on June 26, 2020, while usage of the second and third towers continued through July 26, 2020. Beginning on July 17, 2020, the first tower reopened for normal operations, while the second and third towers reopened on August 1, 2020. On September 7, 2020, the STB announced that event organizers would be allowed to apply for pilot events with limited capacities of up to 250 attendees from October 1, 2020. The date on which nightlife venues may reopen is unknown at this time. In December 2020, Singapore entered phase 3 of reopening, which, among other things, increased our casino operating capacity for Marina Bay Sands from 3,000 players to 3,750 players.
Visitation to Marina Bay Sands declined significantly due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. The STB announced for the 12 months ended November 30, 2020 (the latest information publicly available at the time of filing), total visitation to Singapore decreased approximately 76.6%, as compared to the same period in 2019.
The Nevada government suspended all casino and non-essential operations, including all operations at the Las Vegas Operating Properties, beginning on March 18, 2020, due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. The Nevada government allowed casinos to reopen on June 4, 2020, under strict guidelines issued by the Gaming Control Board and the State of Nevada. We reopened the casino, suites within The Venetian Tower and The Palazzo Tower, and select food and beverage outlets on June 4, 2020, with certain operations subject to reduced capacity. Beginning October 1, 2020, the limit for both public and private events increased from 50 people to the lesser of 250 people or 50% of the room’s capacity (excluding employees, organizers and performers) provided social distancing measures and various safety and related protocols were followed. MICE events for more than 250 people, but no more than 1,000 people, were allowed subject to certain requirements. Larger venues, defined as having more than a 2,500 fixed-seating capacity, were allowed to host a gathering of 10% of their total capacity provided they met additional requirements. As a result of these requirements and lack of customer demand in connection with the impact of the
COVID-19 Pandemic, we have not held any MICE events at our Las Vegas Operating Properties since reopening on June 4, 2020.
In November 2020, the Nevada government tightened capacity and other restrictions, which included, among other things, a 25% capacity limit for gaming establishments and the lesser of 25% or 50 people for MICE events. These increased restrictions will be in place until at least February 14, 2021.
Visitation to our Las Vegas Operating Properties declined due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. The LVCVA announced for the 12 months ended November 30, 2020 (the latest information publicly available at the time of filing), total visitation to Las Vegas decreased 49.8%, as compared to the same period in 2019. The LVCVA also announced for the 12 months ended November 30, 2020 (the latest information publicly available at the time of filing), gross gaming revenue for the Las Vegas Strip decreased 38.5%, as compared to the same period in 2019.
In connection with reopening the Singapore and Las Vegas properties, we are adhering to social distancing requirements, which include reduced seating at table games and a decreased number of active slot machines on the casino floor. Additionally, there is uncertainty around the impact the COVID-19 Pandemic will continue to have on operations in future periods. For example, there have been a number of MICE event cancellations or rescheduling through the end of 2021 and there may be additional restrictions placed on our other services, such as nightclubs and entertainment venues for our Las Vegas properties.
If our Integrated Resorts are not permitted to resume normal operations, travel restrictions such as those related to inbound travel from other countries are not modified or eliminated, the China IVS and other visa programs are suspended or the global response to contain the COVID-19 Pandemic escalates or is unsuccessful, our operations, cash flows and financial condition will be additionally and materially impacted.
While each of our properties is currently open and operating at reduced levels due to lower visitation and the implementation of required safety measures as described above, the current economic and regulatory environment on a global basis and in each of our jurisdictions continues to evolve. We cannot predict the manner in which governments will react as the global and regional impact of COVID-19 changes over time, which could significantly alter our current operations.
We have a strong balance sheet and sufficient liquidity in place, including total cash and cash equivalents balance, excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents, of $2.12 billion and access to $1.50 billion, $2.02 billion and $448 million of available borrowing capacity from our LVSC Revolving Facility, 2018 SCL Revolving Facility and the 2012 Singapore Revolving Facility, respectively, and SGD 3.69 billion (approximately $2.79 billion at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2020) under our Singapore Delayed Draw Term Facility, exclusively for capital expenditures for the MBS Expansion Project, as of December 31, 2020. On January 25, 2021, SCL entered into an agreement with lenders to increase commitments under the 2018 SCL Credit Facility by HKD 3.83 billion (approximately $494 million at exchange rates in effect on the date of this transaction). Subsequently, on January 29, 2021, SCL drew down $29 million and HKD 2.13 billion (approximately $274 million at exchange rates in effect on January 29, 2021) under this facility for general corporate purposes, resulting in remaining available borrowing capacity of $2.21 billion. We believe we are able to support continuing operations, complete the major construction projects that are underway and respond to the current COVID-19 Pandemic challenges. We have taken various mitigating measures to manage through the current environment, including a cost and capital expenditure reduction program to minimize cash outflow of non-essential items.
Key Operating Revenue Measurements
Operating revenues at The Venetian Macao, The Londoner Macao, The Parisian Macao, The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Hotel Macao, Marina Bay Sands and our Las Vegas Operating Properties are dependent upon the volume of customers who stay at the hotel, which affects the price charged for hotel rooms and our gaming volume. Operating revenues at Sands Macao are principally driven by casino customers who visit the property on a daily basis.
Management utilizes the following volume and pricing measures in order to evaluate past performance and assist in forecasting future revenues. The various volume measurements indicate our ability to attract customers to our Integrated Resorts. In casino operations, win and hold percentages indicate the amount of revenue to be expected based on volume. In hotel operations, average daily rate and revenue per available room indicate the demand for
rooms and our ability to capture that demand. In mall operations, base rent per square foot indicates our ability to attract and maintain profitable tenants for our leasable space.
The following are the key measurements we use to evaluate operating revenues:
Casino revenue measurements for Macao and Singapore: Macao and Singapore table games are segregated into two groups: Rolling Chip play (composed of VIP players) and Non-Rolling Chip play (mostly non-VIP players). The volume measurement for Rolling Chip play is non-negotiable gaming chips wagered and lost. The volume measurement for Non-Rolling Chip play is table games drop ("drop"), which is net markers issued (credit instruments), cash deposited in the table drop boxes and gaming chips purchased and exchanged at the cage. Rolling Chip and Non-Rolling Chip volume measurements are not comparable as they are two distinct measures of volume. The amounts wagered and lost for Rolling Chip play are substantially higher than the amounts dropped for Non-Rolling Chip play. Slot handle, also a volume measurement, is the gross amount wagered for the period cited.
We view Rolling Chip win as a percentage of Rolling Chip volume, Non-Rolling Chip win as a percentage of drop and slot hold (amount won by the casino) as a percentage of slot handle. Win or hold percentage represents the percentage of Rolling Chip volume, Non-Rolling Chip drop or slot handle that is won by the casino and recorded as casino revenue. Our win and hold percentages are calculated before discounts, commissions, deferring revenue associated with our loyalty programs and allocating casino revenues related to goods and services provided to patrons on a complimentary basis. Our Rolling Chip win percentage is expected to be 3.15% to 3.45% in Macao and Singapore. Actual win percentage may vary from our expected win percentage and historical win and hold percentages. Generally, slot machine play is conducted on a cash basis. In Macao and Singapore, 24.0% and 14.6%, respectively, of our table games play was conducted on a credit basis for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Casino revenue measurements for the U.S.: The volume measurements in the U.S. are slot handle, as previously described, and table games drop, which is the total amount of cash and net markers issued deposited in the table drop box. We view table games win as a percentage of drop and slot hold as a percentage of slot handle. Our win and hold percentages are calculated before discounts, commissions, deferring revenue associated with our loyalty programs and allocating casino revenues related to goods and services provided to patrons on a complimentary basis. Based upon our mix of table games, our table games are expected to produce a win percentage of 18% to 26% for Baccarat and 16% to 24% for non-Baccarat. Actual win percentage may vary from our expected win percentage and historical win and hold percentages. Similar to Macao and Singapore, slot machine play is generally conducted on a cash basis. Approximately 68.8% of our table games play at our Las Vegas Operating Properties was conducted on a credit basis for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Hotel revenue measurements: Performance indicators used are occupancy rate (a volume indicator), which is the average percentage of available hotel rooms occupied during a period and average daily room rate ("ADR", a price indicator), which is the average price of occupied rooms per day. Available rooms exclude those rooms unavailable for occupancy during the period due to renovation, development or other requirements (such as government mandated closure, lodging for team members and usage by the Macao and Singapore governments for quarantine measures). The calculations of the occupancy rate and ADR include the impact of rooms provided on a complimentary basis. Revenue per available room ("RevPAR") represents a summary of hotel ADR and occupancy. Because not all available rooms are occupied, ADR is normally higher than RevPAR. Reserved rooms where the guests do not show up for their stay and lose their deposit, or where guests check out early, may be re-sold to walk-in guests.
Mall revenue measurements: Occupancy, base rent per square foot and tenant sales per square foot are used as performance indicators. Occupancy represents gross leasable occupied area ("GLOA") divided by gross leasable area ("GLA") at the end of the reporting period. GLOA is the sum of: (1) tenant occupied space under lease and (2) tenants no longer occupying space, but paying rent. GLA does not include space currently under development or not on the market for lease. Base rent per square foot is the weighted average base or minimum rent charge, excluding rent concessions, in effect at the end of the reporting period for all tenants that would qualify to be included in occupancy. Tenant sales per square foot is the sum of reported comparable sales for the trailing 12 months divided by the comparable square footage for the same period. Only tenants that have been open for a minimum of 12 months are included in the tenant sales per square foot calculation.
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019
Summary Financial Results
Our financial results were adversely impacted by decreased visitation at each of our operating properties due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. See “COVID-19 Pandemic” for further information. Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $3.61 billion, compared to $13.74 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. Operating loss was $1.69 billion, compared to operating income of $3.70 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. Net loss was $2.14 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net income of $3.30 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Operating Revenues
Our net revenues consisted of the following:
Consolidated net revenues were $3.61 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $10.13 billion compared to $13.74 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, due to decreases of $7.12 billion, $1.84 billion and $940 million at our Macao operations, Marina Bay Sands and our Las Vegas Operating Properties, respectively. The decreases were driven by decreased visitation and temporary property closures as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic, as described above. Additionally, there was a $227 million decrease due to the sale of Sands Bethlehem on May 31, 2019.
Net casino revenues decreased $7.56 billion compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, driven by temporary property closures and decreased visitation once our properties reopened as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic described above. Additionally, casinos at each of our properties continue to operate at a reduced capacity due to social distancing measures. Revenues at our Macao operations and Marina Bay Sands decreased $5.85 billion and $1.30 billion, respectively, driven by decreases in Non-Rolling Chip drop and Rolling Chip volume, while revenues at our Las Vegas Operating Properties decreased $217 million due to decreases in table games drop and win percentage and slot handle. Additionally, there was a decrease of $199 million attributable to the sale of Sands Bethlehem on May 31, 2019. The following table summarizes the results of our casino activity:
In our experience, average win percentages remain fairly consistent when measured over extended periods of time with a significant volume of wagers, but can vary considerably within shorter time periods as a result of the statistical variances associated with games of chance in which large amounts are wagered.
Room revenues decreased $1.25 billion compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily a result of temporary property closures and decreased visitation at each of our properties due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Additionally, certain rooms within The Londoner Macao and Marina Bay Sands were utilized for quarantine purposes and certain rooms across our Macao properties were used by team members due to travel restrictions. The following table summarizes the results of our room activity:
_________________________
(1) Includes The Grand Suites at Four Seasons, which opened in October 2020.
Food and beverage revenues decreased $614 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to decreases of $239 million, $220 million and $144 million at our Macao properties, our Las Vegas Operating Properties and Marina Bay Sands, respectively, as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic described above.
Mall revenues decreased $335 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to $272 million in rent concessions granted to our mall tenants in Macao and Singapore, as well as a $59 million decrease in overage rents resulting from lower traffic in our malls as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic. Our Macao Operations were also impacted by lower occupancy due to the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic.
For further information related to the financial performance of our malls, see "Additional Information Regarding our Retail Mall Operations." The following table summarizes the results of our malls on the Cotai Strip in Macao and in Singapore:
_________________________
Note: This table excludes the results of mall operations at Sands Macao.
(1)Tenant sales per square foot is the sum of reported comparable sales for the trailing 12 months divided by the comparable square footage for the same period.
(2)The Shoppes at Londoner will feature up to approximately 600,000 square feet of gross leasable area upon completion of all phases of the renovation, rebranding and expansion to The Londoner Macao.
Convention, retail and other revenues decreased $364 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, driven by decreases of $111 million, $102 million and $61 million at our Las Vegas Operating Properties, Macao properties and Marina Bay Sands, respectively, as a result of the cancellation of MICE events and decreased visitation across our properties due to the COVID-19 Pandemic described above. Additionally, there was a $76 million decrease related to our ferry operations, due to the temporary closure of the Hong Kong China Ferry Terminal since late January 2020 and the Hong Kong Macao Ferry Terminal since early February 2020 in response to the COVID-19 Pandemic.
Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses consisted of the following:
Operating expenses were $5.30 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $4.74 billion compared to $10.04 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by a $3.55 billion decrease in casino expenses. Additionally, general and administrative expenses decreased $409 million and food and beverage expenses decreased $331 million. The decreases were mainly driven by the COVID-19 Pandemic described above. Although management has implemented certain cost reduction programs, operating margins in each business segment were negatively impacted due to employee and other costs incurred during this period of decreased visitation and property closures. We have maintained our staffing levels across our jurisdictions through significantly reduced visitation. The level of payroll costs during 2020 were reduced by $109 million in connection with the Job Support Scheme in Singapore and the Employee Retention Credit under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act in the U.S. We have also implemented payroll cost saving initiatives across each of our properties, including utilization of paid time off and voluntary unpaid leave. Finally, our bonus and incentive expense in 2020 decreased $262 million from 2019 due to not meeting certain performance criteria due to impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic.
Casino expenses decreased $3.55 billion compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of $3.06 billion in gaming taxes due to decreased casino revenues, as previously described. Additionally, the sale of Sands Bethlehem in May 2019 resulted in a $127 million decrease.
Room expenses decreased $173 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was driven by decreases of $90 million, $54 million and $27 million at our Macao properties, our Las Vegas Operating Properties and Marina Bay Sands, respectively. These decreases are consistent with the reduction in room revenue.
Food and beverage expenses decreased $331 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, due to decreases of $135 million, $99 million and $87 million at our Macao properties, our Las Vegas Operating Properties and Marina Bay Sands, respectively. These decreases are consistent with the reduction in food and beverage revenues.
Convention, retail and other expenses decreased $155 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, driven by a $69 million decrease related to the temporary closure of the ferry terminals as previously described. Additionally, our Macao properties, Las Vegas Operating Properties and Marina Bay Sands decreased $35 million, $31 million and $17 million, respectively, as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic described above.
The provision for credit losses was $99 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was driven by the aging of receivables for premium players at our Macao properties and Marina Bay Sands during 2020, as travel restrictions have limited the ability for patrons to redeem markers. The amount of this provision can vary over short periods of time because of factors specific to the customers who owe us money from gaming activities at any given time. We believe the amount of our provision for credit losses in the future will depend upon the state of the economy, our credit standards, our risk assessments and the judgment of our employees responsible for granting credit.
General and administrative expenses decreased $409 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, due to decreases of $169 million, $116 million and $92 million at our Macao properties, Marina Bay Sands and our Las Vegas Operating Properties, respectively. The decreases were primarily driven by decreases in marketing, payroll and property operation costs. Additionally, the sale of Sands Bethlehem in May 2019 resulted in a $32 million decrease.
Corporate expenses decreased $145 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by a nonrecurring legal settlement recorded in 2019 and a decrease in payroll costs as described above.
Pre-opening expenses represent personnel and other costs incurred prior to the opening of new ventures, which are expensed as incurred. Development expenses include the costs associated with our evaluation and pursuit of new business opportunities, which are also expensed as incurred.
Loss on disposal or impairment of assets was $80 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $90 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The loss for the year ended December 31, 2020, consisted primarily of asset disposals and demolition costs related to The Londoner Macao. The loss for the year ended December 31, 2019, consisted primarily of a $65 million impairment of our ferries in Macao.
Segment Adjusted Property EBITDA
The following table summarizes information related to our segments (see "Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 17 - Segment Information" for discussion of our operating segments and a reconciliation of consolidated adjusted property EBITDA to net income/loss):
_________________________
(1)We completed the sale of Sands Bethlehem on May 31, 2019. Results of operations include Sands Bethlehem through May 30, 2019.
(2)Consolidated adjusted property EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, is used by management as the primary measure of the operating performance of our segments. Consolidated adjusted property EBITDA is net income/loss before stock-based compensation expense, corporate expense, pre-opening expense, development expense, depreciation and amortization, amortization of leasehold interests in land, gain or loss on disposal or impairment of assets, interest, other income or expense, gain on sale of Sands Bethlehem, gain or loss on modification or early retirement of debt and income taxes. Consolidated adjusted property EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure used by management, as well as industry analysts, to evaluate operations and operating performance. In particular, management utilizes consolidated adjusted property EBITDA to compare the operating profitability of our operations with those of our competitors, as well as a basis for determining certain incentive compensation. Integrated Resort companies have historically reported adjusted property EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure to GAAP financial measures. In order to view the operations of their properties on a more stand-alone basis, Integrated Resort companies, including Las Vegas Sands Corp., have historically excluded certain expenses that do not relate to the management of specific properties, such as pre-opening expense, development expense and corporate expense, from their adjusted property EBITDA calculations. Consolidated adjusted property EBITDA should not be interpreted as an alternative to income from operations (as an indicator of operating performance) or to cash flows from operations (as a measure of liquidity), in each case, as determined in accordance with GAAP. We have significant uses of cash flow, including capital expenditures, dividend payments, interest payments, debt principal repayments and income taxes, which are not reflected in consolidated adjusted property EBITDA. Not all companies calculate adjusted property EBITDA in the same manner. As a result, our presentation of consolidated adjusted property EBITDA may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
Adjusted property EBITDA at our Macao operations decreased $3.62 billion compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, due to a decrease in operations driven by government-mandated travel restrictions, property closures and overall reduced visitation since late January 2020 resulting from the COVID-19 Pandemic.
Adjusted property EBITDA at Marina Bay Sands decreased $1.28 billion compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, due to a decrease in operations, driven by the temporary closure of the property and reduced visitation resulting from the COVID-19 Pandemic.
Adjusted property EBITDA at our Las Vegas Operating Properties decreased $611 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to no MICE events after the first quarter of 2020 and decreased room and casino revenues driven by the temporary closure of the properties and overall reduced visitation resulting from the COVID-19 Pandemic.
Interest Expense
The following table summarizes information related to interest expense:
Interest cost decreased $5 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, resulting primarily from decreases in our weighted average interest rate, offset by the increase in weighted average total debt balance. The decrease in weighted average interest rate was due to a decrease in the Singapore Offer Rate ("SOR"). The weighted average debt balance increased in connection with the issuance of the SCL 2026 and 2030 Senior Notes in June 2020 and borrowings on the Singapore Delayed Draw Term Loan in September 2020 (see "Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 8 - Long-Term Debt").
Other Factors Affecting Earnings
Other income was $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $23 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. Other income during the year ended December 31, 2020, was primarily attributable to $20 million of foreign currency transaction gains, driven by the U.S. dollar-denominated debt held by SCL.
Our income tax benefit was $38 million on a loss before income taxes of $2.18 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, resulting in a (1.7%) effective income tax rate. This compares to a 12.4% effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019, would have been 9.5% without the discrete income tax expense of $161 million resulting from the sale of Sands Bethlehem. The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020, reflects a 17% statutory tax rate on our Singapore operations, a 21% corporate income tax rate on our U.S. operations, and a zero percent tax rate on our Macao gaming operations due to our income tax exemption in Macao. Our U.S. operations recorded a tax benefit associated with the pre-tax book losses incurred for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our U.S. tax benefit was partially offset by a valuation allowance recorded on certain U.S. foreign tax credits, which we no longer expect to utilize due to lower royalty income resulting from a decrease in revenues from our Macao and Singapore operations compared to prior estimates. Our Macao non-gaming operations had a non-cash income tax expense of $14 million due to the reversal of certain deferred tax assets related to fixed assets, which were primarily disposed of as part of The Londoner Macao project.
The net loss attributable to our noncontrolling interests was $458 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net income attributable to our noncontrolling interest of $606 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. These amounts were primarily related to the noncontrolling interest of SCL.
Additional Information Regarding our Retail Mall Operations
The following tables summarize the results of our mall operations on the Cotai Strip and at Marina Bay Sands for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
____________________
Note: This table excludes the results of our mall operations at Sands Macao and Sands Bethlehem, which was sold in May 2019.
(1) Minimum rents include base rents and straight-line adjustments of base rents.
(2) Rent concessions were provided to tenants as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic and the related impact on mall operations.
(3) Commercial property that generates rental income is exempt from property tax for the first six years for newly constructed buildings in Cotai. Each property is also eligible to obtain an additional six-year exemption,
provided certain qualifications are met. To date, The Venetian Macao, The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Hotel Macao, The Londoner Macao and The Parisian Macao have obtained a second exemption. The exemption for The Venetian Macao and The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Hotel Macao expired in August 2019 and August 2020, respectively, and the exemption for The Londoner Macao and The Parisian Macao will be expiring in December 2027 and September 2028, respectively.
(4) Mall-related expenses consist of CAM, marketing fees and other direct operating expenses, property taxes and provision for credit losses, but excludes depreciation and amortization and general and administrative costs.
It is common in the mall operating industry for companies to disclose mall net operating income ("NOI") as a useful supplemental measure of a mall's operating performance. Because NOI excludes general and administrative expenses, interest expense, impairment losses, depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from property dispositions, allocations to noncontrolling interests and provision for income taxes, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and operating commercial real estate properties and the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs.
In the table above, we believe taking total mall revenues less mall-related expenses provides an operating performance measure for our malls. Other mall operating companies may use different methodologies for deriving mall-related expenses. As such, this calculation may not be comparable to the NOI of other mall operating companies.
Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018

Cash Flows - Operating Activities
Table games play at our properties is conducted on a cash and credit basis, while slot machine play is primarily conducted on a cash basis. Our rooms, food and beverage and other non-gaming revenues are conducted primarily on a cash basis or as a trade receivable, resulting in operating cash flows being generally affected by changes in operating income and accounts receivable. For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash used in operations was $1.31 billion, a decrease of $4.35 billion compared to $3.04 billion of cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2019. The main factor driving this decrease was the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on our operations, which significantly reduced visitation to our properties and caused the temporary shutdown of all of our properties at various times during 2020 as described above. The COVID-19 Pandemic impacted our working capital, which was a cash outflow during the year ended December 31, 2020 as the amount of receivables collected was less than the settlement of operating accrued liabilities and the outstanding chip liability was significantly reduced in 2020. In addition, cash flow from operations in the prior year were impacted by the land lease payment made in 2019 in connection with the MBS Expansion Project.
Cash Flows - Investing Activities
Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2020, totaled $1.33 billion, including $1.06 billion in Macao, which consisted of $739 million for The Londoner Macao, $157 million for The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Hotel Macao primarily for The Grand Suites at Four Seasons and $140 million for The Venetian Macao; $164 million in Singapore; $103 million at our Las Vegas Operating Properties; and $5 million for corporate and other activities.
Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2019, totaled $1.22 billion, including $762 million in Macao, which consisted of $298 million for The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Hotel Macao primarily for The Grand Suites at Four Seasons, $282 million for The Londoner Macao and $131 million for The Venetian Macao; $198 million at our Las Vegas Operating Properties; $195 million in Singapore; and $61 million for corporate and other activities.
Cash Flows - Financing Activities
Net cash flows generated from financing activities were $560 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was primarily attributable to the issuance of $1.50 billion of unsecured notes at SCL, partially offset by $911 million in dividend payments.
Net cash flows used in financing activities were $3.37 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, which was primarily attributable to $3.0 billion in dividend payments, $754 million in common stock repurchases and $132 million in payments of financing costs, partially offset by proceeds of $495 million from the issuance of the 2025 LVSC Senior Notes.
As of December 31, 2020, we had $3.96 billion available for borrowing under our U.S., Macao and Singapore revolving facilities, net of letters of credit. Additionally, we had $2.79 billion available for borrowing under the 2012 Singapore Delayed Draw Term Facility to finance construction costs incurred in connection with the MBS Expansion Project.
Capital Financing Overview
We fund our development projects primarily through borrowings from our debt instruments (see "Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 8 - Long-Term Debt") and operating cash flows.
In June 2020, SCL issued, in a private offering, two series of senior unsecured notes in an aggregate principal amount of $1.50 billion. The net proceeds from the offering were used for incremental liquidity and general corporate purposes. (see "Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 8 - Long-Term Debt - Corporate and U.S. Related Debt - SCL Senior Notes").
Our U.S., SCL and Singapore credit facilities, as amended, contain various financial covenants, which include maintaining a maximum leverage ratio or net debt, as defined, to trailing twelve-month adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, as defined. In September 2020, LVSC entered into an amendment, pursuant to which lenders, among other things, removed LVSC’s requirement to maintain a maximum leverage ratio as of the last day of the fiscal quarter during the period beginning on October 31, 2020, through and including December 31, 2021. In March 2020, SCL entered into a waiver and amendment request letter, pursuant to which lenders, among other things, waived SCL’s requirement to ensure the leverage ratio does not exceed 4.0x and the interest coverage ratio is greater than 2.50x for any period beginning on, and including, January 1, 2020 and ending on, and including, July 1, 2021 (other than with respect to the financial year ended December 31, 2019). In September 2020, SCL entered into a waiver extension and amendment request letter, pursuant to which the aforementioned waiver period was extended to January 1, 2022. In June 2020, MBS entered into an amendment letter, such that MBS will not have to comply with the leverage or interest coverage covenants for the financial quarters ending, and including, September 30, 2020 through, and including, December 31, 2021.
Any defaults under our debt agreements would allow the lenders, in each case, to exercise their rights and remedies as defined under their respective agreements. If the lenders were to exercise their rights to accelerate the due dates of the indebtedness outstanding, there can be no assurance we would be able to repay or refinance any
amounts that may become due and payable under such agreements, which could force us to restructure or alter our operations or debt obligations.
We held unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $2.12 billion and restricted cash and cash equivalents of $16 million as of December 31, 2020, of which approximately $1.21 billion of the unrestricted amount is held by non-U.S. subsidiaries. Of the $1.21 billion, approximately $946 million is available to be repatriated to the U.S., and we do not expect withholding taxes or other foreign income taxes to apply should these earnings be distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise. The remaining unrestricted amounts held by non-U.S. subsidiaries are not available for repatriation primarily due to dividend requirements to third-party public stockholders in the case of funds being repatriated from SCL. We believe the cash on hand and cash flow generated from operations, as well as the $3.96 billion available for borrowing under our U.S., Macao and Singapore credit facilities, net of outstanding letters of credit, and SGD 3.69 billion (approximately $2.79 billion at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2020) under the 2012 Singapore Delayed Draw Term Facility, as of December 31, 2020, will be sufficient to maintain compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facilities and fund our working capital needs, committed and planned capital expenditures, development opportunities and debt obligations. In the normal course of our activities, we will continue to evaluate global capital markets to consider future opportunities for enhancements of our capital structure. On January 25, 2021, we increased the amount available under the SCL revolving credit facility by HKD 3.83 billion (approximately $494 million in exchange rates in effect at the time of transaction) to further enhance our liquidity. Subsequently, on January 29, 2021 SCL drew down $29 million and HKD 2.13 billion (approximately $274 million at exchange rates in effect on January 29, 2021) under this facility for general corporate purposes, resulting in remaining available borrowing capacity of $2.21 billion.
During the quarter ended March 31, 2020, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.79 per common share as part of a regular cash dividend program and recorded $603 million as a distribution against retained earnings.
On February 21, 2020, SCL paid a dividend of 0.99 HKD to SCL stockholders (a total of $1.03 billion, of which we retained $717 million during the year ended December 31, 2020).
We have suspended our quarterly dividend program and SCL did not pay a final dividend for 2019 due to the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic.
In June 2018, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $2.50 billion of our outstanding common stock, which was to expire in November 2020. In October 2020, our Board of Directors authorized the extension of the expiration date of the remaining repurchase amount of $916 million to November 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2020, no shares of our common stock were repurchased under this program. All share repurchases of our common stock have been recorded as treasury stock. Repurchases of our common stock are made at our discretion in accordance with applicable federal securities laws in the open market or otherwise. The timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including our financial position, earnings, cash flows, legal requirements, other investment opportunities and market conditions.
Aggregate Indebtedness and Other Contractual Obligations
Our total long-term indebtedness and other contractual obligations are summarized below as of December 31, 2020:
_______________________
(1)As of December 31, 2020, we had a $71 million liability related to uncertain tax positions; we do not expect this liability to result in a payment of cash within the next 12 months. We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the liability in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions; therefore, such amounts are not included in the table.
(2)See "Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 8 - Long-Term Debt" for further details on these financing transactions and "Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 13 - Leases" for further details on finance leases.
(3)Based on the 1-month rate as of December 31, 2020, Singapore Swap Offer Rate ("SOR") of 0.13% plus the applicable interest rate spread in accordance with the respective debt agreements.
(4)We are party to certain operating leases for real estate and various equipment, which primarily include $331 million related to long-term land leases in Macao with an anticipated lease term of 50-years, $132 million related to a 99-year lease agreement (83 years remaining) for a parking structure located adjacent to The Venetian Resort Las Vegas and $70 million related to certain leaseback agreements related to the sale of the Grand Canal Shoppes. See "Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 13 - Leases" for further details on operating leases.
(5)Mall deposits consist of refundable security deposits received from mall tenants.
(6)In addition to the 39% gross gaming win tax in Macao (which is not included in this table as the amount we pay is variable in nature), we are required to pay an annual premium with a fixed portion and a variable portion, which is based on the number and type of gaming tables and gaming machines we operate. Based on the gaming tables and gaming machines in operation as of December 31, 2020, the annual premium payable to the Macao government is approximately $41 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and approximately $21 million through the termination of the gaming subconcession in June 2022.
(7)Primarily consists of all other non-cancellable contractual obligations and primarily relates to certain hotel and restaurant management and service agreements. The amounts exclude open purchase orders with our suppliers that have not yet been received as these agreements generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule and adjust terms based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities, nor have we engaged in any derivative transactions.
Restrictions on Distributions
We are a parent company with limited business operations. Our main asset is the stock and membership interests of our subsidiaries. Certain of our debt instruments contain restrictions that, among other things, limit the ability of certain subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, issue disqualified stock or equity interests, pay dividends or make other distributions, repurchase equity interests or certain indebtedness, create certain liens, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, enter into certain mergers or consolidations or sell certain assets of our Company without prior approval of the lenders or noteholders.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates and judgments are based on historical information, information currently available to us and on various other assumptions management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could vary from those estimates and we may change our estimates and assumptions in future evaluations. Changes in these estimates and assumptions may have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We believe the critical accounting policies discussed below affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Provision for Expected Credit Losses
We maintain a provision for expected credit losses on casino, hotel and mall receivables and regularly evaluate the balances. We apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances, which are grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and days past due. The reserve percentages are based on estimated loss rates supported by historical observed default rates over the expected life of the receivable and are adjusted for forward-looking information. We also specifically analyze the collectability of each account with a balance over a specified dollar amount, based upon the age of the account, the customer's financial condition, collection history and any other known information and adjust the aforementioned reserve with the results from the individual reserve analysis. We also monitor regional and global economic conditions and forecasts, which include the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic, in our evaluation of the adequacy of the recorded reserves.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, there has been a delay in payments on casino receivables due to the inability of patrons to travel to our properties or to accomplish financial transactions due to the travel restrictions caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic. The collection of casino receivables has also been impacted by liquidity issues faced by certain patrons also stemming from the COVID-19 Pandemic. We have increased the provision for credit losses in each jurisdiction accordingly to account for the expected credit losses due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Although we believe the provision on our casino receivables is adequate as of December 31, 2020, it is possible our provisions could increase if we experience further delays on payments from patrons.
Account balances are written off against the provision when we believe it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. Credit or marker play was 24.0%, 14.6% and 68.8% of table games play at our Macao properties, Marina Bay Sands and Las Vegas Operating Properties, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2020. Our provision for casino credit losses was 58.3% and 32.3% of gross casino receivables as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The credit extended to gaming promoters can be offset by the commissions payable to said gaming promoters, which is considered in the establishment of the provision for credit losses. Our provision for credit losses from our hotel and other receivables is not material.
Litigation Accrual
We are subject to various claims and legal actions. We estimate the accruals for these claims and legal actions based on all relevant facts and circumstances currently available and include such accruals in other accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets when it is determined such contingencies are both probable and reasonably estimable.
Property and Equipment
As of December 31, 2020, we had net property and equipment of $15.11 billion, representing 72.6% of our total assets. We depreciate property and equipment on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives are based on the nature of the assets as well as current operating strategy and legal
considerations, such as contractual life. Future events, such as property expansions, property developments, new competition or new regulations, could result in a change in the manner in which we use certain assets requiring a change in the estimated useful lives of such assets. The estimated useful lives of assets are periodically reviewed and adjusted as necessary on a prospective basis.
For assets to be held and used (including projects under development), fixed assets are reviewed for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. If an indicator of impairment exists, we first group our assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities (the "asset group"). Secondly, we estimate the undiscounted future cash flows directly associated with and expected to arise from the completion, use and eventual disposition of such asset group. We estimate the undiscounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset within the asset group. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment is measured based on fair value compared to carrying value, with fair value typically based on a discounted cash flow model. If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs.
To estimate the undiscounted cash flows of our asset groups, we consider all potential cash flows scenarios, which are probability weighted based on management's estimates given current conditions. Determining the recoverability of our asset groups is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including estimated cash flows, probability weighting of potential scenarios, costs to complete construction for assets under development, growth rates and future market conditions, among others. Future changes to our estimates and assumptions based upon changes in macro-economic factors, regulatory environments, operating results or management's intentions may result in future changes to the recoverability of our asset groups.
Due to the substantial reduction in cash flows generated from our operating properties and the ongoing travel restrictions due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, we determined a triggering event occurred in 2020 and an impairment assessment was warranted for our asset groups in Macao, Singapore and Las Vegas. We tested our long-lived assets held for use at our operating properties in Macao, Singapore and Las Vegas for recoverability as of December 31, 2020, resulting in no impairment as the estimated undiscounted future cash flows exceeded their carrying values. We believe we made reasonable estimates and judgments in performing the analysis in light of the uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 Pandemic; however, should the effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic persist for a prolonged duration and projected operating results further decline in future periods, we could be required to recognize an impairment loss.
For assets to be held for sale, the fixed assets (the "disposal group") are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Losses are recognized for any initial or subsequent write-down to fair value less cost to sell, while gains are recognized for any subsequent increase in fair value less cost to sell, but not in excess of the cumulative loss previously recognized. Any gains or losses not previously recognized that result from the sale of the disposal group shall be recognized at the date of sale. Fixed assets are not depreciated while classified as held for sale.
Income Taxes
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (including federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We record income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
Our foreign and U.S. tax rate differential reflects the fact that U.S. tax rates are higher than the statutory tax rates in Singapore and Macao of 17% and 12%, respectively. In August 2018, we received an additional exemption from Macao's corporate income tax on profits generated by the operation of casino games of chance for the period January 1, 2019 through June 26, 2022, the date our subconcession agreement expires. Additionally, we entered into an agreement with the Macao government in April 2019, effective through June 26, 2022, providing for an annual payment of 38 million patacas (approximately $5 million at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2020) that is a substitution for a 12% tax otherwise due from VML shareholders on dividend distributions paid from VML gaming
profits. We intend to request extensions of these tax arrangements; however, there is no assurance we will receive these extensions.
Accounting standards regarding income taxes require a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance, if based on the available evidence, it is "more-likely-than-not" such assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed at each reporting period based on a "more-likely-than-not" realization threshold. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring and tax planning strategies.
We recorded a valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets of certain foreign jurisdictions of $342 million and $279 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and a valuation allowance on certain net deferred tax assets of our U.S. operations of $4.58 billion and $4.51 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Due to the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and the resulting reduction in estimated royalty income from an expected decrease in our Macao and Singapore operations, we recorded a valuation allowance on certain U.S. foreign tax credits, which we no longer expect to utilize during the period 2021 through 2027 before their expiration. We believe we made reasonable estimates and judgments in performing the analysis in light of the uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 Pandemic; however, should the effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic persist for a prolonged duration, we could be required to record additional valuation allowances. Management will reassess the realization of deferred tax assets each reporting period and consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, sources of taxable income and tax planning strategies. To the extent the financial results of these operations improve and it becomes "more-likely-than-not" the deferred tax assets are realizable, we will be able to reduce the valuation allowance in the period such determination is made, as appropriate.
Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Accounting standards regarding uncertainty in income taxes provides a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is "more-likely-than-not" the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely, based solely on the technical merits, of being sustained on examinations. We recorded unrecognized tax benefits of $131 million and $134 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and for which actual outcomes may be different.
Our major tax jurisdictions are the U.S., Macao, and Singapore. We could be subject to examination for tax years beginning in 2016 in Macao and Singapore and tax years 2010 through 2015 and 2017 through 2019 in the U.S.
U.S. tax reform made significant changes to U.S. income tax laws including lowering the U.S. corporate tax rate to 21% effective beginning in 2018 and transitioning from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system resulting in dividends from our foreign subsidiaries not being subject to U.S. income tax and therefore, no longer generating U.S. foreign tax credits.
