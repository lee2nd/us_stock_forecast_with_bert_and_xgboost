Basis of Presentation
Our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report have been derived from our accounts and those of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Our Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending September 30.
In January 2020, we acquired Return Polymers, Inc. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with this acquisition were included in our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2020 and in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss) and statement of cash flow beginning from the effective date of the acquisition in January 2020. The results of operations of Return Polymers are included in our Residential segment.
Initial Public Offering
On June 16, 2020, we completed our IPO of our Class A common stock, in which we sold 38,237,500 shares, including 4,987,500 shares pursuant to the underwriters’ over-allotment option. The shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on June 12, 2020 under the symbol “AZEK”. The shares were sold at an IPO price of $23.00 per share for net proceeds to us of approximately $819.7 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $50.6 million and offering expenses of approximately $9.2 million payable by us. In addition, we used the net proceeds to redeem $350.0 million in aggregate principal of our then-outstanding 2025 Senior Notes, $70.0 million of our then-outstanding principal amount under the Revolving Credit Facility and effected a $337.7 million prepayment of our then-outstanding principal amount under the Term Loan Agreement.
Secondary Offerings
On September 15, 2020, we completed an offering of 28,750,000 shares of Class A common stock, including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase up to 3,750,000 additional shares of Class A common stock, at a public offering price of $33.25 per share. All of the shares were sold by certain of our stockholders, or the Selling Stockholders. We did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares by the Selling Stockholders. The offering expenses of approximately $1.4 million is payable by us and recorded in “Other general expenses” within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). Immediately subsequent to the closing of the secondary offering, our sole stockholder of our Class B common stock converted 33,068,863 shares of its Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock.
On January 26, 2021, we completed an offering of 23,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share, including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase up to 3,000,000 additional shares of Class A common stock, at a public offering price of $40.00 per share. The shares were sold by certain of the Selling Stockholders. We did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares by those Selling Stockholders. In connection with the offering we incurred approximately $1.2 million in expenses.
On June 1, 2021, we completed an offering of 17,250,000 shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share, including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase up to 2,250,000 additional shares of Class A common stock, at a public offering price of $43.50 per share. The shares were sold by certain of the Selling Stockholders. We did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares by those Selling Stockholders. In connection with the offering we incurred approximately $1.1 million in expenses.
Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations
Our results of operations and financial condition are affected by the following factors, which reflect our operating philosophy and continued focus on driving material conversion to our low-maintenance, engineered products in each of our markets.
Volume of Products Sold
Our net sales depend primarily on the volume of products we sell during any given period, and volume is affected by the following items:
•
Economic conditions: Demand for our products is significantly affected by a number of economic factors impacting our customers and consumers. For example, demand for products sold by our Residential segment is driven primarily by home repair and remodeling activity and, to a lesser extent, new home construction activity. The residential repair and remodeling market depends in part on home equity financing, and accordingly, the level of equity in homes will affect consumers’ ability to obtain a home equity line of credit and engage in renovations that would result in purchases of our
products. Demand for our products is also affected by the level of interest rates and the availability of credit, consumer confidence and spending, housing affordability, demographic trends, employment levels and other macroeconomic factors that may influence the extent to which consumers engage in repair and remodeling projects to enhance the outdoor living spaces of their homes. Sales by our Commercial segment in the institutional construction market are affected by amounts available for expenditures in school construction, military bases and other public institutions, which depend in part on the availability of government funding and budgetary priorities. Sales of our engineered polymer materials in our industrial OEM markets are also affected by macroeconomic factors, in particular gross domestic product levels and levels of industrial production. Changes in these economic conditions can impact the volume of our products sold during any given period.
•
Material conversion: We have continued to increase sales of our products through our focused efforts to drive material conversion and market penetration of our products. We believe that there is a long-term trend toward material conversion from traditional materials, such as wood, to the low-maintenance, engineered materials we produce. We believe that our products offer a compelling value proposition due to their enhanced durability and lower maintenance costs compared to products manufactured from traditional materials, and we anticipate that sales of our products will continue to benefit from material conversion. The success of our efforts to drive conversion during any given period will impact the volume of our products sold during that period.
•
Product innovation: We continue to develop and introduce innovative products to accelerate material conversion and expand our markets. We believe that new products will enhance our ability to compete with traditional materials at a variety of price points, and we expect to continue to devote significant resources to developing innovative new products. The volume of our products sold during a given period will depend in part on our successfully introducing new products that generate additional demand as well as the extent to which new products may impact our sales of existing products.
•
Marketing and distribution: Demand for our products is influenced by our efforts to expand and enhance awareness of our premium brands and the benefits of our products as well as to drive continued material conversion. Within our Residential segment, we sell our products through a national network of more than 4,200 dealers, more than 35 distributors and multiple home improvement retailers providing extensive geographic coverage enabling us to effectively serve contractors across the United States and Canada. Within our Commercial segment, we sell our products through a widespread distribution network as well as directly to OEMs. Our customer-focused sales organization generates pull-through demand for our products by driving increased downstream engagement with consumers and key influencers such as architects, builders and contractors and by focusing on strengthening our position with dealers and growing our presence in retail. Our volume of product sales in a given period will be impacted by our ability to raise awareness of our brands and products.
Pricing
In general, our pricing strategy is to price our products at a premium relative to competing materials based on the value proposition they provide, including lower maintenance and lifetime costs. Our pricing strategy differs between our two operating segments as follows:
•
Residential: Prices for our residential products are typically set annually, however recent market trends have warranted repricing on a more frequent basis, taking into account current and anticipated changes in input costs, market dynamics and new product introductions by us or our competitors.
•
Commercial: A number of our commercial product sales, such as those related to our partitions and lockers product lines, are customized by order, and, therefore, these products are typically priced based on the nature of the particular specifications ordered. For other commercial products, such as various Vycom product lines, we maintain standard pricing lists that we review and change periodically as the market demands.
Cost of Materials
Raw material costs, including costs of petrochemical resins, reclaimed polyethylene and PVC material, waste wood fiber and aluminum, represent a majority of our cost of sales. The cost of petrochemical resins used in our manufacturing processes has historically varied significantly and has been affected by changes in supply and demand and in the price of crude oil. In addition, the price of reclaimed polyethylene material, waste wood fiber, aluminum, other additives (including modifiers, TiO2 and pigments) and other raw materials fluctuates depending on, among other things, overall market supply and demand and general business conditions. We have long-standing relationships as well as guaranteed supply contracts with some of our key suppliers but, other than certain contracts with prices determined based on the current index price, we have no fixed-price contracts with any of our major vendors. Under our guaranteed supply contracts, the prices are either established annually based on a discount to the then-current market prices or, for purchase orders, based on market rates in effect when the orders become effective. Prices for spot market purchases are negotiated on a continuous basis in line with the market at the time. During fiscal year 2021, we experienced significant increases in
the cost of our raw materials due to factors such as global and domestic supply chain disruptions, extreme weather events, including Winter Storm Uri, and the direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. While we seek to mitigate the effects of increases in raw material costs by broadening our supplier base, increasing our use of recycled material and scrap, reducing waste and exploring options for material substitution without sacrificing quality, we anticipate that the increased raw material prices and shortages of raw materials that we experienced in fiscal year 2021 may continue for the foreseeable future. We have not entered into hedges with respect to our raw material costs at this time, but we may choose to enter into such hedges in the future.
Product Mix
We offer a wide variety of products across numerous product lines within our Residential and Commercial segments, and these products are sold at different prices, are composed of different materials and involve varying levels of manufacturing complexity. In any particular period, changes in the volume of particular products sold and the prices of those products relative to other products will impact our average selling price and our cost of sales. For example, the gross margins of our Residential segment significantly exceed the gross margins of our Commercial segment. In addition to the impacts attributable to product mix as between the Residential and Commercial segments, our results of operations are impacted by the relative margins associated with individual products within our Residential and Commercial segments, which vary among products. As we continue to introduce new products at varying price points to compete with products made with wood or other traditional materials across a wide range of prices, our overall gross margins may vary from period to period as a result of changes in product mix and different margins for our higher and lower price point offerings. We may choose to introduce new products with initially lower gross margins with the expectation that those margins will improve over time as we improve our manufacturing efficiency for those products. In addition, our product mix and our gross margins may be impacted by our marketing decisions in a particular period as well as the rebates and incentives that we may extend to our customers in a particular period. We also continue to seek to enhance our gross margins by improving manufacturing efficiency across our operations, including by investing in, and expanding, our recycling capabilities and implementing initiatives to more efficiently use scrap and to reduce waste. Our success in achieving margin improvements through these initiatives may vary due to changes in product mix as different products benefit to different degrees from these initiatives.
Seasonality
Although we generally have demand for our products throughout the year, our sales have historically experienced some seasonality. We have typically experienced moderately higher levels of sales of our residential products in the second fiscal quarter of the year as a result of our “early buy” sales and extended payment terms typically available during the second fiscal quarter of the year. As a result of these extended payment terms, our accounts receivable have typically reached seasonal peaks at the end of the second fiscal quarter of the year, and our net cash provided by operating activities has typically been lower in the second fiscal quarter relative to in other quarters. Our sales are also generally impacted by the number of days in a quarter or a year that contractors and other professionals are able to install our products. This can vary dramatically based on, among other things, weather events such as rain, snow and extreme temperatures. We have generally experienced lower levels of sales of our residential products in the first fiscal quarter due to adverse weather conditions in certain markets, which typically reduce the construction and renovation activity during the winter season. In addition, we have experienced higher levels of sales of our bathroom partition products and our locker products during the second half of our fiscal year, which includes the summer months when schools are typically closed and therefore are more likely to undergo remodel activities.
COVID-19
Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been focused on protecting our employees’ health and safety, meeting our customers’ needs as they navigate an uncertain financial and operating environment, working closely with our suppliers to protect our ongoing business operations and rapidly adjusting our short-, medium- and long-term operational plans to proactively and effectively respond to the current and potential future public health crises. While the COVID-19 pandemic and its direct and indirect effects present very serious concerns for our business and operations, our employees and their families, our customers and our suppliers, we believe that we have adapted and continue to adapt well to the wide ranging changes that the global economy continues to undergo, and we remain confident that we will continue to maintain business continuity, produce and sell our products safely and in compliance with applicable laws and governmental orders and mandates, maintain our robust and flexible supply chains and be in a strong position to maintain financial flexibility even in the event of a potentially extended economic downturn. This discussion and analysis includes periods prior to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Although we have implemented measures to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations, we expect that these measures may not fully mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot predict the degree to, or the period over, which we will be affected by the pandemic and resulting governmental and other measures. We expect that the direct and indirect economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will likely continue to affect demand for our products in the foreseeable future. As the COVID-19 pandemic
continues, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the risks described in “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report. See “Risk Factors” for a further discussion of the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.
Acquisitions
Throughout our history, we have made selected acquisitions, and we expect to continue to strategically pursue acquisitions to enhance our market position, supplement our product and technology portfolios and increase the diversity of our business.

Segment Results of Operations
We report our results in two segments: Residential and Commercial. The key segment measures used by our chief operating decision maker in deciding how to evaluate performance and allocate resources to each of the segments are Segment Adjusted EBITDA and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Margin. Depending on certain circumstances, Segment Adjusted EBITDA and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Margin may be calculated differently, from time to time, than our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, which are further discussed under the heading “Selected Consolidated Financial Data-Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” Segment Adjusted EBITDA and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Margin represent measures of segment profit reported to our chief operating decision maker for the purpose of making decisions about allocating resources to a segment and assessing its performance and are determined as disclosed in our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report consistent with the requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 280. We define Segment Adjusted EBITDA as a segment’s net income (loss) before income tax (benefit) expense and by adding to or subtracting therefrom interest expense, net, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation costs, asset impairment and inventory revaluation costs, business transformation costs, capital structure transaction costs, acquisition costs, initial public offering costs and certain other costs. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Margin is equal to a segment’s Segment Adjusted EBITDA divided by such segment’s net sales. Corporate expenses, which include selling, general and administrative costs related to our corporate offices, including payroll and other professional fees, are not included in computing Segment Adjusted EBITDA. Such corporate expenses increased by $20.1 million to $59.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 from $39.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2020, and decreased by $2.7 million to $39.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2020 from $42.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2019.
Residential
The following table summarizes certain financial information relating to the Residential segment results that have been derived from our audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
Net Sales
Net sales of the Residential segment for the year ended September 30, 2021 increased by $273.0 million, or 35.4%, to $1,044.1 million from $771.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales related to our Deck, Rail & Accessories and Exteriors businesses.
Net sales of the Residential segment for the year ended September 30, 2020 increased by $115.7 million, or 17.7%, to $771.2 million from $655.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to higher sales in our Deck, Rail and Accessories and Exteriors businesses driven by continued market growth and success of new products across the portfolio, as well as the benefit from investments in downstream selling capabilities, retail expansion and pricing.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA
Segment Adjusted EBITDA of the Residential segment for the year ended September 30, 2021 increased by $76.5 million, or 32.1% to $314.6 million from $238.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2020. The increase was mainly driven by higher sales, pricing, manufacturing productivity, partially offset by higher raw material costs, manufacturing costs and selling, general and administrative expenses.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA of the Residential segment for the year ended September 30, 2020 increased by $49.3 million, or 26.1%, to $238.1 million from $188.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2019. The increase was mainly driven by higher sales, net manufacturing productivity improvements, as well as lower selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by COVID-19 related production costs.
Commercial
The following table summarizes certain financial information relating to the Commercial segment results that have been derived from our audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
Net Sales
Net sales of the Commercial segment increased by $6.8 million, or 5.3%, to $134.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 from $128.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales in our Vycom business, partially offset by decreased net sales in our Scranton Products business.
Net sales of the Commercial segment for the year ended September 30, 2020 decreased by $10.7 million, or 7.7%, to $128.1 million from $138.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by lower sales in our Vycom business, as the effects of COVID-19 impacted certain end market demands.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA
Segment Adjusted EBITDA of the Commercial segment was $19.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2021, compared to $15.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2020. The increase was driven by higher sales in the Vycom business, pricing and net manufacturing productivity offset by higher raw material costs.
Segment Adjusted EBITDA of the Commercial segment was $15.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2020 compared to $21.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by lower sales in the Vycom business, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs and reductions in selling, general and administrative expenses.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our Consolidated Financial Statements prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP performance financial measures, as described below, to provide investors with additional useful information about our financial performance, to enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and to allow for greater transparency with respect to important metrics used by our management for financial and operational decision-making. We are presenting these non-GAAP financial measures to assist investors in seeing our financial performance from management’s view and because we believe they provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our core financial performance over multiple periods with other companies in our industry. Our GAAP financial results include significant expenses that are not indicative of our ongoing operations as detailed in the tables below.
However, non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in their usefulness to investors because they have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, our Consolidated Financial Statements prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.
Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Profit Margin, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin
We define Adjusted Gross Profit as gross profit before depreciation and amortization, business transformation costs and acquisition costs as described below. Adjusted Gross Profit Margin is equal to Adjusted Gross Profit divided by net sales. We define Adjusted Net Income as net income (loss) before amortization, stock-based compensation costs, business transformation costs, acquisition costs, initial public offering costs, capital structure transaction costs and certain other costs as described below. We define Adjusted Diluted EPS as Adjusted Net Income divided by weighted average common shares outstanding-diluted, to reflect the conversion or exercise, as applicable, of all outstanding shares of restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and options to purchase shares of our common stock. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, net, income tax (benefit) expense and depreciation and amortization and by adding to or subtracting therefrom items of expense and income as described below. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is equal to Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales. We believe Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Profit Margin, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are useful to investors because they help identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by certain expenses that can vary from company to company depending on, among other things, its financing, capital structure and the method by which its assets were acquired, and can also vary significantly from period to period. We also add back depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation because we do not consider them indicative of our core operating performance. We believe their exclusion facilitates comparisons of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis. Therefore, we believe that showing gross profit and net income, as adjusted to remove the impact of these expenses, is helpful to investors in assessing our gross profit and net income performance in a way that is similar to the way management assesses our performance. Additionally, EBITDA and EBITDA margin are common measures of operating performance in our industry, and we believe they facilitate operating comparisons. Our management also uses Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Profit Margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin in conjunction with other GAAP financial measures for planning purposes, including as a measure of our core operating results and the effectiveness of our business strategy, and in evaluating our financial performance. Management considers Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS as useful measures because our cost of sales includes the depreciation of property, plant and equipment used in the production of products and the amortization of various intangibles related to our manufacturing processes.
Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Profit Margin, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:
•
These measures do not reflect our cash expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;
•
These measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;
•
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt;
•
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not reflect our income tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes;
•
Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS and Adjusted EBITDA exclude the expense of depreciation, in the case of Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA, and amortization, in each case, of our assets, and, although these are non-cash expenses, the assets being depreciated or amortized may have to be replaced in the future;
•
Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS and Adjusted EBITDA exclude the expense associated with our equity compensation plan, although equity compensation has been, and will continue to be, an important part of our compensation strategy;
•
Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS and Adjusted EBITDA exclude certain business transformation costs, acquisition costs and other costs, each of which can affect our current and future cash requirements; and
•
Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Profit Margin, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.
Because of these limitations, none of these metrics should be considered indicative of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity Outlook
Our primary cash needs are to fund working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and any acquisitions we may undertake. As of September 30, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $250.5 million and total indebtedness of $467.7 million. CPG International LLC, our direct, wholly owned subsidiary, had approximately $146.7 million available under the borrowing base of our Revolving Credit Facility for future borrowings as of September 30, 2021. CPG International LLC has the option to increase the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by up to $100.0 million, subject to certain conditions.
We believe we will have adequate liquidity over the next 12 months to operate our business and to meet our cash requirements as a result of cash flows from operating activities, available cash balances and availability under our Revolving Credit Facility after consideration of our debt service and other cash requirements. In the longer term, our liquidity will depend on many factors, including our results of operations, our future growth, the timing and extent of our expenditures to develop new products and improve our manufacturing capabilities, the expansion of our sales and marketing activities and the extent to which we make acquisitions. Changes in our operating plans, material changes in anticipated sales, increased expenses, acquisitions or other events may cause us to seek additional equity and/or debt financing in future periods.
Holding Company Status
We are a holding company and do not conduct any business operations of our own. As a result, we are largely dependent upon cash dividends and distributions and other transfers from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations. The agreements governing the indebtedness of our subsidiaries impose restrictions on our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to us.
CPG International LLC is party to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are secured by specified assets. The obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are guaranteed by The AZEK Company Inc. and the wholly owned domestic subsidiaries of CPG International LLC other than certain immaterial subsidiaries and other excluded subsidiaries.
The Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain covenants restricting payments of dividends by CPG International LLC unless certain conditions, as provided in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, are met. The covenants under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities provide for certain exceptions for specific types of payments. However, other than restricted payments under the specified exceptions, the covenants under our Term Loan Agreement generally prohibit the payment of dividends unless the fixed charge coverage ratio of CPG International LLC, on a pro forma basis, for the four quarters preceding the declaration or payment of such dividend would be at least 2.00 to 1.00 and such restricted payments do not exceed an amount based on the sum of $40.0 million plus 50% of consolidated net income for the period commencing October 1, 2013 to the end of the most recent fiscal quarter for which internal consolidated financial statements of CPG International LLC are available at the time of such restricted payment, plus certain customary addbacks. Based on the general restrictions in our Term Loan Agreement as of September 30, 2021, CPG International LLC would have been permitted to declare or pay dividends of up to $168.5 million, plus any dividends for the specific purposes specified in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.
Since the restricted net assets of the Company exceed 25% of our consolidated net assets, in accordance with Rule 12-04, Schedule 1 of Regulation S-X, refer to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for condensed parent company financial statements of the Company.
Cash Sources
We have historically relied on cash flows from operations generated by CPG International LLC, borrowings under the credit facilities, issuances of notes and other forms of debt financing and capital contributions to fund our cash needs.
On September 30, 2013, our subsidiary, CPG International LLC (as successor-in-interest to CPG Merger Sub LLC, a limited liability company formed to effect the acquisition of CPG International LLC), Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, as administrative agent and collateral agent, or the Revolver Administrative Agent, and the lenders party thereto entered into the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility provides for maximum aggregate borrowings of up to $150.0 million, subject to an asset-based borrowing base. The borrowing base is limited to a specified percentage of eligible accounts receivable and inventory, less reserves that may be established by the Revolver Administrative Agent in the exercise of its reasonable credit judgment. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, CPG International LLC had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and had $3.3 million and $6.8 million, respectively, of outstanding letters of credit held against the Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, CPG International LLC had approximately $146.7 million and $129.4 million, respectively, available under the borrowing base for future borrowings in addition to cash and cash equivalents on hand of $250.5 million and $215.0 million, respectively. Because our borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility depends, in part, on inventory,
accounts receivable and other assets that fluctuate from time to time, the amount available under the borrowing base may not reflect actual borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility.
Cash Uses
Our principal cash requirements have included working capital, capital expenditures, payments of principal and interest on our debt, and, if market conditions warrant, making selected acquisitions. We may elect to use cash from operations, debt proceeds, equity or a combination thereof to finance future acquisition opportunities.
Cash Flows
“N/M” indicates the variance as a percentage is not meaningful.
Year Ended September 30, 2021, Compared with Year Ended September 30, 2020
Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities was $207.7 million and $98.4 million for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The $109.3 increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily related to the increase in net income over the year ended September 30, 2020.
Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $175.1 million and $113.8 million for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended September 30, 2021 primarily consisted of purchases of property, plant and equipment to support our expansion of capacity in our manufacturing facilities, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2020, which primarily consisted of purchases of property, plant and equipment in the normal course of business and $18.5 million for the acquisition of Return Polymers, Inc.
Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $2.9 million and $124.5 million for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2021 consisted of proceeds of cash received from the exercise of stock options, offset by debt fees paid to third parties, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2020, which consisted of proceeds from our IPO, net of related costs, our issuance of the 2025 Senior Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility, offset by our redemption of the 2025 Senior Notes and the 2021 Senior Notes, debt payments and redemptions of capital contributions.
Year Ended September 30, 2020, Compared with Year Ended September 30, 2019
Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities was $98.4 million and $94.9 million for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During the first half of our fiscal year, we operate programs to prepare for increased purchases during the building season, and as a result, we typically experience an increase in cash used in operating activities relative to the second half of our fiscal year. During the year ended September 30, 2020, our operating cash flow increased as a result of the increased demand for our Residential products, partially offset by higher accounts receivable and inventory balances.
Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $113.8 million and $62.9 million for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, primarily representing purchases of property, plant and equipment in the normal course of business and $18.5 million for the acquisition of Return Polymers, Inc.

Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2020 consisted of proceeds from our IPO, net of related costs, our issuance of the 2025 Senior Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility, offset by our redemption of the 2025 Senior Notes and the 2021 Senior Notes, debt payments and redemptions of capital contributions, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2019, which consisted of proceeds from our Revolving Credit Facility, offset by payments for debt and contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Ultralox.
Availability under our Revolving Credit Facility
The Revolving Credit Facility provides for maximum aggregate borrowings of up to $150.0 million, subject to an asset-based borrowing base. Outstanding revolving loans under the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at a rate which equals, at our option, either (i) for alternative base rate, or ABR, borrowings, the highest of (a) the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, (b) the prime rate and (c) the LIBOR, as of such date for a deposit in U.S. dollars with a maturity of one month plus 100 basis points, plus, in each case, a spread of 25 to 75 basis points based on average historical availability, or (ii) for Eurocurrency borrowings, adjusted LIBOR plus a spread of 125 to 175 basis points, based on average historical availability. The maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility is the earlier of March 31, 2026 and the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity of the Term Loan Agreement or any permitted refinancing thereof.
A “commitment fee” accrues on any unused portion of the revolving commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility during the preceding three calendar month period. If the average daily used percentage is greater than 50%, the commitment fee equals 25 basis points, and if the average daily used percentage is less than or equal to 50%, the commitment fee equals 37.5 basis points.
The obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are secured by a first priority security interest in certain assets, including substantially all of the accounts receivable, inventory, deposit accounts, securities accounts and cash assets of The AZEK Company Inc., CPG International LLC and the subsidiaries of CPG International LLC that are guarantors under the Revolving Credit Facility, and the proceeds thereof (subject to certain exceptions), or the Revolver Priority Collateral, plus a second priority security interest in all of the Term Loan Priority Collateral (as defined below). The obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by The AZEK Company Inc. and the wholly owned domestic subsidiaries of CPG International LLC other than certain immaterial subsidiaries and other excluded subsidiaries.
Revolving loans under the Revolving Credit Facility may be voluntarily prepaid in whole, or in part, in each case without premium or penalty. CPG International LLC is also required to make mandatory prepayments (i) when aggregate borrowings exceed commitments or the applicable borrowing base and (ii) during “cash dominion,” which occurs if (a) the availability under the Revolving Credit Facility is less than the greater of (i) $12.5 million and (ii) 10% of the lesser of (x) $150.0 million and (y) the borrowing base, for five consecutive business days or (b) certain events of default have occurred and are continuing.
The Revolving Credit Facility contains affirmative covenants that are customary for financings of this type, including allowing the Revolver Administrative Agent to perform periodic field exams and appraisals to evaluate the borrowing base. The Revolving Credit Facility contains various negative covenants, including limitations on, subject to certain exceptions, the incurrence of indebtedness, the incurrence of liens, dispositions, investments, acquisitions, restricted payments, transactions with affiliates, as well as other negative covenants customary for financings of this type. The Revolving Credit Facility also includes a financial maintenance covenant, applicable only when the excess availability is less than the greater of (i) 10% of the lesser of the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility and the borrowing base, and (ii) $12.5 million. In such circumstances, we would be required to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility) for the trailing four quarters equal to at least 1.0 to 1.0; subject to our ability to make an equity cure (no more than twice in any four quarter period and up to five times over the life of the facility). As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, CPG International LLC was in compliance with the financial and nonfinancial covenants imposed by the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility also includes customary events of default, including the occurrence of a change of control.
We also have the option to increase the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by up to $100.0 million, subject to certain conditions.
Term Loan Agreement
The Term Loan Agreement is a first lien term loan. As of each of September 30, 2021 and 2020, CPG International LLC had $467.7 million outstanding under the Term Loan Agreement. The Term Loan Agreement will mature on May 5, 2024.
The interest rate applicable to the outstanding principal under the Term Loan Agreement equals, at our option, either, (i) in the case of ABR borrowings, the highest of (a) the Federal Funds Rate as of such day plus 50 basis points, (b) the prime rate and (c) the LIBOR as of such day for a deposit in U.S. dollars with a maturity of one month plus 100 basis points, provided that in no event will the alternative base rate be less than 175 basis points, plus, in each case, the applicable margin of 150 basis points per annum; or (ii) in the case of Eurocurrency borrowings, the greater of (a) the LIBOR in effect for such interest period divided by one, minus the statutory reserves applicable to such Eurocurrency borrowing, if any, and (b) 75 basis points, plus the applicable margin of 250 basis points per annum. The applicable margin may be reduced by a further 25 basis points in respect of both Eurocurrency borrowings and ABR borrowings during any period that CPG International LLC maintains specified public corporate family ratings.
The obligations under the Term Loan Agreement are secured by a first priority security interest in the membership interests of CPG International LLC owned by The AZEK Company Inc., the equity interests of CPG International LLC’s domestic subsidiaries and all remaining assets not constituting Revolver Priority Collateral (subject to certain exceptions) of The AZEK Company Inc., CPG International LLC and the subsidiaries of CPG International LLC that are guarantors under the Term Loan Agreement, or the Term Loan Priority Collateral, and a second priority security interest in the Revolver Priority Collateral. The obligations under the Term Loan Agreement are guaranteed by The AZEK Company Inc. and the wholly owned domestic subsidiaries of CPG International LLC other than certain immaterial subsidiaries and other excluded subsidiaries.
The Term Loan Agreement may be voluntarily prepaid in whole, or in part, in each case without premium or penalty (other than the Prepayment Premium, as defined in the Term Loan Agreement, if applicable), subject to certain customary conditions. CPG International LLC is also required to make mandatory prepayments in an amount equal to (i) 100% of the net cash proceeds from casualty events or the disposition of property or assets, subject to customary reinvestment rights, (ii) 100% of the net cash proceeds from the incurrence or issuance of indebtedness (other than permitted indebtedness) by CPG International LLC or any restricted subsidiary and (iii) 50% of excess cash flow, with such percentage subject to reduction (to 25% and to 0%) upon achievement of specified leverage ratios and which prepayment may be declined by the lenders under the Term Loan Agreement. As of September 30, 2021, and 2020, no excess cash flow payment was required based on the current leverage ratio. The lenders under the Term Loan Agreement have the option to decline any prepayments based on excess cash flows. At the lenders’ option the excess cash flow payment made in January 2020 was $2.2 million with the remaining prepayment declined by the lenders. Additionally, CPG International LLC is required to pay the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan Agreement in quarterly installments of 0.25253% of the aggregate principal amount under the Term Loan Agreement outstanding, and such quarterly payments may be reduced as a result of prepayments. Based on the prepayment of $337.7 million made with net proceeds we received from our IPO, CPG International LLC has prepaid all of the quarterly principal payments otherwise due through the maturity of the Term Loan Agreement.
The Term Loan Agreement contains affirmative covenants, negative covenants and events of default, which are broadly consistent with those in the Revolving Credit Facility (with certain differences consistent with the differences between a revolving loan and term loan) and that are customary for facilities of this type. The Term Loan Agreement does not have any financial maintenance covenants. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, CPG International LLC was in compliance with the covenants imposed by the Term Loan Agreement. The Term Loan Agreement also includes customary events of default, including the occurrence of a change of control.
We have the right to arrange for incremental term loans under the Term Loan Agreement of up to an aggregate principal amount of $150.0 million, plus the amounts incurred under Incremental Amendment No. 1 thereto, plus any amounts previously voluntarily prepaid, with additional incremental term loans available if certain leverage ratios are achieved.
Restrictions on Dividends
The Senior Secured Credit Facilities each restrict payments of dividends unless certain conditions, as provided in the Revolving Credit Facility or the Term Loan Agreement, as applicable, are met.
Contingent Commitments
We have contractual commitments for purchases of certain minimum quantities of raw materials at index-based prices, and non-cancelable capital and operating leases, outstanding letters of credit and fixed asset purchase commitments. For a description of our contractual obligations and commitments, see Notes 7 “Debt”, 9 “Leases” and 17 “Commitments and Contingencies” to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Other
We are currently in the process of a multi-phase capacity expansion program including the opening of a new manufacturing facility to be located in Boise, Idaho. In connection with our capacity expansion program, we have announced our intention to invest approximately $230 million through 2022 which we expect to add a total of approximately 85% of incremental decking capacity relative to our decking capacity at the end of fiscal year 2019, combined with increases in recycling, railing and exteriors capacity. The first and second phases of our multi-phase capacity expansion plan were completed during the third quarter of fiscal year 2021, providing cumulatively approximately 40% more decking capacity. We subsequently upsized our expansion plans at our Wilmington, Ohio facility and expect to add an incremental approximately 15% of decking and recycling capacity in early 2022. The third phase involves the opening of a new manufacturing facility, which will be located in Boise, Idaho and is expected to be operational during fiscal 2022 and contribute approximately 30% more decking capacity.
We also intend to continue to invest in new capacity in the ordinary course as we execute against the long-term material conversion opportunity and market expansion.
Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Assumptions
A discussion of our significant accounting policies and significant accounting estimates and judgments is presented in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Throughout the preparation of the financial statements, we employ significant judgments in the application of accounting principles and methods. These judgments are primarily related to the assumptions used to arrive at various estimates. These significant accounting estimates and judgments include:
Revenue Recognition
Our Residential segment generates revenue from the sale of our innovative, low-maintenance, sustainable Outdoor Living products, including decking, railing, trim, moulding, pavers products and accessories. Our Commercial segment generates revenue from the sale of sustainable low-maintenance privacy and storage solution products and highly engineered plastic sheet products.
We recognize revenues when control of the promised goods is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods, at a point in time, when shipping occurs. Each product we transfer to the customer is considered one performance obligation. We have elected to account for shipping and handling costs as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer the goods. As a result of this accounting policy election, we do not consider shipping and handling activities as promised services to our customers.
Customer contracts are typically fixed price and short-term in nature. The transaction price is based on the product specifications and is determined at the time of order. We do not engage in contracts greater than one year, and therefore do not have any incremental costs capitalized as of September 30, 2021 or September 30, 2020.
We may offer various sales incentive programs throughout the year. We estimate the amount of sales incentive to allocate to each performance obligation, or product shipped, using the most-likely-amount method of estimation, based on sales to the direct customer or sell-through customer. The estimate is updated each reporting period and any changes are allocated to the performance obligations on the same basis as at inception. Changes in estimate allocated to a previously satisfied performance obligation are recognized as part of net revenue in the period in which the change occurs under the cumulative catch-up method. In addition to sales incentive programs, we may offer a payment discount, if payments are received within 30 days. We estimate the payment discount that we determine will be taken by the customer based on prior history and using the most-likely-amount method of estimation. We believe the most-likely-amount method best predicts the amount of consideration to which we will be entitled. The payment discounts are also reflected as part of net revenue. The total amount of incentives was $92.5 million, $63.1 million and $50.8 million for the years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Customer program costs and incentives, such as rebates are a common practice in our business. We incur customer program costs to promote sales of products and to maintain competitive pricing. Customer program costs and incentives include annual programs related to volume growth as well as certain product-specific incentives. The program costs are accounted for at the time the revenue is recognized in net sales. Management’s estimates are based on historical and projected experience for each type of program or customer and in consideration of product specific incentives. Management periodically reviews accruals for these rebates and allowances, and adjusts accruals when circumstances indicate (typically as a result of a change in volume expectations).
Goodwill
We evaluate goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter at the reporting unit level annually, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change in the interim that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the asset below the carrying amount. Goodwill is considered to be impaired when the net book value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. Our evaluation may begin with a qualitative assessment of the factors that could impact the significant inputs used to estimate fair value to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed to a quantitative assessment to determine if goodwill is impaired. In quantitative impairment tests, we first compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is impaired and an impairment loss is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.
We measure fair value of the reporting units to which goodwill is allocated using an income based approach, a generally accepted valuation methodology, using relevant data available through and as of the impairment testing date. Under the income approach, fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow method, projecting future cash flows of each reporting unit, as well as a terminal value, and discounting such cash flows at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows. The key
assumptions and factors used in this approach include, but are not limited to, revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts, a weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows, and a review with comparable market multiples for the industry segment as well as our historical operating trends. Any impairment is increased to encompass the income tax effects of any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit, so that the after-tax impairment loss is equivalent to the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value.
No impairments were recorded during the year ended September 30, 2021 as the estimated fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value for all reporting units.
Product Warranties
We provide product assurance warranties against certain defects to our customers based on standard terms and conditions for periods beginning as of the sale date and lasting from five years to a lifetime, depending on the product and subject to various limitations. We provide for the estimated cost of warranties by product line at the time revenue is recognized based on management’s judgment, considering such factors as cost per claim, historical experience, anticipated rates of claims, and other available information, including our stated warranty policies and procedures. Management reviews and adjusts these estimates, if necessary, based on the differences between actual experience and historical estimates. Because warranty issues may surface later in the product life cycle, management continues to review these estimates on a regular basis and considers adjustments to these estimates based on actual experience compared to historical estimates. Estimating the required warranty reserves requires a high level of judgment, especially as many of our products are at a relatively early stage in their product life cycles. The warranty obligation is reflected in other current and other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
Equity Based Compensation
Prior to our IPO
To assist us in attracting, retaining, incentivizing and motivating employees, certain employees were granted limited partnership interests in our former indirect parent entity, which we refer to as the Partnership, that generally were intended to constitute “profits interests,” or the Profits Interests. The Profits Interests were subject to specified hurdle amounts, which functioned like option exercise prices because the Profits Interests did not participate in distributions by the Partnership until distributions to equity holders had exceeded the relevant hurdle amounts. In general, awards of Profits Interests were 50% time vested and 50% performance vested.
Prior to completion of our IPO, interests in the Partnership, including the Profits Interests, were not listed on any established exchange. In determining the fair value of the Profits Interests, we took into account the methodologies and approaches described in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Accounting and Valuation Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. The sole material asset of the Partnership was indirect ownership of our company. Accordingly, the fair value of the Profits Interests was derived by reference to the value of our company, which we estimated using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. Under the income approach, we estimated the fair value of our company based on the present value of our future estimated cash flows and the estimated residual value of our company beyond the forecast period. These future values were discounted to their present values at a discount rate deemed appropriate to reflect the risks inherent in achieving these estimated cash flows. Significant estimates and judgments involved in the income approach include our estimated future cash flows, the perpetuity growth rate assumed in estimating the residual value of our cash flows and the discount rate used to discount our cash flows to present value. For the market approach, we utilized the comparable company method by analyzing a group of companies that were considered to be comparable to us in terms of product offerings, revenue, margins and/or growth. We then used these companies to develop relevant market multiples, which were applied to our corresponding financial metrics to estimate our equity value. Significant estimates and judgments used in the comparable company method included the selection of comparable companies and the selection of appropriate market multiples. Application of these approaches involves the use of estimates, judgment and assumptions that are highly subjective. Following our IPO, it is not necessary to apply these valuation approaches as shares of our Class A common stock are traded in the public market.
In order to determine the value of the Profits Interests, the estimated equity value of the Partnership was allocated among the various interests in the Partnership, including the Profits Interests, using the option pricing method, which treated the various interests in the Partnership as call options with exercise prices determined based on their respective rights to participate in distributions by the Partnership. The values attributable to these implicit call options were determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions, including volatility and the expected term of the call options. As equity interests in the Partnership were not publicly traded, expected volatility was derived based on the volatilities of a peer group of publicly traded companies that were deemed to be similar to us. The expected term of the options was based on the anticipated time to liquidity. Other assumptions include the risk-free rate of interest and dividend yield. The risk-free rate of interest was based on yields for U.S. Treasury securities with remaining maturities corresponding to the estimated term of the options. Dividends were assumed to be zero, consistent with historical experience. After the equity value was determined and
allocated to the various classes of interests in the Partnership, including the Profits Interests, a discount for lack of marketability, or DLOM, was applied to derive the fair value of the Profits Interests. A DLOM is meant to account for the lack of marketability of a security that is not publicly traded.
The cost of time-vested Profits Interests was recognized as an expense generally on a straight-line basis over the employee’s requisite service period, which generally coincided with the vesting of the award. For performance vested Profits Interests, expense was recognized if and when the achievement of the applicable performance criteria became probable. Performance vested Profits Interests only vested upon receipt by the Sponsors of specified proceeds (in the form of cash and marketable securities) or, in the event of a Change of Control (as defined in the Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Partnership, dated as of September 30, 2013), upon the Sponsors achieving a specified rate of return. Through September 30, 2019 and immediately prior to the IPO, no compensation expense had been recognized with respect to the performance vested Profits Interests because the achievement of the performance criteria had not become probable.
Subsequent to our IPO
We determine the expense for all employee stock-based compensation awards by estimating their fair value and recognizing such value as an expense, on a straight-line, ratable or cliff basis, depending on the award, in our consolidated financial statements over the requisite service period in which employees earn the awards. We estimate the fair value of performance-based awards granted to employees using the Monte Carlo pricing model and for service-based awards granted to employees using the Black Scholes pricing model. The fair value of performance-based awards that are expected to vest is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The fair value of service-based awards that are expected to vest is recognized as compensation expense on either (1) a straight-line basis, (2) a ratable vesting basis or (3) a cliff vesting basis. We account for forfeitures as they occur.
To determine the fair value of a stock-based award using the Monte Carlo and Black Scholes models, we make assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, expected future volatility, expected dividend yield and performance period. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. We estimate the expected volatility of the share price by reviewing the estimated volatility levels of our Class A common stock in conjunction with the historical volatility levels of public companies that operate in similar industries or are similar in terms of stage of development or size and then projecting this information toward its future expected volatility. We exercise judgment in selecting these companies, as well as in evaluating the available historical and implied volatility for these companies. Dividend yield is determined based on our future plans to pay dividends. We calculate the performance period based on the specific market condition to be achieved and derived from estimates of future performance. We calculate the expected term in years for each stock option using a simplified method based on the average of each option’s vesting term and original contractual term. The simplified method is used due to the lack of sufficient historical data available to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term of each stock option.
Stock-Based Compensation Expense
We recognized $22.7 million, $120.5 million and $3.3 million in stock-based compensation expense during the years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The stock-based compensation expense recognized in fiscal year 2020 is primarily a result of the vesting of performance-based equity awards due to the Sponsors receiving sufficient proceeds from our secondary offering completed in September 2020. As of September 30, 2021, the Company had not yet recognized compensation cost on unvested stock-based awards of $24.5 million, with a weighted average remaining recognition period of 2.4 years.
Income Taxes
In determining our current income tax provision, we assessed temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences resulted in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets. When we maintain deferred tax assets, we must assess the likelihood that these assets will be recovered through adjustments to future taxable income. To the extent we believe, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the asset will not be realized, we establish a valuation allowance. We record an allowance reducing the asset to a value we believe is more likely than not to be realized based on our expectation of future taxable income. We believe the accounting estimate related to the valuation allowance is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period as it requires management to make assumptions about our future income over the lives of the deferred tax assets, and the impact of increasing or decreasing the valuation allowance is potentially material to our results of operations.
Forecasting future income requires us to use a significant amount of judgment. In estimating future income, we use our internal operating budgets and long-range planning projections. We developed our budgets and long-range projections based on recent results, trends, economic and industry forecasts influencing our segments’ performance, our backlog, planned timing of new product launches,
and customer sales projections. Significant changes in the expected realization of net deferred tax assets would require that we adjust the valuation allowance, resulting in a change to net income.
We record liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is recognition, where we evaluate whether an individual tax position has a likelihood of greater than 50% of being sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. For tax positions that are currently estimated to have a less than 50% likelihood of being sustained, no tax benefit is recorded. For tax positions that have met the recognition threshold in the first step, we perform the second step of measuring the benefit (expense) to be recorded. The actual benefits (expense) ultimately realized may differ from our estimates. In future periods, changes in facts, circumstances, and new information may require us to change the recognition and measurement estimates with regard to individual tax positions. Changes in recognition and measurement estimates are recorded in the consolidated statement of income and consolidated balance sheet in the period in which such changes occur. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, we had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits pertaining to uncertain tax positions totaling $1.0 million and $1.0 million, respectively.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
Under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, we qualified as an emerging growth company, or an EGC, and as such, have elected not to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting pronouncements. During the extended transition period, we were not subject to new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies.
Based on our public float calculation at March 31, 2021, we are deemed a Large Accelerated Filer under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission guidelines and ceased to qualify as an EGC effective September 30, 2021. The loss of EGC status resulted in losing the reporting exemptions noted above, and in particular required our independent registered public accounting firm to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of and for the year ended September 30, 2021 under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
On October 1, 2018, we early adopted ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. The update will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance. Under the new standard, entities are required to identify the contract with a customer; identify the separate performance obligations in the contract; determine the transaction price; allocate the transaction price to the separate performance obligations in the contract; and recognize the appropriate amount of revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies each performance obligation. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
On October 1, 2019, we adopted ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfer of Assets Other Than Inventory. The standard amends several aspects of the tax accounting and recognition timing for intra-company transfers. We adopted the standard using a modified retrospective approach, with an adjustment to the beginning retained earnings of approximately $1.3 million, due to the cumulative impact of adopting the standard. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
On October 1, 2020, we adopted ASU No. 2018-13, Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement, which amends Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement. This standard modifies the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements by removing, modifying, or adding certain disclosures. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
On October 1, 2020, we adopted ASC 842 (Leases) using the transition method introduced by ASU 2018-11, which does not require revisions to comparative periods. Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recording of lease assets and lease liabilities of approximately $15.2 million and $18.7 million, respectively, as of October 1, 2020. The difference between the lease assets and lease liabilities primarily relates to accrued rent and unamortized lease incentives recorded in accordance with the previous leasing guidance. As of the adoption date, accumulated deficit within shareholder's equity on our consolidated balance sheet decreased by $2.1 million, primarily related to the derecognition of build-to-suit leasing arrangements. The new standard did not materially impact our consolidated statements of income or cash flows.
On October 1, 2020, we adopted ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), and the subsequent amendments The standard sets forth an expected credit loss model which requires the measurement of expected credit losses for financial instruments based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This replaces the existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost, and certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
On October 1, 2020, we adopted ASU No. 2018-15, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): The standard aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
On October 1, 2020, we adopted ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848), The standard provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contract modifications and hedging relationships, subject to meeting certain criteria, that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740)-Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. This standard simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to general principles in Topic 740 and clarifying and amending existing guidance. For public entities, the amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. Early adoption of the amendments is permitted, including adoption in any interim period for (1) public business entities for periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued and (2) all other entities for periods for which financial statements have not yet been made available for issuance. An entity that elects to early adopt the amendments in an interim period should reflect any adjustments as of the beginning of the annual period that includes that interim period. Additionally, an entity that elects early adoption must adopt all the amendments in the same period. The amendments are applied on a prospective or retrospective basis, depending upon the amendment adopted within this ASU. The amendments in this ASU are effective for us for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021. We are currently evaluating the impact this adoption will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
