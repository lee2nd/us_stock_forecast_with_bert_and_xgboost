Overview
ENLC is a Delaware limited liability company formed in October 2013. ENLC’s material assets consist of all of the outstanding common units of ENLK and all of the membership interests of the General Partner. All of our midstream energy assets are owned and operated by ENLK and its subsidiaries. We primarily focus on providing midstream energy services, including:
•gathering, compressing, treating, processing, transporting, storing, and selling natural gas;
•fractionating, transporting, storing, and selling NGLs; and
•gathering, transporting, stabilizing, storing, trans-loading, and selling crude oil and condensate, in addition to brine disposal services.
Our midstream energy asset network includes approximately 11,900 miles of pipelines, 22 natural gas processing plants with approximately 5.5 Bcf/d of processing capacity, seven fractionators with approximately 290,000 Bbls/d of fractionation capacity, barge and rail terminals, product storage facilities, purchasing and marketing capabilities, brine disposal wells, a crude oil trucking fleet, and equity investments in certain joint ventures. We manage and report our activities primarily according to the nature of activity and geography. We have five reportable segments:
•Permian Segment. The Permian segment includes our natural gas gathering, processing, and transmission activities and our crude oil operations in the Midland and Delaware Basins in West Texas and Eastern New Mexico;
•Louisiana Segment. The Louisiana segment includes our natural gas and NGL pipelines, natural gas processing plants, natural gas and NGL storage facilities, and fractionation facilities located in Louisiana and our crude oil operations in ORV;
•Oklahoma Segment. The Oklahoma segment includes our natural gas gathering, processing, and transmission activities, and our crude oil operations in the Cana-Woodford, Arkoma-Woodford, northern Oklahoma Woodford, STACK, and CNOW shale areas;
•North Texas Segment. The North Texas segment includes our natural gas gathering, processing, and transmission activities in North Texas; and
•Corporate Segment. The Corporate segment includes our unconsolidated affiliate investments in the Cedar Cove JV in Oklahoma, our ownership interest in GCF in South Texas, our derivative activity, and our general corporate assets and expenses.
We manage our consolidated operations by focusing on adjusted gross margin because our business is generally to gather, process, transport, or market natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, and condensate using our assets for a fee. We earn our fees through various fee-based contractual arrangements, which include stated fee-only contract arrangements or arrangements with fee-based components where we purchase and resell commodities in connection with providing the related service and earn a net margin as our fee. We earn our net margin under our purchase and resell contract arrangements primarily as a result of stated service-related fees that are deducted from the price of the commodity purchase. While our transactions vary in form, the essential element of most of our transactions is the use of our assets to transport a product or provide a processed product to an end-user or marketer at the tailgate of the plant, pipeline, or barge, truck, or rail terminal. Adjusted gross margin is a non-GAAP financial measure and is explained in greater detail under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. Approximately 94% of our adjusted gross margin was derived from fee-based contractual arrangements with minimal direct commodity price exposure for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Our revenues and adjusted gross margins are generated from eight primary sources:
•gathering and transporting natural gas, NGLs, and crude oil on the pipeline systems we own;
•processing natural gas at our processing plants;
•fractionating and marketing recovered NGLs;
•providing compression services;
•providing crude oil and condensate transportation and terminal services;
•providing condensate stabilization services;
•providing brine disposal services; and
•providing natural gas, crude oil, and NGL storage.
The following customers individually represented greater than 10% of our consolidated revenues. These customers represent a significant percentage of revenues, and the loss of the customer would have a material adverse impact on our results of operations because the revenues and adjusted gross margin received from transactions with these customers is material to us. No other customers represented greater than 10% of our consolidated revenues.
We gather, transport, or store gas owned by others under fee-only contract arrangements based either on the volume of gas gathered, transported, or stored or, for firm transportation arrangements, a stated monthly fee for a specified monthly quantity with an additional fee based on actual volumes. We also buy natural gas from producers or shippers at a market index less a fee-based deduction subtracted from the purchase price of the natural gas. We then gather or transport the natural gas and sell the natural gas at a market index, thereby earning a margin through the fee-based deduction. We attempt to execute substantially all purchases and sales concurrently, or we enter into a future delivery obligation, thereby establishing the basis for the fee we will receive for each natural gas transaction. We are also party to certain long-term gas sales commitments that we satisfy through supplies purchased under long-term gas purchase agreements. When we enter into those arrangements, our sales obligations generally match our purchase obligations. However, over time, the supplies that we have under contract may decline due to reduced drilling or other causes, and we may be required to satisfy the sales obligations by buying additional gas at prices that may exceed the prices received under the sales commitments. In our purchase/sale transactions, the resale price is generally based on the same index at which the gas was purchased.
We typically buy mixed NGLs from our suppliers to our gas processing plants at a fixed discount to market indices for the component NGLs with a deduction for our fractionation fee. We subsequently sell the fractionated NGL products based on the same index-based prices. To a lesser extent, we transport and fractionate or store NGLs owned by others for a fee based on the volume of NGLs transported and fractionated or stored. The operating results of our NGL fractionation business are largely dependent upon the volume of mixed NGLs fractionated and the level of fractionation fees charged. With our fractionation business, we also have the opportunity for product upgrades for each of the discrete NGL products. We realize higher adjusted gross margins from product upgrades during periods with higher NGL prices.
We gather or transport crude oil and condensate owned by others by rail, truck, pipeline, and barge facilities under fee-only contract arrangements based on volumes gathered or transported. We also buy crude oil and condensate on our own gathering
systems, third-party systems, and trucked from producers at a market index less a stated transportation deduction. We then transport and resell the crude oil and condensate through a process of basis and fixed price trades. We execute substantially all purchases and sales concurrently, thereby establishing the net margin we will receive for each crude oil and condensate transaction.
We realize adjusted gross margins from our gathering and processing services primarily through different contractual arrangements: processing margin (“margin”) contracts, POL contracts, POP contracts, fixed-fee based contracts, or a combination of these contractual arrangements. See “
