ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Results of Operations - Overview
QNB Corp. (“QNB” or the “Company”) earns its net income primarily through its subsidiary, QNB Bank (the “Bank”). Net interest income, or the spread between the interest, dividends and fees earned on loans and investment securities and the expense incurred on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities, is the primary source of operating income for QNB. QNB seeks to achieve sustainable and consistent earnings growth while maintaining adequate levels of capital and liquidity and limiting its exposure to credit and interest rate risk levels approved by the Board of Directors. Due to its limited geographic area, comprised principally of Bucks, Lehigh and Montgomery counties, growth is pursued through expansion of existing customer relationships and building new relationships by stressing a consistent high level of service at all points of contact.
Tabular information presented throughout management’s discussion and analysis, other than share and per share data, is presented in thousands of dollars.
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $12,083,000, or $3.42 per share on a diluted basis. This compares to 2019 net income of $12,357,000, or $3.53 per share on a diluted basis and 2018 net income of $11,335,000, or $3.25 per share on a diluted basis. Two important measures of profitability in the banking industry are an institution’s return on average assets and return on average shareholders’ equity. Return on average assets was 0.90%, 1.02% and 0.96% in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, and return on average shareholders’ equity was 9.76%, 10.58% and 10.47%, respectively, during those same periods.
The Bank contributed $11,753,000 to net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $10,648,000 for the same period in 2019; whereas the holding company contributed $330,000 to net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $1,709,000 for the same period in 2019. The decrease at the holding company resulted primarily from a decrease in gains on sales of equity securities and a decrease in the fair value of the equity portfolio during 2020.

These items, as well as others, will be explained more thoroughly in the next sections.
Net Interest Income
The following table presents the adjustment to convert net interest income to net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.
Net interest income is the primary source of operating income for QNB. Net interest income is interest income, dividends, and fees on earning assets, less interest expense incurred for funding sources. Earning assets primarily include loans, investment securities and interest-bearing balances at the Federal Reserve Bank (Fed). Sources used to fund these assets include deposits and borrowed funds. Net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates, the volume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and the amount of earning assets funded by non-interest-bearing deposits.
For purposes of this discussion, interest income and the average yield earned on loans and investment securities are adjusted to a tax-equivalent basis as detailed in the table that appears above. This adjustment to interest income is made for analysis purposes only. Interest income is increased by the amount of savings of Federal income taxes, which QNB realizes by investing in certain tax-exempt state and municipal securities and by making loans to certain tax-exempt organizations. In this way, the ultimate economic impact of earnings from various assets can be more easily compared.
The net interest rate spread is the difference between average rates received on earning assets and average rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, while the net interest margin, which includes interest-free sources of funds, is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. The Asset/Liability and Investment Management Committee works to manage and maximize the net interest margin for the Company.
2020 versus 2019
On a tax-equivalent basis, net interest income for 2020 increased $865,000, or 2.3%, to $37,939,000. The net interest margin, which decreased 24 basis points to 2.92% was unfavorably impacted by decreased rates on loans. The average rate earned on earning assets decreased 60 basis points from 4.02% for 2019 to 3.42% for 2020 with the yield on loans decreasing 53 basis points, favorably impacted by a $48,161,000 increase in average commercial and industrial loans partially offset by an 123 basis point decrease in the related yield and a $9,475,000 increase in average residential real estate loans partially offset by a 19 basis point decrease in yield, and unfavorably impacted by a 36 basis point decrease in the yield partially offset by a $21,719,000 increase in average commercial real estate loans. The yield on investment securities declined 45 basis points to 1.92%. In comparison, the interest rate paid on total average interest-bearing liabilities decreased 44 basis points from 1.07% for 2019 to 0.63% for 2020 with the average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increasing from 1.06% to 0.63% for the same time periods, respectively, partially offset by a $75,213,000 increase in average interest-bearing deposits.
Market disruption caused by local bank consolidation positively impacted both loan and deposit growth which was partially offset by the competitive local interest rate market for quality loans and deposits. Net interest spread decreased 16 basis points to 2.79% for 2020 compared to 2.95% for 2019. Average earning assets increased by $122,532,000, or 10.4%, to $1,297,151,000 for 2020, with average loans increasing $60,465,000, or 7.5%, to $871,991,000. The growth in loans and investment securities was funded by a $120,038,000, or 11.6%, increase in average total deposits.
2019 versus 2018
On a tax-equivalent basis, net interest income for 2019 increased $1,241,000, or 3.5%, to $37,074,000. The net interest margin, which increased three basis points to 3.16% was favorably impacted by increased rates on loans. The average rate earned on earning assets increased 17 basis points from 3.85% for 2018 to 4.02% for 2019 with the yield on loans increasing 16 basis points, favorably impacted by a $32,443,000 increase in average commercial real estate loans and an 16 basis point increase in the related yield, a $5,290,000 increase in average residential real estate loans and a 12 basis point increase in yield, and a $2,447,000 increase in average commercial and industrial loans and a 15 basis point increase in the related yield. The yield on investment securities increased to 2.37%. In comparison, the interest rate paid on total average interest-bearing liabilities increased 19 basis points from 0.88% for 2018 to 1.07% for 2019 with the average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increasing from 0.86% to 1.06% for the same time periods, respectively, and a $15,780,000 increase in average interest-bearing deposits.

Rate-Volume Analysis of Changes in Net Interest Income (1) (2) (3)
(1)
Loan fees have been included in the change in interest income totals presented. Non-accrual loans and investment securities have been included in average balances.
(2)
Changes due to both volume and rates have been allocated in proportion to the relationship of the dollar amount change in each.
(3)
Interest income on loans and securities is presented on a tax-equivalent basis.
The Rate-Volume Analysis tables, as presented on a tax-equivalent basis, highlight the impact of changing rates and volumes on interest income and interest expense. Total interest income on a tax-equivalent basis decreased $2,814,000 to $44,384,000 for 2020, while total interest expense decreased $3,679,000 to $6,445,000. Volume growth in earning assets contributed an additional $5,293,000 of interest income and interest rate decreases contributed to a reduction in interest income of $8,107,000. Rate-related interest expense decreased $3,921,000, while volume-related interest expense increased $242,000.
Investments
2020 versus 2019
Interest income on available-for-sale and equity investment securities decreased $1,043,000 when comparing the two years. The increase in average balances contributed an additional $878,000 to interest income but was offset by $1,921,000 due to the 45-basis point decrease in rates. The average yield on the available-for-sale and equity investment portfolio decreased to 1.92% for 2020 compared to 2.37% for 2019.
- 24 -
Income on U.S. Government agency securities decreased $370,000, due to a decrease in average balances totaling $5,225,000 and a 43-basis point decrease in the yield from 1.81% for 2019 to 1.38% for 2020. Most of the bonds in the agency portfolio have call features ranging from three months to three years, many of which were exercised during 2020 as a result of the declining rates during the year.
Interest income on tax-exempt municipal securities increased $91,000. Average balances, which increased $11,192,000, contributed $396,000 to interest income. The decrease in yield of 46 basis points from 3.54% in 2019 to 3.08% in 2020 partially offset the increase in interest income by $305,000. Many of these bonds have either reached maturity or their call dates and are being replaced with municipal bonds with less favorable tax-equivalent yields. Typically, QNB purchased municipal bonds with 10- to 15-year maturities with call dates between 2 and 5 years. Future demand for tax-exempt municipal securities is uncertain, as the tax-equivalent yield could be less favorable compared to other securities with similar risk-based capital asset-weighting characteristics.
All the mortgage-backed and collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMO”) securities owned by QNB are issued by U.S. Government agencies and sponsored enterprises (“GSE”) and carry the implicit backing of the U.S. Government, but they are not direct obligations of the U.S. Government. Interest income on mortgage-backed securities and CMOs decreased $807,000 due to 57-basis point decrease in rate from 2.18% for 2019 to 1.61% for 2020 partially offset by an increase of $25,401,000, or 11.7%, in average balances. This portfolio generally provides higher yields relative to agency bonds and provides monthly cash flow which can be used for liquidity purposes or can be reinvested as interest rates increase.
Income on corporate debt securities decreased $28,000 due to a decrease in average balances of $653,000 and a decrease in yield from 3.74% for 2019 to 3.69% for 2020.
Dividend income on equities increased $118,000 due to an increase in average balances of $2,790,000 and an increase in yield of 23 basis points.
2019 versus 2018
Interest income on available-for-sale and equity investment securities decreased $115,000 when comparing the two years. The decrease in average balances contributed to $519,000 of the decrease, partially offset by $404,000 due to the increase in rates. The average yield on the available-for-sale and equity investment portfolio increased slightly to 2.37% for 2019 compared to 2.32% for 2018. The decrease in the investment portfolio is due to funding needs to support loan growth.
Income on U.S. Government agency securities decreased $34,000, due to a decrease in average balances totaling $2,513,000, which was partially offset by an increase in the yield on the portfolio of two basis points from 1.79% for 2018 to 1.81% for 2019. Most of the bonds in the agency portfolio have call features ranging from three months to three years, many of which were not exercised during 2019 as a result of the rising rates during the year.
Interest income on tax-exempt municipal securities decreased $399,000. Average balances, which decreased $16,416,000, contributed $539,000 to the interest income decline. The increase in yield of 25 basis points from 3.29% in 2018 to 3.54% in 2019 partially offset the decrease in interest income by $140,000.
Interest income on mortgage-backed securities and CMOs increased $150,000 due to both an increase of $3,282,000, or 1.5%, in average balances and an increase in yield of four basis points from 2.14% for 2018 to 2.18% for 2019.
Income on corporate debt securities increased $150,000 due to an increase in average balances of $1,760,000 and an increase in yield from 2.39% for 2018 to 3.74% for 2019.
Loans
2020 versus 2019
The largest category of the loan portfolio is commercial real estate loans. This category of loans includes commercial purpose loans secured by either commercial properties such as office buildings, hotels, factories, warehouses, medical facilities and retail establishments, or residential real estate, usually the residence of the business owner or investment properties. The category also includes construction and land development loans. Income on commercial real estate loans decreased $731,000. The increase in average balances of $21,719,000, or 4.7%, contributed an increase in interest income of $1,047,000; this was offset by the 36-basis point decrease in yield, from 4.82% in 2019 to 4.46% in 2020 resulted in a decrease of interest income of $1,778,000.
- 25 -
Income on commercial and industrial loans, the second largest category, increased $4,000 with the positive impact from an increase in average balances. Average commercial and industrial loans increased $48,161,000, or 30.6%, to $205,566,000 for 2020, resulting in a $2,531,000 increase in interest income. Average yield on these loans decreased 123 basis points to 4.02% causing a decrease of $2,527,000 in interest income. Many of the loans in this category are indexed to the prime interest rate, which decreased 25 basis points in August 2019 with an additional decrease of 25 basis points in September 2019, 25 basis points in October and a total of 150 basis points in March 2020. Included in this category are the PPP loans which contributed $53,374,000 of the net volume increase. The PPP loans yield one percent to the customer, however QNB received origination fees from the SBA ranging from one to five basis points, resulting in a yield of approximately 3.36% for 2020. The PPP loans contributed 24 basis points to the decline in the average yield.
Tax-exempt loan income decreased $335,000 from $1,609,000 in 2019. When comparing the same periods, average balances decreased $11,904,000 to $35,665,000, which contributed a $402,000 decrease in interest income. The average yield on the tax-exempt loan portfolio increased from 3.38% for 2019 to 3.57% for 2020, resulting in an increase in interest income of $67,000. The decrease in volume during 2020 was a result of municipal loans being refinanced as bonds.
QNB strives to become the “local consumer lender of choice”, and to affect this goal, QNB has refocused its retail lending efforts by strengthening the management of the area, adding new product offerings and by increasing marketing and promotion. The positive impact of this renewed focus has been year-over-year growth in balances in residential mortgages. Overall, interest income for retail lending decreased $691,000 in 2020 compared with 2019, driven by the 62-basis point decrease in yield.
Given the low yields on alternative investment securities, QNB retained certain fixed rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgages to borrowers with high credit scores and low loan-to-value ratios. As a result, average residential mortgage loans secured by first lien 1-4 family residential mortgages increased by $9,475,000, or 14.0%, to $77,077,000 for 2020. The average yield on the residential real estate portfolio decreased 19 basis points to 3.79% for 2020 compared to 3.98% for 2019. Overall, interest income for this segment grew $234,000 in 2020.
Income on home equity loans decreased by $830,000 when comparing 2020 and 2019. During 2020 and 2019, QNB offered attractive rates on both variable rate and fixed rate home equity loans. Mortgage rates dropped during 2020 resulting in the refinancing home-equity lines into longer-term mortgages, this contributed to the decrease in average balances of $6,145,000, or 9.1%, to $61,493,000 when comparing 2020 and 2019. The yield on the home equity portfolio decreased 88 basis points to 3.79% when comparing the two years. The home values have recovered; therefore, we expect that the demand for home equity loans will continue.
Interest income on consumer loans decreased $95,000. Consumer loans at QNB experienced a decline in average balances in 2020, which decreased $841,000, or12.4%, led by a decline in student loans. Student loan balances are no longer insured, and QNB ceased funding originations through its third-party provider during the second half of 2018; average balances decreased $544,000 and interest income decreased $69,000 when comparing 2020 and 2019.
2019 versus 2018
Income on commercial real estate loans increased $2,258,000. The increase in average balances of $32,443,000, or 7.5%, contributed an increase in interest income of $1,512,000. The 16-basis point increase in yield, from 4.66% in 2018 to 4.82% in 2019 resulted in an increase of interest income of $746,000.
Income on commercial and industrial loans increased $368,000 with the positive impact from an increase in yield and average balances. Average commercial and industrial loans increased $2,447,000, or 1.6%, to $157,405,000 for 2019, resulting in a $124,000 increase in interest income. Average yield on these loans increased 15 basis points to 5.25% providing an additional $244,000 in interest income.
Tax-exempt loan income increased $225,000 from 2018. When comparing the same periods, average balances increased $4,557,000 to $47,569,000, which contributed a $147,000 increase in interest income. The average yield on the tax-exempt loan portfolio increased from 3.22% for 2018 to 3.38% for 2019, resulting in an increase in interest income of $78,000.
Interest income for retail lending interest income for retail lending increased $444,000 in 2019 compared with 2018, driven by the increase in average balances and average rate increases on residential and home equity loans.
Average residential mortgage loans secured by first lien 1-4 family residential mortgages increased by $5,290,000, or 8.5%, to $67,602,000 for 2019. The average yield on the residential real estate portfolio increased 12 basis points to 3.98% for 2019 compared to 3.86% for 2018. Overall, interest income for this segment grew $286,000 in 2019.
- 26 -
Income on home equity loans increased by $169,000 when comparing 2019 and 2018. Average balances increased $262,000, or 0.4%, to $67,638,000 when comparing 2019 and 2018. The yield on the home equity portfolio increased 23 basis points to 4.67% when comparing the two years.
Interest income on consumer loans decreased $11,000. Average balances in this segment decreased $217,000, or 3.1%, led by a decline in student loans. Student loan average balances decreased $362,000 and interest income decreased $17,000 when comparing 2019 and 2018. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in consumer installment loans.
Deposits and Borrowings
2020 versus 2019
Earning assets are funded primarily by deposits, which increased on average by $120,038,000, or 11.6%, to $1,150,411,000, when comparing 2020 and 2019. Total interest expense for 2020 was $6,455,000 compared with $10,124,000 for 2019, a decrease of $3,679,000. Interest expense on total deposits decreased $3,362,000 and interest expense on borrowed funds decreased $317,000 when comparing the two years. The rate paid on interest-bearing deposits decreased 43 basis points; the rate paid on borrowings decreased 59 basis points, when comparing the two periods. Deposit and borrowing costs are expected to increase as the competition for deposits increases when rates rise
Consistent with the past several years, the growth in deposits during 2020 was centered in accounts with greater liquidity. Average non-interest-bearing demand accounts increased $44,825,000, or 31.6%, to $186,897,000 for 2020; QNB has been successful in increasing both personal and business checking accounts. Average interest-bearing demand accounts increased $39,635,000, or 18.7%, to $252,050,000 for 2020 compared with 2019, with interest expense on interest-bearing demand accounts decreasing $322,000 to $668,000 for 2020. The average rate paid decreased 21 basis points to 0.26% for 2020 compared to 0.47% for 2019. Interest-bearing business checking account average balances increased by $10,689,000, or 24.3%, and related interest expense decreased $265,000, or 72 basis points in yield, when comparing the two years. This was primarily due to initial proceeds from PPP loans being held by customers at the Bank. Also included in this category is QNB-Rewards checking, a tiered-rate checking account product. In order to receive the high rate a customer must receive an electronic statement, have one direct deposit or other ACH transaction and have at least 12 debit card purchase transactions post and clear per statement cycle. If these qualifications are not met, the rate paid for 2020 was 0.20%. For 2020, the average balance in this product was $74,447,000 and the related interest expense was $325,000 for an average cost of funds of 0.44%. In comparison, the average balance in this product was $59,490,000 and the related interest expense was $392,000 for an average cost of funds of 0.66%. The rates paid on the QNB-Rewards product, assuming qualifications are met, is attractive relative to competitors’ offerings as well as other QNB products. This product also generates fee income through the use of the debit card. The average balance of other interest-bearing demand accounts included in this category increased from $108,872,000 for 2019 to $122,861,000 for 2020. The average rate paid on these balances was 0.05% for both years.
Average money market accounts increased $839,000, or 0.9%, to $90,989,000 for 2020 compared with 2019. Interest expense on money market accounts decreased $410,000 to $405,000 for 2020 compared with 2019. The average interest rate paid on money market accounts was 0.45% for 2020, a decrease of 45 basis points compared with 2019. The balances in this category primarily comprise Select money market accounts, a product that pays a tiered rate based on account balances. The balances remaining in these accounts for 2020 were primarily at higher-yielding tiers.
Interest expense on municipal interest-bearing demand accounts decreased $1,344,000 to $679,000 for 2020. The average balance of municipal interest-bearing demand accounts increased $7,134,000, or 6.3%, to $119,673,000 and the average interest rate paid on these accounts decreased 123 basis points to 0.57% for 2020 from 1.80% for 2019. Most of these accounts are indexed to the Federal funds rate with negotiated rate floors between 0.25% and 0.50%.

Provision for Loan Losses
The provision for loan losses represents management’s determination of the amount necessary to be charged to operations to bring the allowance for loan losses to a level that represents management’s best estimate of the known and inherent losses in the existing loan portfolio. QNB recorded a provision for loan losses of $1,250,000, $1,300,000 and $1,130,000 for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

The majority of the commercial loans charged off during 2020 and 2019 had specific reserves established during the allowance for loan loss calculation process prior to the decision to charge-off the loans. Deterioration in credit quality or significant growth in the loan portfolio may result in a higher provision for loan losses in 2021.

The primary reason for the decreased effective tax rate for 2020 over 2019 was due to the state taxes on the realized gains on securities in 2019. In 2018, QNB elected to change its tax methods for bad debt conformity and for loan origination costs effective with the filing of the 2017 tax return which resulted in a tax benefit of $415,000. These discrete tax items were recorded in 2018.
Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. In the event of disclosure or release of non-GAAP financial measures, the SEC Regulation G requires: (i) the presentation of the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and (ii) a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measure presented and the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.
For the year ended December 31, 2018, the effective tax rate excluding the discrete items was 15.3%; the primary reason for the increase effective tax rate for 2019 over 2018 was due to the state taxes on the realized gains on securities. QNB expects the effective tax rate in 2021 to be similar to the 17.5%, less than the 21% corporate rate, due to its holdings of tax-free assets, including municipal bonds, municipal loans, and life insurance contracts. For a more comprehensive analysis of income tax expense and deferred taxes, refer to Note 11 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Financial Condition
ASSETS
The following table presents total assets at the dates indicated:
Cash and interest-earning deposits
Total cash and cash equivalents increased $21,723,000 from $17,608,000 at December 31, 2019 to $39,331,000 at December 31, 2020. QNB had interest-bearing balances at the Federal Reserve Bank of $25,581,000 compared with $1,584,000 and interest-bearing balances in a brokerage account of $242,000 compared with $3,616,000 at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Net cash was provided by operating activities. The maturity, prepayment and sales of investment securities and proceeds received from deposit growth more than offset loan growth and the purchases of investment securities.
Investment Securities and Other Short-Term Investments
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, QNB had no Federal funds sold. With the Federal funds rate between 0% and 0.25%, excess funds for liquidity purposes are kept at the Federal Reserve. These funds carry a 0% risk weighting for risk-based capital calculation purposes.
QNB accounts for its investments by classifying securities into four categories. Debt securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings. Debt securities that QNB has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity securities and reported at amortized cost. Debt securities not classified as either held-to-maturity securities or trading securities are classified as available-for-sale securities and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of shareholders’ equity. Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the time of purchase.

Investment Securities - Trading
QNB did not hold any trading security during 2020 or 2019.
Investments Held-To-Maturity Debt Securities
QNB did not hold any held-to-maturity security during 2020 or 2019.
Investments Available-For-Sale Debt Securities
Available-for-sale investment securities include securities that management intends to use as part of its liquidity and asset/liability management strategy. These securities may be sold in response to changes in market interest rates, changes in the securities prepayment or credit risk, the need for liquidity, or growth in loan demand. At December 31, 2020, the fair value of investment debt securities available-for-sale was $435,646,000, or $7,151,000 above the amortized cost of $428,495,000. This compares to a fair value of $349,710,000, or $325,000 above the amortized cost of $349,385,000, at December 31, 2019. The available-for-sale portfolio, excluding the pooled trust preferred securities, had a weighted average maturity of approximately 5.2 years at December 31, 2020 and 4.6 years at December 31, 2019. The weighted average tax-equivalent yield, excluding the pooled trust preferred securities, was 1.57% and 2.36% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
At December 31, 2020, approximately 78% of QNB’s investment securities available-for-sale were either U.S. Government agency debt securities, U.S. Government agency issued mortgage-backed securities or CMOs. As of December 31, 2020, QNB held no securities of any one issue or any one issuer (excluding the U.S. Government and its agencies) that were in excess of 10% of shareholders’ equity.
The QNB investment portfolio represents a significant portion of earning assets and interest income. QNB actively manages the investment portfolio in an attempt to maximize earnings, while considering liquidity needs, interest rate risk and credit risk. The increase of the investment portfolio as a percent of total assets in 2020 is due to deposit growth and the investment of excess funds. Proceeds from the sale of investment securities available-for-sale were $6,930,000 during 2020 compared with $47,851,000 during 2019. In addition to the proceeds from the sale of investment securities available-for-sale, proceeds from maturities, calls and prepayments were $207,245,000 in 2020 compared with $68,174,000 in 2019. During 2020, $295,734,000 of investment securities available-for-sale were purchased compared with $113,688,000 during 2019.
The balance of U.S. Government agency securities increased $478,000 to $69,776,000 at December 31, 2020 and represents 16.0% of the available-for-sale investment portfolio, compared with 19.8% at December 31, 2019. U.S. Government agency issued CMO and MBS balances increased $49,356,000 to $270,795,000 and represents 62.2% of the available-for-sale portfolio compared with 63.4% at December 31, 2019. These bonds provide monthly cash flow to be reinvested in either loans or other securities, potentially at higher yields as rates increase.
- 35 -
The balance of municipal securities increased $37,031,000 to $87,812,000 at December 31, 2020, representing 20.2% of the available-for-sale portfolio compared with 14.5% at December 31, 2019. QNB focuses on the financial performance of the underlying issuer for municipal bond purchases in addition to the bond rating of the issuer or the rating of bond insurer, if present. Ninety-four bonds were purchased with a book value of $51,787,000 and thirty-five bonds with a book value of $15,045,000 were called or matured in 2020.
QNB owns one collateralized debt obligations (“CDO”) in the form of a pooled trust preferred security. The security is comprised of securities issued by banks or bank holding companies. QNB owns the mezzanine tranche of this security. The security is structured so that the senior and mezzanine tranches are protected from defaults by over-collateralization and cash flow default protection provided by subordinated tranches. The trust preferred security the Bank continues to hold has a carrying balance of $70,000 at December 31, 2020 and represents the senior-most obligation of the trust. There was no credit-related other-than-temporary impairment charge during 2020, 2019 or 2018. Future estimates of fair value of the remaining security could require recording additional OTTI charges through earnings. For additional detail on these securities see Notes 4 and 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
The weighted average maturity is based on the stated contractual maturity or likely call date of all securities except for MBS and CMOs, which are based on estimated average life. The maturity of the portfolio could become shorter if interest rates declined and prepayments on MBS and CMOs increased or securities are called. However, the estimated average life could lengthen if interest rates were to increase and principal payments on MBS and CMOs slowed or securities anticipated to be called extend past their call date.
Investment Portfolio Maturities and Weighted Average Yields
Securities are assigned to categories based on stated contractual maturity except for mortgage-backed securities and CMOs which are based on anticipated payment periods and state and municipal securities which are based on pre-refunded date, if applicable. Tax-exempt securities were adjusted to a tax-equivalent basis and are based on the marginal Federal corporate tax rate of 21% and a Tax Equity and Financial Responsibility Act (“TEFRA”) adjustment for the cost of funds. Weighted average yields on investment securities available-for-sale are based on amortized cost.
Investments in Equity Securities
Equity securities increased $3,685,000 to $12,849,000 at December 31, 2020 from $9,164,000 at December 31, 2019. QNB sold $4,767,000 in equity securities for a net gain of $585,000 and purchased $7,914,000 in equities during 2020.
- 36 -
QNB adopted ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, effective January 1, 2018. This ASU was issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) on January 5, 2016 to enhance the reporting model for financial instruments to address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The FASB issued ASU 2018-03 in February 2018 which provides technical corrections and improvements to ASU 2016-01. QNB used the modified retrospective method for transition in which the cumulative effect will be recognized at the date of adoption with no restatement of comparative periods presented. QNB reclassified a loss, net of taxes, of $254,000 from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings on January 1, 2018. Increases and decreases in the fair value were recognized in net income during 2020, 2019 and 2018. At December 31, 2020, the fair value of the equity securities was $12,849,000, or $65,000 above the cost of $12,784,000 compared to $$9,164,000, or $111,000 above the cost of $9,053,000 at December 31, 2019.
The equities portfolio comprises blue-chip large-capitalized stocks, providing a taxable equivalent dividend yield of 3.54%. The estimated cumulative contribution (realized and unrealized net gains (losses), plus dividends) of the equity portfolio to earnings per share from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2020 is $1.79 per diluted share. Details of the equity portfolio’s contribution to net income is detailed in the following table.
Loans
QNB’s primary business is to accept deposits and to make loans to meet the credit needs of the communities it serves. Loans are the most significant component of earning assets, and growth in loans to small businesses and residents of these communities has been a primary focus of QNB. Inherent within the lending function is the evaluation and acceptance of credit risk and interest rate risk. QNB manages credit risk associated with its lending activities through portfolio diversification, underwriting policies and procedures and loan monitoring practices.
QNB has comprehensive policies and procedures that define and govern commercial and retail loan originations and the management of risk. All loans are underwritten in a manner that emphasizes the borrowers’ capacity to pay. The measurement of capacity to pay delineates the potential risk of non-payment or default. The higher potential for default determines the need for and amount of collateral required. QNB makes unsecured commercial loans when the capacity to pay is considered substantial. As capacity lessens, collateral is required to provide a secondary source of repayment and to mitigate the risk of loss. Various policies and procedures provide guidance to the lenders on such factors as amount, terms, price, maturity and appropriate collateral levels. Each risk factor is considered critical to ensuring that QNB receives an adequate return for the risk undertaken, and that the risk of loss is minimized.
QNB manages the risk associated with commercial loans by having lenders work in tandem with credit analysts while maintaining independence between personnel. In addition, a Bank loan committee and a committee of the Board of Directors review and approve certain loan requests on a weekly basis. Other than disclosed in the forthcoming Loan Portfolio Table, at December 31, 2020, there was a concentration of loans to lessors of residential buildings and dwellings of 14.9% of total loans and to lessors of nonresidential buildings of 19.6% of total loans, compared with 16.6% and 18.3% of total loans, respectively, at December 31, 2019. These concentrations were primarily within the commercial real estate categories.
QNB moved from an eight-grade risk rating system to a ten-grade system in 2018, further disaggregating the credit quality of the loan portfolio to enhance credit risk strategies.

QNB’s commercial lending activity is focused on small businesses within the local community. Commercial purpose loans are generally perceived as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans with a personal purpose and consumer loans. These types of loans involve larger loan balances to a single borrower or group of related borrowers and are more susceptible to a risk of loss during a downturn in the business cycle. These loans may involve greater risk because the availability of funds to repay these loans depends on the successful operation of the borrower’s business. The assets financed are used within the business for its ongoing operation. Repayment of these types of loans generally comes from the cash flow of the business or the ongoing conversions of assets, such as accounts receivable and inventory, to cash. Commercial and industrial loans represent commercial purpose loans that are either secured by collateral other than real estate or unsecured.
Commercial loans secured by commercial real estate include commercial purpose loans collateralized at least in part by commercial real estate. Some of these loans may not be for the express purpose of conducting commercial real estate transactions. Commercial loans secured by residential real estate are commercial purpose loans generally secured by the business owner’s residence or residential investment properties owned by the borrower and rented to tenants. Commercial loans secured by either commercial real estate or residential real estate are originated primarily within the Eastern Pennsylvania market area, are within the Bank’s underwriting criteria, and generally include the guarantee of the borrowers. Repayment of this kind of loan is dependent upon either the ongoing cash flow of the borrowing entity or the resale of or lease of the subject property. Commercial real estate and commercial construction loans may be affected to a greater extent than residential loans by adverse conditions in real estate markets or the economy because commercial real estate borrowers’ ability to repay their loans depends on successful development of their properties.
Loans to state and political subdivisions are tax-exempt or taxable loans to municipalities, school districts and housing and industrial development authorities. These loans can be general obligations of the municipality or school district repaid through their taxing authority, revenue obligations repaid through the income generated by the operations of the authority, such as a water or sewer authority, or loans issued to a housing and industrial development agency, for which a private corporation is responsible for payments on the loans.
The Company originates fixed rate and adjustable-rate residential real estate loans that are secured by the underlying 1-4 family residential properties. Credit risk exposure in this area of lending is minimized by the evaluation of the credit worthiness of the borrower, including debt-to-income ratios, credit scores and adherence to underwriting policies that emphasize conservative loan-to-value ratios of generally no more than 80%. To reduce interest rate risk, qualifying originations of fixed-rate loans to individuals for 1-4 family residential mortgages with maturities of 15 years or greater are generally sold in the secondary market. Mortgage loan origination activity increased in 2020 with $39,474,000 in residential mortgages originated for sale during 2020, compared with $8,106,000 for 2019. There were $6,570,000 in residential mortgage loans held-for-sale at December 31, 2020 and $977,000 at December 31, 2019. These loans are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or market.
The home equity portfolio consists of fixed-rate home equity loans and variable rate home equity lines of credit. These loans are often in a junior lien position and therefore carry a higher risk than first lien 1-4 family residential loans. Risks associated with loans secured by residential properties, either first lien residential mortgages or home equity loans and lines, are generally lower than commercial loans and include general economic risks, such as the strength of the job market, employment stability and the strength of the housing market. Since most loans are secured by a primary or secondary residence, the borrower’s continued employment is the greatest risk to repayment.
The Company offers a variety of loans to individuals for personal and household purposes. Consumer loans are generally considered to have greater risk than loans secured by residential real estate because they may be unsecured, or, if they are secured, the value of the collateral may be difficult to assess or more likely to decrease in value than real estate. Credit risk in this portfolio is controlled by conservative underwriting standards that consider debt-to-income levels and the creditworthiness of the borrower, and, if secured, the value of the collateral.
Under the CARES Act, enacted on March 27, 2020, QNB continues to provide customers experiencing financial hardship caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic, solutions to help them through this difficult period. As of December 31, 2020, QNB had modifications to approximately 4.0% of the commercial portfolio, with an outstanding balance of $31,148,000, and modifications to approximately 1.8% of the retail portfolio, with an outstanding balance of $2,722,000, related to the COVID-19 Pandemic. During 2020, the Bank originated $82,475,000 in PPP loans, enabling 660 businesses to maintain their payrolls and stay in operation. At December 31, 2020, QNB had 556 PPP loans totaling $72,821,000 reported in commercial and industrial loans. PPP loan origination fees net of costs amounted to $1,909,000 at December 31, 2020 and are recognized in interest income as a yield adjustment over the term of the loans. The PPP loans are 100% guaranteed by the SBA. Excluding PPP loans net of deferred fees at December 31, 2020, loans receivable would have increased $28,514,000, or 3.5% since year-end 2019.
- 38 -
Total loan receivables at December 31, 2020 were $920,042,000, an increase of $99,426,000, or 12.1%, from December 31, 2019. This follows a 4.5% increase in outstanding loans in 2019. A key financial ratio, loans to deposits was 74.9% at December 31, 2020, compared with 79.1% at December 31, 2019. QNB continues to be committed to make loans available to credit worthy consumers and businesses.
Demand loans and loans with no stated maturity are included in one year or less. Table details final maturity.
The following shows the amount of loans due after one year that have fixed interest rates and variable or adjustable interest rates at December 31, 2020:
Loans with fixed predetermined interest rates: $195,877,000
Loans with variable or adjustable interest rates: $593,220,000
The Allowance for Loan Losses Allocation table on Page 43 shows the percentage composition of the loan portfolio over the past five years. There was very little change in the composition of the portfolio between the periods ended December 31, 2019 and 2020. Loans secured by commercial real estate represent the largest sector of the portfolio, remaining 41.0% of the portfolio at both December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, as the balances in this sector grew by $41,536000, or 12.4%, from $336,050,000 at December 31, 2019 to $377,586,000 at December 31, 2020. While loans secured by commercial real estate represent a significant portion of the total portfolio, the collateral is diversified, including investment properties, manufacturing facilities, office buildings, hospitality properties, hospitals, retirement and nursing home facilities, warehouses and owner-occupied facilities. Commercial real estate loans have drawn the attention of the regulators in recent years as a potential source of risk. QNB monitors these types of loans closely, obtaining updated appraisals on loans classified substandard or worse. As detailed in the Allowance for Loan Losses table, QNB had no charge-offs in this category in 2020, 2019 or 2018.
- 39 -
Commercial loans secured by residential real estate increased by $9,454,000, or 13.1%, to $81,897,000 at December 31, 2020 and at 8.9% represent a slightly higher share of the overall portfolio than the 8.8% at December 31, 2019. Some of the properties that serve as collateral for these loans are located outside the Bank’s market area and have experienced vacancies and significant declines in market value in prior years. Charge-offs in this category have significantly decreased over the past three years. Non-accrual commercial loans secured by residential real estate were $875,000, $851,000, and $1,102,000 at December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Net recoveries were $68,000 in 2020, compared with net recoveries of $72,000 in 2019 and net charge-offs of $50,000 in 2018. In 2020, $64,000 of the net recoveries were out-of-market investment properties, compared with $73,000 of the net recoveries in 2019 and $56,000 of the net charge-offs in 2018.
Commercial and industrial loans, the second largest sector of the portfolio, experienced growth in balances of $59,400,000, or 35.4%, to $227,431,000 at December 31, 2020. This followed a growth in this category of $5,579,000, or 3.4%, in 2019. Excluding PPP loans, commercial and industrial loans decreased $13,421,000, or 8.0% in 2020. Commercial and industrial loans represented 24.7% of the portfolio at year-end 2020 compared with 20.5% at December 31, 2019. Excluding PPP loans, commercial and industrial loans represented 18.2% of the portfolio at year-end 2020. This category of loans generally presents a greater risk than loans secured by real estate since these loans are either secured by accounts receivable, inventory or equipment, or are unsecured. During 2020, nonaccrual commercial and industrial loan balances decreased $1,534,000 to $4,367,000, the majority of which is due to paydowns of $1,270,000 and the partial charge-off of three credits totaling of $263,000. During 2019, nonaccrual commercial and industrial loan balances increased $2,722,000 to $5,901,000, the majority of which is due to six relationships being downgraded in 2019 of which one credit was partially charged-off by $207,000. In 2020, 2019, and 2018, charge-offs were $268,000, $207,000, and $0, respectively.
Construction loans increased 2.5% from $56,209,000, or 6.8% of the portfolio at December 31, 2019, to $57,594,000, or 6.2% of the portfolio at December 31, 2020. These loans are primarily to developers and builders for the construction of residential units or commercial buildings or to businesses for the construction of owner-occupied facilities. This portfolio is diversified among different types of collateral including: 1-4 family residential construction, medical and retirement home facilities, office buildings, hotels and land for development loans. Construction loans are generally made only on projects that have municipal approval. These loans are usually originated to include a short construction period followed by permanent financing provided through a commercial mortgage after construction is complete. Once construction is complete, the balance is moved to the secured by commercial real estate category if the permanent financing is provided by the Bank. There were no charge-offs in the construction loan portfolio since 2011, and no construction loans on non-accrual since 2014.
Loans to state and political subdivisions decreased $13,074,000, or 34.1%, from $38,376,000 at December 31, 2019 to $25,302,000 at December 31, 2020. This sector decreased from 4.7% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2019 to 2.7% at December 31, 2020. Many municipalities, counties and school districts refinanced their existing bonds or bank debt due to decreased. The decrease in 2020 was primarily due to one relationship lost during the end of 2020. The 2017 Tax Reform Act made the tax effective yield on loans to state and political subdivisions less favorable than experienced historically.
Residential mortgage loans secured by first lien balances increased by $13,270,000, or 19.1%, to $82,739,000 at December 31, 2020. This followed an increase of $2,016,000, or 3.0%, between December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019. In 2020 and 2019, QNB retained some adjustable and fixed rate mortgages to borrowers with high credit scores and low loan-to-value ratios.
Balances in home equity loans and lines decreased $9,368,000, or 12.8%, to $63,943,000 at December 31, 2020. During 2020, QNB continued to offer very attractive rates on both variable and fixed rate home equity loans and lines. These attractive rates, along with excellent customer service, including quick turnaround time, resulted in new originations in home equity loans, however, paydowns and refinancing into mortgage loans contributed to the decline. QNB expects demand for home equity loans will increase as rates normalize and debt consolidation into mortgage loans decline.
Consumer loan balances decreased $1,166,000 to $5,364,000 at December 31, 2020. In 2013, QNB reentered the private student loan market through a relationship with a third party. These student loans are either fixed or variable rate with the rate dependent on the credit scores of the student and/or the cosigner. As of December 31, 2020 the balance of student loans was $2,724,000, a decrease of $672,000 compared with December 31, 2019. Student loan balances will decline, as their balances are no longer insured, and QNB ceased funding originations through the third party during 2019 and forward.
Non-Performing Assets
Non-performing assets include non-performing loans, OREO and repossessed assets and non-performing trust preferred securities. Non-performing assets totaled $14,109,000, or 0.98% of total assets at December 31, 2020, a $2,355,000 decrease over the $16,464,000, or 1.34% of total assets at December 31, 2019.
Total non-performing loans, which represent loans on non-accrual status, loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest and troubled debt restructured loans were $14,109,000, or 1.53% of total loans receivable at December 31, 2020 compared with $16,464,000, or 2.01% of total loans receivable at December 31, 2019. Loans on non-accrual status were $9,640,000 at December 31, 2020 compared with $11,704,000 at December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to paydowns of $2,590,000 and net charge-offs of $419,000, partially offset by $945,000 being placed on nonaccrual of which $391,000 were due to two commercial relationships; specific impairment reserves have been established based on updated collateral values even if the borrower continues to pay in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Of the total amount of non-accrual loans at December 31, 2020, $5,030,000, or approximately 52% of the loans classified as non-accrual, are current or past due less than 30 days.
- 40 -
QNB had no loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing at December 31, 2020 or at December 31, 2019. Total loans that are 30 days or more past due decreased $1,260,000 to $5,700,000, representing 0.62% of total loans at December 31, 2020 compared with $6,960,000 and 0.85% of total loans at December 31, 2019. Restructured loans, as defined in accounting guidance for troubled debt restructuring in ASC 310-40, that have not already been included in loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing or in non-accrual loans, totaled $4,469,000 and $4,760,000 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
QNB held no OREO at December 31, 2020 or 2019. There were no repossessed assets as of December 31, 2020 or 2019.
Additional loan quality information can be found in Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Management’s view is that loans classified as substandard or doubtful that are not included in the past due, non-accrual or restructured categories are potential problem loans. For some of these loans, management may have knowledge of possible credit problems that will cause management to question the ability of the borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms. Commercial loans classified as substandard or doubtful, which includes non-performing loans, continue to show improvement. At December 31, 2020, substandard or doubtful loans totaled $22,193,000, an increase of $6,271,000, or 39.4%, from the $15,922,000, reported as of December 31, 2019.

The allowance for loan losses represents management’s best estimate of the known and inherent losses in the existing loan portfolio. Management believes that it uses the best information available to make determinations about the adequacy of the allowance and that it has established its existing allowance for loan losses in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The determination of an appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses is based upon an analysis of the risks inherent in QNB’s loan portfolio. Management, in determining the allowance for loan losses, makes significant estimates and assumptions. Since the allowance for loan losses is dependent on conditions that may be beyond QNB’s control, it is at least reasonably possible that management’s estimates of the allowance for loan losses and actual results could differ. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review QNB’s allowance for losses on loans. Such agencies may require QNB to recognize changes to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. Actual loan losses, net of recoveries, serve to reduce the allowance.
Management closely monitors the quality of its loan portfolio and performs a quarterly analysis of the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses and the level of unallocated reserves. This analysis considers a number of relevant factors including: specific impairment reserves, historical loan loss experience, general economic conditions, levels of and trends in delinquent and non-performing loans, levels of classified loans, trends in the growth rate of loans, and concentrations of credit.
Economic conditions, nationally and in QNB’s market, declined in 2020, however, asset quality remained strong. The allowance level stated as a percent of loans receivable decreased from 1.20% at December 31, 2019 to 1.18% at December 31, 2020. Excluding PPP loans, the allowance level stated as a percent of loans receivable was 1.27% at December 31, 2020. PPP loans are 100% guaranteed by the SBA. The allowance for loan losses increased to $10,826,000 at year-end 2020 from $9,887,000 at year-end 2019, due to the increase in loans receivable over the same period and the decline economic conditions.
Gross loans represent loans before unamortized net loan fees and costs. Percent gross loans lists the percentage of each loan type to total loans.
A loan is considered impaired, based on current information and events, if it is probable that QNB will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls may not be classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the recorded investment in loans for which impairment has been identified totaled $14,516,000 and $16,860,000, respectively, of which $6,432,000 and
- 42 -
$8,082,000, respectively, required no specific allowance for loan loss. The recorded investment in impaired loans requiring an allowance for loan losses was $8,084,000 and $8,778,000 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related allowance for loan losses associated with these loans was $3,050,000 and $3,566,000, respectively. See Note 5 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional detail of impaired loans.
QNB had net loan charge-offs of $311,000, or 0.04% of average loans for 2020 compared with $247,000, or 0.03% of average loans for 2019 and $137,000, or 0.02% of average loans for 2018. The majority of charge-offs recorded during these periods had specific
- 43 -
reserves established during the allowance for loan loss calculation process prior to the decision to charge-off the loan. The increase in commercial and industrial charge-offs in 2020 and 2019 was primarily related to a single relationship as well as in 2017.
Management believes the allowance for loan losses of $10,826,000 is adequate as of December 31, 2020, in relation to the estimate of known and inherent losses in the portfolio.
Premises and equipment
Premises and equipment includes a right-of-use asset of $4,258,000 and $3,821,000 at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 respectively. The discount rates used in determining the initial value of the right of use assets are based on the FHLB Amortizing Fixed Loan Rate for the term of each lease. QNB typically enters into lease agreements with an initial term of 5 to 10 years and subsequent additional optional terms in increments of 5 years. The lease agreements also contain termination options. None of the leases contain purchase options and none transfer the ownership of the leased asset. QNB has renewed one operating lease during 2020. QNB has renewed one operating lease and entered into two new operating leases during 2019. Operating lease liabilities are included with “Other liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. All operating lease costs are included in non-interest expense within “Net occupancy” on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Other premises and equipment, net of depreciation decreased $641,000 to $11,146,000 at December 31, 2020. QNB built a new building for a relocated branch and made improvements to a new leased space in the creation of its twelfth branch during 2019.
Other assets
Other assets, as presented in the table on Page 35, decreased $2,280,000 from $5,836,000 at December 31, 2019 to $3,556,000 at December 31, 2020. Most of the decrease in other assets relates to a $1,375,000 decrease to the deferred tax asset resulting from the fair value adjustment on investment securities available-for-sale of $1,434,000. The detail of the net deferred tax asset can be found in Note 11 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
LIABILITIES
The following table presents total liabilities at the dates indicated:
Deposits
QNB primarily attracts deposits from within its market area by offering various deposit products. These deposits are in the form of time deposits, which include certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts (“IRAs”) which have a stated maturity, and non-maturity deposit accounts, which include: non-interest-bearing demand accounts, interest-bearing demand accounts, money market accounts and savings accounts.
Total deposits increased $190,207,000, or 18.3%, to $1,228,067,000 at December 31, 2020. This follows an increase of $22,262,000, or 2.2%, to $1,037,860,000 at December 31, 2019. QNB has experienced growth in part due to market disruption created by bank mergers in its footprint throughout 2018, 2019 and 2020. The growth in deposits as well as the mix of deposits continues to be impacted by customers’ reactions to the competition, regulations and the interest rate environment. Many customers are looking for transaction accounts that provide liquidity and pay a reasonable amount of interest, while others look for high rate. Time deposit balances decreased $38,491,000, or 16.3% between 2019 and 2020. Customers appear to be looking for the safety of FDIC insured deposits and the stability of a strong local community bank.
Non-interest-bearing demand accounts increased $58,314,000 to $204,584,000 at December 31, 2020. This followed growth of $17,655,000 between December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019. These deposits are both retail and commercial checking accounts and are volatile depending on the timing of deposits and withdrawals. QNB has been successful in attracting new customers and expanding relationships with existing customers, which provides an opportunity for fee income.
- 44 -
Interest-bearing demand accounts, retail and business interest checking and municipal accounts increased $62,446,000, or 18.8%, to $395,364,000 at December 31, 2020. All three segments experienced growth in 2020. QNB has been successful in developing relationships with several school districts and municipalities as well as expanding existing relationships, the balances in these accounts are seasonal in nature and can be volatile on a daily basis. Most of the school district taxes are collected during the third quarter of the year and are disbursed over a nine-month period. Business checking increased from $47,577,000 at December 31, 2019 to $55,051,000 at December 31, 2020. Retail checking accounts increased $50,688,000, or 29.2%, to $224,112,000 at December 31, 2020. QNB continues to open a significant number of new checking accounts; additionally, customers may choose to switch products. Rewards checking balances increased $21,172,000 from $64,327,000 at December 31, 2019 to $85,499,000 at December 31, 2020, and personal interest-bearing balances increased $4,959,000. The balances in the Select 50 product increased $24,403,000 from $91,249,000 at December 31, 2019 to $115,652,000 at December 31, 2020.
Money Market accounts increased from $75,634,000 at December 31, 2019 to $96,811,000 at December 31, 2020 due to increases in both personal and business accounts.
Total savings account balances increased $86,761,000, or 35.1%, to $334,223,000 at December 31, 2020. This increase is due primarily to an increase in the online eSavings account of $67,877,000, or 38.5%, to $244,243,000 at December 31, 2020. The rate on eSavings accounts was changed from 0.80% at the end of 2019 to 0.40% in 2020.
Total time deposit account balances were $197,085,000 at December 31, 2020, a decrease of $38,491,000, or 16.3%, from the amount reported at December 31, 2019. QNB was able to retain many maturing deposits during 2020 by offering competitive rates and many current customers move balances from more liquid accounts to take advantage of these rates.
To continue to attract and retain deposits, QNB plans to remain competitive with respect to rates and to continue to deliver products with terms and features that appeal to customers. The QNB Rewards checking accounts and time deposits are examples of such products.
The following table presents trends in balances and yield on the major deposit groups.
Short-term borrowings
Short-term borrowings comprising commercial sweep accounts and overnight FHLB borrowings increased $2,907,000, or 5.2%, to $58,838,000 at December 31, 2020. Overnight FHLB borrowings decreased $11,817,000, to $0 at December 31, 2020. Commercial sweeps increased $14,724,000, or 33.4%, to $58,838,000 at December 31, 2020.
Long-term debt
Long-term debt comprises of $10,000,0000 in FHLB borrowings. During 2020, QNB borrowed long-term debt of $10,000,000 at fixed rates to lock in at a low yield. The average yield of 1.57% was 33 basis points lower than the yield on short-term FHLB borrowings.
- 45 -
Other liabilities
Other liabilities comprise accrued expenses including salaries, post-retirement life insurance benefits and income taxes, operating lease liability, deferred revenue, and ATM/debit card processing clearing. These balances decreased $1,077,000, to $8,529,000 at December 31, 2020.
Liquidity
Liquidity represents an institution’s ability to generate cash or otherwise obtain funds at reasonable rates to satisfy demand for loans and deposit withdrawals. QNB attempts to manage its mix of cash and interest-bearing balances, Federal funds sold and investment securities to match the volatility, seasonality, interest sensitivity and growth trends of its loans and deposits. The Company manages its liquidity risk by measuring and monitoring its liquidity sources and estimated funding needs. Liquidity is provided from asset sources through repayments and maturities of loans and investment securities. The portfolio of investment securities classified as available for sale and QNB's policy of selling certain residential mortgage originations in the secondary market also provide sources of liquidity. Core deposits and cash management repurchase agreements have historically been the most significant funding source for QNB. These deposits and repurchase agreements are generated from a base of consumers, businesses and public funds primarily located in the Company’s market area.
An additional source of liquidity is provided by the Bank’s membership in the FHLB. At December 31, 2020, the Bank had a maximum borrowing capacity with the FHLB of approximately $342,915,000, net of the $10,000,000 in long-term debt outstanding at year-end 2020 and the $350,000 in FHLB-issued letters of credit. The maximum borrowing capacity changes depending upon the Bank’s level of qualifying collateral assets. QNB had $10,000,000 and $11,817,000 in FHLB borrowings at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In addition, the Bank maintains five unsecured Federal funds lines with five correspondent banks totaling $101,000,000. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no outstanding borrowings under these lines. Future availability under these lines is subject to the policies of the granting banks and may be withdrawn. As part of its contingency funding plan, QNB successfully tested its ability to borrow from these sources during the fourth quarter of 2020.
Total cash and cash equivalents, equity and available-for-sale securities and loans held-for-sale totaled $494,396,000 at December 31, 2020 and $377,459,000 at December 31, 2019, of which $220,934,000 and $205,016,000, respectively, were pledged as collateral for repurchase agreements and public deposits. This increase in liquid sources is primarily the result of a $85,936,000 increase in available-for-sale securities and a $21,723,000 increase in cash. Management anticipates that these liquid sources are adequate to meet normal fluctuations in loan demand or deposit withdrawals. It is anticipated that the investment portfolio will continue to provide sufficient liquidity as municipal bonds are called and as principal and interest payments on mortgage-backed and CMO securities provide steady cash flow. Increases in interest rates, however, result in decreased cash flow available from the investment portfolio.
QNB is a member of the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Services (“CDARS”) program offered by the Promontory Interfinancial Network, LLC. CDARS is a funding and liquidity management tool used by banks to access funds and manage their balance sheet. It enables financial institutions to provide customers with full FDIC insurance on time deposits over $250,000 that are placed in the program. QNB also has available Insured Cash Sweep (“ICS”), another program through Promontory Interfinancial Network, LLC, which is a product similar to CDARS, but one that provides liquidity like a money market or savings account. QNB had $2,440,000 in CDARS time deposits at December 31, 2020.
SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY
The following table presents total shareholders’ equity at the dates indicated:
Total shareholders’ equity increased $13,728,000, or 11.4%, to $134,445,000 at December 31, 2020 with retained earnings (net income less dividends paid) contributing $7,272,000 and the dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan, employee stock purchase plan and stock option plan contributing $1,082,000. During 2020, QNB purchased $130,000 in treasury stock.
Accumulated other comprehensive gain increased $5,392,000 to a $5,649,000 gain, resulting from the increase in fair value of the available-for-sale investment portfolio due to maturities of securities and calls on securities being replaced during 2020.
- 46 -
QNB remains “well capitalized” based on FDIC requirements.
Capital Adequacy
A strong capital position is fundamental to support continued growth and profitability and to serve the needs of depositors. QNB’s shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2020 was $134,445,000, or 9.33% of total assets, compared with shareholders’ equity of $120,717,000, or 9.85% of total assets, at December 31, 2019. Shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2020 included a positive adjustment of $5,649,000 related to unrealized holding losses, net of taxes, on investment securities available for sale. At December 31, 2019, shareholders’ equity included a positive adjustment of $257,000 related to unrealized holding losses, net of taxes, on investment securities available for sale. Excluding these adjustments, shareholders’ equity to total assets would have been 8.98% and 9.84% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Average shareholders’ equity and average total assets were $123,790,000 and $1,343,984,000 for 2020, an increase of 6.0% and 10.9%, respectively, from 2019 average equity and average total assets of $116,771,000 and $1,212,040,000, respectively. The ratio of average total equity to total average assets was 9.21% for 2020, compared with 9.63% for 2019.
QNB is subject to restrictions on the payment of dividends to its shareholders pursuant to the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law of 1988 as amended (the BCL). The BCL operates generally to preclude dividend payments, if the effect thereof would render QNB insolvent, as defined. As a practical matter, QNB’s payment of dividends is contingent upon its ability to obtain funding in the form of dividends from the Bank. Under Pennsylvania banking law, the Bank is subject to certain restrictions on the amount of dividends that it may declare without prior regulatory approval. At December 31, 2020, the retained earnings of the Bank totaling $113,178,000 was available for dividends without prior Pennsylvania Department of Banking approval, subject to the regulatory capital requirements discussed below. The approval of the Federal Reserve is required for a state bank member in the Federal Reserve system to pay dividends if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year exceeds the Bank’s net profits (as defined) for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years. Under this formula, the Bank can declare dividends in 2021 without approval of the Federal Reserve of approximately $21,883,000 plus an additional amount equal to the Bank’s net profits for 2021 up to the date of any such dividend declaration. QNB paid dividends to its shareholders of $1.36 per share, $1.32 per share, and $1.28 per share, in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
QNB is subject to various regulatory capital requirements as issued by Federal regulatory authorities. Regulatory capital is defined in terms of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2. Risk-based capital ratios are expressed as a percentage of risk-weighted assets. Risk-weighted assets are determined by assigning various weights to all assets and off-balance sheet arrangements, such as letters of credit and loan commitments, based on associated risk. QNB is subject to various regulatory capital requirements as issued by Federal regulatory authorities. The final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s capital guidelines for U.S. banks (“Basel III”) became effective for QNB on January 1, 2015 and was fully phased-in by January 1, 2019.
Under the final rules, minimum requirements increased for both the quantity and quality of capital held by banks. The rules included a new common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets minimum ratio of 4.5%, raised the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4.0% to 6.0%, required a minimum ratio of Total Capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0%, and required a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%. A new capital conservation buffer, comprised of common equity Tier 1 capital, was also established above the regulatory minimum capital requirements. This capital conservation buffer was phased in beginning January 1, 2016, at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increase each subsequent year by an additional 0.625% until reaching its final level of 2.5% on January 1, 2019. Strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments were also implemented. The final rules also revised the definition and calculation of Tier 1 capital, Total Capital, and risk-weighted assets. QNB and the Bank had enough capital to meet the fully phased in buffer on January 1, 2019.
QNB offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (the “Plan”) to provide participants a convenient and economical method for investing cash dividends paid on the Company’s common stock in additional shares at a discount. The Plan also allows participants to make additional cash purchases of stock at a discount. Stock purchases under the Plan contributed $898,000 and $863,000 to capital during 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 100,000 shares of QNB’s common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase authorization does not bear a termination date. As of December 31, 2019, 57,883 shares were repurchased under this authorization at an average price of $16.97 and a total cost of $982,000. During 2020, 4,100 shares were repurchased at an average price of $31.75. As of December 31, 2020, a total of 61,983 shares were repurchased under this authorization at an average price of $17.95 and a total cost of $1,112,000.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 established five capital level designations for insured institutions ranging from “well capitalized” to “critically undercapitalized.” At December 31, 2020 and 2019, management believes
- 47 -
that the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject and have met the “well capitalized” criteria.
Contractual Obligations, Commitments, and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
QNB has various financial obligations, including contractual obligations and commitments, which may require future cash payments.
The following table presents, as of December 31, 2020, significant contractual obligations to third parties by payment date and the amounts and expected maturities of significant commitments. Further discussion of the nature of each obligation can be found in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company’s reserve for unfunded commitments totaled $91,000 and $73,000 at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.
(a)
Includes available amounts for overdraft protection program in one year or less
Commitments to extend credit, including loan commitments, standby letters of credit, and commercial letters of credit do not necessarily represent future cash requirements, as these commitments often expire without being drawn upon. The Company does not currently have any commitments for significant capital expenditures or other purchase obligations.
- 48 -
Market Risk Management
Market risk reflects the risk of economic loss resulting from changes in interest rates and market prices. QNB’s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk and liquidity risk. QNB’s liquidity position was discussed in a prior section.
QNB’s largest source of revenue is net interest income, which is subject to changes in market interest rates. Interest rate risk management seeks to minimize the effect of interest rate changes on net interest margins and interest rate spreads and to provide growth in net interest income through periods of changing interest rates. QNB’s Asset/Liability and Investment Management Committee (“ALCO”) is responsible for managing interest rate risk and for evaluating the impact of changing interest rate conditions on net interest income.
QNB uses computer simulation analysis to measure the sensitivity of projected earnings to changes in interest rates. Simulation considers current balance sheet volumes and the scheduled repricing dates, instrument level optionality, and maturities of assets and liabilities. It incorporates assumptions for growth, changes in the mix of assets and liabilities, prepayments, and average rates earned and paid. Based on this information, management uses the model to project net interest income under multiple interest rate scenarios.
A balance sheet is considered liability sensitive when its liabilities (deposits and borrowings) reprice faster or to a greater extent than its earning assets (loans and securities). A liability sensitive balance sheet will produce relatively less net interest income when interest rates rise and more net interest income when they decline. Based on our simulation analysis, management believes QNB’s interest sensitivity position at December 31, 2020 is liability sensitive. Management expects that market interest rates may gradually increase in the next 12 months, based on the economic environment and policy of the Federal Reserve.
The following table shows the estimated impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 assuming instantaneous rate shocks, and consistent levels of assets and liabilities. Net interest income for the subsequent twelve months is projected to decrease when interest rates are higher than current rates.
Computations of future effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. Assets and liabilities may react differently than projected to changes in market interest rates. The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag changes in market interest rates. Interest rate shifts may not be parallel.
Changes in interest rates can cause substantial changes in the amount of prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed securities, which may in turn affect QNB’s interest rate sensitivity position. Additionally, credit risk may rise if an interest rate increase adversely affects the ability of borrowers to service their debt.
QNB is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk. At December 31, 2020, QNB did not have any hedging transactions in place such as interest rate swaps, caps or floors.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recently issued accounting standards.
- 49 -
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
Disclosure of the Company’s significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Additional information is contained in Management’s Discussion and Analysis and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the most sensitive of these issues. The discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements of QNB, which are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and predominant practices within the banking industry. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires QNB to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. QNB evaluates estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, the determination of the valuation of other real estate owned, other-than-temporary impairments on investment securities, the determination of impairment of restricted bank stock, the valuation of deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation and income taxes. QNB bases its estimates on historical experience and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Other-than-Temporary Investment Security Impairment
Securities are evaluated periodically to determine whether a decline in their value is other-than-temporary. Management utilizes criteria such as the magnitude and duration of the decline, in addition to the reasons underlying the decline, to determine whether the loss in value is other-than-temporary. The term “other-than-temporary” is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent, but indicates that the prospect for a near-term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable, or that there is a lack of evidence to support a realizable value equal to or greater than the carrying value of the investment.
The Company follows the accounting guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 320-10 as it relates to the recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”). This accounting guidance specifies that (a) if a company does not have the intent to sell a debt security prior to recovery and (b) it is more likely than not that it will not have to sell the debt security prior to recovery, the security would not be considered other-than-temporarily impaired unless there is a credit loss. When an entity does not intend to sell the security, and it is more likely than not, the entity will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis, it will recognize the credit component of an other-than-temporary impairment of a debt security in earnings and the remaining portion in other comprehensive income. For held to maturity debt securities, the amount of an other-than-temporary impairment recorded in other comprehensive income for the non-credit portion of a previous other-than-temporary impairment should be amortized prospectively over the remaining life of the security on the basis of the timing of future estimated cash flows of the security. For equity securities without a readily determinable market value, once a decline in value is determined to be other-than-temporary, the value of the equity security is reduced to fair value and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized.
Allowance for Loan Losses
QNB considers that the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than its other significant accounting policies. The allowance for loan losses is calculated with the objective of maintaining a level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb probable known and inherent losses in the outstanding loan portfolio. The allowance is reduced by actual credit losses and is increased by the provision for loan losses and recoveries of previous losses. The provisions for loan losses are charged to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered necessary by management.
The allowance for loan losses is based on management’s continual review and evaluation of the loan portfolio. The level of the allowance is determined by assigning specific reserves to individually identified problem credits and general reserves to all other loans. The portion of the allowance that is allocated to impaired loans is determined by estimating the inherent loss on each credit after giving consideration to the value of underlying collateral. The general reserves are based on the composition and risk characteristics of the loan portfolio, including the nature of the loan portfolio, credit concentration trends, delinquency and loss experience, as well as other qualitative factors such as current economic trends.
Management emphasizes loan quality and close monitoring of potential problem credits. Credit risk identification and review processes are utilized in order to assess and monitor the degree of risk in the loan portfolio. QNB’s lending and credit administration staff are charged with reviewing the loan portfolio and identifying changes in the economy or in a borrower’s circumstances which may affect the ability to repay debt or the value of pledged collateral. A loan classification and review system exists that identifies those loans with a higher than normal risk of collection. Each commercial loan is assigned a grade based upon an assessment of the borrower’s financial capacity to service the debt and the presence and value of collateral for the loan. An independent loan review group tests risk assessments and evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Management meets monthly to review the credit quality of the loan portfolio and quarterly to review the allowance for loan losses.

In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review QNB’s allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require QNB to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. Management believes that it uses the best information available to make determinations about the adequacy of the allowance and that it has established its existing allowance for loan losses in accordance with GAAP. If circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making determinations, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and results of operations could be affected. Because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, increases to the allowance may be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above.
Foreclosed Assets
Assets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value less cost to sell at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Revenue and expenses and changes in the valuation allowance are included in net expenses from foreclosed assets.
Stock-Based Compensation
QNB sponsored stock-based compensation plans, administered by a Board committee, under which both qualified and nonqualified stock options may be granted periodically to certain employees. QNB accounts for all awards granted under stock-based compensation plans in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. Compensation cost has been measured using the fair value of an award on the grant date and is recognized over the service period, which is usually the vesting period. The fair value of each option is amortized into compensation expense on a straight-line basis between the grant date for the option and each vesting date. QNB estimates the fair value of stock options on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The model requires the use of numerous assumptions, many of which are highly subjective in nature.
Income Taxes
QNB accounts for income taxes under the asset/liability method in accordance with income tax accounting guidance, ASC 740 - Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets when, in the judgment of management, it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not become available. Because the judgment about the level of future taxable income is dependent to a great extent on matters that may, at least in part, be beyond QNB’s control, it is at least reasonably possible that management’s judgment about the need for a valuation allowance for deferred taxes could change in the near term.
