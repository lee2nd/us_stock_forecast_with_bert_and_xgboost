Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results     of Operations .
Executive Summary
The Trust is a passive fixed investment trust which holds overriding royalty rights, receives income under those rights from certain operating companies, pays its expenses and distributes the remaining net funds to its unit owners. As mandated by the Trust Agreement, distributions of income are made on a quarterly basis. These distributions, as determined by the Trustees, constitute substantially all of the funds on hand after provision is made for Trust expenses then anticipated.
The Trust does not engage in any business or extractive operations of any kind in the areas over which it holds royalty rights and is precluded from engaging in such activities by the Trust Agreement. There are no requirements, therefore, for capital resources with which to make capital expenditures or investments in order to continue the receipt of royalty revenues by the Trust.
The properties of the Trust are described in Item 2. Properties of this Report. Of particular importance with respect to royalty income are the two royalty agreements, the Mobil Agreement and the OEG Agreement. The Mobil Agreement covers gas sales from the western part of the Oldenburg concession. The Trust has traditionally received the majority of its royalty income under the Mobil Agreement due to the higher royalty rate of 4%. The OEG Agreement covers gas sales from the entire Oldenburg concession but the royalty rate of 0.6667% is significantly lower and gas royalties have been correspondingly lower.
The operating companies pay monthly royalties to the Trust based on their sales of natural gas, sulfur and oil. Of these three products, natural gas provided approximately 90% of the total royalties in fiscal 2021. The amount of royalties paid to the Trust is primarily based on four factors: the amount of gas sold, the price of that gas, the area from which the gas is sold and the exchange rate. For purposes of the royalty calculations, the determination of the gas price is explained in detail in the following three paragraphs.
On August 26, 2016, the Mobil and OEG Agreements were amended to establish a new base to determine gas prices for the calculation of the Trust's royalties calculated. This new base is set as the state assessment base for natural gas used by the operating companies in their calculation of royalties payable to the State of Lower Saxony. This change reflects a shift from the use of gas ex-field prices ("contractual prices") to the prices calculated for the German Border Import gas Price ("GBIP"). The average combined totals of the GBIP for the relevant three-month period are used to provide an average gas price for the quarter. This average gas price is increased by 1% and 3% per the terms of the Mobil and OEG Royalty Agreements and is used by the operators to calculate the royalties payable to the Trust for a given quarter.
The change to the GBIP was intended to be revenue neutral for the Trust in comparison to the previous pricing methodology. Additionally, this change was intended to reduce the scope and cost of the accounting examination, eliminate ongoing disputes with OEG and Mobil regarding sales to related parties, and reduce prior year adjustments to the normally scheduled year-end reconciliation. The pricing basis has eliminated certain costs (transportation and plant gas storage) that were previously deductible prior to the royalty calculation under the OEG Agreement.
On approximately the 25th of the months of January, April, July and October, the operating companies calculate the volume of gas sold during the previous calendar quarter. This volume of gas sold is then multiplied by the average adjusted GBIP available at that time. Due to delays in the calculation of the GBIP by the state, the most current GBIP is from a period ending two months prior to the end of the relevant calendar quarter. The respective royalty amount is divided into thirds and forms the monthly royalty payments to the Trust (payable on the 15th of each month) for the Trust's upcoming fiscal quarter. At the same time that the operating companies determine the actual amount of royalties that were payable for the prior calendar quarter, they look at the actual amount of royalties that were paid to the Trust for that period and calculate the difference between what was paid and what was payable. Any positive adjustments are paid immediately and any negative adjustments would be deducted from the royalty payment for the first month of the next fiscal quarter. In September of the succeeding calendar year, the operating companies make the final determination of any necessary royalty adjustments for the prior calendar year with a positive or negative adjustment made accordingly. These adjustments are based on the final average GBIP for the preceding year applied to the final calculation of the total volume of gas sold by the operating companies during that year.
There are two types of natural gas found within the Oldenburg concession, sweet gas and sour gas. Sweet gas has little or no contaminants and needs no treatment before it can be sold. Sour gas, in comparison, must be processed at the Grossenkneten desulfurization plant before it can be sold. The desulfurization process removes hydrogen sulfide and other contaminants. The hydrogen sulfide in gaseous form is converted to sulfur in a solid form, which is sold separately. With full operation of the two units, raw gas input capacity stands at approximately 400 million cubic feet ("MMcf") per day. As needed, EMPG conducts maintenance on the plant generally during the summer months when demand is lower. As part of the regular 10-year scheduled maintenance, Grossenkneten underwent an overhaul from September 8, 2020 through October 13, 2020. During this time the plant was completely shut down and no sour gas was processed. Since sour gas accounts for 75% of overall gas sales and 98% of western gas sales, this shutdown significantly impacted royalty income during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and the first quarter of fiscal 2021.
For unit owners, changes in the U.S. dollar value of the Euro have an immediate impact. This impact occurs at the time the royalties, which are paid to the Trust in Euros, are converted into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate and transferred from Germany to the Trust's bank account in the U.S. In relation to the U.S. dollar, a stronger Euro would yield more U.S. dollars and a weaker Euro would yield fewer U.S. dollars.
Seasonal demand factors affect the income from the Trust's royalty rights insofar as they relate to energy demands and increases or decreases in prices, but on average they are generally not material to the annual income received under the Trust's royalty rights.
The Trust has no means of ensuring continued income from overriding royalty rights at their present level or otherwise. The Trust's consultant in Germany provides general information to the Trust on the German and European economies and energy markets. This information provides a context in which to evaluate the actions of the operating companies. The Trust's consultant receives reports from EMPG with respect to current and planned drilling and exploration efforts. However, EMPG and the operating companies continue to limit the information flow to that which is required by German law, and the Trust is not able to confirm the accuracy of any of the information supplied by EMPG or the operating companies.
The low level of administrative expenses of the Trust limits the effect of inflation on costs. Sustained price inflation would be reflected in sales prices. Sales prices along with sales volumes form the basis on which the royalties paid to the Trust are computed.
Results: Fiscal 2021 versus Fiscal
For fiscal 2021, the Trust's gross royalty income increased 13.64% to $4,602,410 from $4,050,017 in fiscal 2020. The increase in the amount of royalty income resulted in the higher distribution. The total distribution for fiscal 2021 was $0.47 per unit compared to $0.32 per unit for fiscal 2020. Gas prices and the average exchange rates under both royalty agreements were higher while gas sales were down. The royalty income attributable to gas sales under the Mobil Agreement in fiscal 2021 increased by $195,626 as compared to fiscal 2020. Royalty income attributable to gas sales under the OEG Agreement in fiscal 2021 increased by $156,179 as compared to fiscal 2020.
As in prior years, the Trust receives adjustments from the operating companies based on their final calculations of royalties payable during the previous periods. During fiscal 2021, the adjustments based on royalties payable for 2020 decreased royalty income by $696,189. During fiscal 2020, the adjustments based on royalties payable for 2017, 2018 and 2019 decreased royalty income by $653,916. In fiscal 2021 and 2020, Mobil sulfur royalties totaled $178,367 and $71,280, respectively.
Gas sales under the Mobil Agreement decreased 8.33% to 15.821 Billion cubic feet ("Bcf") in fiscal 2021 from 17.259 Bcf in fiscal 2020. The most significant factor resulting in the decrease in gas sales for 2021 was the continuing negative impact of COVID-19 on the German, European and global economies. In addition, according to the Trust's consultant in Germany, some portion of the decline in gas production is due to the normal reduction in well pressure that is experienced over time.

Excluding the effects of differences in prices and average exchange rates, the combination of royalty rates on gas sold from western Oldenburg results in an effective royalty rate approximately seven times higher than the royalty rate on gas sold from eastern Oldenburg. This is of particular significance to the Trust since gas sold from western Oldenburg provides the bulk of royalties paid to the Trust. For fiscal 2021, the volume of gas sold from western Oldenburg accounted for only 29.33% of the volume of all gas sales. However, western Oldenburg gas royalties provided approximately 79.98% or $3,326,874 out of a total of $4,159,420 in overall Oldenburg gas royalties.
Gas sales under the OEG Agreement decreased 3.39% to 53.947 Bcf in fiscal 2021 from 55.841 Bcf in fiscal 2020. The most significant factor resulting in the decrease in gas sales for 2021 was the continuing negative impact of COVID-19 on the German, European and global economies. In addition, according to the Trust's consultant in Germany, some portion of the decline in gas production is due to the normal reduction in well pressure that is experienced over time.

Interest income for fiscal 2021 of $641 decreased from interest income of $2,853 for fiscal 2020 due to lower interest rates in effect. Trust expenses decreased $140,013, or 18.27%, to $626,494 in fiscal 2021 from $766,507 in fiscal 2020 due to reduced Trustees' fees as specified in the provisions of the Trust Agreement, cost savings realized through the suspension of in-person meetings due to the pandemic, lower legal expenses, lower insurance costs and the absence of accounting costs associated with the biennial examinations of the royalty calculations by the German operating companies during fiscal 2021.
Report on Exploration and Drilling
The Trust's German consultant periodically contacts the representatives of the operating companies to inquire about their planned and proposed drilling and geophysical work and other general matters. The following represents a summary of the most recent information the Trust's German consultant received from representatives of EMPG as of November 2021. The Trust is not able to confirm the accuracy of any of the information supplied by the operating companies. In addition, the operating companies are not required to take any of the actions outlined and, if they change their plans with respect to any such actions, they are not obligated to inform the Trust. Information on wells that are not named or are in preliminary planning stages is not divulged by EMPG.
EMPG has not planned any new wells for calendar year 2022. On the exploration side, there has been no major work initiated. Desktop studies are continuing to satisfy mining authorities.
The operator has performed a study, The Sour Gas Study, dealing with all matters which could help to optimize the tail end production from all sour gas wells in the gas fields of Oldenburg concessions. The focus of the study was on how to optimize the gas compression in the flowline grids from each well to the gathering stations, compressor stations and finally towards the processing plant in Grossenkneten. Some optimization potential has been found.
Grossenkneten plant operation will soon be reduced to one train from the current two trains in parallel thus optimizing cost and efficiency.
It is expected that the Trust's consultant will learn additional details about The Sour Gas Study and its impact when he meets EMPG in March 2022.
Critical Accounting Policies
The financial statements, appearing subsequently in this Report, present financial statement balances and financial results on a modified cash basis of accounting, which is a comprehensive basis of accounting other than accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP basis"). Cash basis accounting is an accepted accounting method for royalty trusts such as the Trust. GAAP basis financial statements disclose income as earned and expenses as incurred, without regard to receipts or payments. The use of GAAP would require the Trust to accrue for expected royalty payments. This is exceedingly difficult since the Trust has very limited information on such payments until they are received and cannot accurately project such amounts. The Trust's cash basis financial statements disclose revenue when cash is received and expenses when cash is paid. The one modification of the cash basis of accounting is that the Trust accrues for distributions to be paid to unit owners (those distributions approved by the Trustees for the Trust). The Trust's distributable income represents royalty income received by the Trust during the period plus interest income less any expenses incurred by the Trust, all on a cash basis. In the opinion of the Trustees, the use of the modified cash basis provides a more meaningful presentation to unit owners of the results of operations of the Trust and presents to the unit owners a more accurate calculation of income and expenses for tax reporting purposes.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Trust has no off-balance sheet arrangements.
This Report on Form 10-K may contain forward-looking statements intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements address future expectations and events or conditions concerning the Trust. Many of these statements are based on information provided to the Trust by the operating companies or by consultants using public information sources. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements. These include:
• risks and uncertainties concerning levels of gas production and gas sale prices, general economic conditions and currency exchange rates;
• the ability or willingness of the operating companies to perform under their contractual obligations with the Trust;
• potential disputes with the operating companies and the resolution thereof; and
• the effects of the novel coronavirus identified as COVID-19 on our financial results.
All such factors are difficult to predict, contain uncertainties that may materially affect actual results, and are generally beyond the control of the Trust. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for the Trust to predict all such factors or to assess the impact of each such factor on the Trust. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and the Trust does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made.
