A summary of our results of operations and financial condition and select metrics is included in the following table:
Index
Asset Quality
For all banks and bank holding companies, asset quality plays a significant role in the overall financial condition of the institution and its results of operations. The Company measures asset quality in terms of nonaccrual loans as a percentage of gross loans, and net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans. Net charge-offs are calculated as the difference between charged-off loans and recovery payments received on previously charged-off loans. The following table summarizes these asset quality metrics:
Asset and Deposit Growth
The Company’s assets and liabilities are comprised primarily of loans and deposits. The ability to originate new loans and attract new deposits is fundamental to the Company’s asset growth. Total assets increased to $975.4 million at December 31, 2020 from $913.9 million at December 31, 2019. Total loans including net deferred fees and unearned income increased by $82.0 million, or 10.6%, to $857.6 million as of December 31, 2020 compared to $775.6 million as of December 31, 2019. Total deposits increased by 2.0%, to $766.2 million as of December 31, 2020 from $750.9 million as of December 31, 2019.

Index
Comparison of interest income, interest expense and net interest margin
The Company’s primary source of revenue is interest income. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $43.9 million, an decrease from $45.7 million and an increase from $42.6 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The interest income was negatively impacted by decreased average earning assets and rates, primarily SBA PPP loans in 2020. Average loans for the year increased 6.8% over 2019, and 10.7% over 2018. Average earning asset yields decreased by 74 basis points for 2020 compared to 2019.
Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased compared to 2019 by $4.1 million and decreased compared to 2018 by $1.7 million, respectively, to $7.3 million. The decrease for 2020 compared to 2019 was mostly the result of the lower rates paid on wholesale funding deposits, interest-bearing demand deposits, and time deposits. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits also decreased to 98 basis points in 2020 compared to 165 basis points in 2019. Total cost of funds decreased by 63 basis points for 2020 compared to 2019 and by 35 basis points compared to 2018.
The net impact of the changes in yields on interest-earning assets and the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities decreased the margin for 2020 compared to 2019. The net interest margin was 3.89% for 2020 compared to 4.06% for 2019 and 4.07% in 2018.
Net interest income increased by $2.2 million for 2020 compared to 2019, and $2.9 million compared to 2018.
Index
Provision for loan losses
The provision for loan losses in each period is reflected as a charge against earnings in that period. The provision for loan losses is equal to the amount required to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that is adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The provision (credit) for loan losses was $1.2 million in 2020 compared to $(165,000) in 2019 and $14,000 in 2018. The provision for loan losses for 2020 resulted primarily from increased qualitative factors related to COVID-19. The provision for 2019 resulted primarily from loan growth and change in loan portfolio mix. As a result of the pandemic as it relates to credit quality and proactive risk rating of our loan portfolio, the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to loans held for investment increased to 1.23% at December 31, 2020 from 1.19% at December 31, 2019.
The following table summarizes the provision (credit), charge-offs (recoveries) by loan category for the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:
The percentage of net non-accrual loans (net of government guarantees) to the total loan portfolio has increased to 0.43% as of December 31, 2020 from 0.31% at December 31, 2019 primarily due to an increase in nonaccrual SBA 504 loans.
The allowance for loan losses compared to net non-accrual loans has decreased to 278% as of December 31, 2020 from 365% as of December 31, 2019. Total past due loans were $1.9 million as of December 31, 2020 and as of December 31, 2019.
Index
Non-interest Income
The Company earned non-interest income primarily through fees related to services provided to loan and deposit clients.
The following tables present a summary of non-interest income for the periods presented:
Total non-interest income increased $0.3 million for 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was mostly from increased other loan fees and gain from loan sales. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in service charges. Service charges income declined primarily due to the Company’s adherence with the Cares Act initiative to waive certain transaction fees.
Non-Interest Expenses
The following tables present a summary of non-interest expenses for the periods presented:
Total non-interest expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019 increased by $0.8 million primarily due to additional salaries and employee benefits, professional services, and FDIC assessment as a result of the Company's increased market share in the Northern and Southern regions, and addition of client relationships and support positions. Additionally, commissions expense (included in salaries and employee benefits expense) increased $0.5 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to increased manufactured housing loan originations and relationship banking deposit originations through the pandemic.
Income Taxes
The income tax provision for 2020 was $3.5 million compared to $3.4 million in 2019 and $2.8 million in 2018. The effective income tax rate was 30.0%, 30.0%, and 27.5%, respectively, for 2020, 2019 and 2018, reflecting the federal corporate tax rate reduction implemented in 2018.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax basis including operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Net deferred tax assets of $4.0 million and $3.2 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, are reported in the consolidated balance sheet as a component of total assets.
Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires that companies assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against their deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence using a “more likely than not” standard.
Index
A valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets if, based on weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets may not be realized. Management evaluates the Company’s deferred tax assets for recoverability using a consistent approach which considers the relative impact of negative and positive evidence, including the Company’s historical profitability and projections of future taxable income. The Company is required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and record a charge to income if management determines, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets may not be realized.
There was no valuation allowance on deferred tax assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
ASC 740 also prescribes a more likely than not threshold for the financial statement recognition of uncertain tax positions. ASC 740 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. On a quarterly basis, the Company undergoes a process to evaluate whether income tax accruals are in accordance with ASC 740 guidance on uncertain tax positions. There were no uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Additional information regarding income taxes, including a reconciliation of the differences between the recorded income tax provision and the amount of tax computed by applying statutory federal and state income tax rates before income taxes, can be found in Note 7 “Income Taxes” to the consolidated financial statements of Form 10-K beginning on page 87.
BALANCE SHEET
Total assets increased $61.6 million to $975.4 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $913.9 million at December 31, 2019. The majority of the increase was $91.4 million in loans held for investment primarily from the SBA PPP loan program. Total SBA loans including SBA PPP increased $66.6 million to $81.3 at December 31, 2020. Total commercial real estate loans increased by 4.3% to $402.1 million at December 31, 2020 compared to 2019, and comprised 46.9% of the total loan portfolio.

Total liabilities increased $54.5 million, or 6.6% to $886.4 million at December 31, 2020 from $831.9 million at December 31, 2019. The majority of this increase was due to deposit growth. Total deposits increased by $15.3 million, or 2.0% to $766.2 million at December 31, 2020 from $750.9 million at December 31, 2019. Non-interest bearing demand deposits increased by $71.0 million to $181.8 million at December 31, 2020 from $110.8 million at December 31, 2019. Certificates of deposit decreased by $142.6 million to $167.5 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $310.1 million at December 31, 2019. Interest-bearing demand deposits increased by $83.8 million to $398.1 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $314.3 million at 2019. Savings deposits increased slightly to $18.7 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $15.7 million at December 31, 2019. Other borrowings increased by $40.0 million to $105.0 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $65.0 million at December 31, 2019 due to increased FHLB advances.
Total stockholders’ equity increased to $89.0 million at December 31, 2020 from $82.0 million at December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily from 2020 net income of $8.2 million reduced by common stock dividends of $1.7 million.
Index
The following tables present the Company’s average balances as of the dates indicated:
Loan Portfolio
Market Summary
Total loans increased by $82.0 million during 2020 to $857.6 million. The majority of this increase was driven by $66.6 million of growth in the SBA loan portfolio mostly due to SBA PPP loans. Total manufactured housing loans increased by $23.0 million and total commercial loans including commercial agriculture loans decreased by $20.6 million. Commercial real estate loans increased by $16.5 million in 2020. Single family real estate loans decreased by $1.4 million. With the recent decrease in interest rates the competition for quality loans has increased in our markets.
Index
The table below summarizes the distribution of the Company’s loans (including loans held for sale) at the year-end:
Commercial Loans
Commercial loans consist of term loans and revolving business lines of credit. Under the terms of the revolving lines of credit, the Company grants a maximum loan amount, which remains available to the business during the loan term. The collateral for these loans typically are by Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC-1”) lien filings, real estate, and personal guarantees. The Company does not extend material loans of this type in excess of five years.
Commercial Real Estate
Commercial real estate and construction loans are primarily made for the purpose of purchasing, improving, or constructing, commercial and industrial properties. This loan category also includes SBA 504 loans and land loans.
Commercial and industrial real estate loans are primarily secured by nonresidential property. Office buildings or other commercial property primarily secure these types of loans. Loan to appraised value ratios on nonresidential real estate loans are generally restricted to a maximum of 75% of appraised value of the underlying real property if occupied by the owner or owner’s business; otherwise, these loans are generally restricted to 70% of appraised value of the underlying real property.
The Company makes real estate construction loans on commercial properties and single-family dwellings for speculative purposes. These loans are collateralized by first and second trust deeds on real property. Construction loans are generally written with terms of six to eighteen months and usually do not exceed a loan to appraised value of 75%.
SBA 504 loans are made in conjunction with Certified Development Companies. These loans are granted to purchase or construct real estate or acquire machinery and equipment. The loan is structured with a conventional first trust deed provided by the Bank and a second trust deed which is funded through the sale of debentures. The predominant structure is terms of 10% down payment, 50% conventional first loan and 40% debenture. Construction loans of this type must provide additional collateral to reduce the loan-to-value to approximately 75%. Conventional and investor loans are sometimes funded by our secondary-market partners and CWB receives a premium for these transactions.
SBA Loans
SBA loans consist of SBA 7(a), Business and Industry loans (“B&I”), and SBA Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans. The SBA 7(a) loan proceeds are used for working capital, machinery and equipment purchases, land and building purposes, leasehold improvements, and debt refinancing. At present, the SBA guarantees as much as 85% on loans up to $150,000 and 75% on loans more than $150,000. The SBA’s maximum exposure amount is $3,750,000. The Company may sell a portion of the loans, however, under the SBA 7(a) loan program; the Company is required to retain a minimum of 5% of the principal balance of each loan it sells into the secondary market.
Index
Under the CARES Act, CWB offered SBA Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans. The loans are forgivable in whole or in part and carry a fixed rate of 1% for a term of two years (loans made before June 5, 2020) or five years (loans made after June 5, 2020), if not forgiven, in whole or in part. Payments are deferred until either the date on which the SBA remits the amount of the forgiveness proceeds to the lender or the date that is 10 months after the day of the covered period if the borrower does not apply for forgiveness within the 10 month period
B&I loans are guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The maximum guaranteed amount is 60% to 80% depending on the size of the loan. B&I loans are similar to the SBA 7(a) loans but are made to businesses in designated rural areas. These loans can also be sold into the secondary market.
In April of 2020, under the CARES Act, CWB began offering SBA Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans. The loans are forgivable in whole or in part and carry a fixed rate of 1% for a term of two years (loans made before June 5, 2020) or five years (loans made after June 5, 2020), if not forgiven, in whole or in part. Payments are deferred until either the date on which the SBA remits the amount of the forgiveness proceeds to the lender or the date that is 10 months after the day of the covered period if the borrower does not apply for forgiveness within the 10-month period.
Agricultural Loans for real estate and operating lines
The Company has an agricultural lending program for agricultural land, agricultural operational lines, and agricultural term loans for crops, equipment, and livestock. The primary product is supported by guarantees issued from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”), Farm Service Agency (“FSA”), and the USDA B&I loan program. The FSA loans typically have a 90% guarantee up to $1,776,000 (amount adjusted annually based on inflation) for up to 40 years, but not always. The Company had $69.8 million of commercial agriculture loans at December 31, 2020, of which $31.6 million had FSA guarantees.
CWB is an approved Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (“Farmer Mac”) lender under the Farmer Mac I and Farmer Mac II Programs. Under the Farmer Mac I program, loans are sourced by CWB, underwritten, funded, and serviced by Farmer Mac. CWB receives an origination fee and an ongoing field servicing fee of 25 basis points to 115 basis points for maintaining the relationship with the borrower and performing certain loan compliance monitoring, and other duties as directed by the Central Servicer. As of December 31, 2020, CWB was servicing $110.7 million of Famer Mac loans.
Manufactured Housing Loans
CWB originates loans secured by manufactured homes located in approved rental, co-operative ownership, condominium and planned unit development mobile home parks in Santa Barbara, Ventura and San Luis Obispo Counties as well as along the California coast from San Diego to San Francisco. The loans are made to borrowers for purchasing or refinancing new or existing manufactured homes. The loans are made under either fixed rate programs for terms of 10 to 20 years or adjustable-rate programs with terms of 25 to 30 years. The adjustable-rate loans generally have an initial fixed rate period of five years and then adjust annually subject to interest rate caps.
HELOC
Home equity lines of credit (“HELOC”) held at the Bank are lines of credit collateralized by residential real estate. Typically, HELOCs are collateralized by a second deed of trust. The combined loan-to-value, first trust deed and second trust deed, are not to exceed 75% on all HELOCs. The Bank is not actively originating new HELOCs.
Other Installment Loans
Installment loans consist of automobile and general-purpose loans made to individuals. The Bank is not actively originating installment loans.
Single Family Real Estate Loans
Until the third quarter of 2015, the Company originated loans that consisted of first and second mortgage loans secured by trust deeds on one-to-four family homes. These loans were made to borrowers for purposes such as purchasing a home, refinancing an existing home, interest rate reduction or home improvement.
Index
Loan Maturities and Sensitivity to Interest Rates
The following table sets forth the amount of loans outstanding by type of loan as of December 31, 2020 that were contractually due in one year or less, more than one year and less than five years, and more than five years based on remaining scheduled repayments of principal. Lines of credit or other loans having no stated final maturity and no stated schedule of repayments are reported as due in one year or less. The tables also present an analysis of the rate structure for loans within the same maturity time periods. Actual cash flows from these loans may differ materially from contractual maturities due to prepayment, refinancing or other factors.
At December 31, 2020, total loans consisted of 76.1% with floating rates and 23.9% with fixed rates. Manufactured housing loans, which are generally fixed rate for the first five years are included in floating rate loans during the fixed period.
The following table presents total gross loans based on remaining scheduled contractual repayments of principal as of the periods indicated:
Index
COVID-19 Loan Modifications
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has taken two primary approaches in assisting our clients by modifying terms of existing loans and originating loans under the PPP. The Company has taken a proactive approach to assist its borrowers through individual evaluation and broad-based programs. Modifications granted to borrowers have been payment deferrals taking the form of full payment deferrals. Based on the circumstances of the borrower, payments have been deferred either 90 days, with the option to extend, or 180 days. Consistent with the CARES Act provisions and Interagency Statement on "Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus," modifications granted to borrowers that are related to COVID-19 are not required to be evaluated as TDRs under ASC 310-40. These modified loans are classified as performing and are not considered past due. Loans are to be placed on non-accrual when it becomes apparent that payment of interest or recovery of all principal is questionable, and the COVID-19 related modification is no longer considered short-term or the modification is deemed ineffective. The Company anticipates additional loans to be modified due to the effects of COVID-19 in the coming periods. At December 31, 2020, the Company had 13 COVID-19 related modified loans with a total balance of $5.1 million. Through the date of this filing, the Company has not experienced any loan charge-offs caused by the economic impact from COVID-19. Management has evaluated events related to COVID-19 that have occurred subsequent to December 31, 2020 and has concluded there are no matters that would require recognition in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
The table below shows the breakdown of pandemic deferrals by loan segment:
High Risk Industries Impacted By COVID-19
The industries most heavily impacted include retail, healthcare, hospitality, schools, and energy. The Company’s management team has evaluated the loans related to the affected industries and at December 31, 2020, the Bank’s loans to these industries were $179.2 million, which is 21.0% of our $857.6 million loan portfolio.
Importantly, of the selected industry loans, $3.0 million, or 1.66%, are on non-accrual. Also, for the impacted industries loans the classified loans are $16.9 million, or 9.43%. Lastly, the Bank has accommodated $2.1 million of these loans with payment deferrals, or 1.16% of the selected industries. Additional detail by industry is included in the table below.

Index
Concentrations of Lending Activities
The Company’s lending activities are primarily driven by the clients served in the market areas where the Company has branch offices in the Central Coast of California. The Company monitors concentrations within selected categories such as geography and product. The Company makes manufactured housing, commercial, SBA, construction, commercial real estate, and consumer loans to clients through branch offices located in the Company’s primary markets. The Company’s business is concentrated in these areas and the loan portfolio includes significant credit exposure to the manufactured housing and commercial real estate markets of these areas. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, manufactured housing loans comprised 32.6% and 33.2%, of total loans, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, commercial real estate loans accounted for approximately 46.8% and 49.7% of total loans, respectively. Approximately 28.9% and 31.9% of these commercial real estate loans were owner occupied at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Substantially all of these loans are secured by first liens with an average loan to value ratios of 53.8% and 54.8% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company was within established policy limits at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Interest Reserves
Interest reserves are generally established at the time of the loan origination as an expense item in the budget for a construction and land development loan. The Company’s practice is to monitor the construction, sales and/or leasing progress to determine the feasibility of ongoing construction and development projects. If, at any time during the life of the loan, the project is determined not to be viable, the Company discontinues the use of the interest reserve and may take appropriate action to protect its collateral position via renegotiation and/or legal action as deemed appropriate. At December 31, 2020, the Company had 5 loans with an outstanding balance of $13.0 million with available interest reserves of $1.1 million. Total construction and land loans are approximately 3% and 5% of the Company’s loan portfolio at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Impaired loans
A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and/or interest under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and/or interest payments. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays or payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays or payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis. When determining the possibility of impairment, management considers the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower's prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. For collateral-dependent loans, the Company uses the fair value of collateral method to measure impairment. All other loans are measured for impairment based on the present value of future cash flows. Impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis for all impaired loans in the portfolio.
A loan is considered a troubled debt restructured loan (“TDR”) when concessions have been made to the borrower and the borrower is in financial difficulty. These concessions include but are not limited to term extensions, rate reductions and principal reductions. Forgiveness of principal is rarely granted and modifications for all classes of loans are predominantly term extensions. TDR loans are also considered impaired.
The recorded investment in loans that are considered impaired is as follows:
Index
The following schedule summarizes impaired loans and specific reserves by loan class as of the periods indicated:
$0.7 million of the above impaired loans are government guaranteed.
$0.6 million of the above impaired loans are government guaranteed.
Total impaired loans decreased by $0.3 million at December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019. The manufactured housing impaired loans decreased by $1.3 million and commercial impaired loans decreased by $0.3 million in 2020 compared to 2019. SBA impaired loans decreased by $0.1 million in 2020 compared to 2019. These decreases were partially offset by one new SBA 504 impaired loan of $1.5 million. Impaired manufactured housing loans decreased mainly due to upgrades and payoffs of existing loans.
Index
The following schedule reflects recorded investment in certain types of loans at the dates indicated:
The accrual of interest is discontinued when substantial doubt exists as to collectability of the loan; generally, at the time the loan is 90 days delinquent. Any unpaid but accrued interest is reversed at that time. Thereafter, interest income is usually no longer recognized on the loan. Interest income may be recognized on impaired loans to the extent they are not past due by 90 days. Interest on nonaccrual loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual. Loans are returned to accrual status when all of the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.
The following table summarizes the composition of nonaccrual loans:
Total nonaccrual balances increased $1.2 million to $3.9 million at December 31, 2020, from $2.7 million at December 31, 2019. Nonaccrual balances include $0.2 million and $0.3 million of loans that are government guaranteed at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Nonaccrual loans net of government guarantees increased $1.3 million or 54%, from $2.4 million at December 31, 2019 to $3.7 million at December 31, 2020. The percentage of nonaccrual loans to the total loan portfolio has increased to 0.43% as of December 31, 2020 from 0.31% at December 31, 2019.
CWB or the SBA repurchases the guaranteed portion of SBA loans from investors when those loans become past due 120 days. After the foreclosure and collection process is complete, the SBA reimburses CWB for this principal balance. Therefore, although these balances do not earn interest during this period, they generally do not result in a loss of principal to CWB.

Allowance for Loan Losses
The following table summarizes the activity in our allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated.
The following table summarizes the allocation of allowance for loan losses by loan type. However, allocation of a portion of the allowance to one category of loans does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other categories:
Index
Total allowance for loan losses increased by $1.5 million to $10.2 million at December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year. In addition, the Company had net recoveries of $0.3 million in 2020 compared to net recoveries of $0.2 million in 2019.
Potential Problem Loans
The Company classifies loans consistent with federal banking regulations. These loan grades are described in further detail in “Item 8. Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of this Form 10-K. The following table presents information regarding potential problem loans consisting of loans graded Special Mention or worse, but still performing:
(1)
Loan balance includes $2.1 million guaranteed by government agencies.

Loan balance includes $1.5 million guaranteed by government agencies.
Investment Securities
Investment securities are classified at the time of acquisition as either held-to-maturity or available-for-sale based upon various factors, including asset/liability management strategies, liquidity and profitability objectives, and regulatory requirements. Held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts. Available-for-sale securities are securities that may be sold prior to maturity based upon asset/liability management decisions. Investment securities identified as available-for-sale are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities are recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity. Amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts on mortgage-backed securities is periodically adjusted for estimated prepayments.
The investment securities portfolio of the Company is utilized as collateral for borrowings, required collateral for public deposits and to manage liquidity, capital, and interest rate risk.
Index
The carrying value of investment securities for the years indicated was as follows:
The weighted average yields of investment securities by maturity period were as follows at December 31, 2020:
Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers or issuers have the right to call or prepay certain investment securities. Changes in interest rates may also impact prepayment or call options.
The Company does not own any subprime mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”) in its investment portfolio. Gross unrealized losses at December 31, 2020 are primarily caused by interest rate fluctuations, credit spread widening and reduced liquidity in applicable markets. The Company has reviewed all securities on which there was an unrealized loss in accordance with its accounting policy for other than temporary impaired (“OTTI”) described in “Item 8. Note 2 in this Form 10-K, “Investment Securities” and determined no impairment was required. At December 31, 2020, the Company had the intent and the ability to retain its investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.
Other Assets Acquired Through Foreclosure
The following table represents the changes in other assets acquired through foreclosure:
Other assets acquired through foreclosure consist primarily of properties acquired as a result of, or in-lieu-of, foreclosure. Properties or other assets (primarily manufactured housing) are classified as other real estate owned and other repossessed assets and are reported at fair value at the time of foreclosure less estimated costs to sell. Costs relating to development or improvement of the assets are capitalized and costs related to holding the assets are charged to expense. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had $0.1 million and $0.2 million valuation allowance on foreclosed assets, respectively. At December 31, 2018, the Company had no valuation allowance on foreclosed assets.

Other Borrowings
The following table sets forth certain information regarding FHLB advances and other borrowings.
FHLB and FRB Advances
The Company utilizes borrowed funds to support liquidity needs. The Company’s borrowing capacity at FHLB and FRB is determined based on collateral pledged, generally consisting of securities and loans. At December 31, 2020, no advances were outstanding from the FRB.
Other Borrowing
The Company has a revolving line of credit agreement for up to $10.0 million. The line of credit matures July 30, 2022. The Company must maintain a compensating deposit with the lender of 25% of the outstanding principal balance in a non-interest-bearing deposit account. In addition, the Company must maintain a minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.65, a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 7.0% and a minimum total risked based capital ratio of 10.0%. At December 31, 2020, the line of credit balance was zero.
Preferred Stock
There are no shares of the Company's preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Capital Resources
The federal banking agencies have adopted risk-based capital adequacy guidelines that are used to assess the adequacy of capital in supervising a bank holding companies and banks. In July 2013, the federal banking agencies approved the final rules (“Final Rules”) to establish a new comprehensive regulatory capital framework with a phase-in period beginning January 1, 2015 and ending January 1, 2019. The Final Rules implement the third installment of the Basel Accords (“Basel III”) regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) and substantially amended the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to the Company. Basel III redefined the regulatory capital elements and minimum capital ratios, introduced regulatory capital buffers above those minimums, revised rules for calculating risk-weighted assets and added a new component of Tier 1 capital called Common Equity Tier 1, which includes common equity and retained earnings and excludes preferred equity.
In November 2019, the federal banking agencies jointly issued a final rule, which provides for an additional optional, simplified measure of capital adequacy, the community bank leverage ratio framework. The final rule was effective January 1, 2020. Under this framework, the Bank would choose the option of using the community bank leverage ratio (CBLR). In order to qualify, a community banking organization is defined as having less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, a leverage ratio greater than 9%, off-balance sheet exposures of 25% or less of total consolidated assets, and trading assets and liabilities of 5% or less of total consolidated assets. A CBLR bank may opt out of the framework at any time, without restriction, by reverting to the generally applicable risk-based capital rules. The Company chose the CBLR option for calculation of its capital ratio in the first quarter of 2020.
Index
The following table illustrates the Bank’s regulatory ratios and the current adequacy guidelines as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The fully-phased in guidelines applicable on January 1, 2019 are also summarized.
Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company enters into contracts for services in the ordinary course of business that may require payment for services to be provided in the future and may contain penalty clauses for early termination of the contracts. To meet the financing needs of clients, the Company has financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, including commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. The Company does not believe that these off-balance sheet arrangements have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. However, there can be no assurance that such arrangements will not have a future effect.
The following table sets forth our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020.
Purchase obligations primarily related to contracts for software licensing and maintenance and outsourced service providers. Off-balance sheet commitments associated with outstanding letters of credit, commitments to extend credit, and overdraft lines as of December 31, 2020 are summarized below. Since commitments associated with letters of credit and commitments to extend credit may expire unused, the amounts shown do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements.

Critical Accounting Policies
The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contain a discussion of our significant accounting policies, including information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements, our adoption of such policies and the related impact of their adoption. We believe that certain of these policies, along with various estimates that we are required to make in recording our financial transactions, are important to have a complete understanding of our financial position. In addition, these estimates require us to make complex and subjective judgments, many of which include matters with a high degree of uncertainty. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for a discussion of these critical accounting policies and significant estimates.
Liquidity
Liquidity for a bank is the ongoing ability to fund asset growth and business operations, to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals and meet contractual obligations through unconstrained access to funding at reasonable market rates. Liquidity management involves forecasting funding requirements and maintaining sufficient capacity to meet the needs and accommodate fluctuations in asset and liability levels due to changes in our business operations or unanticipated events.
The ability to have readily available funds sufficient to repay fully maturing liabilities is of primary importance to depositors, creditors, and regulators. CWB's available liquidity, represented by cash and amounts due from banks, federal funds sold and non-pledged marketable securities. CWB manages its liquidity risk through operating, investing, and financing activities. In order to ensure funds are available when necessary, on at least a quarterly basis, CWB projects the amount of funds that will be required and strive to maintain relationships with a diversified client base. Liquidity requirements can also be met through short-term borrowings or the disposition of short-term assets. The Company has federal funds borrowing lines at correspondent banks totaling $20.0 million. In addition, loans and securities are pledged to the FHLB providing $81.4 million in available borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2020. Loans pledged to the FRB discount window provided $102.7 million in borrowing capacity. As of December 31, 2020, there were no outstanding borrowings from the FRB.
The Bank has established policies as well as analytical tools to manage liquidity. Proper liquidity management ensures that sufficient funds are available to meet normal operating demands in addition to unexpected customer demand for funds, such as high levels of deposit withdrawals or increased loan demand, in a timely and cost-effective manner. The most important factor in the preservation of liquidity is maintaining public confidence that facilitates the retention and growth of core deposits. Ultimately, public confidence is gained through profitable operations, sound credit quality and a strong capital position. CWB’s liquidity management is viewed from a long-term and short-term perspective, as well as from an asset and liability perspective. Management monitors liquidity through regular reviews of maturity profiles, funding sources and loan and deposit forecasts to minimize funding risk. The Bank has asset/liability committees (“ALCO”) at the Board and Bank management level to review asset/liability management and liquidity issues.
The Company through CWB has a blanket lien credit line with the FHLB. FHLB advances are collateralized in the aggregate by the Company’s eligible loans and securities. Total FHLB advances were $105.0 million and $65.0 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, borrowed at fixed rates. At December 31, 2020, CWB had pledged to FHLB, securities of $18.9 million at carrying value and loans of $304.7 million. At December 31, 2019, the Company had pledged to FHLB, securities of $25.6 million at carrying value and loans of $324.2 million, and had $60.5 million available for additional borrowing.
The Company has established a credit line with the FRB. Advances are collateralized in the aggregate by eligible loans. There were no advances outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and unused borrowing capacity was $102.7 million.
The Company also maintains federal funds purchased lines with a total borrowing capacity of $20.0 million. There was no amount outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
The Company has not experienced disintermediation and does not believe this is a likely occurrence, although there is significant competition for core deposits. The liquidity ratio of the Bank was 14% and 15%, at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The Bank’s liquidity ratio fluctuates in conjunction with loan funding demands. The liquidity ratio consists of the sum of cash and due from banks, deposits in other financial institutions, available for sale investments, federal funds sold and loans held for sale, divided by total assets.
As a legal entity, separate and distinct from the Bank, CWBC must rely on its own resources for its liquidity. CWBC’s routine funding requirements primarily consisted of certain operating expenses, common stock dividends and interest payments on the other borrowings. CWBC obtains funding to meet its obligations from dividends collected from CWB and fees charged for services provided to CWB and has the capability to issue equity and debt securities. Federal banking laws and regulatory requirements regulate the amount of dividends that may be paid by a banking subsidiary without prior approval.
Interest Rate Risk
The Company is exposed to different types of interest rate risks. These risks include lag, repricing, basis, and prepayment risk.
Index
Lag risk results from the inherent timing difference between the repricing of the Company’s adjustable-rate assets and liabilities. For instance, certain loans tied to the prime rate index may only reprice on a quarterly basis. This lag can produce some short-term volatility, particularly in times of numerous prime rate changes.
Repricing risk is caused by the mismatch in the maturities or repricing periods between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. If CWB was perfectly matched, the net interest margin would expand during rising rate periods and contract during falling rate periods. This happens because loans tend to reprice more quickly than funding sources.
Basis risk is due to item pricing tied to different indices which tend to react differently. CWB’s variable products are mainly priced off the treasury and prime rates.
Prepayment risk results from borrowers paying down or paying off their loans prior to maturity. Prepayments on fixed-rate products increase in falling interest rate environments and decrease in rising interest rate environments. A majority of CWB’s loans have adjustable rates and are reset based on changes in the treasury and prime rates.
The Company’s ability to originate, purchase and sell loans is also significantly impacted by changes in interest rates. In addition, increases in interest rates may reduce the amount of loan and commitment fees received by CWB.
Management of Interest Rate Risk
To mitigate the impact of changes in market interest rates on the Company’s interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the amounts and maturities are actively managed. Short-term, adjustable-rate assets are generally retained as they have similar repricing characteristics as funding sources. CWB can sell a portion of its FSA and SBA loan originations. While the Company has some interest rate exposure in excess of five years, it has internal policy limits designed to minimize risk should interest rates rise. The Company has not used derivative instruments to help manage risk, but will consider such instruments in the future if the perceived need should arise.
