Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with Item 1A and the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes thereto for the period ended June 30, 2021 included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K are qualified by the cautionary statement included under the sub-heading, “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Information,” at the beginning of this Form 10-K.
Overview
The Hain Celestial Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (collectively, along with its subsidiaries, the “Company,” and herein referred to as “Hain Celestial,” “we,” “us” and “our”), was founded in 1993 and is headquartered in Lake Success, New York. The Company’s mission has continued to evolve since its founding, with health and wellness being the core tenet. The Company continues to be a leading marketer, manufacturer and seller of organic and natural, “better-for-you” products by anticipating and exceeding consumer expectations in providing quality, innovation, value and convenience. The Company is committed to growing sustainably while continuing to implement environmentally sound business practices and manufacturing processes. Hain Celestial sells its products through specialty and natural food distributors, supermarkets, natural food stores, mass-market and e-commerce retailers, food service channels and club, drug and convenience stores in over 80 countries worldwide.
The Company manufactures, markets, distributes and sells organic and natural products under brand names that are sold as “better-for-you” products, providing consumers with the opportunity to lead A Healthier Way of Life®. Hain Celestial is a leader in many organic and natural product categories, with many recognized brands in the various market categories it serves, including Celestial Seasonings®, Clarks™, Cully & Sully®, Earth’s Best®, Ella’s Kitchen®, Frank Cooper’s®, Gale’s®, Garden of Eatin’®, Hain Pure Foods®, Hartley’s®, Health Valley®, Imagine®, Joya®, Lima®, Linda McCartney’s® (under license), MaraNatha®, Natumi®, New Covent Garden Soup Co.®, Robertson’s®, Rose’s® (under license), Sensible Portions®, Spectrum®, Sun-Pat®, Terra®, The Greek Gods®, Yorkshire Provender® and Yves Veggie Cuisine®. The Company’s personal care products are marketed under the Alba Botanica®, Avalon Organics®, JASON®, Live Clean®, and Queen Helene® brands.
The Company continues to execute the four key pillars of its strategy to: (1) simplify its portfolio; (2) strengthen its capabilities; (3) expand profit margins and cash flow; and (4) reinvigorate profitable topline growth. The Company has executed this strategy, with a focus on discontinuing uneconomic investment, realigning resources to coincide with brand importance, reducing unproductive stock-keeping units (“SKUs”) and brands and reassessing current pricing architecture. As part of this initiative, the Company reviewed its product portfolio within North America and divided it into “Get Bigger” and “Get Better” brand categories.
The Company’s “Get Bigger” brands represent its strongest brands with higher margins, which compete in categories with strong growth potential. The Company has concentrated its investment in marketing, innovation and other resources to prioritize spending for these brands, in an effort to reinvigorate profitable topline growth, optimize assortment and increase share of distribution.
The Company’s “Get Better” brands are the brands in which the Company is primarily focused on simplification and expansion of profit margin. Some of these brands have historically been low margin, non-strategic brands that added complexity with minimal benefit to the Company’s operations.
As part of the Company’s overall strategy, the Company may seek to dispose of businesses and brands that are less profitable or are otherwise less of a strategic fit within our core portfolio. During fiscal 2019, the Company divested its Hain Pure Protein reportable segment and its WestSoy® tofu, seitan and tempeh businesses. In fiscal 2020, the Company divested its Tilda business and its Arrowhead Mills®, SunSpire®, Europe's Best®, Casbah®, Rudi’s Gluten-Free Bakery™, Rudi’s Organic Bakery® and Fountain of Truth™ brands. In fiscal 2021, the Company divested its Danival® business, its United Kingdom fruit and fruit juice businesses (“Fruit”), primarily consisting of the Orchard House® Foods Limited business and associated brands, and its WestSoy®, Dream® and GG UniqueFiber® brands.
COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a net increase in overall demand for our products. The impact was particularly pronounced during the early stages of the pandemic as consumers reacted to stay-at-home measures and the uncertainty of the pandemic. The pandemic-driven demand for our products has subsided as effective vaccines have become available,
governments have eased safety measures and consumer purchasing behaviors have started to return to pre-pandemic norms. Our net sales during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 through the second quarter of fiscal 2021 benefited from pandemic-driven demand, and as a result net sales were lower in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2021 compared to the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2020, respectively.
Despite normalizing consumer demand in recent quarters, the pandemic continues to create near-term and longer-term challenges and uncertainty as we continue our commitment to supporting the global response to the crisis. Effective vaccines for COVID-19 have not yet allowed a return to normal economic activity and business operations, and the presence of new variants and increasing case figures in many countries create additional uncertainty about the duration and extent of the impact from the pandemic. The pandemic and the measures being taken by governments, businesses and consumers to limit the spread of COVID-19 have led to operational challenges in our business and may result in broader and longer-term challenges and uncertainty that we will need to manage successfully. Such challenges include but are not limited to:
•manufacturing and supply chain challenges resulting from health and safety precautions among our employees and the general population as well as macroeconomic factors resulting from the pandemic, including labor market shortages;
•an uncertain future demand environment as a result of changing consumer behaviors amid uncertain economic conditions; and
•increased costs of operating our business and managing our supply chain during a global pandemic.
Productivity and Transformation Initiatives
One of the key pillars of the Company’s strategy seeks to identify areas of operating efficiencies and cost savings to expand profit margins and cash flow. In furtherance of this key pillar, we have undertaken multiple productivity and transformation initiatives, including (1) consolidating certain of the Company’s manufacturing plants, (2) implementing broader supply chain operational improvements, (3) integrating the operations of our U.S. and Canadian businesses, (4) product rationalization initiatives which are aimed at eliminating slow moving SKUs and (5) outsourcing certain functions in our North American business, including order management, billing, accounts receivable and accounts payable, to third-party service providers and the associated implementation of new procurement technology solutions.
We incur costs as part of these productivity and transformation initiatives with the objective of obtaining longer term operating efficiencies and cost savings. The costs include consulting and severance costs, moving and shut-down costs and other costs associated with carrying out the initiatives. The Company will continue to carry out the existing productivity initiatives as well as additional initiatives under this strategy in fiscal 2022.
Discontinued Operations
On August 27, 2019, the Company and Ebro Foods S.A. (the “Purchaser”) entered into, and consummated the transactions contemplated by, an agreement relating to the sale and purchase of the Tilda Group Entities and certain other assets. The Company sold the entities comprising its Tilda operating segment and certain other assets of the Tilda business to the Purchaser for an aggregate price of $341.8 million.
On February 15, 2019, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of the assets used primarily for the Plainville Farms business, a component of the Company’s Hain Pure Protein Corporation (“HPPC”) operating segment. On June 28, 2019, the Company completed the sale of the remainder of HPPC and Empire Kosher which included the FreeBird and Empire Kosher businesses. These dispositions were undertaken to reduce complexity in the Company’s operations and simplify the Company’s brand portfolio, in addition to allowing additional flexibility to focus on opportunities for growth and innovation in the Company’s more profitable and faster growing core businesses. Collectively, these dispositions were reported in the aggregate as the Hain Pure Protein reportable segment.
These dispositions represented strategic shifts that had a major impact on the Company’s operations and financial results and therefore, the Company is presenting the operating results and cash flows of the Tilda operating segment and the Hain Pure Protein reportable segment within discontinued operations in the current and prior periods. See Note 5, Dispositions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
Results of Operations
Comparison of Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2021 to Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2020
Consolidated Results
The following table compares our results of operations, including as a percentage of net sales, on a consolidated basis, for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 (amounts in thousands, other than percentages which may not add due to rounding):
* Percentage is not meaningful due to a comparison of a positive figure and a negative figure.
Net Sales
Net sales in fiscal 2021 were $1.97 billion, a decrease of $83.6 million, or 4.1%, from net sales of $2.05 billion in fiscal 2020 as a result of a decrease in sales in both the North America and the International reportable segments. On a constant currency basis, adjusted for the impact of divestitures and discontinued brands, net sales decreased approximately 0.6% from the prior comparable period. On an adjusted basis, net sales decreased in the North America reportable segment and was partially offset by an increase in the International reportable segment. Further details of changes in adjusted net sales by segment are provided below in the Segment Results section.
Gross Profit
Gross profit in fiscal 2021 was $491.6 million, an increase of $25.8 million, or 5.5%, from gross profit of $465.8 million in fiscal 2020. Gross profit margin was 25.0% of net sales, compared to 22.7% in the prior year. The increase in gross profit margin was mainly driven by the International reportable segment as a result of lower costs of goods sold stemming from the Fruit business divestiture in the current fiscal year, lower trade spend and cost savings due to supply chain efficiencies which resulted in a lower cost of sales as a percentage of revenue. In addition, the gross profit margin improved in the North America reportable segment as a result of our productivity and transformation initiatives.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $299.1 million in fiscal 2021, a decrease of $25.3 million, or 7.8%, from $324.4 million in fiscal 2020. The decrease was mainly due to reduced expenses in the North America reportable segment in the amount of $26.9 million. The decrease in the North America reportable segment was due to (1) lower broker trade expense which was a result of lower net sales, (2) lower salaries and benefits which was primarily a result of the reorganization which resulted in headcount reductions that occurred throughout fiscal 2020 for which we are now seeing the benefits, (3) headcount reductions due to divestitures, (4) lower marketing expense due to a decrease in consumer advertising and public relations, (5) lower bonus expense, and (6) lower outside service expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was 15.2% in the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 compared to 15.8% in the prior year, attributable to the aforementioned items.
Amortization of Acquired Intangibles
Amortization of acquired intangibles was $8.9 million in fiscal 2021, a decrease of $2.7 million, or 23.3%, from $11.6 million in fiscal 2020. The decrease was due to the elimination of the United Kingdom Fruit business intangible amortization since the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and finite-lived intangibles from historical acquisitions becoming fully amortized or impaired during fiscal year 2020, partially offset by amortization as a result of certain indefinite-lived intangibles reclassified to finite-lived intangibles during the first quarter of fiscal 2021.
Productivity and Transformation Costs
Productivity and transformation costs were $18.9 million in fiscal 2021, a decrease of $29.9 million or 61.3% from $48.8 million in fiscal 2020. The decrease was due to lower consulting fees, severance costs, and other costs incurred in connection with the Company’s productivity and transformation initiatives in fiscal 2021.
Proceeds from Insurance Claims
During fiscal year 2021, the Company received $0.6 million as payment from an insurance claim related to a litigation described in Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies. In July of 2019, the Company received $7.0 million as partial payment from an insurance claim relating to business disruption costs associated with a co-packer. Of this amount, $4.5 million was recognized in fiscal 2019 as it related to reimbursement of costs already incurred, with the remaining $2.5 million recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
Long-Lived Asset and Intangibles Impairment
During fiscal year 2021, the Company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $57.9 million, of which $56.1 million related to the reserve recorded against the assets of the Company's United Kingdom Fruit business (see Note 5, Dispositions, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K) and $1.6 million related to impairment of property, plant and equipment and other non-current assets. During fiscal year 2020, the Company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $27.5 million of which (1) $9.5 million ($4.0 million related to the North America reportable segment and $5.5 million related to the International reportable segment) related to certain tradenames of the Company, (2) $4.5 million related to customer relationships of certain brand divestitures within the North America reportable segment and (3) $12.3 million related to a write-down of certain machinery and equipment in the United States and Europe used to manufacture certain slow moving or low margin SKUs and the write-down of buildings, machinery and equipment related to the sale of our Danival business.
Operating Income
Operating income in fiscal 2021 was $107.4 million compared to operating income of $56.0 million in fiscal 2020 due to the items described above.
Interest and Other Financing Expense, Net
Interest and other financing expense, net totaled $8.7 million in fiscal 2021, a decrease of $9.6 million, or 52.6%, from $18.3 million in the prior year. The decrease resulted primarily from lower interest expense in fiscal 2021 from lower outstanding debt and lower variable interest rates on the portion of the debt not hedged by derivatives. See Note 11, Debt and Borrowings, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Other (Income) Expense, Net
Other income, net totaled $10.1 million in fiscal 2021, an increase of $14.0 million from other expense, net of $4.0 million in the prior year. The change from expense to income was primarily attributable to a gain on sale of assets and businesses in fiscal 2021 of $11.1 million and a $2.8 million gain primarily related to foreign currency movements on the remeasurement of foreign currency balances in fiscal 2021 compared with respective losses in fiscal 2020.
Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes and Equity in Net Loss of Equity-Method Investees
Income before income taxes and equity in the net loss of our equity-method investees for fiscal 2021 was $108.8 million compared to $33.8 million in fiscal 2020. The increase was due to the items discussed above.
Provision for Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes includes federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. Our income tax expense from continuing operations was $41.1 million and $6.2 million for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively.
On March 27, 2020, H.R. 748, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) was signed into legislation which included business tax provisions that impacted taxes related to 2018, 2019 and 2020. Under the CARES Act, the Company carried back net operating losses generated in the June 30, 2019 tax year for five years, resulting in a net income tax benefit of $11.2 million. The $11.2 million income tax benefit represents the federal rate differential between 35% and 21%, net of a reserve under Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) 740-10 and excludes the indirect tax benefit of $6.7 million related to discontinued operations. The Company recorded a tax refund receivable of $52.5 million which was included as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2020. The Company received the tax refund, along with $1.3 million of interest, during fiscal year 2021.
The effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 37.8% and 18.3% of pre-tax income for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The effective income tax rate from continuing operations for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 was primarily impacted by various discrete items including the tax impact of the Fruit business impairment and disposal, and the enacted change in the United Kingdom’s corporate income tax rate from 19% to 25%.
The effective income tax rate from continuing operations for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 was primarily impacted by the geographical mix of earnings, state taxes, provisions in the CARES Act, global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) and limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation.
Our effective tax rate may change from period-to-period based on recurring and non-recurring factors including the geographical mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state and local income taxes and tax audit settlements.
See Note 12, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
Equity in Net Loss of Equity-Method Investees
Our equity in the net loss from our equity method investments for fiscal 2021 was $1.6 million compared to $2.0 million for fiscal 2020. See Note 15, Investments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Net Income from Continuing Operations
Net income from continuing operations for fiscal 2021 was $66.1 million compared to net income of $25.6 million for fiscal 2020. Net income per diluted share was $0.65 in fiscal 2021 compared to net income per diluted share of $0.25 in fiscal 2020. The increase was attributable to the factors noted above.
Net Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax
Net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, for fiscal 2021 was income of $11.3 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $106.0 million or $1.02 per diluted share for fiscal 2020.
During the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, the Company recognized a $11.3 million adjustment to the Tilda business primarily related to the recognition of a deferred tax benefit. Net loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 included a reclassification of $95.1 million of cumulative translation losses from Accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the Tilda business' discontinued operations. The income tax expense from discontinued operations of $13.5 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 was impacted by $15.3 million of tax related to the tax gain on the sale of the Tilda entities. See Note 5, Dispositions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Net Income (Loss)
Net income for fiscal 2021 was $77.4 million compared to net loss of $80.4 million for fiscal 2020. Net income per diluted share was $0.76 in fiscal 2021 compared to net loss per diluted share of $0.77 in 2020. The change was attributable to the factors noted above.
Adjusted EBITDA
Our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA was $258.9 million and $200.0 million for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, as a result of the factors discussed above. See Reconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures to U.S. GAAP Measures following the discussion of our results of operations for definitions and a reconciliation of our net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA.
Segment Results
The following table provides a summary of net sales and operating income (loss) by reportable segment for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020:
North America
Our net sales in the North America reportable segment for fiscal 2021 were $1.10 billion, a decrease of $67.4 million, or 5.7%, from net sales of $1.17 billion in fiscal 2020. On a constant currency basis, adjusted for the impact of divestitures and discontinued brands, net sales decreased by 1.7%. The decrease of 1.7% was mainly due to lower sales in the current year compared to the prior year driven by higher at-home food consumption and hand sanitizer purchases in the prior year as a result of stay-at-home orders at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the Company had a large program with a wholesale club in fiscal 2020 which did not recur in fiscal 2021. Further, sales were lower in the current year due to the impact of the prior year SKU rationalization, which reduced or eliminated sales related to those SKUs in the current year. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in snacks and tea in fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020. Operating income in North America in fiscal 2021 was $129.0 million, an increase of $33.1 million, or 34.5%, from $95.9 million in fiscal 2020. The increase was driven by a favorable product mix, lower selling, general and administrative expenses and supply chain cost efficiencies gained with the Company's productivity and transformation initiatives, partially offset by lower net sales in 2021.
International
Net sales in the International reportable segment for fiscal 2021 were $866.2 million, a decrease of $16.3 million, or 1.8%, from net sales of $882.4 million in fiscal 2020. On a constant currency basis, and adjusted for the impact of divestitures and discontinued brands, net sales increased by 0.8% from fiscal 2020. The increase in adjusted net sales was due to sustained demand from the prior year with additional growth in the current year from our plant-based food and beverage products. Operating income in our International reportable segment for fiscal 2021 was $38.0 million, a decrease of $17.3 million, or 31.3%, from $55.3 million in fiscal 2020. The decrease in operating income was mainly due to an impairment loss recorded for the Fruit business amounting to $56.0 million, partially offset by improved gross profit of $28.0 million mainly due to product mix and benefits realized from our productivity initiatives in fiscal 2021 when compared with fiscal 2020.
Corporate and Other
Our Corporate and Other category consists of expenses related to the Company’s centralized administrative functions, which do not specifically relate to an operating segment. Such Corporate and Other expenses are comprised mainly of compensation and related expenses of certain of the Company’s senior executive officers and other employees who perform duties related to our entire enterprise as well as expenses for certain professional fees, facilities, and other items which benefit the Company as a whole. Our Corporate and Other expenses for fiscal 2021 were $59.7 million, a decrease of $35.6 million or 37.3%, from $95.2 million in fiscal 2020. This change was primarily related to a decrease in productivity and transformation costs included in Corporate and Other, which were $10.6 million for fiscal 2021, a decrease of $22.1 million, from $32.7 million for fiscal 2020. Additionally, included in fiscal 2020 was a tradename impairment charge of $9.5 million which did not recur in fiscal 2021. These decreases were offset in part by additional retirement plan expense of $1.1 million in fiscal 2021 as a result of a higher employer match into the defined contribution plan.
Refer to Note 21, Segment Information, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional details.
Comparison of Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2020 to Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2019
Consolidated Results
The following table compares our results of operations, including as a percentage of net sales, on a consolidated basis, for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 (amounts in thousands, other than percentages which may not add due to rounding):
* Percentage is not meaningful due to a comparison of a positive figure and a negative figure or due to the baseline figure being zero.
Net Sales
Net sales in fiscal 2020 were $2.05 billion, a decrease of $50.7 million, or 2.4%, from net sales of $2.10 billion in fiscal 2019. Foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted net sales by $27.5 million as compared to the prior year. On a constant currency basis, net sales decreased approximately 1.1% from the prior year. Net sales decreased across both our North America and International reportable segments, primarily driven by the strategic decision to no longer support certain lower margin and unprofitable SKUs, a reduction in net sales in relation to divested brands and a decline in our United Kingdom Fruit business as a result of the impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. Further details of changes in net sales by segment are provided below.
Gross Profit
Gross profit in fiscal 2020 was $465.8 million, an increase of $67.3 million, or 16.9%, from gross profit of $398.5 million in fiscal 2019. Gross profit margin was 22.7%, an increase of 380 basis points from the prior year. This increase was driven by a
favorable product mix as well as cost savings from the Company’s productivity and transformation initiatives. The year-over-year increase was further due to an inventory write-down of $12.4 million in fiscal 2019, which did not recur in fiscal 2020, in connection with the discontinuance of slow moving SKUs primarily in the United States as part of a product rationalization initiative and increased freight and commodity costs in fiscal 2019 primarily in the United States operating segment.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $324.4 million in fiscal 2020, an increase of $10.4 million, or 3.3%, from $314.0 million in fiscal 2019. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher marketing and advertising spend as well as higher variable compensation costs in fiscal 2020. Variable compensation costs include stock-based compensation expense, which was higher in fiscal 2020 primarily due to the reversal in the prior year of previously accrued amounts under certain performance-based incentive plans of which achievement was no longer probable. See Note 14, Stock-based Compensation and Incentive Performance Plans, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was 15.8% in fiscal 2020 and 14.9% in the prior year, an increase of 90 basis points, primarily attributable to the aforementioned items.
Amortization of Acquired Intangibles
Amortization of acquired intangibles was $11.6 million in fiscal 2020, a decrease of $1.5 million, or 11.4%, from $13.1 million in fiscal 2019. The decrease was due to finite-lived intangibles from certain historical acquisitions becoming fully amortized subsequent to June 30, 2019 as well as impairment of certain finite-lived intangibles taken during fiscal year 2020.
Productivity and Transformation Costs
Productivity and transformation costs were $48.8 million in fiscal 2020, an increase of $8.7 million from $40.1 million in fiscal 2019. The increase was primarily due to increased North America integration costs incurred in connection with the Company’s productivity and transformation initiative as well as increased severance costs in fiscal year 2020 as compared to the prior year.
Former Chief Executive Officer Succession Plan Expense, Net
On June 24, 2018, the Company entered into a succession plan, whereby the Company’s former CEO, Irwin D. Simon, agreed to terminate his employment with the Company upon the hiring of a new CEO. Net costs and expenses associated with the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer succession plan were $30.2 million in fiscal 2019 compared with no expense incurred in fiscal year 2020. See Note 3, Former Chief Executive Officer Succession Plan, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Proceeds from Insurance Claims
In July of 2019, the Company received $7.0 million as partial payment from an insurance claim relating to business disruption costs associated with a co-packer. Of this amount, $4.5 million was recognized in fiscal 2019 as it related to reimbursement of costs already incurred, with the remaining $2.5 million recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. The Company recorded an additional $0.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
Accounting Review and Remediation Costs, Net of Insurance Proceeds
Costs and expenses associated with the internal accounting review, remediation and other related matters were $4.3 million in fiscal 2019, compared to no expense incurred in fiscal 2020. Included in accounting review and remediation costs for fiscal 2019 were insurance proceeds of $0.2 million related to the reimbursement of costs incurred as part of the internal accounting review and the independent review by the Audit Committee and other related matters.
Long-lived Asset and Intangibles Impairment
During fiscal 2020, the Company recorded $27.5 million of long-lived asset and intangibles impairment charges. This included a pre-tax impairment charge of $9.5 million ($4.0 million related to the North America reportable segment and $5.5 million related to the International reportable segment) related to certain tradenames of the Company. The Company also recorded $4.5 million of pre-tax impairment charges relating to customer relationships of certain brand divestitures within the North America reportable segment. Additionally, during fiscal 2020, the Company recorded a $12.3 million non-cash impairment charge primarily related to a write-down of certain machinery and equipment in the United States and Europe used to manufacture certain slow moving or low margin SKUs and the write-down of buildings, machinery and equipment related to the sale of our Danival business.
During fiscal 2019, the Company recorded $33.7 million of long-lived asset and intangibles impairment charges. This included a pre-tax impairment charge of $17.9 million ($15.1 million related to the North America reportable segment and $2.8 million related to the International reportable segment) related to certain tradenames of the Company. Additionally, the Company recorded $6.1 million of non-cash impairment charges primarily related to the Company’s decision to consolidate manufacturing of certain fruit-based products in the United Kingdom. Moreover, the Company recorded a $9.7 million non-cash impairment charge to write down the value of certain machinery and equipment no longer in use in the United States and United Kingdom, some of which was used to manufacture certain slow moving SKUs that were discontinued.
See Note 7, Property, Plant and Equipment, Net and Note 9, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for details regarding the aforementioned impairment charges.
Operating Income (Loss)
Operating income in fiscal 2020 was $56.0 million compared to operating loss of $32.5 million in fiscal 2019. The increase from operating loss to operating income in fiscal 2020 resulted from the items described above.
Interest and Other Financing Expense, Net
Interest and other financing expense, net totaled $18.3 million in fiscal 2020, a decrease of $4.3 million, or 18.9%, from $22.5 million in the prior year. The decrease in interest and other financing expense, net resulted primarily from lower interest expense related to our revolving credit facility as a result of lower variable interest rates and a lower balance of borrowings outstanding during fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019. See Note 11, Debt and Borrowings, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Other Expense, Net
Other expense, net totaled $4.0 million in fiscal 2020, an increase of $3.0 million from $1.0 million in the prior year. The increase in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 resulted from losses related to the sale of the Arrowhead, SunSpire and Rudi’s businesses, partially offset by higher net unrealized foreign currency gains due to the effect of foreign currency movements on the remeasurement of foreign currency denominated loans.
Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes and Equity in Net Loss of Equity-Method Investees
Income before income taxes and equity in the net loss of our equity-method investees for fiscal 2020 was $33.8 million compared to loss of $56.0 million in fiscal 2019. The increase was due to the items discussed above.
Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes
The provision (benefit) for income taxes includes federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. Our income tax from continuing operations was an expense of $6.2 million and a benefit of $3.2 million for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively.
On March 27, 2020, H.R. 748, the CARES Act was signed into legislation which includes business tax provisions that impacted taxes related to 2018, 2019 and 2020. Some of the significant tax law changes in accordance with the CARES Act were to increase the limitation on deductible business interest expense for 2019 and 2020, allow for the five-year carryback of net operating losses for 2018-2020, suspend the 80% limitation of taxable income for net operating loss carryforwards for 2018-2020, provide for the acceleration of depreciation expense from 2018 and forward on qualified improvement property, and accelerate the ability to claim refunds of Alternative Minimum Tax (“AMT”) credit carryforwards. The Company carried
back net operating losses generated in the June 30, 2019 tax year for five years, resulting in a net income tax benefit of $11.2 million. The $11.2 million income tax benefit represents the federal rate differential between 35% and 21%, net of a reserve under ASC 740-10 and excludes the indirect tax benefit of $6.7 million related to discontinued operations. The Company recorded a tax refund receivable of $52.5 million which was included as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2020.
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), which significantly revised the ongoing U.S. corporate income tax law by lowering the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, implementing a territorial tax system, imposing a one-time tax on foreign unremitted earnings and setting limitations on deductibility of certain costs (e.g., interest expense and executive compensation), among other things.
In accordance with SAB No. 118, the SEC's staff accounting bulletin issued to address complexities involved in accounting for the Tax Act, the Company finalized the tax effects of the Tax Act during fiscal 2019. The Company recorded additional tax expense of $6.8 million related to its transition tax liability due to finalizing the Company’s foreign earnings and profits study. The net increase reflected newly issued tax laws, regulations, and notices from the U.S. Department of Treasury and Internal Revenue Service tax authorities. The adjustment of the Company’s provisional tax expense was recorded as a change in estimate in accordance with SAB No. 118.
The Tax Act also includes a provision to tax GILTI of foreign subsidiaries. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Staff Q&A Topic No. 5, Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, states that an entity can make an accounting policy election either to recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences that are expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or provide for the tax expense related to GILTI resulting from those items in the year the tax is incurred. The Company has elected to recognize the resulting tax on GILTI as a period expense in the period the tax is incurred. The Company has computed the impact on our effective tax rate on a discrete basis.
The effective income tax rate from continuing operations was expense of 18.3% and a benefit of 5.8% of pre-tax income for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The effective income tax rate from continuing operations for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020 was primarily impacted by the geographical mix of earnings, state taxes, provisions in the CARES Act, GILTI and limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation.
The effective income tax rate from continuing operations for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 was primarily impacted by the Tax Act’s lowering of the corporate tax rate, the geographical mix of earnings, state taxes, GILTI, finalization of the transition tax liability, and limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation. The effective income tax rate was also impacted by a net increase in the Company’s valuation allowance primarily related to the Company’s state deferred tax assets and state net operating loss carryforwards.
Our effective tax rate may change from period-to-period based on recurring and non-recurring factors including the geographical mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state and local income taxes and tax audit settlements.
See Note 12, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
Equity in Net Loss of Equity-Method Investees
Our equity in the net loss from our equity method investments for fiscal 2020 was $2.0 million compared to equity in net loss of $0.7 million for fiscal 2019. See Note 15, Investments, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Net Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations
Net income from continuing operations for fiscal 2020 was $25.6 million compared to net loss of $53.4 million for fiscal 2019. Net income per diluted share was $0.25 in fiscal 2020 compared to net loss per diluted share of $0.51 in fiscal 2019. The decrease was attributable to the factors noted above.
Net Loss from Discontinued Operations
Net loss from discontinued operations for fiscal 2020 and 2019 was $106.0 million and $129.9 million, respectively, or $1.02 and $1.25 per diluted share, respectively. The net loss from discontinued operations for fiscal 2020 included a reclassification of $95.1 million of cumulative translation losses from Accumulated comprehensive loss related to the Tilda business to discontinued operations, while in fiscal 2019 net loss from discontinued operations was primarily attributable to asset impairment charges of $109.3 million and losses on sale in connection with the disposition of the Plainville Farms and HPPC businesses of $40.2 million and $0.6 million, respectively. See Note 5, Dispositions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Net Loss
Net loss for fiscal 2020 was $80.4 million compared to net loss of $183.3 million for fiscal 2019. Net loss per diluted share was $0.77 in fiscal 2020 compared to net loss per diluted share of $1.76 in 2019. The change was attributable to the factors noted above.
Adjusted EBITDA
Our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA was $200.0 million and $165.1 million for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively, as a result of the factors discussed above. See Reconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures to U.S. GAAP Measures following the discussion of our results of operations for definitions and a reconciliation of our net loss to Adjusted EBITDA.
Segment Results
The following table provides a summary of net sales and operating income by reportable segment for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019:
North America
Our net sales in the North America reportable segment in fiscal 2020 were $1.17 billion, a decrease of $24.5 million, or 2.0%, from net sales of $1.20 billion in fiscal 2019. The decrease in net sales was primarily driven by the strategic decision to no longer support certain lower margin SKUs in order to reduce complexity and increase gross margins as well as a reduction in net sales in relation to divested brands such as our Rudi’s business, Arrowhead Mills®, Europe’s Best® and WestSoy®, partially offset by increased overall demand for our products in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic during the second half of fiscal 2020. Operating income in North America in fiscal 2020 was $95.9 million, an increase of $63.3 million, or 193.5%, from $32.7 million in fiscal 2019. The increase in operating income was the result of increased gross profit in the United States driven by a favorable product mix due to our efforts under the “Get Bigger” and “Get Better” strategy for our brands, efficient trade spending and supply chain cost reductions in the United States as well as other productivity savings, offset in part by increased marketing and advertising expense and variable compensation.
International
Our net sales in the International reportable segment in fiscal 2020 were $882.4 million, an decrease of $26.2 million, or 2.9%, from net sales of $908.6 million in fiscal 2019. On a constant currency basis, net sales decreased 0.1% from the prior year primarily due to a decline in our United Kingdom Fruit business as a result of impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and discontinued sales of unprofitable SKUs, partially offset by growth in our plant-based food and beverage products. Operating income in our International reportable segment for fiscal 2020 was $55.3 million, a decrease of $3.5 million, or 5.9%, from $58.8 million in fiscal 2019. Excluding the impact of foreign currency movements of $1.8 million, operating income decreased 2.8% for fiscal 2020, compared to the prior year, due to reductions in sales of certain fruit-based products and non-cash impairment charges primarily related to a write-down of certain machinery and equipment in Europe, offset in part by increased gross profit driven by a favorable product mix and increased overall demand for our products in reaction to COVID-19 in Europe.
Corporate and Other
Our Corporate and Other category consists of expenses related to the Company’s centralized administrative functions, which do not specifically relate to an operating segment. Corporate and Other expenses are comprised mainly of the compensation and related expenses of certain of the Company’s senior executive officers and other employees who perform duties related to our entire enterprise, as well as expenses for certain professional fees, facilities and other items which benefit the Company as a whole. Additionally, productivity and transformation costs, tradename impairment charges and proceeds from insurance claim included within Corporate and Other expenses were $32.7 million, $9.5 million and $3.0 million, respectively, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. Former Chief Executive Officer Succession Plan expense, net, Productivity and transformation costs and Accounting review and remediation costs, net of insurance proceeds included within Corporate and Other expenses were $30.2 million, $28.4 million and $4.3 million, respectively, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019.
Refer to Note 21, Segment Information, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional details.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We finance our operations and growth primarily with the cash flows we generate from our operations and from borrowings available to us under our Amended Credit Agreement. See Note 11, Debt and Borrowings, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Our cash and cash equivalents balance increased by $38.1 million at June 30, 2021 to $75.9 million compared to $37.8 million at June 30, 2020. Our working capital, which excludes current assets and current liabilities of discontinued operations, was $284.7 million at June 30, 2021, an increase of $28.9 million from $255.9 million at the end of fiscal 2020.
Liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of the Company’s business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets. Our cash balances are held in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Europe, Middle East, and India. As of June 30, 2021, all of the Company’s total cash balance was held outside of the United States. The Company historically considered the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested. To achieve its cash management objectives, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company reversed its reinvestment assertion for certain international locations representing $93.4 million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The Company continues to reinvest $732.1 million of undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries and may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes if it reverses its indefinite reinvestment assertion on these foreign earnings in the future.
We maintain our cash and cash equivalents primarily in money market funds or their equivalent. As of June 30, 2021, all of our investments were expected to mature in less than three months. Accordingly, we do not believe that our investments have significant exposure to interest rate risk. Cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities is summarized below.
Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $196.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, compared to $156.9 million in fiscal 2020 and $39.3 million in fiscal 2019. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 resulted primarily from an improvement of $32.8 million in net income adjusted for non-cash charges and due to an increase of $7.0 million of cash provided by working capital accounts. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 resulted primarily from an improvement of $141.5 million in net income adjusted for non-cash charges, offset in part by an increase of $23.9 million of cash used in working capital accounts. The increase in working capital in fiscal 2020 was mainly due to a tax refund receivable of $52.5 million (included as a component of Other current assets in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows) resulting from carryback of net operating losses (“NOLs”) under the CARES Act.
Cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $2.4 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, a decrease of $42.8 million from $45.1 million in fiscal 2020 primarily due to proceeds of $10.4 million and $58.8 million from the sale of assets and businesses, respectively, partially offset by increased capital expenditures. Cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $45.1 million for fiscal 2020, a decrease of $23.5 million from $68.6 million in fiscal 2019 primarily due to proceeds of $15.8 million from brand divestitures and other investing activities and decreased capital expenditures.
Cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $162.4 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 and included $50.0 million of net repayments of our revolving credit facility and $106.1 million of share repurchases. Cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $104.5 million for fiscal 2020 and primarily included net repayments of $345.9 million on our term loan and revolving credit facility and $60.2 million of share repurchases offset in part by proceeds of $305.6 million from discontinued operations primarily related to the sale of Tilda.
Operating Free Cash Flow from Continuing Operations
Our operating free cash flow was $125.2 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, an increase of $29.2 million from the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. The increase in operating free cash flow primarily resulted from an improvement in net income adjusted for non-cash items of $32.8 million and cash provided within working capital accounts of $7.0 million partially offset by an increase in our capital expenditures of $10.7 million. Refer to the Reconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures to U.S. GAAP Measures following the discussion of our results of operations for definitions and a reconciliation from our net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations to operating free cash flow from continuing operations.
Capital Expenditures
During fiscal 2021, our aggregate capital expenditures used in continuing operations were $71.6 million. We expect to spend approximately 3% to 4% of net sales for capital projects in fiscal 2022.
Share Repurchase Program
On June 21, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $250.0 million of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock. As of June 30, 2021, the Company had $82.4 million of remaining authorization under the 2017 authorization. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, the Company repurchased 3.1 million shares under the repurchase program for a total of $107.4 million, excluding commissions, at an average price of $34.87 per share. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, the Company repurchased 2.6 million shares under the repurchase program for a total of $60.2 million, excluding commissions, at an average price of $23.59 per share. The Company did not repurchase any shares under this program in fiscal 2019.
In August 2021, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved an additional $300 million share repurchase authorization. Share repurchases under the 2021 authorization will commence after the 2017 authorization is fully utilized, at the Company’s discretion.
The extent to which the Company repurchases its shares and the timing of such repurchases will depend upon market conditions and other corporate considerations. Repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, pursuant to pre-set trading plans, in private transactions or otherwise. The authorizations do not have a stated expiration date.
Reconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures to U.S. GAAP Measures
We have included in this report measures of financial performance that are not defined by U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). We believe that these measures provide useful information to investors and include these measures in other communications to investors.
For each of these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences between the non-U.S. GAAP measure and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, an explanation of why our management and Board of Directors believes the non-U.S. GAAP measure provides useful information to investors and any additional purposes for which our management and Board of Directors uses the non-U.S. GAAP measure. These non-U.S. GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, the comparable U.S. GAAP measure.
Constant Currency Presentation
We believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it provides transparency to underlying performance in our consolidated net sales by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on year-to-year comparability given the volatility in foreign currency exchange markets. To present this information for historical periods, current period net sales for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar are translated into U.S. Dollars at the average monthly exchange rates in effect during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, rather than at the actual average monthly exchange rate in effect during the current period of the current fiscal year. As a result, the foreign currency impact is equal to the current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in average foreign currency exchange rate between the current fiscal period and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
Divestitures and Discontinued Brands
We also exclude the impact of divestitures and discontinued brands when comparing net sales to prior periods, which results in the presentation of certain non-U.S. GAAP financial measures. The Company's management believes that excluding the impact of divestitures and discontinued brands when presenting period-over-period results of net sales aids in comparability.
A reconciliation between reported and adjusted net sales decrease in fiscal 2021 is as follows:
A reconciliation between reported and constant currency net sales decrease in fiscal 2020 is as follows:
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before income taxes, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization, impairment of long-lived and intangible assets, equity in the earnings of equity-method investees, stock-based compensation, productivity and transformation costs, and other non-recurring items. The Company’s management believes that this presentation provides useful information to management, analysts and investors regarding certain additional financial and business trends relating to its results of operations and financial condition. In addition, management uses this measure for
reviewing the financial results of the Company and as a component of performance-based executive compensation. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-U.S. GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
We do not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The principal limitation of Adjusted EBITDA is that it excludes certain expenses and income that are required by U.S. GAAP to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is subject to inherent limitations as this metric reflects the exercise of judgment by management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining Adjusted EBITDA. In order to compensate for these limitations, management presents Adjusted EBITDA in connection with U.S. GAAP results.
A reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:
Operating Free Cash Flow from Continuing Operations
In our internal evaluations, we use the non-U.S. GAAP financial measure “operating free cash flow from continuing operations.” The difference between operating free cash flow from continuing operations and cash flow provided by or used in operating activities from continuing operations, which is the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, is that operating free cash flow from continuing operations reflects the impact of capital expenditures. Since capital spending is essential to maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider capital spending when evaluating our cash provided by or used in operating activities. We view operating free cash flow from continuing operations as an important measure because it is one factor in evaluating the amount of cash available for discretionary investments. We do not consider operating free cash flow from continuing operations in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
A reconciliation from Cash flow provided by operating activities to Operating free cash flow is as follows:
Contractual Obligations
Obligations for all debt instruments, finance and operating leases and other contractual obligations as of June 30, 2021 are as follows:
(1)Including principal and interest.
(2)Including interest.
(3)Excludes amounts that may be payable upon termination to co-packers as we are not able to reasonably estimate such amounts.
As of June 30, 2021, we had non-current unrecognized tax benefits of $22.9 million for which we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows. As a result, this amount has not been included in the table above.
We believe that our cash on hand of $75.9 million at June 30, 2021 as well as projected cash flows from operations and availability under our Amended Credit Agreement are sufficient to fund our working capital needs in the ordinary course of business, anticipated fiscal 2022 capital expenditures and other expected cash requirements for at least the next 12 months.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
At June 30, 2021, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K that have had or are likely to have a material current or future effect on our consolidated financial statements.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Practices, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The policies below have been identified as the critical accounting policies we use which require us to make estimates and assumptions and exercise judgment that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods presented. We believe in the quality and reasonableness of our critical accounting estimates; however, materially different amounts might be reported under different conditions or using assumptions, estimates or making judgments different from those that we have applied. Our critical accounting policies, including our methodology for estimates made and assumptions used, are as follows:
Revenue Recognition
The Company sells its products through specialty and natural food distributors, supermarkets, natural foods stores, mass-market and e-commerce retailers, food service channels and club, drug and convenience stores in over 80 countries worldwide. The majority of our revenue contracts represent a single performance obligation related to the fulfillment of customer orders for the purchase of our products. We recognize revenue as performance obligations are fulfilled when control passes to our customers. Our customer contracts typically contain standard terms and conditions. In instances where formal written contracts are not in place we consider the customer purchase orders to be contracts based on the criteria outlined in ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Payment terms and conditions vary by customer and are based on the billing schedule established in our contracts or purchase orders with customers, but we generally provide credit terms to customers ranging from 15-60 days; therefore, we have determined that our contracts do not include a significant financing component.
Sales to customers generally do not include more than one performance obligation. When a contract does contain more than one performance obligation, we allocate the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. The standalone selling price for each distinct good is generally determined by directly observable data.
We have determined that we satisfy our performance obligations related to our customer contracts at a point in time, as opposed to over time, and, accordingly, revenue is recognized at a point in time. Therefore, we do not have any contract balances with our customers recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Sales includes shipping and handling charges billed to the customer and are reported net of discounts, trade promotions and sales incentives, consumer coupon programs and other costs, including estimated allowances for returns, allowances and discounts associated with aged or potentially unsalable product, and prompt pay discounts. Shipping and handling costs are accounted for as a fulfillment activity of our promise to transfer products to our customers and are included in cost of sales line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Variable Consideration
In addition to fixed contract consideration, many of our contracts include some form of variable consideration. We offer various trade promotions and sales incentive programs to customers and consumers, such as price discounts, slotting fees, in-store display incentives, cooperative advertising programs, new product introduction fees and coupons. The expenses associated with these programs are accounted for as reductions to the transaction price of our products and are therefore deducted from our sales to determine reported net sales. Trade promotions and sales incentive accruals are subject to significant management estimates and assumptions. The critical assumptions used in estimating the accruals for trade promotions and sales incentives include management’s estimate of expected levels of performance and redemption rates. Management exercises judgment in developing these assumptions. These assumptions are based upon historical performance of the retailer or distributor customers with similar types of promotions adjusted for current trends. The Company regularly reviews and revises, when deemed necessary, estimates of costs to the Company for these promotions and incentives based on what has been incurred by the customers. The terms of most of our promotion and incentive arrangements do not exceed a year and therefore do not require highly uncertain long-term estimates. Settlement of these liabilities typically occurs in subsequent periods primarily through an authorization process for deductions taken by a customer from amounts otherwise due to the Company. Differences between estimated expense and actual promotion and incentive costs are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. Actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance were to vary from estimates.
Valuation of Accounts and Chargeback Receivable
We perform routine credit evaluations on existing and new customers. We apply reserves for delinquent or uncollectible trade receivables based on a specific identification methodology and also apply an additional reserve based on the experience we have with our trade receivables aging categories. As credit losses have been within our expectations in recent years and as no customers represented more than 10% of accounts receivable, net at June 30, 2021, we believe there is no significant or unusual credit exposure at this time.
Based on cash collection history and other statistical analysis, we estimate the amount of unauthorized deductions that our customers have taken that we expect will be collectible and repaid in the near future and record a chargeback receivable. Differences between estimated collectible receivables and actual collections are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined.
We may not have the same experience with our receivables during different economic conditions, or with changes in business conditions, such as consolidation within the food industry and/or a change in the way we market and sell our products.
Valuation of Long-lived Assets
Fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if impairment exists. If impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but rather are tested at least annually for impairment, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that more likely than not the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit represents an operating segment or a component of an operating segment. Goodwill is tested for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a two-step quantitative test. The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. We may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all reporting units and perform a two-step quantitative impairment test. The estimate of the fair values of our reporting units are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment. We generally use a blended analysis of the present value of discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach. The discounted cash flow model uses the present values of estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and external economic factors in estimating our future cash flows. The assumptions we use in our evaluations include projections of growth rates and profitability, our estimated working capital needs, as well as our weighted average cost of capital. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of a reporting unit based on a comparison to comparable publicly traded firms in similar businesses. Estimates used in the market value approach include the identification of similar companies with comparable business factors. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting the assumptions we made could result in additional goodwill impairment in future periods. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value, goodwill is considered impaired. The amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the “implied” fair value, which is calculated as if the reporting unit had just been acquired and accounted for as a business combination.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of acquired tradenames and trademarks. We first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. We measure the fair value of these assets using the relief from royalty method. This method assumes that the tradenames and trademarks have value to the extent their owner is relieved from paying royalties for the benefits received. We estimate the future revenues for the associated brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital.
The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, in conjunction with its budgeting and forecasting process for fiscal year 2022, and concluded that no indicators of impairment existed at any of its reporting units.
As of June 30, 2021, the carrying value of goodwill was $871.1 million. For the fiscal 2021 impairment analysis, the Company performed the qualitative assessment for all of its reporting units with the exception of the Hain U.S. and Hain Canada reporting units where a quantitative assessment was performed. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value based on the analysis performed. For the Hain U.S. and Hain Canada reporting units, the quantitative analysis was performed, and it was found that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 110% and 230%, respectively. Holding all other assumptions used in the 2021 fair value measurement constant, a 100-basis-point increase in the weighted average cost of capital would not result in the carrying value of the reporting units to be in excess of the fair value. The fair values were based on significant management assumptions including an estimate of future cash flows. If assumptions are not achieved or market conditions decline, potential impairment charges could result. The Company will continue to monitor impairment indicators and financial results in future periods.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated on an annual basis in conjunction with the Company’s evaluation of goodwill, or on an interim basis if and when events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of any of its indefinite-life intangible assets below their carrying value. In assessing fair value, the Company utilizes a “relief from royalty payments” methodology. This approach involves two steps: (i) estimating the royalty rates for each trademark and (ii) applying these royalty rates to a projected net sales stream and discounting the resulting cash flows to determine fair value. If the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds the fair value of the asset, the carrying value is written down to fair value in the period identified. The result of the annual assessment for the year ended June 30, 2021 indicated that the fair value of the Company’s tradenames exceeded their carrying values and no indicators of impairment were present. During the second and third quarters of fiscal 2020, the Company determined that indicators of impairment existed in certain of the Company’s indefinite-lived tradenames in association with the sale or discontinuation of certain businesses and brands. The Company performed interim impairment analyses during the year, and determined that the fair value of certain of the Company’s tradenames was below their carrying value, and therefore an impairment charge of $9.5 million was recognized ($4.0 million in the North America reportable segment and $5.5 million in the International reportable segment). For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, a tradename impairment charge of $17.9 million was recognized ($15.1 million in the North America reportable segment and $2.8 million in the International reportable segment).

Stock-based Compensation
The Company uses the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the grant date to measure fair value for service-based and performance-based awards and a Monte Carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of market-based awards. The use of the Monte Carlo simulation model requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions, such as expected volatility, expected term and risk-free interest rate. The fair value of stock-based compensation awards is recognized as an expense over the vesting period using the straight-line method. For awards that contain a market condition, expense is recognized over the defined or derived service period using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
For restricted stock awards which include performance criteria, compensation expense is recorded when the achievement of the performance criteria is probable and is recognized over the performance and vesting service periods. Compensation expense is recognized for only that portion of stock-based awards that are expected to vest.
Valuation Allowances for Deferred Tax Assets
Deferred tax assets arise when we recognize expenses in our financial statements that will be allowed as income tax deductions in future periods. Deferred tax assets also include unused tax net operating losses and tax credits that we are allowed to carry forward to future years. Accounting rules permit us to carry deferred tax assets on the balance sheet at full value as long as it is “more likely than not” that the deductions, losses or credits will be used in the future. A valuation allowance must be recorded against a deferred tax asset if this test cannot be met. Our determination of our valuation allowances is based upon a number of assumptions, judgments and estimates, including forecasted earnings, future taxable income and the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Concluding that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is significant negative evidence that is objective and verifiable, such as cumulative losses in recent years.
We have deferred tax assets related to foreign net operating losses, primarily in the United Kingdom and to a lesser extent in Belgium, against which we have recorded valuation allowances. The losses in the United Kingdom were recorded prior to the acquisition of Daniels. Under current tax law in these jurisdictions, our carryforward losses have no expiration.
During fiscal 2020 and 2019, we recorded a valuation allowance against a majority of our state deferred tax assets and state net operating loss carryforwards as it was not more likely than not that the state tax attributes will be realized. In fiscal 2021, the Company had positive results in the United States and, thus, state-level taxable income. This resulted in an expected utilization of certain of the state deferred tax assets which were previously reserved. Valuation allowances reversed were based on this positive evidence, in addition to other positive evidence, which justified the release of an additional amount of the state. valuation allowance.

Seasonality
Certain of our product lines have seasonal fluctuations. Hot tea, hot-eating desserts and soup sales are stronger in colder months, while sales of snack foods, sunscreen and certain of our personal care products are stronger in the warmer months. As such, our results of operations and our cash flows for any particular quarter are not indicative of the results we expect for the full year, and our historical seasonality may not be indicative of future quarterly results of operations. In recent years, net sales and diluted earnings per share in the first fiscal quarter have typically been the lowest of our four quarters.
