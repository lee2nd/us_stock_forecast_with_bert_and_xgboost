•The likelihood of indemnification and guarantee payment obligations and clients failing to fulfill contractual obligations (see Commitments and Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 - Note 15 and Financial Instruments Subject to Off-Balance Sheet Credit Risk - Client Trade Settlement in Note 17).
Achievement of the expressed beliefs, objectives and expectations described in these statements is subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expressed beliefs, objectives, and expectations.

OVERVIEW
Management focuses on several client activity and financial metrics in evaluating Schwab’s financial position and operating performance. We believe that metrics relating to net new and total client assets, as well as client cash levels and utilization of advisory services, offer perspective on our business momentum and client engagement. Data on new and total client brokerage accounts provides additional perspective on our ability to attract and retain new business. Total net revenue growth, pre-tax profit margin, EPS, return on average common stockholders’ equity, and the Consolidated Tier 1 Leverage Ratio provide broad indicators of Schwab’s overall financial health, operating efficiency, and ability to generate acceptable returns. Total expenses excluding interest as a percentage of average client assets is a measure of operating efficiency.
Our consolidated financial statements include the results of operations and financial condition of TD Ameritrade beginning on October 6, 2020, as discussed below. Results for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 are as follows:
(1) 2020 includes inflows of $1.6 trillion related to the acquisition of TD Ameritrade, $79.9 billion related to the acquisition of the assets of USAA-IMCO, $8.5 billion related to the acquisition of Wasmer Schroeder, and an inflow of $10.9 billion from a mutual fund clearing services client. 2019 includes inflows of $11.1 billion from certain mutual fund clearing services clients. 2018 includes outflows of $93.9 billion from certain mutual fund clearing services clients.
(2) 2020 includes 14.5 million new brokerage accounts related to the acquisition of TD Ameritrade and 1.1 million new brokerage accounts related to the acquisition of assets from USAA-IMCO.
(3) See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further details and a reconciliation of such measures to GAAP reported results.
(4) Adjusted total expenses is a non-GAAP financial measure adjusting total expenses excluding interest. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures.

2020 Compared to 2019
Throughout the extraordinary macroeconomic environment that persisted during 2020, Schwab continued to execute on key strategic initiatives, and produced solid financial results. The impact of COVID-19, along with social and political turmoil, created an unprecedented combination of personal and macroeconomic challenges for our clients, employees, and stockholders. While working through these challenges, we progressed in advancing the Company’s strategic goals to drive scale, monetization, and segmentation in ways that benefit our clients. Among the Company’s key accomplishments in 2020 were the successful completion of the acquisition of TD Ameritrade and three other strategic acquisitions, as discussed below.
The COVID-19 pandemic’s rapid escalation in early 2020 was accompanied by volatile equity markets and the Federal Reserve’s further easing of monetary policy. As the year progressed, government aid packages and vaccine developments helped settle the markets, with the S&P 500® erasing its pandemic-related losses to finish up 16% for the year. Throughout 2020, client engagement with the financial markets greatly increased over the prior year, as client trading activity reached record levels. Core net new assets totaled $281.9 billion in 2020, representing our third consecutive year of over $200 billion. Total client assets reached $6.69 trillion spread across 29.6 million brokerage accounts, up 66% and 140%, respectively, from year-end 2019.
Against this backdrop, Schwab’s net income totaled $3.3 billion, down $405 million, or 11% from 2019, while the Company produced diluted EPS of $2.12, representing a decrease of 21% relative to 2019. Adjusted diluted EPS (1), which excludes acquisition and integration-related costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and related income tax effects, amounted to $2.45 in 2020, down 9% from $2.70 in 2019.
Total net revenues reached $11.7 billion for the year, increasing 9% from 2019. During March 2020, the Federal Reserve acted to support the economy by cutting the Fed Funds rate from 1.75% to near zero and announcing significant asset purchase programs. Mortgage refinancing activity subsequently accelerated, and our net interest margin was impacted by both significantly lower interest rates and increased prepayments of mortgage-backed securities held in our investment portfolio. Strong growth in interest-earning assets via client inflows and allocation decisions, as well as our acquisitions of TD Ameritrade and assets of USAA-IMCO, helped limit the decrease in net interest revenue to 6%, resulting in a full-year 2020 total of $6.1 billion.
Growing balances in advisory solutions and a rebound in equity markets in 2020 helped drive an 8% increase in asset management and administration fees, which totaled $3.5 billion in 2020. Record client trading activity and the addition of TD Ameritrade in the fourth quarter contributed to an 88% increase in trading revenue, which reached $1.4 billion for the year, more than offsetting a full-year impact of the commission reductions implemented in the fourth quarter of 2019. With the TD Ameritrade acquisition, our fourth quarter 2020 results included bank deposit account fee revenue for the first time, which totaled $355 million for the period from October 6, through December 31, 2020.
Total expenses excluding interest increased 26% in 2020 to $7.4 billion, which included significant costs related to our acquisitions. With the completion of four acquisitions during the year, acquisition and integration-related costs totaled $442 million in 2020, representing a significant increase from the $26 million incurred in 2019. Amortization of acquired intangible assets also increased, totaling $190 million in 2020 compared with $27 million in 2019. Exclusive of these items (1), adjusted total expenses increased 16% from 2019. Return on average common stockholders’ equity was 9% in 2020, down from 19% in 2019. Return on tangible common equity (1) (ROTCE) was 15% in 2020, down from 21% in 2019. The 2020 decreases in both return on average common stockholders’ equity and ROTCE are due to lower net income as well as significantly higher balances of common equity due to the TDA acquisition and higher AOCI in 2020, driven by unrealized gains in our AFS investment portfolio.
(1) Adjusted diluted EPS, adjusted total expenses, and return on tangible common equity are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further details and a reconciliation of such measures to GAAP reported results.

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)
Throughout 2020, the Company maintained its disciplined approach to capital management, helping sustain significant balance sheet growth. Schwab’s consolidated total assets ended 2020 at $549 billion, representing growth of $255 billion, or 87%, from year-end 2019, reflecting both our organic growth as well as the acquisitions of TD Ameritrade and the assets of USAA-IMCO. Through offerings in April and December, the Company issued preferred stock totaling approximately $5 billion in 2020, bringing total preferred stock to approximately $7.7 billion, or approximately 25% of Tier 1 Capital at December 31, 2020. The Company’s Tier 1 Leverage Ratio was 6.3% at December 31, 2020.
Business and Asset Acquisitions
TD Ameritrade
Effective October 6, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of TD Ameritrade. TD Ameritrade provides securities brokerage services, including trade execution, clearing services, and margin lending, through its broker-dealer subsidiaries; and futures and foreign exchange trade execution services through its FCM and FDM subsidiary. At the time of closing, TD Ameritrade had approximately $1.6 trillion in client assets and approximately 14.5 million brokerage accounts. In exchange for each share of TD Ameritrade common stock, TD Ameritrade stockholders received 1.0837 shares of CSC common stock, except for TD Bank and its affiliates which received a portion in nonvoting common stock. In connection with the transaction, Schwab issued approximately 586 million common shares to TD Ameritrade stockholders consisting of approximately 509 million shares of common stock and 77 million shares of nonvoting common stock. Upon completion of the acquisition, TDA Holding became a wholly-owned subsidiary of CSC. See Item 8 - Note 3 for more information.
For the period of October 6, through December 31, 2020, total net revenues and total expenses excluding interest attributable to TD Ameritrade were approximately $1.7 billion and $943 million, respectively. TD Ameritrade’s primary sources of revenues include trading revenue, bank deposit account fees, net interest revenue, and asset management and administration fees. Bank deposit account fee revenue is primarily earned through the Company’s IDA agreement. TD Ameritrade’s assets and liabilities have been revalued and recorded at their provisional estimated fair value as of the date of acquisition.
The integration of TD Ameritrade’s operations is expected to occur over 18 to 36 months from the date of acquisition, and the Company expects to continue to incur significant acquisition and integration-related costs and integration-related capital expenditures throughout the integration process. Such costs have included and are expected to continue to include professional fees, such as legal, advisory, and accounting fees, and compensation and benefits expenses for employees and contractors involved in the integration work, costs for technology enhancements, as well as exit and other related costs incurred to attain anticipated synergies. Such costs include employee compensation and benefits, including severance pay, other termination benefits and retention costs, as well as costs related to facility closures, including accelerated depreciation or impairments of assets in those locations.
The Company currently estimates that total acquisition and integration-related costs and capital expenditures related to the integration of TD Ameritrade will be approximately $1.6 billion. The Company is in the early stages of integration, and our estimates of the nature, amounts, and timing of recognition of acquisition and integration-related costs are subject to change based on a number of factors, including the expected duration and complexity of the integration process and the heightened uncertainty of the current economic environment. More specifically, factors that could cause variability in our expected acquisition and integration-related costs include the level of employee attrition, workforce redeployment from eliminated positions into open roles, changes in the levels of client activity, as well as increased real estate-related exit cost variability due to effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Acquisition and integration-related costs, which includes related exit costs, for all of our acquisitions completed in 2020 totaled $442 million, and the Company expects to incur a roughly consistent amount in 2021 related primarily to continued work on the integration of TD Ameritrade. While inclusion of TD Ameritrade’s operating costs and continued acquisition and integration-related costs will increase the Company’s total expenses excluding interest in 2021 and going forward, we expect to realize cost synergies through integration. Over the course of the integration, we expect to realize annualized cost synergies of between $1.8 billion and $2.0 billion, with one-quarter to one-third on an annualized run-rate basis expected by the end of the first year following acquisition. Estimated timing and amounts of synergy realization are subject to change as we progress in the integration. See also Results of Operations - Total Expenses Excluding Interest, Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and Item 8 - Notes 3 and 16.

Assets of USAA-IMCO
On May 26, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of the assets of USAA-IMCO for $1.6 billion in cash. Along with the asset purchase agreement, the companies entered into a long-term referral agreement that makes Schwab the exclusive provider of wealth management and investment brokerage services for USAA members. The USAA-IMCO acquisition has added scale to the Company’s operations through the addition of 1.1 million brokerage and managed portfolio accounts with approximately $80 billion in client assets at the acquisition date. The transaction also provides Schwab the opportunity to further expand our client base by serving USAA’s members through the long-term referral agreement. See Item 8 - Note 3 for more information on the USAA-IMCO acquisition.
Other
During the second quarter of 2020 the Company completed its acquisition of technology and intellectual property of Motif, a financial technology company. The Motif assets help us build on our existing capabilities and help accelerate our development of thematic and direct index investing for Schwab’s retail investors and RIA clients. On July 1, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of Wasmer Schroeder, which adds established strategies and new separately managed account offerings to our existing fixed income lineup.
2019 Compared to 2018
Schwab delivered solid financial results in 2019 while taking significant steps to further enhance our offer to clients and help position the Company to build value for our stakeholders over the long-term. Throughout 2019, investor sentiment reflected a complex market environment that included global trade negotiations and an uncertain domestic economic outlook. The Federal Reserve ended up cutting the federal funds target interest rate three times in 2019, in a reversal of the increases seen in 2018. At the same time, stocks continued to rise, with the S&P 500® increasing 29% during 2019. Core net new assets totaled $211.7 billion for 2019, representing an organic growth rate of 7% and our second consecutive year over $200 billion. Clients opened 1.6 million new brokerage accounts in 2019, while active brokerage accounts grew 6% to 12.3 million. Our success in asset gathering combined with strong market returns drove total client assets to reach $4.04 trillion at December 31, 2019, closing the year up 24%.
Company actions to benefit clients and build long-term value during 2019 included the elimination of online trading commissions for U.S. and Canadian-listed stocks and ETFs, as well as the base charge on options, which became effective October 7, 2019. The Company also announced two significant acquisitions during 2019. In July 2019, the Company agreed to acquire assets of USAA-IMCO and agreed to enter into a long-term referral agreement. In late November 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire TD Ameritrade.
Against the backdrop of the more challenging than expected macroeconomic environment and our own pricing decisions, Schwab’s net income totaled $3.7 billion in 2019, an increase of $197 million, or 6%. Diluted EPS grew to $2.67, representing an increase of 9% from 2018.
Total net revenues reached $10.7 billion, up 6% in 2019. Net interest revenue increased 12% in 2019 to $6.5 billion, driven by higher average investment yields and also by an increase in client cash balances held at our bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries. While trading revenue declined 17% to $752 million due to our pricing actions, asset management and administration fees remained essentially flat with 2018 at $3.2 billion, decreasing 1%. Growing enrollment in advice solutions, along with rising balances in other third-party mutual funds, helped to largely offset declines in Mutual Fund OneSource® and lower sweep money market fund revenue due to transfers of sweep money market funds to our balance sheet in 2018 and early 2019.
Total expenses excluding interest increased 5% in 2019 to $5.9 billion, which included $62 million in severance charges associated with a 3% reduction in our workforce and $25 million in costs relating to the announced acquisitions of assets of USAA-IMCO and TD Ameritrade. The Company’s focus on driving efficiency while managing spending in a disciplined manner helped us maintain a ratio of expenses to client assets of 16 bps for 2019. Balancing long-term profitability with reinvesting for growth, we achieved a 45.2% pre-tax profit margin and a 19% return on equity in 2019, representing our second consecutive year of at least 45% and 19%, respectively.

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)
Disciplined balance sheet management remained core to our strategy as we continued to support business growth and meaningful capital returns across a range of conditions. In early 2019, the Board of Directors raised the quarterly cash dividend 31% to $0.17 per share and authorized the repurchase of up to $4.0 billion of common stock; during 2019 we repurchased 55 million shares for $2.2 billion under this authorization. As of December 31, 2019, our balance sheet assets were $294 billion, down 1% from December 31, 2018; our Tier 1 Leverage Ratio was 7.3% at year-end 2019.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Total Net Revenues
Total net revenues of $11.7 billion and $10.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, represented growth of 9% and 6% from the prior periods. The 2020 increase was due to our acquisition of TD Ameritrade, which contributed approximately $1.7 billion of total net revenues from October 6, through December 31, 2020. Total net revenues increased in 2019 primarily due to growth in net interest revenue.
(1) Beginning in the first quarter of 2019, a change was made to move CTFs from other asset management and administration fees. Prior periods have been recast to reflect this change.
(2) Beginning in the first quarter of 2020, order flow revenue was reclassified from other revenue to trading revenue. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to reflect this change.
N/M Not meaningful. Percentage changes greater than 200% are presented as not meaningful.
Net Interest Revenue
Schwab’s primary interest-earning assets include cash and cash equivalents; cash and investments segregated; margin loans, which constitute the majority of receivables from brokerage clients; investment securities; and bank loans. Revenue on interest-earning assets is affected by various factors, such as the composition of assets, prevailing interest rates and spreads at the time of origination or purchase, changes in interest rates on floating rate securities and loans, and changes in prepayment levels for mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities and loans. Fees earned and expenses incurred on securities lending and borrowing activities are conducted by our broker-dealer subsidiaries using assets held in client brokerage accounts.
Schwab’s interest-bearing liabilities include bank deposits, payables to brokerage clients, short-term borrowings (e.g., Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances, commercial paper), and long-term debt. Non-interest-bearing funding sources include stockholders’ equity, certain client cash balances, and other miscellaneous liabilities.

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)
Schwab establishes the rates paid on client-related liabilities, and management expects that it will generally adjust the rates paid on these liabilities at some fraction of any movement in short-term rates. Schwab deploys the funds from these sources into the assets outlined above. We do not use short-term, wholesale borrowings to support our long-term investment activity, but may use such funding, including FHLB advances or commercial paper, for short-term liquidity purposes or to provide temporary funding (e.g., for investment purchases) ahead of anticipated balance sheet deposit growth.
In order to keep interest-rate sensitivity within established limits, management actively monitors and adjusts interest-rate sensitivity through changes in the balance sheet, primarily by adjusting the composition of our banking subsidiaries’ investment portfolios. As Schwab builds its client base, we attract new client sweep cash, which is a primary driver of funding balance sheet growth.
Late in the first quarter of 2020, the Federal Reserve cut the federal funds target overnight rate from 1.75% to near zero; on the longer-end of the curve, the 10-year Treasury rate declined by over 120 basis points. Lower interest rates across maturities persisted from the end of the first quarter through the end of 2020, while credit spreads also compressed. Moreover, changes in the economic environment throughout 2020 resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic drove significantly higher levels of client cash sweep balances. As these balances rapidly accumulated in the first quarter of 2020, the Company initially placed a substantial amount in excess reserves held at the Federal Reserve, and subsequently deployed a significant amount of this cash build-up throughout 2020. AFS securities purchases in 2020 totaled $202.2 billion. These purchases were made at rates below the average yield on the existing AFS portfolio due to the current low interest rate environment.
Schwab’s acquisition of TD Ameritrade, effective October 6, 2020, provides additional interest-earning assets and liabilities. For Schwab’s 2020 full-year averages, TD Ameritrade contributed approximately $12.0 billion of average interest-earning assets and $9.6 billion of average interest-bearing liabilities. TD Ameritrade’s interest-earning assets consist primarily of receivables from brokerage clients, cash and investments segregated, cash and cash equivalents, and AFS securities. TD Ameritrade’s interest-bearing liabilities consist primarily of payables to brokerage clients and long-term debt. See Item 8 - Note 3 for additional information on the TD Ameritrade acquisition including the provisional fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)
The following table presents net interest revenue information corresponding to interest-earning assets and funding sources on the consolidated balance sheets:
(1) Amounts have been calculated based on amortized cost.
(2) On January 1, 2020, the Company transferred all of its investment securities designated as held to maturity (HTM) to the AFS category, as described in Item 8 - Note 6.
(3) Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, securities lending revenue has been reclassified from broker-related receivables and other revenue. Securities lending expense has been reclassified from other expense. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to reflect this change.
(4) Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, broker-related receivables were removed from total interest earning assets and netted against non-interest-bearing funding sources, resulting in an immaterial reduction to total interest-earning assets and total funding sources. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to reflect this change.
(5) Interest revenue or expense was less than $500 thousand in the period or periods presented.
Net interest revenue decreased $403 million or 6%, in 2020 from 2019, due primarily to lower average investment yields partially offset by growth in interest-earning assets. Accelerated premium amortization on debt securities in 2020 also contributed to the reduction in net interest revenue, as the decline in long-term interest rates in 2020 resulted in higher prepayments of mortgage-related debt securities. TD Ameritrade contributed approximately $443 million of net interest revenue from October 6, through December 31, 2020.
Average interest-earning assets for 2020 were higher by 40%, compared to 2019. This increase in average interest-earning assets was primarily driven by higher client cash balances in bank deposits and payables to brokerage clients, due to higher client cash allocations and our acquisitions of TD Ameritrade and assets of USAA-IMCO.
Our net interest margin decreased to 1.62% in 2020, from 2.41% in 2019. This decrease was driven primarily by lower yields received on interest-earning assets due largely to the Federal Reserve’s 2019 and 2020 interest rate reductions as well as higher premium amortization on mortgage-related debt securities. Due to the low interest rate environment, purchases of investment securities in 2020 were made at rates below the average yield on the existing AFS portfolio, which negatively impacted our net interest margin. The amount of any further net interest margin compression and resulting net interest

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)
revenue is dependent on a number of factors, including changes to LIBOR, premium amortization, reinvestment rates, and growth in client cash balances.
Net interest revenue increased $693 million, or 12%, in 2019 from 2018, due to higher average investment yields and growth in interest earning assets. Our net interest margin improved 12 basis points to 2.41% in 2019 from 2018, driven primarily by higher average yields received on interest-earning assets in 2019 due largely to the net impact of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate increases in 2018 and decreases in the third and fourth quarters of 2019. The increase in average yields on interest-earning assets was partially offset by higher average interest rates paid on bank deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. Portfolio adjustments made in 2019 to hold a higher percentage of fixed-rate, longer duration investments helped to moderate the impact of the declining rate environment on our net interest margin.
Average interest-earning assets grew 6% from 2018 to 2019, primarily driven by higher bank deposits due to transfers from sweep money market funds to bank sweep, as well as higher client cash balances.
Asset Management and Administration Fees
Asset management and administration fees include mutual fund, ETF, and CTF service fees and fees for other asset-based financial services provided to individual and institutional clients. Schwab earns mutual fund, ETF, and CTF service fees for shareholder services, administration, and investment management provided to its proprietary funds, and recordkeeping and shareholder services provided to third-party funds. Asset management and administration fees are based upon the daily balances of client assets invested in these funds and do not include securities lending revenues earned by proprietary mutual funds, ETFs, and CTFs, as those amounts, net of program fees, are credited to the fund shareholders. Proprietary CTFs may, but generally do not, directly participate in securities lending. The fair values of client assets included in proprietary and third-party mutual funds, ETFs, and CTFs are based on quoted market prices and other observable market data.
We also earn asset management fees for advice solutions, which include managed portfolios, specialized strategies, and customized investment advice. Other asset management and administration fees include various asset-based fees such as trust fees, 401(k) recordkeeping fees, mutual fund clearing fees, and non-balance based service and transaction fees.
Asset management and administration fees attributable to TD Ameritrade are primarily earned on client assets invested in money market mutual funds and other mutual funds, as well as advice solutions.
Asset management and administration fees vary with changes in the balances of client assets due to market fluctuations and client activity.

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)
The following table presents asset management and administration fees, average client assets, and average fee yields:
(1) Beginning in the first quarter of 2019, a change was made to move CTFs from other balance-based fees. Prior periods have been reclassified to reflect this change.
(2) Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, Schwab ETF OneSourceTM was discontinued as a result of the elimination of online trading commissions for U.S. and Canadian-listed ETFs.
(3) Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, includes third-party money funds related to the acquisition of TD Ameritrade.
(4) Average client assets for advice solutions may also include the asset balances contained in the mutual fund and/or ETF categories listed above.
(5) Includes various asset-related fees, such as trust fees, 401(k) recordkeeping fees, and mutual fund clearing fees and other service fees.
(6) Includes miscellaneous service and transaction fees relating to mutual funds and ETFs that are not balance-based.
Asset management and administration fees increased by $264 million, or 8%, in 2020 from 2019, primarily due to higher balances in advice solutions, including managed account assets from USAA and TD Ameritrade, overall gains in equity markets, as well as higher purchased money market funds and other third-party mutual funds and ETFs, in 2020 relative to 2019. These increases were partially offset by the effect of money market fund fee waivers due to declining portfolio yields. Asset management and administration fees attributable to TD Ameritrade were approximately $131 million from October 6, through December 31, 2020. The amount of fee waivers in coming quarters is dependent on a variety of factors, including the level of short-term interest rates and client preferences across our money market fund line-up.
Asset management and administration fees decreased by $18 million, or 1%, in 2019 from 2018, primarily due to lower sweep money market fund revenue as a result of transfers to bank and broker-dealer sweep in 2018 and early 2019, as well as client asset allocation choices including reduced usage of Mutual Fund OneSource®. Part of the decline was offset by revenue from growing asset balances in purchased money market funds, other third-party mutual funds and ETFs, and in advice solutions.

The following table presents a roll forward of client assets for the Schwab money market funds, Schwab equity and bond funds, ETFs, and CTFs, and Mutual Fund OneSource® and other non-transaction fee (NTF) funds. The following funds generated 40%, 45%, and 48% of the asset management and administration fees earned during 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively:
(1) Beginning in the first quarter of 2019, CTFs are included in these balances. Prior periods have been reclassified to reflect this change.
Trading Revenue
Trading revenue includes commissions, order flow revenue, and principal transaction revenues. Commission revenue is affected by volume and mix of trades executed. Order flow revenue is comprised of rebate payments received from trade execution venues to which our broker-dealer subsidiaries send equity and option orders. Order flow revenue is affected by volume and mix of client trades, as well as pricing received from trade execution venues. Principal transaction revenue is primarily comprised of revenue from trading activity in fixed income securities with clients. The difference between the price at which the Company buys and sells securities to and from our clients and other broker-dealers to accommodate clients’ fixed income trading activity is recognized as principal transaction revenue. Principal transaction revenue also includes adjustments to the fair value of these securities positions.
The following table presents trading revenue and the related drivers:
Note: Effective October 7, 2019, CS&Co eliminated online trade commissions for U.S. and Canadian-listed stocks and ETFs, as well as the base charge on options. TD Ameritrade, Inc. also does not charge for these types of trades and does not have a base charge on options.
(1) Beginning in the first quarter of 2020, order flow revenue was reclassified from other revenue to trading revenue. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to reflect this change.
(2) Revenue per trade is calculated as trading revenue divided by DATs multiplied by the number of trading days.
N/M Not meaningful. Percentage changes greater than 200% are presented as not meaningful.
Trading revenue increased $664 million, or 88% in 2020 compared to 2019, due primarily to the acquisition of TD Ameritrade, which contributed approximately $667 million of trading revenue from October 6, 2020 forward. In addition, the Company saw a significant increase in clients’ daily average trades and higher order flow revenue in 2020, which were partially offset by the Company’s October 2019 pricing actions. Order flow revenue was $621 million, $135 million, and $139 million during 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The increase in order flow revenue in 2020 was due to the acquisition of TD Ameritrade and a higher volume of trades throughout 2020 relative to 2019.
Trading revenue decreased by $150 million, or 17%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily due to the elimination of online trading commissions for U.S. and Canadian-listed stocks and ETFs, as well as the base charge on options effective October 7, 2019.
Bank Deposit Account Fees
Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company began earning bank deposit account fee revenue pursuant to the IDA agreement and arrangements with other third-party banks. Bank deposit account fees are primarily affected by average BDA balances and the floating- and fixed-rate reference yields that are a key component to derive fees pursuant to the IDA

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)
agreement. Fees earned under the IDA agreement are affected by changes in interest rates and the composition of balances designated as fixed- and floating-rate.
Bank deposit account fees totaled $355 million for the period of October 6, 2020 through December 31, 2020. During this period, the total average BDA balance was approximately $161 billion, of which approximately 80% was designated as fixed-rate obligation amounts and approximately 20% as floating-rate obligation amounts.
Other Revenue
Other revenue includes exchange processing fees, certain service fees, software fees, and non-recurring gains. Other revenue increased $90 million, or 37%, in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to higher exchange processing fees resulting from higher trade volumes and the acquisition of TD Ameritrade. Other revenue increased $64 million, or 36%, in 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to a gain from the sale of a portfolio management and reporting software solution for advisors to Tamarac Inc. in the second quarter of 2019 and a gain from the assignment of leased office space in the first quarter of 2019.
Total Expenses Excluding Interest
The following table shows a comparison of total expenses excluding interest:
(1) Beginning in the third quarter of 2020, amortization of acquired intangible assets was reclassified from depreciation and amortization. Prior periods have been reclassified to reflect this change.
N/M Not meaningful. Percentage changes greater than 200% are presented as not meaningful.
Total expenses excluding interest increased $1,518 million, or 26%, in 2020 from 2019, and $303 million, or 5%, in 2019 from 2018. In 2020, total expenses excluding interest included approximately $943 million from TD Ameritrade’s results of operations from October 6, through December 31, 2020. Adjusted total expenses, which excludes acquisition and integration-related costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets, increased $939 million, or 16%, in 2020 from 2019, and $279 million, or 5%, in 2019 from 2018. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further details and a reconciliation of such measures to GAAP reported results.

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)
Total compensation and benefits increased in 2020 from 2019, primarily due to an overall increase in employee headcount due primarily to the addition of approximately 10,000 TD Ameritrade employees and the hiring of 400 former USAA employees in connection with our 2020 acquisitions. The increase in 2020 also reflected the Company’s payment of $1,000 to all non-officer employees in March 2020 to help them cover costs incurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Compensation and benefits in 2020 included $235 million of acquisition and integration-related costs. The increase in 2019 from 2018 was primarily due to both an overall increase in employee headcount to support our expanding client base and higher severance costs, which included $62 million associated with a 3% reduction in our workforce in the third quarter of 2019.
Professional services expense increased in 2020 from 2019, primarily due to acquisition and integration-related costs in 2020 of $158 million. The increase in 2019 from 2018 was primarily due to overall growth in the business, investments in projects to further drive efficiency and scale, and certain costs relating to the pending acquisitions completed in 2020.
Occupancy and equipment expense increased in 2020 from 2019, primarily due the inclusion of TDA’s results of operations from October 6, 2020 forward, as well as an increase in technology equipment costs associated with higher client trade volumes and overall growth in the business. The increase in 2019 from 2018 was primarily due to increases in software maintenance expenses and additional licenses to support growth in the business.
Communications expense increased in 2020 from 2019, primarily due to the inclusion of TDA’s results of operations from October 6, 2020 forward and higher news and quotation services expenses due to higher trade volumes.
Depreciation and amortization expenses grew in 2020 from 2019, primarily due to higher amortization of purchased and internally developed software, higher depreciation and amortization of equipment, office facilities, and property recognized in the TDA acquisition, as well as higher depreciation of buildings and equipment related to the expansion of our U.S. campuses in 2019 and 2020. The increase in 2019 from 2018 was primarily due to higher amortization of internally developed software associated with investments in software and technology enhancements.
Amortization of acquired intangible assets increased in 2020 as a result of the acquisitions completed during the year.
Regulatory fees and assessments increased in 2020 from 2019, primarily due to the inclusion of TDA’s results of operations from October 6, 2020 forward, and higher FDIC insurance assessments and other regulatory assessments due to growth in assets and overall growth of the business in 2020. Regulatory fees and assessments decreased in 2019 from 2018, primarily due to a decrease in FDIC insurance assessments resulting from the elimination of the FDIC surcharge in the fourth quarter of 2018.
Other expenses increased in 2020 from 2019, primarily resulting from the inclusion of TDA’s results of operations from October 6, 2020 forward, and increases in processing fees and related expenses due to higher client trade volumes and market volatility. These increases were partially offset by lower travel and entertainment expense in 2020. Other expenses in 2020 included acquisition and integration-related costs of $30 million. Other expenses decreased in 2019 from 2018, primarily due to lower travel and entertainment expense and bad debt expense.
Capital expenditures were $741 million, $753 million, and $576 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Capital expenditures decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to lower building expansion in 2020, largely offset by higher capitalized software costs. Capital expenditures increased in 2019 from 2018 primarily due to the expansion of our campuses in the U.S. Investments in buildings were $173 million, $397 million, and $253 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Capitalized software costs totaled $453 million, $188 million, and $194 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
Our capital expenditures for 2020 equaled 6% of total net revenues, within our estimated range for the year. We will continue to invest in integration-related and other technology projects in 2021, and we anticipate capital expenditures in 2021 to be approximately 6-7% of total net revenues. Our longer term expectation for capital expenditures remains in the range of 3-5% of total net revenues.
During 2020, the Company experienced high levels of client engagement and record trading volumes while nearly all employees were in a remote work environment. Client activity rose sharply in the fourth quarter, and the client service and operational challenges created by this environment became more pronounced. Clients experienced longer call wait times

along with a limited number of issues in utilizing our website and mobile applications. In 2021, the Company anticipates increased spending to improve service levels and support our expanding client base, including additional technology spending as well as hiring more client service professionals.
Overall in 2021, we expect total expenses excluding interest to reflect the impacts of: continued acquisition and integration-related costs primarily related to our integration of TD Ameritrade; increased spending to improve service levels and support growth; and our progress in achieving incremental cost synergies. The magnitude and timing of these impacts are inherently uncertain and depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of client engagement and trading volumes, the pace and levels of employee hiring, onboarding, and attrition, and changes in our needs to exit or maintain office and branch locations.
Taxes on Income
Schwab’s effective income tax rate on income before taxes was 23.3% in 2020, 23.6% in 2019, and 23.1% in 2018. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2020 from 2019 was primarily due to federal and state tax benefits recognized during 2020, including settlement of the IRS examination of tax years 2011-2014, the expiration of the statute of limitations on certain federal and state uncertain tax positions, and tax benefits realized from the filing of state tax returns, as well as an increase in Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) benefits. Offsetting the decrease in the effective tax rate from these items was an increase in nondeductible acquisition costs and FDIC insurance premium disallowance, as well as a decrease in equity compensation tax deduction benefits. The change in rates in 2019 from 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in equity compensation tax deduction benefits which reduced our tax expense by approximately $23 million and $46 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Segment Information
Schwab provides financial services to individuals and institutional clients through two segments - Investor Services and Advisor Services. The Investor Services segment provides retail brokerage and banking services to individual investors, and retirement plan services, as well as other corporate brokerage services, to businesses and their employees. The Advisor Services segment provides custodial, trading, banking, and support services, as well as retirement business services, to independent RIAs, independent retirement advisors, and recordkeepers. Revenues and expenses are attributed to the two segments based on which segment services the client. Management evaluates the performance of the segments on a pre-tax basis. Segment assets and liabilities are not used for evaluating segment performance or in deciding how to allocate resources to segments. Net revenues in both segments are generated from the underlying client assets and trading activity; differences in the composition of net revenues between the segments are based on the composition of client assets, client trading frequency, and pricing unique to each. While both segments leverage the scale and efficiency of our platforms, segment expenses reflect the dynamics of serving millions of clients in Investor Services versus the thousands of RIAs on the Advisor Services platform.
The Company integrated its business and asset acquisitions during 2020 into its two existing reportable segments. Revenues and expenses from our acquisition of USAA-IMCO are allocated to Investor Services only; revenues and expenses from TD Ameritrade and our other 2020 acquisitions are attributed to both Investor Services and Advisor Services based on which segment services the client. See Item 8 - Note 3 for more information regarding acquisitions.

Financial information for our segments is presented in the following table:
(1) Beginning in 2020, order flow revenue was reclassified from other revenue to trading revenue. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to reflect this change.
(2) In 2020, Investor Services includes inflows of $890.7 billion related to the acquisition of TD Ameritrade and $79.9 billion related to the acquisition of assets of USAA-IMCO. Additionally, 2020 and 2019 includes inflows of $10.9 billion and $11.1 billion, respectively, and outflows of $93.9 billion in 2018 from certain mutual fund clearing services clients.
(3) In 2020, Advisor Services includes inflows of $680.6 billion related to the acquisition of TD Ameritrade and $8.5 billion related to the acquisition of Wasmer Schroeder.
N/M Not meaningful. Percentage changes greater than 200% are presented as not meaningful.
Segment Net Revenues
Investor Services total net revenues increased by 13% in 2020 from 2019, while Advisor Services total net revenues remained relatively consistent year-over-year. Investor Services’ growth was primarily due to an increase in trading revenue, higher asset management and administration fees, and the initial recognition of bank deposit account fees in the fourth quarter of 2020, partially offset by lower net interest revenue. For Advisor Services, bank deposit account fees largely offset a decrease in net interest revenue, while trading revenue and asset management and administration fees were consistent with 2019. Trading revenue increased significantly in the Investor Services segment primarily due to the TD Ameritrade acquisition and higher trade volumes in 2020. Asset management and administration fees increased in 2020 for Investor Services primarily due to higher balances in advice solutions, including managed account assets from USAA and TD Ameritrade, as well as higher purchased money market funds and other third-party mutual funds and ETFs, partially offset by the effect of money fund fee waivers. Net interest revenue decreased for both segments primarily due to lower average investment yields, partially offset by growth in interest-earning assets.
Investor Services and Advisor Services total net revenues increased by 4% and 10%, respectively, in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to increases in net interest revenue, which increased as a result of higher average investment yields and higher interest earning assets. For Investor Services, asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to growing asset balances in advice solutions, partially offset by lower mutual fund and ETF service fee revenue as a result of client cash allocation choices, including reduced usage of Mutual Fund OneSource®. For Advisor Services, asset management and administration fees decreased primarily due to lower sweep money market fund revenue as a result of transfers to bank and broker-dealer sweep, as well as client asset allocation choices, including reduced usage of Mutual Fund OneSource®, partially offset by increased revenue from growing asset balances in purchased money market funds and in other third-party mutual funds and ETFs. Trading revenue decreased for both segments as a result of the elimination of online trading commissions for U.S. and Canadian-listed stocks and ETFs, as well as the base charge on options in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Segment Expenses Excluding Interest
Investor Services and Advisor Services total expenses excluding interest increased by 29% and 17%, respectively, in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to the inclusion of TD Ameritrade’s expenses from October 6, 2020 forward and

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

acquisition and integration-related costs. Compensation and benefits increased in both segments primarily due to the acquisition of TDA and overall headcount growth to support our expanding client base, with Investor Services increasing more significantly due to greater headcount growth from the TDA acquisition and the hiring of approximately 400 former USAA employees in connection with the USAA-IMCO acquisition. Both segments also saw increases in professional services, depreciation and amortization, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and other expenses, primarily due to the inclusion of TDA’s expenses from October 6, 2020 forward as well as acquisition and integration-related costs, with Investor Services’ expenses increasing more significantly due to overall size of the segment’s client base and greater client base growth from TDA.
Investor Services and Advisor Services expenses excluding interest increased 3% and 12%, respectively, in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to higher compensation and benefits and occupancy and equipment expense. Additionally, Advisor Services had higher professional services expense due to overall growth in the business and investments in projects to further drive efficiency and scale, and Investor Services had higher amortization of internally developed software due to technology enhancements. For both segments these increases were partially offset by a decrease in FDIC insurance assessments due to the elimination of the FDIC surcharge in the fourth quarter of 2018 and lower travel and entertainment expenses.
RISK MANAGEMENT
Schwab’s business activities expose it to a variety of risks, including operational, compliance, credit, market, and liquidity risks. The Company has a comprehensive risk management program to identify and manage these risks and their associated potential for financial and reputational impact. Despite our efforts to identify areas of risk and implement risk management policies and procedures, there can be no assurance that Schwab will not suffer unexpected losses due to these risks.
Our risk management process is comprised of risk identification and assessment, risk measurement, risk monitoring and reporting, and risk mitigation controls; we use periodic risk and control self-assessments, control testing programs, and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. The activities and governance that comprise the risk management process are described below.
As part of our integration of TD Ameritrade, the Company is aligning TD Ameritrade’s historical risk exposures with Schwab’s risk appetite. Our integration work includes evaluating new or changed risks impacting the combined company, and may involve modifications to our existing risk management processes. Though integration work continues, the Company’s operations, inclusive of TD Ameritrade, remain consistent with our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework.
Culture
The Board of Directors has approved an ERM framework that incorporates our purpose, vision, and values, which form the bedrock of our corporate culture and set the tone for the organization.
We designed the ERM Framework to enable a comprehensive approach to managing risks encountered by Schwab in its business activities. The framework incorporates key concepts commensurate with the size, risk profile, complexity, and continuing growth of the Company. Risk appetite, which is defined as the amount of risk the Company is willing to accept in pursuit of its corporate strategy, is developed by executive management and approved by the Board of Directors.
Risk Governance
Senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures under which specific business and control units are responsible for identifying, measuring, and controlling risks.
The Global Risk Committee, which is comprised of senior executives from each major business and control function, is responsible for the oversight of risk management. This includes identifying emerging risks, assessing risk management practices and the control environment, reinforcing business accountability for risk management, supervisory controls and regulatory compliance, supporting resource prioritization across the organization, and escalating significant issues to the Board of Directors.

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)
We have established risk metrics and reporting that enable measurement of the impact of strategy execution against risk appetite. The risk metrics, with risk limits and tolerance levels, are established for key risk categories by the Global Risk Committee and its functional risk sub-committees.
The Chief Risk Officer regularly reports activities of the Global Risk Committee to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. The Board Risk Committee in turn assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to our risk management program, including approving risk appetite statements and related key risk appetite metrics and reviewing reports relating to risk issues from functional areas of corporate risk management, legal, compliance, and internal audit.
Functional risk sub-committees focusing on specific areas of risk report to the Global Risk Committee. These sub-committees include the:
•Operational Risk Oversight Committee - provides oversight of and approves operational risk management policies, risk tolerance levels, and operational risk governance processes, and includes sub-committees covering Information Security, Fraud, Third-Party Risk, Data, and Model Governance;
•Compliance Risk Committee - provides oversight of compliance risk management programs and policies providing an aggregate view of compliance risk exposure and employee conduct, including subcommittees covering Fiduciary and Conflicts of Interest Risk and International Compliance Risk;
•Financial Risk Oversight Committee - provides oversight of and approves credit, market, liquidity, and capital risk policies, limits, and exposures; and
•New Products and Services Risk Oversight Committee - provides oversight of, and approves corporate policy and procedures relating to, the risk governance of new products and services.
Senior management has also created an Incentive Compensation Risk Oversight Committee, which establishes policy and reviews and approves the Annual Risk Assessment of incentive compensation plans, and reports directly to the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.
The Company’s compliance, finance, internal audit, legal, and corporate risk management departments assist management and the various risk committees in evaluating, testing, and monitoring risk management.
In addition, the Disclosure Committee is responsible for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal quarter. The Disclosure Committee reports on this evaluation to the CEO and CFO prior to their certification required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002.

Operational risk arises due to potential inadequacies or failures related to people, internal processes, and systems, or from external events or relationships impacting the Company and/or any of its key business partners and third parties. While operational risk is inherent in all business activities, we rely on a system of internal controls and risk management practices designed to keep operational risk and operational losses within the Company’s risk appetite. We have specific policies and procedures to identify and manage operational risk, and use control testing programs, and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. Where appropriate, we manage the impact of operational loss and litigation expense through the purchase of insurance. The insurance program is specifically designed to address our key operational risks and to maintain compliance with local laws and regulation.
Schwab’s operations are highly dependent on the integrity and resilience of our critical business functions and technology systems. To the extent Schwab experiences business or system interruptions, errors or downtime (which could result from a variety of causes, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, technological failure, cyber attacks, changes to systems, linkages with third-party systems, and power failures), our business and operations could be negatively impacted. To minimize business interruptions and ensure the capacity to continue operations during an incident regardless of duration, Schwab maintains a backup and recovery infrastructure which includes facilities for backup and communications, a geographically dispersed workforce, and routine testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans and a well-established incident management program.

Information Security risk is the risk of unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, recording or destruction of the firm’s information or systems. We have designed and implemented an information security program that knits together complementary tools, controls and technologies to protect systems, client accounts and data. We continuously monitor the systems and work collaboratively with government agencies, law enforcement and other financial institutions to address potential threats. We use advanced monitoring systems to identify suspicious activity and deter unauthorized access by internal or external actors. We limit the number of employees who have access to clients’ personal information and internal authentication measures are enforced to protect against the potential for social engineering. All employees who handle sensitive information are trained in privacy and security. Schwab’s conduct and cybersecurity teams monitor activity looking for suspicious behavior. These capabilities allow us to identify and quickly act on any attempted intrusions.
Fraud risk arises from attempted or actual theft of financial assets or other property of any client or the Company. Schwab is committed to protecting the Company’s and its clients’ assets from fraud, and complying with all applicable laws and regulations to prevent, detect and report fraudulent activity. Schwab manages fraud risk through policies, procedures and controls. We also take affirmative steps to prevent and detect fraud and report, to appropriate authorities, any known or suspected acts of fraud in accordance with existing laws and requirements.
Schwab also faces operational risk when we employ the services of various third parties, including domestic and international outsourcing of certain technology, processing, servicing, and support functions. We manage the exposure to third party risk and promote a culture of resiliency through contractual provisions, control standards, ongoing monitoring of third party performance, and appropriate testing. We also maintain policies and procedures regarding the standard of care expected with all data, whether the data is internal company information, employee information, or non-public client information. We clearly define for employees, contractors, and third parties the expected standards of care for critical and confidential data. We also provide regular training on data security.
Model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports. Models are owned by several business units throughout the organization, and are used for a variety of purposes. Model use includes, but is not limited to, calculating capital requirements for hypothetical stressful environments, estimating interest and credit risk for loans and other balance sheet assets, and providing guidance in the management of client portfolios. We have established a policy to describe the roles and responsibilities of all key stakeholders in model development, management, and use. All models are registered in a centralized database and classified into different risk ratings depending on their potential financial, reputational, or regulatory impact to the Company. The model risk rating determines the scope of model governance activities.
Incentive Compensation risk is the potential for adverse consequences resulting from compensation plans that do not balance the execution of our strategy with risk and financial rewards, potentially encouraging imprudent risk-taking by employees. We have implemented risk management processes, including a policy, to identify, evaluate, assess, and manage risks associated with incentive compensation plans and the activities of certain employees, defined as Covered Employees, who have the authority to expose the Company to material amounts of risk.
Compliance Risk
Schwab faces compliance risk which is the potential exposure to legal or regulatory sanctions, fines or penalties, financial loss, or damage to reputation resulting from the failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, or other regulatory requirements. Among other things, compliance risks relate to the suitability of client investments, conflicts of interest, disclosure obligations and performance expectations for products and services, supervision of employees, and the adequacy of our controls. The Company and its affiliates are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and foreign regulatory authorities, including SROs.
We manage compliance risk through policies, procedures and controls reasonably designed to achieve and/or monitor compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. These procedures address issues such as conduct and ethics, sales and trading practices, marketing and communications, extension of credit, client funds and securities, books and records, anti-money laundering, client privacy, and employment policies.
Conduct risk arises from inappropriate, unethical, or unlawful behavior of the Company, its employees or third parties acting on the Company’s behalf that may result in detriment to the Company’s clients, financial markets, the Company, and/or the Company’s employees. We manage this risk through a policy, procedures, a system of internal controls, including personnel

monitoring and surveillance. Conduct-related matters are escalated through appropriate channels by the Corporate Responsibility Officer.
Fiduciary risk is the potential for financial or reputational loss through breach of fiduciary duties to a client. Fiduciary activities include, but are not limited to, individual and institutional trust, investment management, custody, and cash and securities processing. We manage this risk by establishing policy and procedures to ensure that obligations to clients are discharged faithfully and in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Business units have the primary responsibility for adherence to the policy and procedures applicable to their business. Guidance and control are provided through the creation, approval, and ongoing review of applicable policies by business units and various risk committees.
Credit Risk
Credit risk is the potential for loss due to a borrower, counterparty, or issuer failing to perform its contractual obligations. Our exposure to credit risk mainly results from investing activities in our liquidity and investment portfolios, mortgage lending, margin lending and client option and futures activities, pledged asset lending, securities lending activities, and our role as a counterparty in other financial contracts. To manage the risks of such losses, we have established policies and procedures, which include setting and reviewing credit limits, monitoring of credit limits and quality of counterparties, and adjusting margin, PAL, option, and futures requirements for certain securities and instruments.
Liquidity and Investment Portfolios
Schwab has exposure to credit risk associated with its investment portfolios, which include U.S. agency and non-agency mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, U.S. agency notes, U.S. Treasury securities, certificates of deposit, U.S. state and municipal securities, commercial paper, and foreign government agency securities.
At December 31, 2020, substantially all securities in the investment portfolios were rated investment grade. U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities do not have explicit credit ratings; however, management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the U.S. government or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises.
Mortgage Lending Portfolio
The bank loan portfolio includes First Mortgages, HELOCs, and other loans. The credit risk exposure related to loans is actively managed through individual loan and portfolio reviews. Management regularly reviews asset quality, including concentrations, delinquencies, nonaccrual loans, charge-offs, and recoveries. All are factors in the determination of an appropriate allowance for credit losses.
Our residential loan underwriting guidelines include maximum LTV ratios, cash out limits, and minimum Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores. The specific guidelines are dependent on the individual characteristics of a loan (for example, whether the property is a primary or secondary residence, whether the loan is for investment property, whether the loan is for an initial purchase of a home or refinance of an existing home, and whether the loan size is conforming or jumbo).
Schwab does not originate or purchase residential loans that allow for negative amortization and does not originate or purchase subprime loans (generally defined as extensions of credit to borrowers with a FICO score of less than 620 at origination), unless the borrower has compensating credit factors. For more information on credit quality indicators relating to Schwab’s bank loans, see Item 8 - Note 7.
Securities and Instrument-Based Lending Portfolios
Collateral arrangements relating to margin loans, PALs, option and futures positions, securities lending agreements, and securities purchased under agreements to resell (resale agreements) include provisions that require additional collateral in the event of market fluctuations. Additionally, for margin loans, PALs, options and futures positions, and securities lending agreements, collateral arrangements require that the fair value of such collateral sufficiently exceeds the credit exposure in order to maintain a fully secured position.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)
Other Counterparty Exposures
Schwab performs clearing services for all securities transactions in its client accounts. Schwab has exposure to credit risk due to its obligation to settle transactions with clearing corporations, mutual funds, and other financial institutions even if Schwab’s clients or a counterparty fail to meet their obligations to the Company.
Market Risk
Market risk is the potential for changes in earnings or the value of financial instruments held by Schwab as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices, or market conditions. Schwab is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in market interest rates on our interest-earning assets relative to changes in the costs of funding sources that finance these assets.
To manage interest rate risk, we have established policies and procedures, which include setting limits on net interest revenue risk and economic value of equity risk. To remain within these limits, we manage the maturity, repricing, and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios. Management monitors established guidelines to stay within the Company’s risk appetite.
Our measurement of interest rate risk involves assumptions that are inherently uncertain and, as a result, cannot precisely estimate the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue, bank deposit account fees, or economic value of equity (EVE). Actual results may differ from simulated results due to balance growth or decline and the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes, as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies, including changes in asset and liability mix. Financial instruments are also subject to the risk that valuations will be negatively affected by changes in demand and the underlying market for a financial instrument.
We are indirectly exposed to option, futures, and equity market fluctuations in connection with client option and futures accounts, securities collateralizing margin loans to brokerage customers, and client securities loaned out as part of the brokerage securities lending activities. Equity market valuations may also affect the level of brokerage client trading activity, margin borrowing, and overall client engagement with Schwab. Additionally, we earn mutual fund and ETF service fees and asset management fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets. Fluctuations in these client asset balances caused by changes in equity valuations directly impact the amount of fee revenue we earn.
Our market risk related to financial instruments held for trading is not material.
Interest Rate Risk Simulations
Net Interest Revenue Simulation
For our net interest revenue sensitivity analysis, we use net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates. The simulations include all balance sheet interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities. Key assumptions include the projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors, prepayment speeds of mortgage-related investments, repricing of financial instruments, and reinvestment of matured or paid-down securities and loans.
Net interest revenue is affected by various factors, such as the distribution and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the spread between yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which may reprice at different times or by different amounts, and the spread between short and long-term interest rates. Interest-earning assets include investment securities, margin loans, and bank loans. These assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in prepayment levels that tend to increase in a declining rate environment and decrease in a rising rate environment. Because we establish the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and bank deposits and the rates charged on certain margin and bank loans, and control the composition of our investment securities, we have some ability to manage our net interest spread, depending on competitive factors and market conditions.
Net interest revenue sensitivity analysis assumes the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates. As we actively manage the consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure, in all likelihood we would take steps to manage additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment.
- 50 -
THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)
The following table shows the simulated change to net interest revenue over the next 12 months beginning December 31, 2020 and 2019 of a gradual 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates at the end of each reporting period:
The change in sensitivities of net interest revenue as of December 31, 2020 reflects a significantly lower interest rate curve relative to December 31, 2019 due to the global economic impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher short-term interest rates would positively impact net interest revenue as yields on interest-earning assets are expected to rise faster than the cost of funding sources. A decline in interest rates could negatively impact the yield on the Company’s investment and loan portfolio to a greater degree than any offsetting reduction in interest expense from funding sources, compressing net interest margin.
In addition to measuring the effect of a gradual 100 basis point parallel increase or decrease in current interest rates, we regularly simulate the effects of larger parallel- and non-parallel shifts in interest rates on net interest revenue.
Economic Value of Equity Simulation
Management also uses EVE simulations to measure interest rate risk. EVE sensitivity measures the long-term impact of interest rate changes on the net present value of assets and liabilities. EVE is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to hypothetical instantaneous shifts in the level of interest rates. This analysis is highly dependent upon asset and liability assumptions based on historical behaviors as well as our expectations of the economic environment. Key assumptions in our EVE calculation include projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors, prepayment speeds of mortgage-related investments, term structure models of interest rates, non-maturity deposit behavior, and pricing assumptions. Our net interest revenue and EVE simulations reflect the assumption of non-negative investment yields.
Bank Deposit Account Fees Simulations
Consistent with the presentation on our statement of income, the sensitivity of bank deposit account fee revenue to interest rate changes is assessed separately from the interest rate sensitivity analysis described above. As of December 31, 2020, the sensitivity of bank deposit account fee revenue to changes in interest rates is limited, as a significant portion of BDA deposit balances are allocated to fixed-rate obligation amounts.
Expected Phase-out of LIBOR
The Company has established a firm-wide team to address the phasing-out of LIBOR by June 30, 2023. As part of our efforts, we have assessed our LIBOR exposures, the largest of which are certain investment securities and loans. In purchasing new investment securities, we ensure that appropriate fall-back language is in the security’s prospectus in the event that LIBOR is unavailable or deemed unreliable, and we have sold certain securities lacking appropriate fall-back language. We are updating loan agreements to ensure new LIBOR-based loans adequately provide for an alternative to LIBOR. Furthermore, we plan to phase-out the use of LIBOR as a reference rate in our new lending products before the end of December 2021, per guidance from the Federal Reserve Board. Consistent with our “Through Clients’ Eyes” strategy, our focus throughout the LIBOR transition process is to ensure clients are treated fairly and consistently as this major change is occurring in the financial markets.
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the potential that Schwab will be unable to sell assets or meet cash flow obligations when they come due without incurring unacceptable losses.
Due to its role as a source of financial strength, CSC’s liquidity needs are primarily driven by the liquidity and capital needs of: CS&Co, TD Ameritrade, Inc., and TDAC, our principal broker-dealer subsidiaries; the capital needs of the banking subsidiaries; principal and interest due on corporate debt; dividend payments on CSC’s preferred stock; and returns of
- 51 -
THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)
capital to common stockholders. The liquidity needs of our broker-dealer subsidiaries are primarily driven by client activity including trading and margin borrowing activities and capital expenditures. The capital needs of the banking subsidiaries are primarily driven by the amount of client deposits. In addition, the liquidity needs of our banking subsidiaries can also be met by excess reserves held at the Federal Reserve, sales of investment securities, or FHLB borrowings. We have established liquidity policies to support the successful execution of business strategies, while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity to meet operational needs and satisfy applicable regulatory requirements under both normal and stressed conditions. We seek to maintain client confidence in the balance sheet and the safety of client assets by maintaining liquidity and diversity of funding sources to allow the Company to meet its obligations. To this end, we have established limits and contingency funding scenarios to support liquidity levels during both business as usual and stressed conditions.
We employ a variety of methodologies to monitor and manage liquidity. We conduct regular liquidity stress testing to develop a consolidated view of liquidity risk exposures and to ensure our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity during market-related or company-specific liquidity stress events. Liquidity is also tested at certain subsidiaries and results are reported to the Financial Risk Oversight Committee. A number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify emerging liquidity stresses in the market or within the organization and are reviewed with management as appropriate.
Primary Funding Sources
Schwab’s primary source of funds is cash generated by client activity which includes bank deposits and cash balances in client brokerage accounts. These funds are used to purchase investment securities and extend loans to clients.
Other sources of funds may include cash flows from operations, maturities and sales of investment securities, repayments on loans, securities lending of assets held in client brokerage accounts, bank deposit account fees earned on client deposits placed in third-party depository programs, repurchase agreements, and cash provided by external financing.
To meet daily funding needs, we maintain liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits and short-term investments. For unanticipated liquidity needs, we also maintain a buffer of highly liquid investments, including U.S. Treasury securities.
Additional Funding Sources
In addition to internal sources of liquidity, Schwab has access to external funding. The need for short-term borrowings from external debt facilities arises primarily from timing differences between cash flow requirements, scheduled liquidation of interest-earning investments, movements of cash to meet regulatory brokerage client cash segregation requirements and general corporate purposes. We maintain policies and procedures necessary to access funding and test discount window borrowing procedures on a periodic basis.

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)
The following table describes external debt facilities available at December 31, 2020:
(1) Amounts available are dependent on the amount of First Mortgages, HELOCs, and the fair value of certain investment securities that are pledged as collateral.
(2) Amounts available are dependent on the fair value of certain investment securities that are pledged as collateral.
(3) CSC has authorization from its Board of Directors to issue Commercial Paper Notes not to exceed $1.5 billion. In February 2021, the Company increased the amount available to $1.5 billion.
(4) Other than an overnight borrowing to test availability, this facility was unused during 2020.
(5) Effective October 6, 2020, Schwab entered into a guaranty supplement to guarantee the obligations of TD Ameritrade under this credit agreement. The provision of the guaranty supplement was a condition for certain financial covenant and reporting obligations being modified in the credit agreement. The Company terminated this revolving credit facility effective January 28, 2021.
(6) Secured borrowing is made available based on TDAC’s ability to provide acceptable collateral to the lender as determined by the credit agreement.
Our banking subsidiaries maintain secured credit facilities with the FHLB. Amounts available under these facilities are dependent on the value of our First Mortgages, HELOCs, and the fair value of certain of our investment securities that are pledged as collateral. These credit facilities are also available as backup financing in the event the outflow of client cash from the banking subsidiaries’ respective balance sheets is greater than maturities and paydowns on investment securities and bank loans.
Our banking subsidiaries also have access to short-term secured funding through the Federal Reserve discount window. Amounts available under the Federal Reserve discount window are dependent on the fair value of certain investment securities that are pledged as collateral.
CSC has a commercial paper program of which proceeds are used for general corporate purposes. The maturities of the Commercial Paper Notes may vary, but are not to exceed 270 days from the date of issue. CSC’s ratings for these short-term borrowings were P1 by Moody’s, A1 by Standard & Poor’s, and by Fitch at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and CSC had no Commercial Paper Notes outstanding at December 31, 2020 or 2019.
The financial covenants for the $700 million committed credit facility require CS&Co to maintain a minimum net capital ratio, all bank subsidiaries to be well capitalized, and CSC to maintain a minimum level of stockholders’ equity, adjusted to exclude AOCI. At December 31, 2020, the minimum level of stockholders’ equity required under this facility was $16.5 billion (CSC’s stockholders’ equity, excluding AOCI, at December 31, 2020 was $50.7 billion). Management believes these restrictions will not have a material effect on CSC’s ability to meet foreseeable dividend or funding requirements.
The financial covenants for the $300 million TDA Holding revolving credit facility requires CSC to maintain a minimum level of stockholders’ equity, adjusted to exclude AOCI. At December 31, 2020, the minimum level of stockholders’ equity required under this facility was $30.9 billion (CSC’s stockholders’ equity, excluding AOCI, at December 31, 2020 was $50.7 billion). Effective January 28, 2021, the Company terminated the TDA Holding revolving credit facility.
To partially satisfy the margin requirement of client option transactions with the Options Clearing Corporation, CS&Co has unsecured standby letter of credit agreements (LOCs) with several banks in favor of the Options Clearing Corporation, which totaled $15 million at December 31, 2020. There were no funds drawn under any of these LOCs during 2020 or 2019. In connection with its securities lending activities, the Company is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. These collateral requirements are satisfied by providing cash as collateral.
CSC has a universal automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, which enables it to issue debt, equity, and other securities.

Liquidity Coverage Ratio
Pursuant to the 2019 interagency regulatory capital and liquidity rules, beginning in the first quarter of 2020, Schwab became subject to a reduced LCR rule requiring the Company to hold HQLA in an amount equal to at least 85% of the Company’s projected net cash outflows over a prospective 30-calendar-day period of acute liquidity stress, calculated on each business day. See Item 1 - Regulation for additional information. The Company was in compliance with the reduced LCR rule at December 31, 2020. The table below presents information about our average daily LCR:
Borrowings
The Company had no short-term borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2020 or 2019. Long-term debt outstanding was $13.6 billion and $7.4 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Effective October 6, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of TD Ameritrade. TDA Holding has $3.6 billion of par value unsecured Senior Notes (TDA Senior Notes) outstanding, which were recognized at the date of acquisition at provisional fair value with no change in existing terms.
The following are details of the Senior Notes:
New Debt Issuances
All debt issuances in 2020, 2019, and 2018 were senior unsecured obligations. Additional details are as follows:

For further discussion of CSC’s long-term debt and information on the equity offerings, see Item 8 - Notes 13 and 19.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Schwab enters into various off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, primarily to meet the needs of our clients. These arrangements include firm commitments to extend credit. Additionally, Schwab enters into guarantees and other similar arrangements in the ordinary course of business. For information on each of these arrangements, see Item 8 - Notes 7, 11, 13, 15, and 17. Concurrent with the closing of the acquisition of TD Ameritrade effective October 6, 2020, the IDA agreement with the TD Depository Institutions became effective. Pursuant to the IDA agreement, certain brokerage client deposits are required to be swept off-balance sheet to the TD Depository Institutions. TD Ameritrade also maintains agreements pursuant to which client brokerage cash deposits are swept to other third-party depository institutions. See Item 8 - Notes 3 and 15 for additional information on the IDA agreement.
Contractual Obligations
Schwab’s principal contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 are shown in the following table. Excluded from this table are liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets that are generally short-term in nature or without contractual payment terms (e.g., bank deposits, payables to brokerage clients, and deferred compensation). The below table excludes exit and other related liabilities from the integration of TD Ameritrade (see Item 8 - Note 16), as well as obligations related to the IDA agreement (see Item 8 - Note 15).
(1) Represents CSB’s commitments to extend credit to banking clients, purchase mortgage loans, and fund CRA investments.
(2) Includes estimated future interest payments through 2031 for Senior Notes. Amounts exclude unamortized discounts and premiums.
(3) Consists of purchase obligations for services such as advertising and marketing, telecommunications, professional services, and hardware- and software-related agreements.
(4) Represents operating lease payments including legally-binding minimum lease payments for leases signed but not yet commenced.
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
Schwab seeks to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support execution of our business strategy, including anticipated balance sheet growth inclusive of migration of IDA balances (see further discussion below), providing financial support to our subsidiaries, and sustained access to the capital markets, while at the same time meeting our regulatory capital requirements and serving as a source of financial strength to our banking subsidiaries. Schwab’s primary sources of capital are funds generated by the operations of subsidiaries and securities issuances by CSC in the capital markets. To ensure that Schwab has sufficient capital to absorb unanticipated losses or declines in asset values, we have adopted a policy to remain well capitalized even in stressed scenarios.
- 55 -
THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)
Internal guidelines are set, for both CSC and its regulated subsidiaries, to ensure capital levels are in line with our strategy and regulatory requirements. Capital forecasts are reviewed monthly at Asset-Liability Management and Pricing Committee and Financial Risk Oversight Committee meetings. A number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify potential problems that could impact capital. In addition, we monitor the subsidiaries’ capital levels and requirements. Subject to regulatory capital requirements and any required approvals, any excess capital held by subsidiaries is transferred to CSC in the form of dividends and returns of capital. When subsidiaries have need of additional capital, funds are provided by CSC as equity investments and also as subordinated loans (in a form approved as regulatory capital by regulators) for CS&Co. The details and method used for each cash infusion are based on an analysis of the particular entity’s needs and financing alternatives. The amounts and structure of infusions must take into consideration maintenance of regulatory capital requirements, debt/equity ratios, and equity double leverage ratios.
Schwab conducts regular capital stress testing to assess the potential financial impacts of various adverse macroeconomic and company-specific events to which the Company could be subjected. The objective of the capital stress testing is (1) to explore various potential outcomes - including rare and extreme events and (2) to assess impacts of potential stressful outcomes on both capital and liquidity. Additionally, we have a comprehensive Capital Contingency Plan to provide action plans for certain low probability/high impact capital events that the Company might face. The Capital Contingency Plan is issued under the authority of the Financial Risk Oversight Committee and provides guidelines for sustained capital events. It does not specifically address every contingency, but is designed to provide a framework for responding to any capital stress. The results of the stress testing indicate there are two scenarios which could stress the Company’s capital: (1) inflows of balance sheet cash during a period of very low interest rates and (2) outflows of balance sheet cash when other sources of financing are not available and the Company is required to sell assets to fund the flows at a loss. The Capital Contingency Plan is reviewed annually and updated as appropriate.
For additional information, see Business - Regulation in Part I, Item 1.
Regulatory Capital Requirements
CSC is subject to capital requirements set by the Federal Reserve and is required to serve as a source of strength for our banking subsidiaries and to provide financial assistance if our banking subsidiaries experience financial distress. Schwab is required to maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio for CSC of at least 4%, and we have a long-term operating objective of 6.75%-7.00%. Due to the relatively low risk of our balance sheet assets and risk-based capital ratios at CSC and CSB that are well in excess of regulatory requirements, the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio is the most restrictive capital constraint on CSC’s asset growth.
Our banking subsidiaries are subject to capital requirements set by their regulators that are substantially similar to those imposed on CSC by the Federal Reserve. Our banking subsidiaries’ failure to remain well capitalized could result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that could have a direct material effect on the banks. Schwab’s principal banking subsidiary, CSB, is required to maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of at least 5% to be well capitalized, but seeks to maintain a ratio of at least 6.25%. Based on its regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2020, CSB is considered well capitalized.
As a result of the significant inflow of client cash in 2020, our Tier 1 Leverage Ratios for CSC and CSB declined from 7.3% and 7.1%, respectively, at year-end 2019 to 6.3% and 5.5%, respectively, at December 31, 2020. Though below our long-term operating objectives, these ratios are well above the regulatory minimum for both CSC and CSB. The pace of our return to the long-term operating objectives over time depends on a number of factors including the overall size of the Company’s balance sheet, earnings, and capital issuances and deployment.
- 56 -
THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)
The following table details the capital ratios for CSC consolidated and CSB:
(1) In the interagency regulatory capital and liquidity rules adopted in October 2019, Category III banking organizations such as CSC were given the ability to opt-out of the inclusion of AOCI in regulatory capital, and CSC made this opt-out election as of January 1, 2020. Therefore, AOCI is excluded from the amounts and ratios presented as of December 31, 2020. In 2019, CSC and CSB were required to include all components of AOCI in regulatory capital; the amounts and ratios for December 31, 2019 are presented on this basis. See Business - Regulation in Part I, Item 1 for additional information.
CSB is also subject to regulatory requirements that restrict and govern the terms of affiliate transactions. In addition, CSB is required to provide notice to, and may be required to obtain approval from, the Federal Reserve and the Texas Department of Savings and Mortgage Lending (TDSML) to declare dividends to CSC. As broker-dealers, CS&Co, TDAC, and TD Ameritrade, Inc., are subject to regulatory requirements of the Uniform Net Capital Rule, which is intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. These regulations prohibit the broker-dealer subsidiaries from paying cash dividends, making unsecured advances and loans to CSC and employees, and repaying subordinated borrowings from CSC if such payment would result in a net capital amount below prescribed thresholds. At December 31, 2020, CS&Co, TDAC, and TD Ameritrade, Inc. were in compliance with their respective net capital requirements.
In addition to the capital requirements above, Schwab’s subsidiaries are subject to other regulatory requirements intended to ensure financial soundness and liquidity. See Item 8 - Note 23 for additional information on the components of stockholders’ equity and information on the capital requirements of significant subsidiaries.
IDA Agreement
Pursuant to the IDA agreement, Schwab will be required to move all uninsured IDA balances out of the IDA sweep program on June 30, 2021. The IDA agreement also provides that, starting July 1, 2021, Schwab will have the option to migrate up to $10 billion of IDA balances every 12 months to Schwab’s balance sheet, subject to certain limitations and adjustments. The Company’s overall capital management strategy includes supporting migration of the uninsured IDA balances on June 30, 2021 as well as optional IDA balances in future periods as available pursuant to the terms of the IDA agreement. The Company’s ability to migrate these balances to its balance sheet is dependent upon multiple factors including having sufficient capital levels to sustain these incremental deposits and the availability of IDA balances designated as floating-rate obligations. See Item 8 - Note 15 for further information on the IDA agreement.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Schwab uses the market approach to determine the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, and to determine fair value disclosures. See Item 8 - Notes 2 and 18 for more information on our assets and liabilities recorded at fair value.
When available, Schwab uses quoted prices in active markets to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities. Quoted prices for investments in exchange-traded securities represent end-of-day close prices published by exchanges. Quoted prices for money market funds and other mutual funds represent reported net asset values. When utilizing market data and bid-ask spread, we use the price within the bid-ask spread that best represents fair value. When quoted prices in active markets do not exist, prices are obtained from independent third-party pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets. We generally obtain prices from three independent pricing sources for assets recorded at fair value. Our primary third-party pricing service provides prices for our fixed income investments such as commercial paper; certificates of deposits; U.S. government and agency securities; state and municipal securities; corporate debt securities; asset-backed securities; foreign government agency securities; and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. Such prices are based on observable trades, broker/dealer quotes, and discounted cash flows that incorporate observable information such as yields for similar types of securities (a benchmark interest rate plus observable spreads) and weighted-average maturity for the same or similar “to-be-issued” securities. We compare the prices obtained from the primary independent pricing service to the prices obtained from the additional independent pricing services to determine if the price obtained from the primary independent pricing service is reasonable. Schwab does not adjust the prices received from independent third-party pricing services unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in material differences in the amounts recorded. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we did not adjust prices received from the primary independent third-party pricing service.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The consolidated financial statements of Schwab have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Item 8 - Note 2 contains more information on our significant accounting policies made in applying these accounting principles.
While the majority of the revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are not based on estimates, there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on Schwab’s financial position and financial results. These critical accounting estimates are described below. Management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy.
Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Additionally, management has reviewed with the Audit Committee the Company’s significant estimates discussed in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Income Taxes
Schwab estimates income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, including federal, state and local domestic jurisdictions, and immaterial amounts owed to several foreign jurisdictions. The estimated income tax expense is reported in the consolidated statements of income in taxes on income. Accrued taxes are reported in other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from taxing jurisdictions either currently or deferred to future periods. Deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting purposes versus income tax reporting purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in management’s judgment, their realizability is determined to be more likely than not. Uncertain tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit management believes is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. In estimating accrued taxes, we assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment considering statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position. Because of the complexity of tax laws and regulations, interpretation can be difficult and subject to legal judgment given specific facts and circumstances.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)
Changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax laws, the status of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities, and newly enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance that impacts the relative merits and risks of tax positions. These changes, when they occur, affect accrued taxes and can be significant to the operating results of the Company. See Item 8 - Note 22 for more information on the Company’s income taxes.
Legal and Regulatory Reserves
Reserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter, after considering, among other factors, the progress of the case, prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases, available defenses, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. In many cases, including most class action lawsuits, it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred, or to estimate the range of that loss, until the matter is close to resolution, in which case no accrual is made until that time. Reserves are adjusted as more information becomes available. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates, and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved. See Item 8 - Note 15 for more information on the Company’s contingencies related to legal and regulatory reserves.
Business Combinations
We have accounted for our acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date as we allocate the purchase price to the estimated fair values of acquired tangible and intangible assets and the liabilities assumed. We also use our best estimates to determine the useful lives of the tangible and definite-lived intangible assets, which impact the periods over which depreciation and amortization of those assets are recognized. These best estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain as they pertain to forward looking views of our businesses, client behavior, and market conditions. In our acquisitions, we have also recognized goodwill at the amount by which the purchase price paid exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired. See Item 8 - Note 3 for more information on our valuation methods and the results of applying the acquisition method of accounting, including the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and, where relevant, the estimated remaining useful lives.
Our ongoing accounting for goodwill and the tangible and intangible assets acquired requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions as we exercise judgement to evaluate these assets for impairment. Our processes and accounting policies for evaluating impairments are further described in Item 8 - Note 2. One of our reporting units has an immaterial amount of goodwill. The results of the 2020 annual goodwill impairment testing for our other two reporting units indicated that the estimated fair values substantially exceeded their carrying amounts.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
In addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with GAAP, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain references to the non-GAAP financial measures described below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information about the financial performance of the Company, and facilitate meaningful comparison of Schwab’s results in the current period to both historic and future results. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies.

Schwab’s use of non-GAAP measures is reflective of certain adjustments made to GAAP financial measures as described below.
Non-GAAP Adjustment or Measure Definition Usefulness to Investors and Uses by Management
Acquisition and integration-related costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets Schwab adjusts certain GAAP financial measures to exclude the impact of acquisition and integration-related costs incurred as a result of the Company’s acquisitions, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and, where applicable, the income tax effect of these expenses.
Adjustments made to exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets are reflective of all acquired intangible assets, which were recorded as part of purchase accounting. These acquired intangible assets contribute to the Company’s revenue generation. Amortization of acquired intangible assets will continue in future periods over their remaining useful lives. We exclude acquisition and integration-related costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets for the purpose of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because we believe doing so provides additional transparency of Schwab’s ongoing operations, and is useful in both evaluating the operating performance of the business and facilitating comparison of results with prior and future periods.
Acquisition and integration-related costs fluctuate based on the timing of acquisitions and integration activities, thereby limiting comparability of results among periods, and are not representative of the costs of running the Company’s ongoing business. Amortization of acquired intangible assets is excluded because management does not believe it is indicative of the Company’s underlying operating performance.
Return on tangible common equity Return on tangible common equity represents annualized adjusted net income available to common stockholders as a percentage of average tangible common equity. Tangible common equity represents common equity less goodwill, acquired intangible assets - net, and related deferred tax liabilities. Acquisitions typically result in the recognition of significant amounts of goodwill and acquired intangible assets. We believe return on tangible common equity may be useful to investors as a supplemental measure to facilitate assessing capital efficiency and returns relative to the composition of Schwab’s balance sheet.
Beginning in 2021, the Company also uses adjusted diluted EPS and return on tangible common equity as components of performance criteria for employee bonus and certain executive management incentive compensation arrangements. The Compensation Committee of CSC’s Board of Directors maintains discretion in evaluating performance against these criteria.
The following tables present reconciliations of GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures:
(1) Acquisition and integration-related costs for 2020 primarily consist of $235 million of compensation and benefits, $158 million of professional services, and $30 million of other expense. Substantially all acquisition and integration-related costs for 2019 are included in professional services expense.

(1) The income tax effects of the non-GAAP adjustments are determined using an effective tax rate reflecting the exclusion of non-deductible acquisition costs and are used to present the acquisition and integration-related costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets on an after-tax basis.
