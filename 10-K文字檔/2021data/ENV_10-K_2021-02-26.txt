Recent Developments
Uncertainties Related to COVID-19
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic disease. We are closely monitoring developments with the COVID-19 pandemic and are taking proactive measures to ensure business continuity. Our priority is to protect the well-being of our employees, while we continue to provide uninterrupted service and support to our clients. As part of our existing business continuity protocol, we created a pandemic steering committee that meets regularly and communicates information or guidance to our employees and customers.
We have instituted travel bans and are following mandatory stay-at-home orders where applicable. A majority of our employees are working from home as a result of these stay-at-home orders. Where permissible, we have also implemented in-office work rotations. For employees working at our offices, preventative measures have been taken, including the adapting of work spaces to allow for appropriate social distancing and enhanced cleaning regimens. We also canceled our 2020 and 2021 in-person Advisor Summit Conferences, instead offering a reimagined Advisor Summit On-Demand, which allows participants access to a library of online sessions. We continue to monitor developments related to COVID-19 and, as the situation evolves, will continue to coordinate our operations response based on existing business continuity plans and on guidance from global health organizations, relevant governments and general response pandemic best practices. The actions that we took in 2020 resulted in lower operating expenses in certain areas, particularly travel and marketing. We expect our operating expenses to increase as COVID-related restrictions are removed and business activity improves.
At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, significant declines occurred within the equity markets. This is significant to us as we provide asset-based, subscription-based and professional services on a business-to-business-to-consumer basis to financial services clients, whereby customers offer solutions based on our platform to their end users. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, approximately 54% of our revenues resulted from asset-based fee billing arrangements. Asset-based recurring revenues primarily consisted of fees for providing customers access to our platforms. These fees are generally based upon variable percentages of assets managed or administered under our platforms. Our fee percentages vary based on the level and type of services that we provide to our customers, as well as the values of existing customer accounts. The values of our customer accounts are affected by inflows or outflows of customer funds and market fluctuations. Approximately 75% of our asset-based fee arrangements are billed at the beginning of each quarter based on the market value of customer assets on our platforms as of the end of the prior quarter.
As a result of the structure of our revenue arrangements and our customer-types, our revenues during the three months ended March 31, 2020 were not materially impacted by COVID-19. While we experienced a decrease to our asset-based revenues in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the first quarter of 2020 as a result of the decline in the equity markets as of March 31, 2020, our asset-based revenues were minimally impacted in the third quarter of 2020 as the equity markets have generally recovered to pre-pandemic levels. We have experienced no business interruptions, nor did we lose any significant customers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, approximately 43% of revenues were subscription-based. These revenues primarily consisted of fees for providing customers continuous access to our platforms. These subscription-based fees generally include fixed fees or usage-based fees. These fees vary based on the services being offered. Our subscription-based fee arrangements are typically established through multi-year contracts.
In the event that the equity markets fall again as a result of COVID-19 or for any other reason, our revenues will be negatively impacted. Based on our most recent internal forecasts and other qualitative factors, we have determined that we currently have no impairments to our assets as of December 31, 2020.
We have not modified our revolving credit agreement in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, in August 2020, we successfully acquired additional financing in the form of convertible notes on terms favorable to the Company.
On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) was signed into law. One provision of the CARES Act provides a five-year carryback of net operating losses (“NOLs”) generated in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2021. We estimate a refund of approximately $1,200 from the carryback of NOLs.
Investment in Private Services Company
On January 8, 2020, we acquired a 4.25% membership interest in a private services company for cash consideration of $11,000. The private services company partners with independent network advisory firms to help them grow, become more profitable and run more efficiently. We account for this investment under the equity method basis of accounting.
Acquisition of Private Technology Company
On February 18, 2020, through our wholly owned subsidiary Yodlee, Inc. (“Yodlee”), we acquired a private technology company (the “Private Technology Company Acquisition”). The private technology company enables the consent generation and data flow between financial information providers, such as banks and financial institutions, and financial information users, such as financial technology lenders and other financial services agencies, through a network of cloud-based interoperable interfaces or application programming interfaces. The technology and operations of the private technology company have been integrated into our Envestnet Data & Analytics segment.
In connection with the Private Technology Company Acquisition, we acquired all of the outstanding shares and paid cash consideration of $2,343, net of cash acquired, subject to certain closing and post-closing adjustments, plus up to an additional $6,750 in contingent consideration, based upon the achievement of certain performance targets. On the date of acquisition, we recorded a liability of approximately $5,239, which represented the estimated fair value of contingent consideration as of that date.
In 2020, we determined that certain performance targets for this acquisition would not be met. As a result, we reduced the contingent consideration liability plus accrued interest associated with this acquisition by $3,105 and recorded this as a reduction to general and administration expenses. Future changes to the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration, if any, will be recognized in our earnings.
We recorded estimated goodwill of $7,019, which is not deductible for income tax purposes, and estimated identifiable intangible assets for proprietary technologies of $1,000. The tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed were not material.
Acquisition of Private Cloud Technology Company
On March 2, 2020, we acquired certain assets of a private cloud technology company (the “Private Cloud Technology Company Acquisition”). The private cloud technology company enables enterprises to design and implement the digital
transition from legacy systems and applications to a modern cloud computing platform. The technology and operations of the private cloud technology company have been integrated into our Envestnet Wealth Solutions segment.
In connection with the Private Cloud Technology Company Acquisition, we paid estimated consideration of $11,968, net of cash acquired. In connection with the acquisition, we recorded estimated goodwill of $10,932, which is deductible for income tax purposes. The tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed were not material.
Acquisition of Private Financial Technology Design Company
On March 3, 2020, we acquired the outstanding units of a private financial technology design company that were not owned by the Company and merged the acquired company into a wholly owned subsidiary of ours (the “Private Financial Technology Design Company Acquisition”). The private financial technology design company designs integrated, intuitive digital technology applications for institutional financial services firms, bank wealth management organizations, independent advisor networks, and broker-dealers. The technology and operations of the private financial technology design company have been integrated into our Envestnet Wealth Solutions segment.
We previously owned approximately 45% of the outstanding units in this private financial technology design company, and accounted for it as an equity method investment. Based upon the estimated value of the private financial technology design company of $11,026, we paid estimated consideration of $5,946, net of cash acquired, for the remaining outstanding units. As a result of the acquisition, we recognized a gain of $4,230 on the re-measurement to fair value of its previously held interest, which is included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.
In connection with the Private Financial Technology Design Company Acquisition, we recorded estimated total goodwill of $9,241, of which approximately $6,232 is deductible for income tax purposes, and estimated identifiable intangible assets for proprietary technologies of $2,000. The tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed were not material.
Private Offering of Convertible Notes due 2025
In August 2020, we issued $517,500 of convertible notes maturing on August 15, 2025 (“Convertible Notes due 2025”). Net proceeds from the offering were approximately $503,000. The Convertible Notes due 2025 bear interest at a rate of 0.75 percent per annum payable semiannually in arrears in cash on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on February 15, 2021.
The Convertible Notes due 2025 are general unsecured obligations, subordinated in right of payment to our obligations under our revolving credit facility. The Convertible Notes due 2025 are convertible into shares of our common stock under certain circumstances prior to maturity at a conversion rate of 9.3682 shares per one thousand principal amount of notes, which represents a conversion price of $106.74 per share, subject to adjustment under certain conditions. See Part II, Item 8, “Note 10-Debt, Convertible Notes due 2025” for more details regarding the issuance of these convertible notes.
Early Retirement Program
In the fourth quarter of 2019, we offered a voluntary early retirement program (the “Early Retirement Program”) to employees over a certain age, who have a combined age and years of experience with the Company of at least 65 years. Employees had until January 31, 2020 to voluntarily accept the program with separation of service no later than March 31, 2020. In connection with this program, we recorded approximately $12,500 of severance expense during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we have accrued approximately $1,904 in future payments that extend through 2030.
Organizational Realignment
In the fourth quarter of 2020, as part of an organizational realignment, we entered into separation agreements with several employees. In connection with this realignment, we recognized approximately $5,100 of severance expense during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, with an additional $5,300 of severance expense expected to be recognized in the first half of 2021. As of December 31, 2020, we have accrued approximately $5,100 in accrued compensation and related taxes associated with these separation agreements.
Executive Leadership Appointments
Effective March 30, 2020, our Board of Directors (the “Board”) appointed Bill Crager as Envestnet's Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), a role he had held on an interim basis following the passing of our former Chairperson and CEO Judson Bergman in 2019. Additionally, on March 30, 2020 the Board appointed Stuart DePina as Envestnet's President. James Fox, a current member of our Board, was named Chairperson of the Board.
Key Metrics
Envestnet Wealth Solutions Segment
The following table provides information regarding the amount of assets utilizing our platforms, financial advisors and investor accounts in the periods indicated:
The following table provides information regarding the degree to which gross sales, redemptions, net flows and changes in the market values of assets contributed to changes in AUM or AUA in the periods indicated:
The above AUM/A gross sales figures include $38.6 billion in new client conversions. We onboarded an additional $119.6 billion in subscription conversions during 2020, bringing total conversions for the year to $158.2 billion.
The above AUM/A gross sales figures include $31.5 billion in new client conversions. We onboarded an additional $297.9 billion in subscription conversions during 2019, bringing total conversions for the year to $329.4 billion.
Asset and account figures in the “Reclass to Subscription” columns for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 represent enterprise customers whose billing arrangements in future periods are subscription-based, rather than asset-based. Such amounts are included in Subscription metrics at the end of the quarter in which the reclassification occurred, with no impact on total platform assets or accounts.
Envestnet Data & Analytics Segment
Paid Users
A paid user is defined as a user of an application or service provided to our customer using the Envestnet Data & Analytics platform whose status corresponds to a billable activity under the associated customer contract. We believe that our ability to increase the number of paid users is an indicator of our market penetration, the growth of our business, and our potential future business opportunities.
Paid users were approximately 35.0 million, 25.0 million and 23.3 million as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in our number of customers as well as expansion of user base within certain existing customers.
Revenues
Overview
We earn revenues primarily under three pricing models. First, a majority of our revenues is derived from fees charged as a percentage of the assets that are managed or administered on our technology platforms by financial advisors. These revenues are recorded under asset-based revenues. Our asset-based fees vary based on the types of investment solutions and services that financial advisors utilize. Asset-based fees accounted for approximately 54%, 54% and 59% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In future periods, the percentage of our total revenues attributable to asset-based fees is expected to vary based on fluctuations in securities markets, whether we enter into significant subscription agreements, the mix of AUM or AUA, and other factors.
We also generate revenues from recurring, contractual subscription fees for providing access to our technology platforms. This subscription revenue includes both contractual minimum payments and usage-based fees and is driven primarily by the number of customers, including new customers as well as customers who renew their existing subscription contracts, and the number of paid users. These revenues are recorded under subscription-based revenues. Subscription fees vary based on the scope of technology solutions and services being used, and are priced in a variety of constructs based on the size of the business, number of users or number of accounts and in many cases can increase over time based on the growth of these factors. Subscription fees accounted for 43%, 42% and 36% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Finally, a portion of our revenues are generated from fees received in connection with professional services and other revenue.
Asset-based recurring revenues
We generally charge our customers fees based on a higher percentage of the market value of AUM than the fees we charge on the market value of AUA, because we provide fiduciary oversight and/or act as the investment advisor in connection with assets we categorize as AUM. The level of fees varies based on the nature of the investment solutions and services we provide, as well as the specific investment manager, fund and/or custodian chosen by the financial advisor. A portion of our revenues from assets under management or administration include costs paid by us to third parties for sub-advisory, clearing, custody and brokerage services. These expenses are recorded under cost of revenues. We do not have fiduciary responsibility in connection with AUA and, therefore, generally charge lower fees on these assets. Our fees for AUA vary based on the nature of the investment solutions and services we provide.
For approximately 75% of our asset-based recurring revenues from assets under management or administration, we bill customers at the beginning of each quarter based on the market value of customer assets on our platforms as of the end of the prior quarter. For example, asset-based recurring revenues recognized during the fourth quarter of 2020 were primarily based on the market value of assets as of September 30, 2020. Our asset-based recurring revenues are generally recognized ratably throughout the quarter based on the number of days in the quarter.
Our asset-based recurring revenues are affected by the amount of new assets that are added to existing and new client accounts, which we refer to as gross sales. Gross sales, from time to time, also include conversions of client assets to our technology platforms. The amounts of assets that are withdrawn from client accounts are referred to as redemptions. We refer to the difference between gross sales and redemptions as net flows. Positive net flows indicate that the market value of assets added to client accounts exceeds the market value of assets that have been withdrawn from client accounts.
Our asset-based revenues are also affected by changes in the market values of securities held in client accounts due to fluctuations in the securities markets. Certain types of securities have historically experienced greater market price fluctuations, such as equity securities, than other securities, such as fixed income securities, though in any given period the type of securities that experience the greatest fluctuations may vary.
Subscription-based recurring revenues
Subscription-based recurring revenues are recognized ratably over the contracted term of each respective subscription agreement, commencing on the date the service is provisioned to the customer, provided all applicable revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. As part of the subscription contracts, our customers generally commit to a minimum level of paid users from which a minimum level of non-refundable subscription revenue is derived. As paid users in excess of the guaranteed minimum level access the platform, the customer is then required to pay additional usage fees calculated based upon a contracted per-paid-user fee. No refunds or credits are given if fewer paid users access the platform than the contracted minimum level. Usage-based revenue is recognized as earned, provided all applicable revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied.
Professional services and other revenues
To a lesser degree we also receive revenues from professional services fees by providing customers with certain technology platform software development and implementation services. These revenues are recognized when completed, under a proportional-performance model utilizing an output-based approach or on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the customer relationship. Our contracts generally have fixed prices and generally specify or quantify interim deliverables.
Expenses
The following is a description of our principal expense items:
Cost of revenues
Cost of revenues primarily includes expenses related to our receipt of sub-advisory and clearing, custody and brokerage services from third parties. The largest component of cost of revenues is paid to third party investment managers. Clearing, custody and brokerage services are performed by third-party providers. These expenses are typically calculated based upon a contractual percentage of the market value of assets held in customer accounts measured as of the end of each fiscal quarter and are recognized ratably throughout the quarter based on the number of days in the quarter. Also included in cost of revenues are vendor specific expenses related to the direct support of revenues associated with the Envestnet Data & Analytics products.
Compensation and benefits
Compensation and benefits expenses primarily relate to employee compensation, including salaries, short-term incentive compensation, non-cash stock-based compensation, incentive compensation, benefits and employer-related taxes.
General and administration
General and administration expenses include costs and expenses related to occupancy, communications services, research and data services, website and system development, marketing, professional and legal services, travel and entertainment and acquisition/transaction related expenses.
Depreciation and amortization
Depreciation and amortization expenses include depreciation and amortization related to:
•fixed assets, including land, building and building improvements, computer equipment and software, leasehold improvements, office furniture and fixtures and office equipment and other;
•internally developed software; and
•intangible assets, primarily related to customer lists, proprietary technology and trade names, the values of which are capitalized in connection with our acquisitions.
Building, furniture and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated economic useful lives or the remaining lease term, whichever is shorter. Improvements are capitalized, while repairs and maintenance costs are recorded as expenses in the period they are incurred. Assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable.
Internally developed software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.
Intangible assets are depreciated using an accelerated or straight-line basis over their estimated economic useful lives and are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.
Interest income
Interest income primarily includes amounts earned on our bank accounts and money market funds.
Interest expense
Interest expense includes coupon interest, discount amortization and issuance cost amortization related our convertible note issuances, as well as interest and amortization of upfront fees and monthly fees related to our Amended Credit Agreement. See Part II, Item 8, “Note 10-Debt” for details. The discount, issuance costs and upfront fees are amortized over the term of the related agreements. As of January 1, 2021, we plan to adopt FASB ASU 2020-06, “Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity.” We expect our interest expense to decrease as a result of adopting this new standard.
Other income (expense), net
Other income (expense), net includes gains (losses) on our portion of our equity method investees' results and foreign exchange gains or losses as well as other miscellaneous income or expense items as appropriate.
Results of Operations
*Not meaningful
Year ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019
Asset-based recurring revenues
Asset-based recurring revenues increased 12% from $484,312 in 2019 to $540,947 in 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in asset values applicable to our quarterly billing cycle as a result of the upswing in the equity markets relative to the comparable 2019 period. In 2020, revenues were also positively affected by new account growth and positive net flows of AUM/A.
The number of financial advisors with AUM or AUA on our technology platforms increased from 40,563 as of December 31, 2019 to 41,206 as of December 31, 2020 and the number of AUM or AUA client accounts increased from approximately 2.1 million as of December 31, 2019 to approximately 2.4 million as of December 31, 2020.
Asset-based recurring revenue was 54% of total revenue for both years.
Subscription-based recurring revenues
Subscription-based recurring revenues increased 13% from $378,813 in 2019 to $426,507 in 2020. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $41,204 in the Envestnet Wealth Solutions segment and an increase of $6,490 in the Envestnet Data & Analytics segment.
The increase in the Envestnet Wealth Solutions segment was primarily due to our 2019 acquisitions of PortfolioCenter and Pietech, Inc. (collectively, the “2019 Acquisitions”) and growth from new and existing customers.
The increase in Envestnet Data & Analytics revenue was primarily due to broad increases in revenue from new and existing customers.
Professional services and other revenues
Professional services and other revenues decreased 17% from $37,002 in 2019 to $30,776 in 2020. The decrease was due to timing of the completion of customer projects and deployments, as well as a decrease in revenues resulting from the cancellation of our 2020 Advisor Summit.
Cost of revenues
Cost of revenues increased 10% from $278,811 in 2019 to $305,929 in 2020, primarily due to an increase in asset-based cost of revenues of $34,656, partially offset by decreases in professional services and other revenues of $5,568 and subscription-based cost of revenues of $1,970. As a percentage of total revenues, cost of revenues remained consistent at 31% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020.
Compensation and benefits
Compensation and benefits increased 4% from $383,554 in 2019 to $398,970 in 2020, primarily due to increases in severance expense of $9,742 and incentive compensation of $6,925, partially offset by salary, benefits and related payroll taxes of $1,922. The increase in severance expense is primarily related to charges connected with the Early Retirement Program that was offered to eligible employees through January 31, 2020. The 2019 Acquisitions contributed compensation and benefits expenses of $22,891 and $28,601, to total compensation and benefits expense in 2019 and 2020, respectively. As a percentage of total revenues, compensation and benefits decreased from 43% in 2019 to 40% in 2020, primarily due to revenue growth of our 2019 Acquisitions outpacing compensation and benefit growth for these same acquisitions.
General and administration
General and administration expenses increased 5% from $152,564 in 2019 to $160,229 in 2020, primarily due to increases in non-recurring restructuring charges and transaction costs of $11,202, systems development expense of $4,772, trade errors of $3,045, permits, licenses and fees of $1,425, professional and legal expenses of $1,363 and other miscellaneous general and administrative expenses of $1,278. These increases were partially offset by decreases in travel and entertainment expense of $12,335, occupancy costs of $3,296 and marketing expense of $3,159. The 2019 Acquisitions contributed general and administration expenses of $8,701 and $6,593, to total general and administration expenses in 2019 and 2020 respectively. As a percentage of total revenues, general and administration expenses decreased from 17% in 2019 to 16% and 2020.
Depreciation and amortization
Depreciation and amortization expense increased 12% from $101,271 in 2019 to $113,661 in 2020, primarily due to increases in internally developed software amortization expense of $6,628 and intangible asset amortization expense of $5,107. As a percentage of total revenues, depreciation and amortization expense remained consistent at 11% in 2019 and 2020.
Interest income
Interest income decreased from $3,347 in 2019 to $1,112 in 2020, primarily due to less interest earned on our bank accounts and money market funds. While our cash and cash equivalent balance increased significantly in 2020 as a result of the proceeds we received from our convertible debt offering in August 2020, interest earned on this cash continued to be low.
Interest expense
Interest expense decreased 3% from $32,520 in 2019 to $31,504 in 2020, primarily due to the payment of $345,000 of convertible notes in December 2019 and the paydown of our revolving credit facility in 2020, partially offset by additional interest incurred on the issuance of Convertible Notes due 2025 in August 2020. As a percentage of total revenues, interest expense decreased from 4% in 2019 to 3% in 2020.
Other income (expense), net
Other income (expense), net increased from other expense of $2,849 in 2019 to other income of $2,906 in 2020, primarily due to a gain of $4,230 recognized in 2020 on the remeasurement of our previously held interest in the private financial technology design company, a gain of $2,524 as a result of a fair value adjustment upon settlement of our former Chief Executive Officer's stock options and a gain on the sale of our interest held in a private company of $1,647. This increase was partially offset by additional equity method losses of $3,038 recorded in 2020 as compared to 2019.
Income tax provision
Our 2020 effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to state taxes, the excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation, the executive compensation deduction limitation, the generation of research and development (“R&D”) tax credits, income related to the Indian partnerships, the impact of the CARES Act related to NOL carryback, the change in the valuation allowance the Company has placed on a portion of its US deferred tax assets and the settlement of ASC 740-10 amounts due to the settlement of the bilateral advance pricing agreement with India and the filing of voluntary disclosure agreement returns.
Our 2019 effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to state taxes, excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation, the generation of R&D tax credits, unrecognized tax benefits, prior period true-ups and changes in valuation allowances.

Revenues
Asset-based recurring revenues
Asset-based recurring revenues increased 12% from $484,312 in 2019 to $540,947 in 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in asset values applicable to our quarterly billing cycle as a result of the upswing in the equity markets relative to the comparable 2019 period. In 2020, revenues were also positively affected by new account growth and positive net flows of AUM/A.
The number of financial advisors with AUM or AUA on our technology platforms increased from 40,563 as of December 31, 2019 to 41,206 as of December 31, 2020 and the number of AUM or AUA client accounts increased from approximately 2.1 million as of December 31, 2019 to approximately 2.4 million as of December 31, 2020.
As a percentage of total revenues, asset-based recurring revenue decreased from 68% of total revenue in 2019 to 67% in 2020.
Subscription-based recurring revenues
Subscription-based recurring revenues increased 20% from $207,606 in 2019 to $248,810 in 2020.
The 2019 Acquisitions contributed incremental revenues of $31,527 to subscription-based recurring revenues in 2020. The remaining increase of $9,677, is a result of growth from new and existing customers.
Professional services and other revenues
Professional services and other revenues decreased 7% from $17,540 in 2019 to $16,333 in 2020. The decrease was due to timing of the completion of customer projects and deployments, as well as a decrease in revenues resulting from the cancellation of our 2020 Advisor Summit.
Cost of revenues
Cost of revenues increased 11% from $255,108 in 2019 to $283,497 in 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in asset-based cost of revenues of $34,656, directly correlated with the increase in asset-based recurring revenues for the period. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in professional services and other cost of revenues of $5,568, primarily as a result of the cancellation of our 2020 Advisor Summit. As a percentage of segment revenues, cost of revenues decreased from 36% in 2019 to 35% in 2020.
Compensation and benefits
Compensation and benefits increased 13% from $227,570 in 2019 to $257,698 in 2020, primarily due to increases in severance expense of $12,301, incentive compensation of $10,555, salaries, benefits and related payroll taxes of $5,287 and non-cash compensation expense of $1,829. The increase in severance expense is primarily related to charges in connection with the Early Retirement Program. The 2019 Acquisitions contributed compensation and benefits expenses of $22,891 and $28,601 to total compensation and benefits expense in 2019 and 2020, respectively. As a percentage of segment revenues, compensation and benefits remained consistent at 32% in 2019 and 2020.
General and administration
General and administration expenses decreased 1% from $93,321 in 2019 to $92,680 in 2020, primarily due to decreases in travel and entertainment expense of $7,667 and marketing expense of $3,153, partially offset by increases in systems development expense of $3,386, trade errors of $3,000, communications, research and data services of $1,583 and non-recurring restructuring charges and transaction costs of $1,219. The 2019 Acquisitions contributed general and administration expenses of $8,701 and $6,593 to total general and administration expense in 2019 and 2020, respectively. As a percentage of segment revenues, general and administration expenses decreased from 13% in 2019 to 11% in 2020.
Depreciation and amortization
Depreciation and amortization increased 23% from $65,746 in 2019 to $80,714 in 2020, primarily due to increases in intangible asset amortization expense of $6,472, internally developed software amortization expense of $5,659 and property and equipment depreciation expense of $2,837. As a percentage of segment revenues, depreciation and amortization expense increased from 9% in 2019 to 10% in 2020.

Year ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019 for the Envestnet Data & Analytics segment
Revenues
Subscription-based recurring revenues
Subscription-base recurring revenues increased 4% from $171,207 in 2019 to $177,697 in 2020, primarily due to broad increases in revenue from new and existing customers.
Professional services and other revenues
Professional services and other revenues decreased 26% from $19,462 in 2019 to $14,443 in 2020, primarily due to the timing of the completion of projects and customer deployments.
Cost of revenues
Cost of revenues decreased 5% from $23,703 in 2019 to $22,432 in 2020, primarily due to a decrease in outside services spend. As a percentage of segment revenues, cost of revenues remained consistent at 12% in 2019 and 2020.
Compensation and benefits
Compensation and benefits decreased 6% from $118,062 in 2019 to $110,436 in 2020, primarily due to decreases in salaries, benefits and related payroll taxes of $11,024 resulting from increased capitalization of internally developed software and a decrease in severance expense of $2,584 primarily related to a reduction in force at one location in 2019, offset by increases in incentive compensation expense of $5,285 and in commission expense of $590. As a percentage of segment revenues, compensation and benefits decreased from 62% in 2019 to 57% in 2020.
General and administration
General and administration expenses decreased 6% from $38,641 in 2019 to $36,268 in 2020, primarily due to decreases in travel and entertainment expense of $4,053, occupancy costs of $2,482 and professional fees of $266. These decreases were partially offset by increases in restructuring charges and transaction costs of $3,542 and miscellaneous general and administrative expense of $613. As a percentage of segment revenues, general and administration expenses decreased from 20% in 2019 to 19% in 2020.
Depreciation and amortization
Depreciation and amortization decreased 7% from $35,525 in 2019 to $32,947 in 2020, primarily due to a decrease in depreciation of property and equipment of $2,224 resulting from a non-recurring prior year event. As a percentage of segment revenues, depreciation and amortization expense decreased from 19% in 2019 to 17% in 2020.

Compensation and benefits
Compensation and benefits decreased 19% from $37,922 in 2019 to $30,836 in 2020, primarily due to decreases in incentive compensation of $8,915 (primarily a result of approximately $8,800 in retention bonuses paid in connection with the PIEtech Acquisition in 2019) and non-cash compensation expense of $2,605, partially offset by an increase in salaries, benefits and related payroll taxes of $3,815 and an increase in contract labor of $568.
General and administration
General and administration expenses increased 52% from $20,602 in 2019 to $31,281 in 2020, primarily due to increases in restructuring charges and transaction costs of $6,441 related to multiple 2020 corporate initiatives and acquisition related activities, professional and legal fees of $1,535, permits, license and fees of $1,203, systems and development costs of $898 and miscellaneous general and administrative expense of $763. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in travel and entertainment expense of $615.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to reporting results according to GAAP, we also disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures to enhance the understanding of our operating performance. Those measures include “adjusted revenues,” “adjusted EBITDA,” “adjusted net income” and “adjusted net income per share”.
“Adjusted revenues” excludes the effect of purchase accounting on the fair value of acquired deferred revenue. Under GAAP, we record at fair value the acquired deferred revenue for contracts in effect at the time the entities were acquired. Consequently, revenue related to acquired entities for periods subsequent to the acquisition does not reflect the full amount of revenue that would have been recorded by these entities had they remained stand-alone entities. Adjusted revenues has
limitations as a financial measure, should be considered as supplemental in nature and are not meant as a substitute for revenue prepared in accordance with GAAP
“Adjusted EBITDA” represents net income (loss) before deferred revenue fair value adjustment, interest income, interest expense, accretion on contingent consideration and purchase liability, income tax benefit, depreciation and amortization, non-cash compensation expense, restructuring charges and transaction costs, severance, fair market value adjustment on contingent consideration liability, litigation and regulatory related expenses, foreign currency, non-income tax expense adjustment, gain on acquisition of equity method investment, gain on sale of interest in private company, loss allocation from equity method investments and (income) loss attributable to non-controlling interest.
“Adjusted net income” represents net income before deferred revenue fair value adjustment, accretion on contingent consideration and purchase liability, non-cash interest expense, non-cash compensation expense, restructuring charges and transaction costs, severance, amortization of acquired intangibles and fair value adjustment to property and equipment, net, fair market value adjustment on contingent consideration liability, litigation and regulatory related expenses, foreign currency, non-income tax expense adjustment, gain on acquisition of equity method investment, gain on sale of interest in private company, loss allocation from equity method investments and (income) loss attributable to non-controlling interest. Reconciling items are presented gross of tax, and a normalized tax rate is applied to the total of all reconciling items to arrive at adjusted net income. The normalized tax rate is based solely on the estimated blended statutory income tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We monitor the normalized tax rate based on events or trends that could materially impact the rate, including tax legislation changes and changes in the geographic mix of our operations.
“Adjusted net income per share” represents adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders divided by the diluted number of weighted-average shares outstanding.
Our Board and management use these non-GAAP financial measures:
•As measures of operating performance;
•For planning purposes, including the preparation of annual budgets;
•To allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of our business;
•To evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies; and
•In communications with our Board of Directors concerning our financial performance.
Our Compensation Committee, Board of Directors and our management may also consider adjusted EBITDA, among other factors, when determining management’s incentive compensation.
We present adjusted revenues, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share as supplemental performance measures because we believe that they provide our Board, management and investors with additional information to assess our performance. Adjusted revenues provide comparisons from period to period by excluding the effect of purchase accounting on the fair value of acquired deferred revenue. Adjusted EBITDA provides comparisons from period to period by excluding potential differences caused by variations in the age and book depreciation of fixed assets affecting relative depreciation expense and amortization of internally developed software, amortization of acquired intangible assets, income tax provision (benefit), non-income tax expense, restructuring charges and transaction costs, accretion on contingent consideration and purchase liability, severance, litigation related expense, pre-tax loss attributable to non-controlling interest and changes in interest expense and interest income that are influenced by capital structure decisions and capital market conditions. Our management also believes it is useful to exclude non-cash stock-based compensation expense from adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income because non-cash equity grants made at a certain price and point in time do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time.
We believe adjusted revenues, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because securities analysts use adjusted revenues, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share as supplemental measures to evaluate the overall performance of companies, and we anticipate that our investors and analyst presentations will include adjusted revenues, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share in such evaluation.
Adjusted revenues, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to revenues, net income, operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our profitability or liquidity.
•Adjusted revenues, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;
•Adjusted revenues, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;
•Adjusted revenues, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share do not reflect non-cash components of employee compensation;
•Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized often will have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements;
•Due to either net losses before income tax expense or the use of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, we paid net cash of $8,304, $8,119, and $5,531 in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In the event that we begin to generate taxable income and our existing net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income taxes have been fully utilized or have expired, income tax payments will be higher; and
•Other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted revenues, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure.
Management compensates for the inherent limitations associated with using adjusted revenues, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share through disclosure of such limitations, presentation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP and reconciliation of adjusted revenues to revenues, the most directly comparable GAAP measure and adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share to net income and net income per share, the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Further, our management also reviews GAAP measures and evaluates individual measures that are not included in some or all of our non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, such as our level of capital expenditures and interest income, among other measures.
The following table sets forth a reconciliation of total revenues to adjusted revenues based on our historical results:

__________________________________________________________
(1)For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the effective tax rate computed in accordance with GAAP equaled 67.1%, 64.2% and 143.8%, respectively.
(2)Estimated normalized effective tax rates of 25.5%, 25.5% and 27.0%, respectively, have been used to compute adjusted net income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Note on Income Taxes: As of December 31, 2020, we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $242,000 and $211,000 for federal and state income tax purposes, respectively, available to reduce future income subject to income taxes. As a result, the amount of actual cash taxes we pay for federal, state and foreign income taxes differs significantly from the effective income tax rate computed in accordance with GAAP, and from the normalized rate shown above.
The following tables set forth a reconciliation of revenues to adjusted revenues and income (loss) from operations to adjusted EBITDA based on our historical results for each segment for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, we had total cash and cash equivalents of $384,565, compared to $82,505 as of December 31, 2019. In August 2020, we issued $517,500 of convertible notes that mature on August 15, 2025. See Part II, Item 8, “Note 10-Debt, Convertible Notes due 2025” for more details regarding the issuance of these convertible notes. With the proceeds from this convertible note issuance, we repaid the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility of $150,000.
We plan to use existing cash as of December 31, 2020, cash generated in the ongoing operations of our business and amounts under our revolving credit facility to fund our current operations, capital expenditures and possible acquisitions or other strategic activity, and to meet our debt service obligations. If the cash generated in the ongoing operations of our business is insufficient to fund these requirements we may be required to borrow under our revolving credit facility or incur additional debt to fund our ongoing operations or to fund potential acquisitions or other strategic activities.
Amended Credit Agreement
In 2014, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement with a group of banks (the “Banks”), for which Bank of Montreal acted as administrative agent. Since 2014, the credit agreement has been amended several times, the latest of which occurred in September 2019 (the “Amended Credit Agreement”).
Pursuant to the Amended Credit Agreement, the Banks agreed to provide to the Company with a revolving credit facility of $500,000, of which amount may be increased by $150,000 (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). The Amended Credit Agreement also includes a $5,000 sub-facility for the issuance of letters of credit.
Proceeds under the Amended Credit Agreement may be used to finance capital expenditures, working capital, permitted acquisitions and for general corporate purposes.
Borrowings made under the Amended Credit Agreement incur interest at rates between 1.50% and 3.25% above LIBOR based on our total leverage ratio. Borrowings made under the Amended Credit Agreement are scheduled to mature on September 27, 2024.
As of December 31, 2020, there were no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2020, we had $500,000 available to borrow under the under the Revolving Credit Facility, subject to covenant compliance.
See Part II, Item 8, “Note 10-Debt” for further information regarding the terms of our Amended Credit Agreement.
Convertible Notes
In May 2018, we issued $345,000 of convertible notes that mature on June 1, 2023 (the “Convertible Notes due 2023”). The Convertible Notes due 2023 bear interest at a rate of 1.75% per annum payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year.
In August 2020, we issued $517,500 of convertible notes that mature on August 15, 2025 (the “Convertible Notes due 2025”). The Convertible Notes due 2025 bear interest at a rate of 0.75% per annum payable semiannually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on February 15, 2021.
See Part II, Item 8, “Note 10-Debt” for further information regarding the terms of our Convertible Notes.
Issuance and sale of Common Shares to BlackRock
In December 2018, we issued and sold to BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock”) approximately 2,356,000 common shares at a purchase price of $52.13 per share, and warrants to purchase approximately 470,000 common shares at an exercise price of $65.16 per share, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. The warrants are exercisable at BlackRock’s option for four years from the date of issuance. The warrants may be exercisable through cash exercise or net issue exercise with cash settlement at our sole discretion.
Cash Flows
The following table presents information regarding our cash flows for the periods indicated:
Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $169,836 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $108,726 for the same period in 2019. The increase was primarily due to:
•A decrease in pre-tax losses period over period of $40,050;
•An increase period over period for noncash addbacks for depreciation and amortization expense of $12,390;
•Reduced fair market value adjustments on estimated contingent consideration liabilities of $5,021; and
•Reduced gains on proceeds of $5,000 received from a life insurance policy that was paid out in 2019.
These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the change in operating assets and liabilities of $6,162 which is primarily timing related.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $99,996 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $375,708 for the same period in 2019. The change was primarily a result of a decrease in cash disbursements for business acquisitions of $300,658. In January 2020, we also used $11,000 to acquire a 4.25% interest in a privately held company. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we capitalized an additional $20,812 of internally developed software costs as compared to the same period in 2019.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $232,950 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $60,465 for the same period in 2019. In August 2020, we received net proceeds of approximately $503,000 from the issuance of convertible debt. With these proceeds, we paid off the outstanding balance of our revolving credit facility. On a year over year basis, our revolver activity resulted in an additional $520,000 of net cash outflows. In 2019, we paid $184,751 towards convertible notes that matured on December 15, 2019.
Commitments
We enter into unconditional purchase obligations arrangements for certain of our services that we receive in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2020, the Company estimated future minimum unconditional purchase obligations of approximately $56,000.
As of December 31, 2020, future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable leases were $163,537. These leases expire at various dates prior to 2030.
In connection with certain of our acquisitions, we have entered into contingent consideration arrangements whereby we have agreed to pay additional amounts based upon the achievement of certain performance targets. As of December 31, 2020, these liabilities are valued at $12,559. We also have additional direct purchase obligations of $6,229 related to our acquisitions. We granted membership interests in certain of the Company's equity method investments to two legacy PIEtech executives with an estimated grant date fair market value of $8,900. These membership interests vested on May 1, 2020 and become exercisable on May 1, 2022, with the option to put the membership interests to the Company.
We have also committed $5,740 in future funding to certain of our equity method investees.
We expect to spend approximately $14,000 on capital expenditures in 2021, with a forecasted 10% annual increase thereafter for the next four years.
We include various types of indemnification and guarantee clauses in certain arrangements. These indemnifications and guarantees may include, but are not limited to, infringement claims related to intellectual property, direct or consequential damages and guarantees to certain service providers and service level requirements with certain customers. The type and amount of any potential indemnification or guarantee varies substantially based on the nature of each arrangement. We have experienced no previous claims and cannot determine the maximum amount of potential future payments, if any, related to these indemnification and guarantee provisions. We believe that it is unlikely that we will have to make material payments under these arrangements and therefore we have not recorded a contingent liability in the consolidated balance sheets.
Backlog
We sell subscriptions to our solutions through contracts that are generally one to three years in length, although terms can extend to as long as five years. Our subscription agreements with our customers generally contain scheduled minimum subscription fees, and usage-based fees which depend on the extent their customers or end users use our platform. We consider the unpaid contractual minimum payments under our subscription agreements to be our backlog. Due to the inherent volatility of backlog measured using contractual minimums, and the fact that contractual minimums are becoming increasingly less important to our business, we do not utilize backlog as a key management metric internally and we do not believe that it is a meaningful measurement of our future revenues.
We expect that the amount of backlog relative to the total value of our subscription agreements will change from year to year for several reasons, including the timing of contract renewals, the proportion of total subscription revenue represented by contractual minimum payments and the average non-cancellable terms of our subscription agreements. The change in backlog that results from these events may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or expected future revenues.
We also expect that as our customer base continues to mature and customer deployments scale usage, renewals over time will increasingly have fewer contractual minimum fees because such fees are intended to decrease the timing risk associated with initial deployment commitments.
In addition, because revenue for any period is a function of revenue recognized from deferred revenue under contracts in existence at the beginning of the period, as well as contracts that are renewed and new customer contracts that are entered into during the period, backlog at the beginning of any period is not necessarily indicative of future performance.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). The accounting policies described below require management to apply significant judgment in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. In particular, judgment is applied to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in calculating estimates that affect certain reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. If different estimates or assumptions were used, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could have been materially different than those reflected in our consolidated financial statements. For additional information regarding our critical accounting policies, see Part II, Item 8, “Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”.
Revenue Recognition
Revenues are derived from asset-based and subscription-based services and professional services and other sources. Revenues are recognized when control of these services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services. All revenue recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is considered to be revenue from contracts with customers. Sales and usage-based taxes are excluded from revenues.
Asset-based recurring revenues- Asset-based recurring revenues primarily consist of fees for providing customers continuous access to platform services through our uniquely customized platforms. These platform services include investment manager research, portfolio diagnostics, proposal generation, investment model management, rebalancing and trading, portfolio performance reporting and monitoring solutions, billing and back office and middle-office operations and administration and are made available to customers throughout the contractual term from the date the customized platform is launched.
The asset-based fees we earn are generally based upon variable percentages of assets managed or administered on our platforms. The fee percentage varies based on the level and type of services we provide to our customers, as well as the values of existing customer accounts. The values of the customer accounts are affected by inflows or outflows of customer funds and market fluctuations.
The platform services are substantially the same over each quarter and performed in a similar manner over the contract period, and are considered stand-ready promises. The platform services that are delivered to the customer over the quarter are considered distinct, as the customer benefits distinctly from each increment of our services and each quarter is separately identified in the contract, and are considered to be a single performance obligation under ASC 606.
The pricing generally resets each quarter and the pricing structure is consistent throughout the term of the contract. The variable fees are generally calculated and billed quarterly in advance based on preceding quarter-end values and the variable amounts earned from the platform services relate specifically to the benefits transferred to the customer during that quarter. Accordingly, revenue is allocated to the specific quarter in which services are performed.
The asset-based contracts generally contain one performance obligation and revenue is recognized on a ratable basis over the quarter beginning on the date that the platform services are made available to the customer as the customer simultaneously consumes and receives the benefits of the services. All asset-based fees are recognized in the Envestnet Wealth Solutions segment.
For certain services provided by third parties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (revenues reported on a gross basis) or agent (revenues reported on a net basis). Generally, we report customer fees including charges for third party service providers where we have a direct contract with such third party service providers on a gross basis, whereas the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues, and amounts paid to third party service providers are recorded as cost of revenues. We are the principal in the transaction because we control the services before they are transferred to our customers. Control is evidenced by being primarily responsible to our customers and having discretion in establishing pricing.
Subscription-based recurring revenues- Subscription-based recurring revenues primarily consist of fees for providing customers continuous access to our platform for wealth management and financial wellness. The subscription-based fees generally include fixed fees and or usage-based fees.
Generally, the subscription services are substantially the same over each quarter and performed in a similar manner over the contract period, and are considered stand-ready promises. Quarterly subscription services are considered distinct as the
customer can benefit from each increment of services on its own and each quarter is separately identified in the contract, and services are considered to be a single performance obligation under the ASC 606.
The usage-based pricing generally resets each quarter and the pricing structure is generally consistent throughout the term of the contract. The fixed fees are generally calculated and billed quarterly in advance. The usage-based fees are generally calculated and are billed either monthly or quarterly based on the actual usage and relate specifically to the benefits transferred to the customer during that month or quarter. Accordingly, revenue is allocated to the specific quarter in which services are performed.
Certain subscription-based contracts contain multiple performance obligations (i.e. platform services performance obligation and professional services performance obligation). Fixed fees are generally recognized on a ratable basis over the quarter beginning when the subscription services are made available to the customer, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the subscription services. Usage-based revenue is recognized on a monthly basis as the customer receives and consumes the benefit as we provide the services. Subscription-based fees are recognized in both the Envestnet Wealth Solutions and Envestnet Data & Analytics segments.
Professional services and other revenues- We earn professional services fees by providing contractual customized services and platform software development as well as initial implementation fees. Professional services contracts generally have fixed prices, and generally specify the deliverables in the contract. Certain professional services contracts are billed on a time and materials basis and revenue is recognized over time as the services are performed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time based on the proportion of services performed. Initial implementation fees are fixed and are generally recognized ratably over the contract term.
Other revenue primarily includes revenue related to the Advisor Summit. Other revenue is recognized when the events are held. Other revenue is not significant.
The majority of the professional services and other contracts contain one performance obligation. Professional services and other revenues are recognized in both the Envestnet Wealth Solutions and Envestnet Data & Analytics segments.
Arrangements with multiple performance obligations- Certain of the our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations such as platform services performance obligation and professional services performance obligation. For such arrangements, we allocate revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling prices of services are estimated based on observable transactions when these services are sold on a standalone basis or based on expected cost plus margin.
Purchase accounting
Assigning fair market values to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of an acquisition requires knowledge of current market values, and the values of assets in use, and often requires the application of judgment regarding estimates and assumptions. While the ultimate responsibility resides with management, for material acquisitions, we retain the services of certified valuation specialists to assist with assigning estimated values to certain acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including intangible assets and contingent consideration.
Acquired intangible assets, excluding goodwill, are valued using a discounted cash flow methodology based on future cash flows specific to the type of intangible asset purchased. This methodology incorporates various estimates and assumptions, the most significant being projected revenue growth rates, margins and forecasted cash flows based on the discount rate and terminal growth rate. Management projects revenue growth rates, margins and cash flows based on the historical operating results of the acquired entity adjusted for synergies anticipated to be achieved through integration, expected future performance, operational strategies and the general macroeconomic environment. We review finite-lived intangible assets for triggering events such as significant changes in operations, customers or future revenue that might indicate the need to impair the assets acquired or change the useful lives of the assets acquired. There was no impairment recognized on intangible assets in 2020, 2019 or 2018.
Assumed liabilities are valued based on estimates of anticipated expenditures to be incurred to satisfy the assumed obligations, including contractual liabilities assumed, which require the exercise of professional judgment.
Assumed contracts may have favorable or unfavorable terms that must be valued as of the acquisition date. Such valuation is subject to management judgment regarding the evaluation and interpretation of contract terms in relation to other economic circumstances, such as the market rates for office space leases.
If we assume a performance obligation to customers as of the acquisition date, a deferred revenue obligation is recognized. Judgment is required to evaluate whether a future performance obligation exists and to assign a value to the performance obligation.
Assumed acquired tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions are dependent on assessing the past practices of the acquisition target based on our review of actual tax filings and information obtained through due diligence procedures. Evaluation of the validity of tax positions taken by the acquisition target are subject to management judgment.
We determine the fair value of contingent acquisition consideration payable on the acquisition date using a discounted cash flow approach utilizing an appropriate discount rate. Each reporting period thereafter, we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as adjustments to fair market value adjustment on contingent consideration liability within general and administration expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. Changes in the fair value of the contingent acquisition consideration liability can result from adjustments to the estimated revenue forecasts included in the contingent payment calculations. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we reduced our contingent consideration liabilities plus accrued interest by $3,105 and $8,126, respectively, as we determined that certain performance targets would not be met. We did not record any fair value adjustments to our contingent consideration for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Reviews for impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets
Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Based on the relevant GAAP authoritative guidance, we aggregate components of a single operating segment into a reporting unit, if appropriate. For purposes of performing the impairment tests, we identify reporting units in accordance with GAAP. The identification of reporting units and consideration of aggregation criteria requires management judgment.
If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is performed. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then a quantitative evaluation must be performed. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its fair value, then an impairment loss equal to the difference will be recorded. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, prior to performing the quantitative evaluation, an assessment of qualitative factors may be performed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value. If it is determined that it is unlikely that the carrying value exceeds the fair value, we are not required to complete the quantitative goodwill impairment evaluation. The selection and assessment of qualitative factors used to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value involves management judgment.
We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 31, 2020 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. At that date, we determined it was appropriate to aggregate certain components of the same operating segment into a single reporting unit. We concluded that we have two reporting units. We also determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value and concluded that goodwill was not impaired. As a result, we did not perform the quantitative goodwill impairment evaluation.
As part of the our ongoing monitoring efforts to assess goodwill for possible indications of impairment, we will continue to consider a wide variety of factors, including but not limited to the global economic environment and its potential impact on our business. There can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions regarding forecasted cash flows of certain reporting units, the current economic environment, or the other inputs used in forecasting the present value of forecasted cash flows will prove to be accurate projections of future performance.
Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances may affect the recoverability of the net assets. Such reviews include an analysis of current results and take into consideration the undiscounted value of projected operating cash flows. No intangible asset impairment charges have been recorded for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Convertible debt
We have issued $345,000 of 1.75% convertible notes due June 2023 and $517,500 of 0.75% convertible notes due August 2025. These convertible notes are accounted for in accordance with ASC 470-20. We have determined that the embedded conversion options in our convertible notes are not required to be separately accounted for as a derivative under GAAP. We separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible notes that can be settled in cash by allocating the proceeds from issuance between the liability component and the embedded conversion option, or equity component, in accordance with accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash (including partial cash settlement) upon conversion. The value of the equity component is calculated by first measuring the fair value of the liability component, using the interest rate of a similar liability that does not have a conversion feature, as of the issuance date. The difference between the proceeds from the convertible debt issuance and the amount measured as the liability component is recorded as the equity component with a corresponding discount recorded on the debt. We recognize the accretion of the resulting discount using the effective interest method as part of interest expense in its consolidated statements of operations. The determination of the interest rate used to value the equity component requires management judgment. Small changes to this interest rate could have a significant effect on the amounts allocated to the liability component and on the amortization of the debt discount.
Income taxes
We are subject to income taxes in the United States, Australia, Canada, India, and the United Kingdom. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.
We use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and for net operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in our income tax provision in the period that includes the enactment date. We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that we determine is more-likely-than-not to be realized in the future.
In our ordinary course of business, we may enter into transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In such cases, we establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on our estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. The reserves are established when we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and may not be fully sustained on review by tax authorities. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or refinement of an estimate. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will be reflected in our provision for income taxes. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate.
The amount of income tax we pay is subject to audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which may result in proposed assessments. Our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. We believe that we have adequately provided for the foreseeable outcome related to these matters. However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved, audits are closed or when statutes of limitations on potential assessments expire. Additionally, the jurisdictions in which our earnings or deductions are realized may differ from our current estimates. As a result, our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis.
Significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.
Our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rates primarily due to state taxes, the effect of the excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation, the executive compensation deduction limitation, the generation of R&D tax credits, income related to the India partnerships, impact of the CARES Act related to NOL carryback, the change in the valuation allowance the Company has placed on a portion of its US deferred tax assets, and the settlement of ASC 740-10 amounts due to
the settlement of the bilateral advanced pricing agreement with India and the filing of voluntary disclosure agreement returns. Our provision for income taxes varies based on, among other things, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, the tax effects of non-cash stock-based compensation or changes in applicable tax laws, regulations and accounting principles or interpretations thereof.
We are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Our Indian subsidiaries are currently under examination by the India Tax Authority for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020, 2011, and 2010. Based on the outcome of examinations of our subsidiary or the result of the expiration of statutes of limitations it is reasonably possible that the related unrecognized tax benefits could change from those recorded in the consolidated balance sheets. It is possible that one or more of these audits may be finalized within the next twelve months.
