ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION
The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements for the years ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018 together with notes thereto as included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in the section entitled “Risk Factors.” Our audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
We are a development stage company since we have no current operations, are currently pursuing options to find suitable merger candidates and have not generated any significant revenue to date. We have incurred recurring losses to date. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation.
We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.

During the year ended June 30, 2019, we incurred operating expenses of $104,650 compared to $98,880 incurred during the year ended June 30, 2018. The increase in operating expenses was mainly due to the increase in filing fees.

GOING CONCERN
The independent auditors’ report accompanying our June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018 financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared “assuming that we will continue as a going concern,” which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. We have suffered recurring losses from operations and have a working capital deficit. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
The following describes the recently issued accounting standards used in reporting our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, accounting standards allow more than one alternative accounting method for reporting. Such is the case with accounting for oil and gas activities described below. In those cases, our reported results of operations would be different should we employ an alternative accounting method.
Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
