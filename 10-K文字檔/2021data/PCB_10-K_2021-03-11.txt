Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
You should read the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under Item 1A “Risk Factors” and “Forward Looking Statements” immediately preceding Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Critical Accounting Policies
The Company follows accounting and reporting policies and procedures that conform, in all material respects, to GAAP and to practices generally applicable to the financial services industry, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make judgments and accounting estimates that affect the amounts reported for assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses on the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes, and amounts disclosed as contingent assets and liabilities. While the Company bases estimates on historical experience, current information and other factors deemed to be relevant, actual results could differ from those estimates. Accounting estimates are necessary in the application of certain accounting policies and procedures that are particularly susceptible to significant change. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that require the most complex or subjective judgment and are reflective of significant uncertainties, and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions
The following is a summary of the more subjective and complex accounting estimates and principles affecting the financial condition and results reported in financial statements. In each area, the Company has identified the variables that management believes to be the most important in the estimation process. The Company uses the best information available to make the estimations necessary to value the related assets and liabilities in each of these areas.
Allowance for Loan Losses
Allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses. Loan losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes the uncollectability of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance for loan losses. The Company estimates the allowance for loan losses required using past loan loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions, and other factors. Allocations of the allowance for loan losses may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance for loan losses is available for any loan that, in management’s judgment, should be charged-off. Amounts are charged-off when available information confirms that specific loans or portions thereof, are uncollectible. This methodology for determining charge-offs is consistently applied to each segment.
The Company determines a separate allowance for loan losses for each portfolio segment. The allowance for loan losses consists of specific and general reserves. Specific reserves relate to loans that are individually classified as impaired. A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value and the probability of collecting all amounts when due. Measurement of impairment is based on the expected future cash flows of an impaired loan, which are to be discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, or measured by reference to an observable market value, if one exists, or the fair value of the collateral for a collateral-dependent loan. The Company selects the measurement method on a loan-by-loan basis except that collateral-dependent loans for which foreclosure is probable are measured at the fair value of the collateral.
The Company recognizes interest income on impaired loans based on its existing methods of recognizing interest income on nonaccrual loans. Loans, for which the terms have been modified resulting in a concession, and for which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, are considered TDRs and classified as impaired with measurement of impairment as described above.
If a loan is impaired, a portion of the allowance is allocated so that the loan is reported, net, at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan’s existing rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral.
General reserves cover non-impaired loans and are based on the Company’s historical loss rates for each portfolio segment, adjusted for the effects of qualitative factors that are likely to cause estimated credit losses as of the evaluation date to differ from the portfolio segment’s historical loss experience.
Qualitative factors include consideration of the following: changes in lending policies and procedures; changes in economic conditions, changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio; changes in the experience, ability and depth of lending management and other relevant staff; changes in the volume and severity of past due, nonaccrual and other adversely graded loans; changes in the loan review system; changes in the value of the underlying collateral for collateral-dependent loans; concentrations of credit and the effect of other external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements.
Executive Summary
Net income was $16.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $7.9 million, or 32.9%, from $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in provision for loan losses and a decrease in net interest income. Provision for loan losses increased primarily due to the increase in risks associated with economic and business conditions, as well an increases in special mention and substandard loans, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and net interest income decreased primarily due to the lower market rates during the year ended December 31, 2020.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, net income was $24.1 million, a decrease of $193 thousand, or 0.8%, from $24.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to increases in provision for loan losses and noninterest expense, partially offset by increases in net interest income and noninterest income. Provision for loan losses increased primarily due to increased charge-offs and noninterest expense increased primarily due to expansion of the Company's infrastructure for being a public company and enhancement of the controls and processes on BSA/AML compliance during the year ended December 31, 2019. Net interest income increased primarily due to the loan growth and higher average market rates and noninterest income increased primarily due to higher sales of loans and securities available-for-sale during the year ended December 31, 2019
Total assets were $1.92 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $176.5 million, or 10.1%, from $1.75 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in loans held-for-investment and cash and cash equivalents. Loans held-for-investment increased primarily due to the SBA PPP loan production and cash and cash equivalents increased primarily due to increases in deposits and borrowings as the Company maintains most of its cash at the Federal Reserve Bank account.
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and governmental and societal responses thereto, have had a severe impact on recent global economic and market conditions, including significant disruption of, and volatility in, financial markets; global supply chain disruptions; and the institution of social distancing and shelter-in-place requirements that have resulted in temporary closures of many businesses, lost revenues, and increased unemployment throughout the U.S., but also specifically in California, where most of the Company’s operations and a large majority of its customers are located.
Since the beginning of the crisis, the Company has taken a number of steps to protect the safety of its employees and to support its customers. The Company has enabled its staff to work remotely and established safety measures within its bank premises and branches for both employees and customers.
In order to support its customers, the Company has been in close contact with its customers, assessing the level of impact on their businesses, and putting a process in place to evaluate each client’s specific situation and provide relief programs where appropriate. SBA PPP loans totaled $135.7 million (1,585 loans) and loans with modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic totaled $36.1 million (39 loan customers) as of December 31, 2020. In December 2020, the Company received SBA PPP forgiveness of $1.8 million for 57 SBA PPP loans. On January 13, 2021, SBA began accepting applications for (i) first draw PPP loans for businesses that did not seek a PPP loan under the original CARES Act, and (ii) second draw PPP loans for businesses that were extended a PPP loan previously. The Company had funded 819 loans totaling $88.1 million by February 28, 2021 and will continue to receive applications as long as funding remains available.
In addition, the Company has been monitoring its liquidity and capital closely. As of December 31, 2020, the Company maintained $194.1 million, or 10.1% of total assets, of cash and cash equivalents and $526.1 million, or 27.4% of total assets, of available borrowing capacity. All regulatory capital ratios were also well above the regulatory well capitalized requirements as of December 31, 2020, while establishing additional provision for loan losses of $13.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
At this time, the Company cannot estimate the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, but these conditions impacted and are expected to impact its business, results of operations, and financial condition negatively.

Result of Operations
Net Interest Income
A principal component of the Company’s earnings is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest and fees earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds. Net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets is referred to as the net interest margin. The net interest spread is the yield on average interest-earning assets less the cost of average interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is affected by changes in the balances of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and changes in the yields earned on interest-earning assets and the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities.
The following table presents interest income, average interest-earning assets, interest expense, average interest-bearing liabilities, and their correspondent yields and costs expressed both in dollars and rates for the periods indicated:
(1) Average balance includes both loans held-for-sale and loans held-for-investment, as well as nonaccrual loans. Net amortization of deferred loan fees (cost) of $2.9 million, $452 thousand and $515 thousand, respectively, and net accretion of discount on loans of $3.3 million, $4.0 million and $4.4 million, respectively, are included in the interest income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
(2) The yield on municipal bonds has not been computed on a tax-equivalent basis.
(3) Net interest spread is calculated by subtracting average rate on interest-bearing liabilities from average yield on interest-earning assets.
(4) Net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets.
(5) Cost of funds is calculated by dividing interest expense on deposits by the sum of interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing demand deposits.
The following table presents the changes in interest income and interest expense for major components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Information is provided on changes attributable to: (i) changes in volume multiplied by the prior rate; and (ii) changes in rate multiplied by the prior volume. Changes attributable to both rate and volume which cannot be segregated have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate.
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019
The following table presents the components of net interest income for the periods indicated:
Net interest income decreased primarily due to a 128 basis point decrease in average yield on interest-earning assets and a 3.2% increase in average balance of interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by a 11.8% increase in average balance of interest-earning assets and a 94 basis point decrease in average cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The increase in average balance of interest-earning assets was primarily due to growth in the loan and other interest-earning assets, supported by deposit growth. The decreases in average yield on interest-earning assets and average cost of interest-bearing liabilities were primarily due to the lower market rates in 2020.
Interest and fees on loans decreased primarily due to a 123 basis point decrease in average yield, partially offset by a 11.4% increase in average balance. The decrease in average yield was primarily due to the lower market rates, the 1% interest rate on SBA PPP loans, and a decrease in net accretion of discount, partially offset by an increase in net amortization of deferred fees on SBA PPP loans. The increase in average balance was primarily due to the SBA PPP loan production as well as an increase in commercial property loans.
Interest on investment securities decreased primarily due to a 23.7% decrease in average balance and a 73 basis point decrease in average yield. The decrease in average balance was primarily due to a sale of investment securities of $32.8 million in December 2019, which lead to a lower average balance in 2020, partially offset by new investment securities purchased in 2020. The decrease in average yield was primarily due to new investment securities purchased at lower market rates, as well as the sales of securities available-for-sale in December 2019 with a weighted-average book yield of 3.02%. The Company purchased $39.4 million and $14.1 million, respectively, of investment securities during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, average yield on total investment securities was 1.73% and 2.46%, respectively.
Interest income on other interest-earning assets decreased primarily due to a 195 basis point decrease in average yield, partially offset by a 58.0% increase in average balance. The decrease in average yield was primarily due to the lower market rates. The increase in average balance was primarily due to increases in deposits and other borrowings as the Company maintains most of its cash at the Federal Reserve Bank account. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, yield on total other interest-earning assets was 0.51% and 2.46%, respectively.
Interest expense on deposits decreased primarily due to a 2.9% decrease in average balance of interest-bearing deposits and a 90 basis point decrease in average cost of interest-bearing deposits. The decrease in average balance was primarily due to a decrease in time deposits, partially offset by increases in savings, NOW and money market accounts. The decrease in average cost was primarily due to the lower market rates. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, average cost on total interest-bearing deposits was 1.19% and 2.09%, respectively.
Interest expense on other borrowings increased primarily due to a 271.5% increase in average balance, partially offset by a 121 basis point decrease in average cost. The decrease in average cost was primarily due to the lower market rates. The increase in average balance was primarily due to the Company’s liquidity management plan in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018
The following table presents the components of net interest income for the periods indicated:
Net interest income increased primarily due to a 7.9% increase in average balance of interest-earning assets and a 15 basis point increase in average yield on interest-earning assets, partially offset by a 5.3% increase in average balance of interest-bearing liabilities and a 44 basis point increase in average cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The increase in average balance of interest-earning assets was primarily due to growth in the loan and investment security portfolios, supported by deposit growth. The increases in average yield on interest-earning assets and average cost of interest-bearing liabilities were primarily due to higher average market rates in 2019.
Interest and fees on loans increased primarily due to a 9.4% increase in average balance and a 11 basis point increase in average yield. The increase in average balance was primarily due to organic loan growth primarily in commercial property loans and commercial lines of credit. The increase in average yield was primarily due to the rising interest rate environment in 2018 and higher average market rates in 2019. The Company had benefited from its high proportion of variable rate loans that had repriced along with such interest rate environment; however, the Company strategically had increased the proportion of fixed rate loans to 43.4% at December 31, 2019 from 34.4% at December 31, 2018 in order to improve its asset composition to align with the current and potential future interest rate environment.
Interest on investment securities increased primarily due to a 4.2% increase in average balance and a 5 basis point increase in average yield. The increase in average balance was primarily due to a steep increase in investment securities throughout 2018, which lead to a higher average balance in 2019, partially offset by a sale of investment securities of $32.8 million in December 2019. The increase in average yield was primarily due to additional purchases of investment securities along with the rising interest rate environment in 2018 and higher average market rates in 2019. The Company purchased $14.1 million and $44.0 million, respectively, of investment securities during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, average yield on total investment securities was 2.46% and 2.41%, respectively.
Interest income on other interest-earning assets increased primarily due to an 18 basis point increase in average yield, partially offset by a 2.0% decrease in average balance. The increase in average yield was primarily due to a higher average federal funds rate in 2019, partially offset by a decrease in dividend on FHLB stock. The decrease in average balance was primarily due to cash deployed to support the loan growth. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, yield on total other interest-earning assets was 2.46% and 2.28%, respectively.
Interest expense on deposits increased primarily due to a 6.4% increase in average balance and a 44 basis point increase in average cost. The increase in average balance was primarily due to increases in time deposits, and NOW and money market accounts. The increase in average cost was primarily due to the impact of higher average market rates on deposits and competition in the Company’s deposit target markets. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, average cost on total interest-bearing deposits was 2.09% and 1.65%, respectively.
Interest expense on other borrowings decreased primarily due to less utilization of FHLB advances. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Bank did not renew the maturing borrowings of $10.0 million as the Bank maintained a sufficient level of on-balance sheet liquidity.
Provision for Loan Losses
Provision for loan losses was $13.2 million, $4.2 million and $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. The increase in provision for loan losses was primarily due to the increase in risks associated with economic and business conditions and uncertainty, as well as the increases in special mention and classified loans, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic for the year ended December 31, 2020.
See further discussion in “Loans Held-For-Investment and Allowance for Loan Losses.”
Noninterest Income
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019
The following table presents the components of noninterest income for the periods indicated:
Service charges and fees on deposits decreased primarily due to a decrease in fee-based transactions.
Loan servicing income represents fees received on loans that the Company services, net of amortization of servicing assets. The increase was primarily due to a decrease in amortization of servicing assets from decreased prepayments of loans being serviced.
Gain on sale of loans increased primarily due to increases in sales volume and premium. The increase in premium on SBA loans was primarily due to the market condition and the increase in sale volume of residential property loans was primarily due to increased refinancing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company sold SBA loans of $89.8 million with a gain of $6.0 million and residential property loans of $51.9 million with a gain of $489 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company sold SBA loans of $99.6 million with a gain of $5.9 million and residential property loans of $10.1 million with a gain of $81 thousand.

Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018
The following table presents the components of noninterest income for the periods indicated:
Service charges and fees on deposits increased primarily due to an increase in the level of transactional based deposit accounts.
Loan servicing income increased primarily due to a decreased amortization of servicing assets from decreased prepayments of loans being serviced, partially offset by a decrease in servicing income. Servicing income decreased due to a decrease in the average balance of servicing portfolio.
Gain on sale of loans increased primarily due to an increase in sales volume. The Company sold SBA loans of $99.6 million with a gain of $5.9 million and residential property loans of $10.1 million with a gain of $81 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company sold SBA loans of $91.7 million with a gain of $5.3 million, residential property loans of $11.6 million with a gain of $220 thousand, and other loans of $1.9 million with a gain of $62 thousand.

Noninterest Expense
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019
The following table presents the components of noninterest expense for the periods indicated:
Salaries and employee benefits increased primarily due to increases in wages, other employee benefits and vacation accrual, partially offset by a direct loan origination cost of $1.1 million related to SBA PPP loan production and a decrease in bonus accrual. The number of full-time equivalent employees averaged 251.8 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 250.2 for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Marketing and business promotion expense decreased primarily due to fewer marketing activities related to the COVID-19 pandemic for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Data processing expense increased primarily due to an increase in processing costs from a greater number of accounts and transactions.
Director fees and expenses decreased primarily due to the Company's Board of Directors decision to temporarily decrease director fees from the second quarter of 2020, partially offset by a severance payment of $45 thousand for a former director during the three months end March 31, 2020.
Regulatory assessment expense increased primarily due to a small bank credit of $345 thousand received from the FDIC during the year ended December 31, 2019, as well as an increase in balance sheet.
Other expense decreased primarily due to decreases in office expenses, provision for unfunded loan commitments, other loan related legal expenses, and armed guard expenses.

Salaries and employee benefits increased primarily due to the hiring of new experienced employees with higher salaries in order to support the expansion of the Company's infrastructure for being a public company and to enhance the controls and processes on BSA/AML compliance, partially offset by a decrease in bonus accrual. The number of full-time equivalent employees averaged 250.2 for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 235.0 for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Occupancy and equipment expense increased primarily due to an establishment of new loan production office in Artesia, California in December 2018 and an increase in equipment maintenance expense.
Professional fees increased primarily due to increases in audit and other professional fees for being a public company and expense related to enhancement of the Bank's controls and processes on BSA/AML compliance programs, partially offset by decreases in legal and professional fees attributed to the portion of expenses related the Company's initial public offering in 2018 that were not capitalized.
Marketing and business promotion expense decreased primarily due to a less advertisement activities for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Data processing expense increased primarily due to an increase in processing costs from a greater number of accounts and transactions.
Director fees and expenses decreased primarily due to a fewer number of directors for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Regulatory assessment expense increased primarily due to an increase in assessment rate from the consent order relating to the Bank’s compliance with BSA/AML, partially offset by a small bank assessment credit of $345 thousand from the FDIC during the year ended December 31, 2019.
Other expense decreased primarily due to a write-off related to a $577 thousand reimbursement paid to SBA in 2018, partially offset by increases in other loan related legal expenses as well as the increase in provision for unfunded loan commitments. Other loan related legal expenses were $486 thousand and $353 thousand, respectively, and provision for unfunded loan commitments was $162 thousand and $18 thousand, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.

Financial Condition
Investment Securities
The following table presents the amortized cost and fair value of the investment securities portfolio as of the dates indicated:
On June 30, 2020, the Company transferred securities held-to-maturity to securities available-for-sale as a part of the Company’s liquidity management plan in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Management determined that its securities held-to-maturity no longer adhere to the Company’s current liquidity management plan and could be sold to potentially improve the Company’s liquidity position. Accordingly, the Company was no longer able to assert that it had the intent to hold these securities until maturity and the Company’s ability to assert that it has the intent and ability to hold to maturity debt securities will be limited for up to two years from the date of transfer. The Company transferred all securities held-to-maturity of $18.8 million to securities available-for-sale, which resulted in a pre-tax increase to accumulated other comprehensive income of $787 thousand.
Total carrying value of investment securities were $120.5 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $2.8 million, or 2.4%, from $117.7 million at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to purchases of $39.4 million and an increase in fair value of securities available-for-sale of $2.9 million, partially offset by principal paydowns and calls of $38.5 million and net premium amortization of $938 thousand.
All individual securities in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or more as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 had an investment grade rating upon purchase. The issuers of these securities have not established any cause for default on these securities and various rating agencies have reaffirmed their long-term investment grade status as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. These securities have fluctuated in value since their purchase dates as market interest rates fluctuated. The Company does not intend to sell these securities and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell before the recovery of its amortized cost basis. The Company determined that the investment securities with unrealized losses for twelve months or more are not other-than-temporary impaired, and, therefore, no impairment was recognized at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
The following table presents the contractual maturity schedule for securities, at amortized cost, and their weighted-average yields as of December 31, 2020:
Loans Held-For-Investment and Allowance for Loan Losses
The following table presents the composition of the Company’s loans held-for-investment as of the dates indicated:
Loans held-for-investment were $1.58 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $132.7 million, or 9.1%, from $1.45 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to new funding of $345.9 million, advances of $100.5 million, and transfers from loan held-for-sale of $697 thousand, partially offset by paydowns and payoffs of $311.5 million, transfers to loans held-for-sale of $1.4 million and charge-offs of $1.5 million. SBA PPP loan production contributed significantly to the Company’s loan growth for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The following table shows the contractual maturities of loans held-for-investment and the distribution between fixed and floating interest rate loans at December 31, 2020:

Allowance for loan losses
The following table reflects allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category and the ratio of each loan category to total loans as of the dates indicated:
The SBA guarantee on PPP loans cannot be separated from the loan and therefore is not a separate unit of account. The Company considered the SBA guarantee in the allowance for loan losses evaluation and determined that it is not required to reserve an allowance on SBA PPP loans at December 31, 2020.
The increase in allowance for loan losses was primarily due to increased risks associated with economic and business conditions, as well as increases in special mention and substandard loans, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The following table provides an analysis of the allowance for loan losses, provision for loan losses and net charge-offs as of the dates or for the periods indicated:
Loans 30 to 89 Days Past Due and Still Accruing
The following table presents a summary of loans 30 to 89 days past due and still accruing as of the dates indicated:
Nonperforming Loans and Nonperforming Assets
The following table presents a summary of total NPLs and NPAs as of the dates indicated:
Total nonaccrual loans were $3.2 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $626 thousand, or 24.7%, from $2.5 million at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to loans placed on nonaccrual status during the year ended December 31, 2020 of $2.8 million, partially offset by payoffs and paydowns of $915 thousand and charge-offs of $1.3 million.
Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when they become 90 days past due, unless management believes the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. Past due loans may or may not be adequately collateralized, but collection efforts are continuously pursued. Loans may be restructured by management when a borrower experiences changes to their financial condition, causing an inability to meet the original repayment terms, and where management believe the borrower will eventually overcome those circumstances and repay the loan in full.
Additional income of approximately $164 thousand would have been recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020, had these loans been paid in accordance with their original terms throughout the periods indicated.
CRE Concentration
The Bank has policies and procedures in place to monitor compliance with the CRE Concentration Guidance. The Bank has set targets for CRE concentration limits as a percentage of total capital in accordance with interagency guidelines and actively manages the Bank’s exposure to CRE lending. The Bank’s construction and land development loans remain a small portion of the loan portfolio and as a percentage of total capital (as defined by the federal bank regulators) were 9.5% and 10.9%, respectively, at December 31, 2020 and 2019. As of December 31, 2020, using regulatory definitions in the CRE Concentration Guidance, CRE loans represented 256.1% of total risk-based capital, as compared to 243.6%, 253.6%, 355.1% and 352.1% as of December 31, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The reduction in CRE concentration ratio in 2018 was primarily due to the additional capital from the Company’s IPO during the year ended December 31, 2018.
The management believes that the Bank has a robust risk management framework in place for CRE concentration issues including board approved CRE concentration contingency plans. The CRE concentration contingency plan contains overview of the Bank’s strategies to mitigate and manage the concentration risks including the plans to maintain stable capital levels, having access to additional capital, maintaining adequate amount of allowance for loan losses, potentially implementing more conservative growth/lending strategies if necessary, maintaining liquidity within the CRE portfolio, and strengthening the loan workout infrastructure.
Troubled Debt Restructurings
Loans that the Bank modifies or restructures where the debtor is experiencing financial difficulties and makes a concession to the borrower in the form of changes in the amortization terms, reductions in the interest rates, the acceptance of interest only payments and, in limited cases, reductions in the outstanding loan balances are classified as TDRs. TDRs are loans modified for the purpose of alleviating temporary impairments to the borrower’s financial condition. A workout plan between a borrower and the Bank is designed to provide a bridge for the cash flow shortfalls in the near term. If the borrower works through the near term issues, in most cases, the original contractual terms of the loan will be reinstated. The following table presents the composition of loans that were modified as TDRs by portfolio segment as of the dates indicated:
Total TDRs were $639 thousand at December 31, 2020, a decrease of $182 thousand, or 22.2%, from $821 thousand at December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to payoffs and paydowns of $86 thousand and charge-offs of $133 thousand, partially offset by new TDRs of $37 thousand.
Loans Held-For-Sale
Loans held-for-sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. When a determination is made at the time of commitment to originate as held-for-investment, it is the Company’s intent to hold these loans to maturity or for the “foreseeable future,” subject to periodic reviews under the Company’s management evaluation processes, including asset/liability management and credit risk management. When the Company subsequently changes its intent to hold certain loans, the loans are transferred to held-for-sale at the lower of cost or fair value. Certain loans are transferred to held-for-sale with write-downs to allowance for loan losses.
The following table presents the composition of the Company’s loans held-for-sale as of the dates indicated:
Loans held-for-sale were $2.0 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $4 thousand, or 0.2%, from $2.0 million at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to originations of $141.2 million and transfers from loans held-for-investment of $1.4 million, partially offset by sales of $141.7 million and a transfer to loans held-for-investment of $697 thousand.
Deposits
The Bank gathers deposits primarily through its branch locations. The Bank offers a variety of deposit products including demand deposits accounts, NOW and money market accounts, savings accounts and time deposits. The following table presents summary of the Company’s deposit as of the dates indicated:
The increase in noninterest-bearing demand deposits was primarily due to the overall liquid deposit market. A total of $117.9 million of SBA PPP loans were funded through the Bank's noninterest-bearing demand deposits and deposit customers also received $93.5 million of SBA Economic Injury Disaster Loans during the past 9-month period.
The decrease in retail time deposits was primarily due to matured and closed accounts of $639.5 million, partially offset by new accounts of $97.0 million and renewals of the matured accounts of $391.7 million.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, total deposits were comprised of 33.7% and 24.3%, respectively, of noninterest-bearing demand accounts, 25.7% and 24.5%, respectively, of savings, NOW and money market accounts and 40.6% and 51.2%, respectively, of time deposits.
The following table presents the maturity of time deposits as of the dates indicated:
Shareholders’ Equity and Regulatory Capital
Capital Resources
Shareholders’ equity is influenced primarily by earnings, dividends paid on common stock and preferred stock, sales and redemptions of common stock and preferred stock, and changes in accumulated other comprehensive income caused primarily by fluctuations in unrealized gains or losses, net of taxes, on securities available-for-sale.
Shareholders’ equity was $233.8 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $7.0 million, or 3.1%, from $226.8 million at December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to the net income of $16.2 million and other comprehensive income from the fair value change in securities available-for-sale of $2.0 million, partially offset by repurchase of common stock of $6.5 million and cash dividends declared on common stock of $6.2 million.
Regulatory Capital Requirements
The Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal and state banking regulators. The Company is not currently subject to separate minimum capital measurements under the definition of a “Small Bank Holding Company.” At such time as the Company reaches the $3 billion asset level, it will again be subject to capital measurements independent of the Bank.
Federal banking agencies also require a capital conservation buffer of 2.50% in addition to the ratios required to generally be considered “adequately capitalized” under the PCA regulations. Failure to meet regulatory capital requirements may result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for the PCA, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting policies. In addition to these uniform risk-based capital guidelines and leverage ratios that apply across the industry, the regulators have the discretion to set individual minimum capital requirements for specific institutions at rates significantly above the minimum guidelines and ratios.
The following table presents a summary of the capital requirements applicable to the Bank in order to be considered “well-capitalized” from a regulatory perspective, as well as the Bank’s capital ratios as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. For comparison purpose, the Company’s ratios are included as well, all of which would have exceeded the “well-capitalized” level had the Company been subject to separate capital minimums.
The Company and the Bank’s capital conservation buffer was 9.22% and 8.95%, respectively, as of December 31, 2020, and 8.90% and 8.71%, respectively, as of December 31, 2019.
Liquidity
Liquidity refers to the measure of ability to meet the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, while at the same time meeting operating, capital and strategic cash flow needs, all at a reasonable cost. The Company continuously monitors liquidity position to ensure that assets and liabilities are managed in a manner that will meet all short-term and long-term cash requirements, while maintaining an appropriate balance between assets and liabilities to meet the return on investment objectives of the Company’s shareholders.
The Company’s liquidity position is supported by management of liquid assets and liabilities and access to alternative sources of funds. Liquid assets include cash, interest-bearing deposits in financial institutions, federal funds sold, and unpledged securities available-for-sale. Liquid liabilities may include core deposits, federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements and other borrowings. Other sources of liquidity include the sale of loans, the ability to acquire additional national market noncore deposits, additional collateralized borrowings such as FHLB advances and Federal Reserve Discount Window, and the issuance of debt securities and preferred or common securities.
The Company’s short-term and long-term liquidity requirements are primarily to fund on-going operations, including payment of interest on deposits and debt, extensions of credit to borrowers, capital expenditures and shareholder dividends. These liquidity requirements are met primarily through cash flow from operations, redeployment of prepaying and maturing balances in loan and investment securities portfolios, increases in debt financing and other borrowings, and increases in customer deposits.
Integral to the Company’s liquidity management is the administration of borrowings. To the extent the Company is unable to obtain sufficient liquidity through core deposits, the Company seeks to meet its liquidity needs through wholesale funding or other borrowings on either a short- or long-term basis.
The Company had $80.0 million and $20.0 million of outstanding FHLB advances at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Based on the values of loans pledged as collateral, the Company had $425.3 million and $404.8 million of additional borrowing capacity with FHLB as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had $65.0 million and $35.0 million of available unused unsecured federal funds lines, respectively.
In addition, available unused secured borrowing capacity from Federal Reserve Discount Window at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $35.8 million and $37.9 million, respectively. Federal Reserve Discount Window was collateralized by loans totaling $44.1 million and $46.1 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company’s borrowing capacity from the Federal Reserve Discount Window is limited by eligible collateral. The Company also maintains relationships in the capital markets with brokers and dealers to issue certificates of deposit. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, total cash and cash equivalents represented 10.1% and 8.4% of total assets, respectively.
On June 30, 2020, the Company also transferred securities held-to-maturity of $18.8 million to securities available-for-sale in order to secure additional liquidity on balance sheet. As of December 31, 2020, management was able to maintain strong on-and off-balance sheet liquidity as a result of proactive liquidity management in response to the COVID-19 pandemic evidenced by the fact that as of December 31, 2020, the Company maintained $194.1 million, or 10.1% of total assets, of cash and cash equivalents and $526.1 million, or 27.4% of total assets, of available borrowing capacity.
PCB Bancorp, on a stand-alone holding company basis, must provide for its own liquidity and its main source of funding is dividends from the Bank. There are statutory, regulatory and debt covenant limitations that affect the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the holding company. Management believes that these limitations will not impact the Company’s ability to meet its ongoing short- and long-term cash obligations.
Off-Balance Sheet Activities and Contractual Obligations
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company has limited off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into financial commitments to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial commitments include commitments to extend credit, unused lines of credit, commercial and similar letters of credit and standby letters of credit. Those instruments involve to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk not recognized in the Company’s financial statements.
The Company’s exposure to loan loss in the event of nonperformance on these financial commitments is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for loans reflected in the financial statements.
Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each client’s credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained if deemed necessary is based on management’s credit evaluation of the customer. The following table presents outstanding financial commitments whose contractual amount represents credit risk as of the dates indicated:
The Company’s exposure to loan loss in the event of nonperformance on commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for the loans reflected in the consolidated financial statements. The Company maintained reserve for off-balance sheet items of $238 thousand and $301 thousand, respectively, at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Contractual Obligations
The following table presents supplemental information regarding total contractual obligations as of the dates indicated:
Management believes that the Company will be able to meet its contractual obligations as they come due through the maintenance of adequate cash levels. Management expects to maintain adequate cash levels through profitability, loan and securities repayment and maturity activity and continued deposit gathering activities. The Company has in place various borrowing mechanisms for both short-term and long-term liquidity needs.
