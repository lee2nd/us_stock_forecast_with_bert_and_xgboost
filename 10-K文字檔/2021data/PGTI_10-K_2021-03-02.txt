MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINACIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in Item 8. Management's Discussion and Analysis comparing the results for the year ended December 28, 2019 to the results for the year ended December 29, 2018 can be found in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 28, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 26, 2020, which is hereby incorporated by reference. In the comparisons which follow, the year ended January 2, 2021 consisted of 53 weeks, whereas the year ended December 28, 2019 consisted of 52 weeks. We believe the effect of the extra week in our 2020 fiscal year was immaterial and does not impact the comparability of our results of operations for the year ended January 2, 2021 to the year ended December 28, 2019.

IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON OUR BUSINESS
During March 2020, a global COVID-19 pandemic (the “Pandemic”) was declared by the World Health Organization related to the rapidly growing outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”). The Pandemic has resulted in a significant number of infections, hospitalizations and deaths in several of our key markets, including Arizona, California, Florida and Texas. The Pandemic has significantly affected economic conditions in those markets, and in the United States in general, and internationally, including due to federal, state and local governments and employers reacting to the public health crisis with mitigation measures, and also due to the general fear and uncertainty created by the Pandemic, all of which has resulted in workforce, supply chain and production disruptions, along with reduced demand and spending in certain industries and markets, including in some of the core markets where our Western Window Systems (“WWS”) products are sold, such as California in particular. The Pandemic has and continues to create significant uncertainties in the U.S. economy. Although many of the government-mandated restrictions on economic and social activities that were put in place as part of the initial response to the Pandemic have been lifted, and vaccines with high degrees of efficacy in combatting COVID-19 have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, with others pending approval, it remains unclear when, or if, social, business, occupational, educational and economic conditions will return to pre-Pandemic conditions. The extent to which the continuing circumstances around the Pandemic could affect our future business, operations and financial results will depend upon numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict, including the severity and duration of any additional outbreaks or “waves” of COVID-19, including those involving new variants of the coronavirus, which may be more contagious and deadly than prior strains, the timing and degree of any relief that may come from the current program of nationwide vaccinations and its effect on the duration of the continuing economic, market and supply chain disruptions related to the Pandemic, and whether such vaccines are effective against any new variants of coronavirus, and the nature, amounts and duration of any additional government stimulus measures designed to bolster the economy, including the impact of any such stimulus measures on our ability to attract and retain qualified manufacturing, logistics and other employees.
- 29 -
Our first priority has been and remains the health and safety of our employees, our customers and their families and the communities in which we operate, and as COVID-19 gained a foothold in the Southeast Florida area, we took swift action to protect our employees by temporarily suspending operations at and fumigating our Miami and Hialeah, Florida facilities, each for one-week periods in April 2020. We also took that step at our Western Windows Systems facility in Phoenix, Arizona during July 2020. All of our manufacturing locations are operational and have been deemed essential under various government orders. Each of our facilities has implemented policies and procedures designed to protect the health and safety of our team members in light of the Pandemic, including: 1) continuing to monitor guidelines from federal, state and local health authorities for personal health and safety, and updating our protocols as needed; 2) implementing a mandatory face-mask policy for employees at all of our locations, and providing them with those masks where needed; 3) enforcing social distancing in common areas and work areas, including production lines where possible; 4) requiring all employees to undergo temperature checks before entering our facilities; 5) allowing only essential business visitors into our facilities, but only after prescreening and a temperature check; 6) implementing work-at-home programs where possible; 7) allowing only essential business travel; and 8) sourcing supplies such as reusable masks, hand sanitizer and cleaning solutions for use by our employees.
Due to the then unprecedented uncertainty associated with the Pandemic and its impact on the United States economy, including in our core markets, and on our business, on April 8, 2020, we announced that we were withdrawing our financial performance guidance for 2020. Additionally, due to that same uncertainty, we then took certain actions aimed at preserving cash and maintaining our liquidity, including canceling planned capital expenditures, reducing discretionary spending, closely monitoring and forecasting cash collections and disbursements, and controlling labor-related costs. This cash conservation program continued through the third quarter of 2020. Late in the second quarter of 2020, we began experiencing strengthening order levels, primarily in our Southeast segment, which continued for the remainder of 2020. As such, during the third quarter of 2020 and for the remainder of the year, we resumed spending on capital projects, which increased our level of capital spending and increased spending on labor-related costs to meet our customers’ requirements. However, we will continue to monitor spending and liquidity, and may reinstate restrictions on spending where we believe it is prudent to do so, whether due to the Pandemic, or otherwise.
We experienced some delays in receiving certain materials, primarily glass and aluminum extrusions, from certain of our supplier during 2020. Although we have taken various steps to mitigate the risks of additional supply chain disruptions, there can be no assurances that we will not experience significant disruptions to our materials supply chain in future periods during the Pandemic. Our manufacturing, sales and servicing operations have been deemed essential operations under the COVID-19 related government orders issued to-date, and thus, our operations have been permitted to continue at all of our locations. However, there can be no assurance that our operations will continue to be considered essential and exempt from any such emergency or executive orders issued by governmental authorities in response to any future increases in the extent or severity of the Pandemic, whether due to more contagious and/or deadly variants of the coronavirus, against which vaccines may or may not be effective, or otherwise. Finally, while we believe that the federal government stimulus payments and enhanced unemployment benefits may have bolstered the economy in certain respects, we believe that those payments and benefits may have had an unfavorable impact on our ability to attract and retain qualified manufacturing, logistics and certain other employees. There can be no assurances that any future government stimulus measures will not have a similar unfavorable impact on our ability to attract and retain certain types of employees, which in turn, could have an adverse impact on our production rates and speed and lead times.
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
Sales and Operations
Our sales grew to $882.6 million in our 2020 fiscal year, an increase of $137.7 million, or 18%, compared to $745.0 million in 2019. Sales in 2020 includes $93.9 million from NewSouth. Excluding the sales of NewSouth, we experienced solid organic growth of $43.7 million, or 5.9%, in 2020, compared to 2019. We experienced an increase in sales at our Southeast segment, as increased demand in Florida more than offset any negative economic effects of the Pandemic in the southeast region. Excluding the sales of NewSouth, our Southeast business unit had sales of $658.5 million in 2020, an increase of $51.9 million, or 8.5%, compared to $606.6 million in 2019. Net sales of our Western segment decreased $8.1 million, or 5.9%, to $130.2 million in 2020, from $138.3 million in 2019. We believe this decrease was due to the unfavorable impact that the Pandemic and government restrictions related thereto had on the economies in certain of Western Windows Systems’ (“WWS”) core markets, such as California in particular, and on demand for WWS products during much of 2020, offset in part by strengthening demand driving increased order activity late in the year.
- 30 -
Our start to 2020 was strong, with 2020 first quarter consolidated net sales increasing 27%, net income increasing 89%, and net income per diluted share increasing 86%, all as compared to the first quarter of 2019. The first part of our 2020 second quarter was unfavorably impacted by the effects of the Pandemic and the negative economic effects it created but ended with strengthened demand and increasing order volumes. Our Southeast and Western business units together saw order entries grow 26% in the third quarter of 2020 compared to the prior-year quarter, while NewSouth increased orders by approximately 48% in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. Once stronger order volumes returned late in the second quarter and early third quarter of 2020, they continued through the end of 2020. We believe execution of strategic selling and marketing initiatives has been a key driver of sales in addition to recovering market demand for our portfolio of products and was also aided by an active hurricane season.
Gross profit was $321.3 million for our 2020 fiscal year, which increased 23% when compared to 2019. Our gross profit increased primarily due to higher sales volume. Gross margin was 36.4% in 2020, compared to 35.0% in 2019. Although both gross profit and gross margin benefitted from operating leverage provided by the increased organic sales volume in our Southeast segment, improvements driven by operational efficiencies at our Western segment, and the addition of and accretion from our NewSouth Acquisition from its February 1, 2020 acquisition date, these benefit were partially offset by a change in product mix during 2020, compared to 2019.
Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) were $224.4 million for 2020, an increase of $48.1 million compared to 2019. SG&A in 2020 includes the SG&A of NewSouth of $36.9 million. SG&A includes $18.8 million in non-cash amortization expense, compared with $15.9 million in 2019. SG&A in 2020, compared to 2019, includes higher acquisition costs, and incremental costs relating to COVID-19 safety measures taken, including increased frequency of cleaning and sanitization of all facilities.
Interest expense was $27.7 million in 2020, an increase of $1.3 million compared to 2019. Generally, higher interest due to a higher level of outstanding 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 outstanding during 2020 as compared to 2019, was partially offset by a lower average interest rate under our 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022.
Our net income in 2020 was $45.1 million, an increase of $1.4 million when compared to 2019. Although our net income benefitted from the higher level of sales, which drove an increase in gross profit, the favorable impact of that higher gross profit on net income for 2020 was more than offset by an impairment charge of $8.0 million relating to our WWS trade name, restructuring costs and charges of $4.2 million relating to our 2020 Florida plant consolidation, and the increase in our SG&A expense from the inclusion of NewSouth in 2020, partially offset the higher gross profit.
Our backlog, which we define as customer orders that we have accepted but not yet shipped, was $199.5 million as of January 2, 2021, and $67.0 million as of December 28, 2019. Our backlog as of January 2, 2021 included $45.0 million of NewSouth backlog. The increase in backlog is a result of an increased level of order entries during the second half of 2020, and also due to supply chain disruptions we experienced in receiving certain materials, primarily glass and aluminum extrusions, during 2020, which slowed our production speed and increased our lead times. At the end of 2020, our lead times, which normally range from one to five weeks, had increased to approximately eight weeks. Although these supply chain disruptions had largely been resolved as of the end of 2020, we have taken a number of steps designed to mitigate any future supply chain disruptions, including evaluating business arrangements with additional suppliers. In addition, we believe that our acquisition of a 75% ownership stake in ECO, which has been one of our glass suppliers historically, will provide us with a high-quality, dependable supply of glass for a portion of our operations going forward.
Liquidity and Cash Flow
During 2020, we generated $75.5 million in cash flow from operations, a decrease of $5.8 million, compared to 2019. In 2020, during the second half of the year, our order entry levels began increasing and continued to increase though the end of the year. Because of this increased demand for our products, we determined to continue to manufacture and ship during late December 2020, whereas in 2019, we had our usual holiday shut-down. As such, the increase in operating cash flow we would usually experience at the end of the year from the reduction in net working capital during our typical one- to two-week holiday shut-down, did not occur in 2020, and we continued to fund working capital during late 2020.
We ended the 2020 fiscal year with $100.3 million in cash, but in 2021, we consummated the ECO Acquisition, funded with the proceeds of the Second Additional Senior notes of $63.3 million, including a premium of $3.3 million, $36.7 million of cash to help fund the purchase price for our acquisition of a 75% ownership stake in ECO, which we closed effective February 1, 2021, and $8.0 million of PGT Innovations, Inc. common stock. We have no scheduled debt repayment obligations until the maturity of our 2016 Credit Agreement on October 31, 2022 and have $76.0 million in availability under the revolving credit facility under our 2016 Credit Agreement, which does not expire until October 2024.
- 31 -
Cash generated from operations was generally used to fund operations and investing cash flows, which was primarily composed of capital expenditures in 2020. However, in 2020, we consummated the NewSouth Acquisition, which was funded with proceeds from the First Additional Senior Notes of $53.2 million, including a premium of $3.2 million, and with $37.2 million in cash on hand. Additionally, during 2020, due to our ability to successfully generate free cash flow, we voluntarily prepaid $10.0 million in borrowings under our 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022. These incremental uses of cash flow were partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditure spending of $6.5 million during 2020, compared to 2019, due to the previously discussed cash conservation program.
During 2019, we made opportunistic repurchases of 393,819 shares of our common stock at a cost of $5.5 million, under a program for share repurchases of up to $30 million, authorized and approved by our Board of Directors on May 22, 2019, representing capital returned to our shareholders. We made no such repurchases during 2020. However, no assurances are provided that we will not make future repurchases under this program. Any future stock repurchases would be subject to the pre-approval of our Board of Directors. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for a more detailed discussion of this event.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Analysis of Selected Items from our Consolidated Statements of Operations
- 32 -
Full Year 2020 Compared with Full Year 2019
Beginning in 2020, sales into certain states have been reclassified between segments. As such, segment sales amounts for the year ended December 28, 2019, along with the related income from operations, have been revised to conform to the 2020 presentation.
Net sales
Net sales for 2020 were $882.6 million, a $137.6 million, or 18.5%, increase in sales, from $745.0 million in the prior year.
The following table shows net sales by segment (in millions, except percentages):
Net sales of our Southeast segment were $752.4 million in 2020, compared with $606.6 million in 2019, an increase of $145.8 million. Net sales of our Western segment were $130.2 million in 2020, compared with $138.3 million in 2019, a decrease of $8.1 million. Sales of our Western segment are composed of sales of WWS.
The increase in net sales in 2020 of $137.6 million was primarily driven by the inclusion of the net sales of our NewSouth Acquisition from its February 1, 2020 acquisition date, but also by organic sales growth in our Southeast segment. These increases in net sales were partially offset by a slight sales decrease at our Western segment. Net sales of our Southeast segment, excluding the sales of our NewSouth Acquisition, increased $51.9 million, or 8.5% as compared to 2019. Net sales of our Western segment decreased $8.1 million, or 5.9%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The organic sales growth at our Southeast segment in 2020 was a result of strong organic growth during the entire year, except for a decrease in the second quarter of 2020, as our Southeast segment was unfavorably impacted by the Pandemic and consumer and government responses thereto. The decrease in sales at our Western segment in 2020 was driven by the economic challenges and related decrease in demand for our products in our core Western states, especially during the second quarter of 2020, but also continuing into the second half of 2020, caused by the Pandemic and government responses thereto, including stay-at-home orders, as well as by the general economic uncertainty that persisted in those markets. That decline in sales was offset in part by stronger sales in the first quarter of 2020, prior to the Pandemic. However, the rate of decrease in sales at our Western segment lessened during the second half of 2020, as compared to the second quarter of 2020, due to a strengthening new construction housing market in the West, but to a lesser extent than the new construction markets in the Southeast. We believe the Pandemic has impacted our Southeast segment to a lesser degree than our Western segment as, during the second and third quarters of 2020, our customers in the Southeast continued to prepare for what was expected to be, and which was, an active 2020 hurricane season. Net sales of our Southeast segment for 2020 included $93.9 million from our NewSouth Acquisition.
Gross profit and gross margin
Gross profit was $321.3 million in 2020, an increase of $60.9 million, or 23.4%, from $260.4 million in the prior year. Gross profit increased on the higher level of sales in 2020, compared with 2019, due to the inclusion of NewSouth since its February 1, 2020 acquisition date, and also due to organic sales growth in our Southeast segment. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in gross profit at our Western segment as a result of the decrease in sales in that segment during 2020, compared to 2019.
Gross margin was 36.4% in 2020, compared to 35.0% in the prior year, a percentage-point increase of 1.4%. Gross margin increased in 2020 due primarily to the favorable effects of a higher sales and the resulting additional leverage provided to cover fixed costs, lower material costs, primarily aluminum costs, a heightened focus on labor cost management leading to improved operating efficiencies, especially at our Western segment, and the addition of and accretion from our NewSouth Acquisition. These benefits were offset by the negative effects of a change in organic mix of products during 2020 compared to 2019, as our Southeast segment products have slightly lower gross margins than our Western segment products.
- 33 -
Selling, general and administrative expenses
SG&A expenses for 2020 were $224.4 million, an increase of $48.1 million, or 27.3%, from $176.3 million in 2019. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A was 25.4% in 2020, compared to 23.7% in 2019. The increase in SG&A is primarily the result of the inclusion of the SG&A expenses of NewSouth for 2020, which resulted in an increase in SG&A totaling $36.9 million from its acquisition on February 1, 2020, which includes $3.0 million in amortization of the amortizable intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of NewSouth. Excluding the increase in SG&A from the inclusion of NewSouth, SG&A increased $11.2 million in 2020, compared to 2019. As a percentage of net sales, excluding the SG&A of NewSouth, SG&A was 23.8% in 2020, compared to 23.7% in 2019.Excluding the SG&A of NewSouth, the increase in SG&A in 2020, compared to 2019, was due to the inclusion of costs in 2020 of $2.4 million relating to COVID-19 safety measures taken, including increased frequency of cleaning and sanitization of all facilities, as well as an increase in acquisition costs relating to both our NewSouth and ECO acquisitions affecting 2020 SG&A, whereas 2019 including only NewSouth Acquisition costs in the fourth quarter of 2019. Additionally, there were increases in several other categories, including depreciation, stock-based compensation, as well as additional costs from investing in our strategic selling and marketing initiatives, and higher distribution costs on increased sales levels.
Impairment of trade name
There was an impairment of our WWS trade name of $8.0 million in the second quarter of 2020. Following an increase in net sales of 14.0% in the first quarter of 2020, compared to the first quarter of 2019, net sales at our WWS reporting unit decreased 19.3% in the second quarter of 2020 compared to last year’s second quarter. As a result of this decrease in net sales in our second quarter of 2020, compared to the second quarter of last year, as well as continued deterioration in economic and market conditions surrounding the Pandemic, we determined to complete an interim impairment test of our WWS trade name as of July 4, 2020. For this interim impairment test, we decreased our modeling assumptions for net sales of our WWS reporting unit for our 2020 fiscal year based on a reassessment of our key assumptions in our modeling, including an updated assessment of macro growth relating to the industry in our WWS reporting unit’s key markets. We also decreased our 2021 growth rate assumption as we expected the challenging macro-economic conditions in the core western markets where our WWS products are sold to continue during 2021. Based on our revised modeling, we concluded that the fair value of our WWS trade name was less than its carrying value, which resulted in an impairment of our WWS trade name of $8.0 million in the second quarter of 2020.
Net sales at our WWS reporting unit for 2020 exceeded our modeling assumptions used during our second impairment test of our WWS trade name as of July 4, 2020. As such, we performed a qualitative assessment as of the first day of our 2020 fourth quarter and concluded that it was not necessary to perform a Step 1 impairment test for our annual test for impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets as no new triggering events or conditions were identified.
Restructuring costs and charges
As we announced on April 20, 2020, the Company’s management approved a plan to consolidate its manufacturing operations in Florida, which included exiting our manufacturing facility in Orlando, Florida, where our WinDoor and Eze-Breeze products were assembled and relocating the manufacturing of those products to our Venice and Tampa, Florida plants, respectively. We ceased production at the Orlando facility during June 2020. As a result of this consolidation, we recorded restructuring costs and charges totaling $4.2 million in 2020.
Of the $4.2 million in restructuring costs and charges, $1.9 million represents costs relating to and write-offs of property, plant and equipment, including the impairment of the right-of-use asset of the lease of the Orlando, Florida facility, $1.2 million represents charges relating to inventory not expected to be used due to product rationalization, which we chose to dispose of, and $1.1 million represents personnel-related costs. All of the personnel-related costs had been paid in cash by the end of our 2020 third quarter.
- 34 -
The following represents activities of restructuring costs and charges for 2020:
Income from operations
Income from operations was $84.7 million in 2020, an increase of $0.6 million, from $84.1 million in 2019. Income from operations in 2020 includes $85.8 million from our Southeast segment and $11.1 million from our Western segment, compared to $73.5 million and $10.6 million from our Southeast and Western segments, respectively, in 2019, all after allocation of corporate operating costs in both periods. Income from operations in 2020 was also impacted by an impairment charge of $8.0 million in the second quarter of 2020 relating to our WWS trade name of our Western segment, and restructuring costs and charges of $4.2 million relating to our Florida plant consolidation actions taken in the 2020 second quarter, and further adjusted in the 2020 third quarter, relating to our Southeast segment. The increase in income from operations in 2020, compared to 2019 is primarily a result of solid organic growth in our Southeast segment, and the inclusion of our NewSouth Acquisition for nearly the entire year of 2020, partially offset by a decrease at our Western segment due to Pandemic-related effects and challenging market conditions, as well as the impairment and restructuring charges taken during 2020.
Interest expense
Interest expense was $27.7 million in 2020, an increase of $1.3 million from $26.4 million in 2019. Interest expense in 2020 includes an increase in interest cost due to the issuance of the First Additional Senior Notes totaling $50.0 million effective on January 24, 2020, which we used to finance a portion of the purchase price for our acquisition of NewSouth. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in interest costs for our term loan under our 2016 Credit Agreement due to a decrease in the weighted-average borrowing rate in 2020, compared to 2019. Additionally, during 2020, we made prepayments of borrowing under our 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 totaling $10.0 million, which resulted in interest cost savings under the credit agreement. There were no prepayments of term loan borrowings during 2019 under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022.
Debt extinguishment costs
Debt extinguishment costs were $1.5 million in 2019. In connection with the Third Amendment, certain existing lenders changed their positions in or exited the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, which resulted in the write-offs of portions of the deferred financing costs and original issue discount allocated to these lenders. Additionally, at the time of the issuance of the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026, certain existing lenders reduced their positions in the revolving credit portion of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, which resulted in the write-offs of the deferred financing costs allocated to these lenders. As such, write-offs totaling $1.5 million is classified as debt extinguishment costs in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 28, 2019.
- 35 -
Income tax expense
Income tax expense was $11.9 million for 2020, representing an effective tax rate of 20.9%. This compares to income tax expense of $12.4 million for 2019, representing an effective tax rate of 22.2%.
Income tax expense in 2020 includes several discrete items of income tax benefits, including Federal and state research and development tax credit true-ups to actual from the assumptions we made when preparing our 2019 tax provision, which totaled $574 thousand, and a refund from the state of Florida relating to excess taxes received by the state caused by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was $700 thousand, which benefitted tax expense by $553 thousand, net of its Federal tax effect. In 2019, there were Federal and state research and development tax credit true-ups totaling $146 thousand. Excess tax benefits relating to equity awards, treated as a discrete item of income tax, were $769 thousand in 2020, and were $2.1 million in 2019. Excluding discrete items of income tax, the effective tax rates for 2020 and 2019, would have been income tax expense rates of 24.2% and 25.9%, respectively. The lower overall tax rate in 2020, compared to 2019, is the result of several factors primarily relating to a lower overall estimate state tax rate due to the addition of NewSouth’s sales in Florida, which currently has a temporarily reduced state corporate income tax rate, which increased our estimated apportionment in Florida, as well as other state tax rate reductions.
We expect to continue to be profitable in 2021, and thus, that we will incur income tax expense at a combined Federal and state effective rate of approximately 25%, excluding discrete tax items. This rate is based on the corporate Federal income tax rate of 21% under the TCJA, plus a blended statutory state rate, taking into consideration a reduction in the corporate income tax rate in the state of Florida, from 5.5% to 4.458% for the tax years of 2019 to 2021.
In response to the Pandemic, in March 2020, the U.S. Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) legislation aimed at providing relief for individuals and businesses that have been negatively impacted by the Pandemic. The CARES Act did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements. During 2020, we made payments of estimated Federal and state income taxes totaling $9.2 million, all during the third and fourth quarters of 2020, as the deadlines for such payments to the United States government, and the majority of states in which we have nexus, which followed the payment deadline extension of the CARES Act, had been deferred until July 15, 2020. However, we received a refund from the state of Florida relating to excess taxes received by the state caused by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, described above, which was $700 thousand, before Federal effect. During 2019, we made payments of estimated Federal and state income taxes totaling $11.9 million.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our principal source of liquidity is cash flow generated by operations, supplemented by borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, if ever needed. We believe our cash generating capability will continue to provide us with financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs. Our primary capital requirements are to fund working capital needs, and to meet required debt payments, including debt service payments on borrowings and fund capital expenditures.
Consolidated Cash Flows
The following table summarizes our cash flow results for 2020 and 2019:
Operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities was $75.5 million for 2020, compared to $81.2 million for 2019.
The decrease in cash flows from operations of $5.7 million in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to the changes in operating cash flows, including an increase of $110.2 million in collections from customers in 2020 compared to 2019, as the result of increased sales, which was partially offset by an increase in payments to suppliers of $91.3 million as the result of higher procurements of inventory, an increase in personnel related disbursements of $24.8 million due to a larger number of employees during 2020, compared to 2019, and an increase in debt service costs of $0.7 million in 2020, compared to 2019, primarily as a result of the issuance of the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026, including the First Additional Senior Notes relating to the acquisition of NewSouth. Also, net tax payments decreased $2.7 million in 2020, compared to 2019. Other collections of cash and other cash activity, net, decreased by $1.8 million. Other collections of cash primarily relate to sales of scrap aluminum.

Direct cash flows from operations for 2020 and 2019 are presented below:
Days sales outstanding (DSO), which we calculate as accounts receivable divided by average daily sales, was 45 days on January 2, 2021, compared to 42 days on December 28, 2019.
Inventory on hand as of January 2, 2021, was $60.3 million, an increase of $16.5 million from December 28, 2019. Inventory on hand at January 2, 2021 includes $4.7 million relating to NewSouth.
Our inventory consists principally of raw materials purchased for the manufacture of our products and limited finished goods inventory as the majority of our products are custom, made-to-order products. Our inventory levels are more closely aligned with our number of product offerings rather than our level of sales. We have maintained our inventory level to have (i) raw materials required to support new product launches; (ii) a sufficient level of safety stock on certain items to ensure an adequate supply of material in the event of a sudden increase in demand and given our short lead-times; and (iii) adequate lead times for raw materials purchased from overseas suppliers in bulk supply. Inventory turns for the year ended January 2, 2021, was 10.8 times, on par with 10.9 times for the year ended December 28, 2019.
Management monitors and evaluates raw material inventory levels based on the need for each discrete item to fulfill short-term requirements calculated from current order patterns and to provide appropriate safety stock. Because the majority of our products are made-to-order, we have only a small amount of finished goods and work in progress inventory. Due to these factors, we believe our inventories are not excessive, and we expect the value of such inventories will be realized.
Investing activities. Cash used in investing activities was $114.4 million in 2020, compared to $31.2 million in 2019 an increase in cash used of $83.2 million. We used $90.4 million of cash to acquire businesses in 2020, whereas in 2019 we had no acquisitions. Also, in 2020, we used cash of $24.8 million for capital expenditures, compared to $31.3 million in 2019, a decrease of $6.5 million in cash used. Finally, in 2020, we received proceeds of $766 thousand from the sales of property, plant and equipment, compared to $71 thousand in 2019, an increase of $695 thousand in cash proceeds received from sales of property, plant and equipment.
Financing activities. Cash provided by financing activities was $42.0 million in 2020, compared with cash used of $5.4 million in 2019, an increase in cash provided of $47.4 million. In 2020, we issued the First Additional Senior Notes, which provided proceeds of $53.2 million, including a premium of $3.2 million. Proceeds from the issuance of the First Additional Senior Notes were used to partially fund the acquisition of NewSouth. We made voluntary prepayments of borrowings of the term loan under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 of $10.0 million in 2020. In 2019, we entered into the Third Amendment of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, which resulted in the repayment of the then existing term loan with proceeds under a new term loan in the amount of $64.0 million. There were payments of other debt of $163 thousand in 2019 as well. There were payments of financing costs totaling $1.3 million in 2020, related to the issuance of the First Additional Senior Notes, compared with $0.9 million in 2019 relating to the Third Amendment of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, an increase in cash used for refinancing costs of $0.4 million.
Taxes paid relating to common stock withheld from employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards were $0.8 million in 2020, versus $0.5 million in 2019, an increase in cash used of $0.3 million. Proceeds from the exercises of stock options were $0.6 million in 2020, compared to $1.6 million in 2019, a decrease in proceeds of $1.0 million. There were proceeds from stock issued under our 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan of $305 thousand during 2020, compared with $59 thousand in 2019. During 2019, we made repurchases of 393,819 shares of our common stock totaling $5.5 million under a repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors.
- 37 -
Share Repurchase Program. On May 22, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized and approved a share repurchase program of up to $30 million. The repurchases may be made in open market or private transactions from time to time. Repurchases of shares may be made under a Rule 10b5-1 plan, which would permit repurchases when the Company might otherwise be precluded from doing so under applicable laws. The Company bases repurchase decisions, including the timing of repurchases, on factors such as the Company’s stock price, general economic and market conditions, the potential impact on the Company’s capital structure, the expected return on competing uses of capital such as strategic acquisitions and capital investments, and other corporate considerations, as determined by management. From the inception of the program on May 22, 2019, through December 28, 2019,we made repurchases of 393,819 shares of our common stock at a total cost of $5.5 million. We made no repurchases under this program during 2020. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. We may make opportunistic purchases in the future.
Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures vary depending on prevailing business factors, including current and anticipated market conditions. In 2020 and 2019, we spent $24.8 million and $31.3 million, respectively, for capital expenditures, primarily representing equipment purchases and facility improvements expected to support growth. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the impact of the Pandemic on our operations and cash flows, late in the first quarter of 2020, and continuing through the second quarter and early third quarter of 2020, we conserved cash by reducing the level of funding of capital projects. During the third quarter of 2020 and for the remainder of the year, we resumed and caught-up on funding of capital projects, which increased our level of capital spending. But the period of cash conservation during 2020 resulted in a decrease of $6.5 million in cash used for capital expenditures in 2020 compared to 2019.
Management expects to spend between $28 million and $34 million for capital expenditures in 2021, excluding capital expenditures relating to our ECO Acquisition, if any. Our capital expenditure program is geared towards making investments in capital assets targeted at increasing both gross sales and margins, but also includes capital expenditures for maintenance capital.
Capital Resources and Debt Covenants
2018 Equity Issuance
On September 18, 2018, we completed an underwritten, public offering of 7,000,000 shares of our common stock, at a public offering price of $23.00 per share.
The offering resulted in gross proceeds to the Company of $161.0 million. Net of an underwriting fee of $1.15 per share, net cash proceeds to the Company approximated $153.0 million. We used $152.0 million of these proceeds to prepay borrowings outstanding under the term loan portion of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022. The remainder of the proceeds were used for working capital or general corporate purposes, including payment of offering expenses of approximately $447 thousand, classified as a reduction of additional paid-in capital in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 28, 2019.
2018 Senior Notes Due 2026
On August 10, 2018, we completed the issuance of $315.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% senior notes (“2018 Senior Notes Due 2026”), issued at 100% of their principal amount. The 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 are jointly and severally and fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of the Company’s existing and future restricted subsidiaries, other than any restricted subsidiary of the Company that does not guarantee the existing senior secured credit facilities or any permitted refinancing thereof. The 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and the guarantors, respectively, and rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior debt and senior to all existing and future subordinated debt of the Company and the guarantors. The 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 were offered under Rule 144A of the Securities Act, and in transactions outside the United States under Regulation S of the Securities Act, and have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act.
On January 24, 2020, we completed the add-on issuance of $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% senior notes (“First Additional Senior Notes”), issued at 106.375% of their principal amount, resulting in a premium to us of $3.2 million. The First Additional Senior Notes are part of the same issuance of, and rank equally and form a single series with, the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026. Proceeds from the First Additional Senior Notes, including premium, were used, together with cash on hand, to pay the $90.4 million purchase price in the NewSouth Acquisition.
On January 25, 2021, we completed a second add-on issuance of $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 (the “Second Additional Senior Notes”), issued at 105.5% of their principal amount, resulting in a premium to us of $3.3 million. The Second Additional Notes are part of the same issuance of, and rank equally and form a single series with, the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026. Proceeds from the Second Additional Senior Notes, including premium, were used, together with $36.7 million of cash on hand, to pay the $100.0 million cash portion of the $108.0 million purchase price in the ECO Acquisition. The common stock portion of the purchase price was represented by the issuance of 357,797 shares of PGT Innovations, Inc. common stock on February 1, 2021, with a then value of $22.36 per share, and are legally restricted from being sold by the recipient for a three-year period from February 1, 2021.
- 38 -
The 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 mature on August 10, 2026. Interest on the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 is payable semi-annually, in arrears, beginning on February 16, 2019, with interest accruing at a rate of 6.75% per annum from August 10, 2018. We incurred financing costs relating to bank fees and professional services costs relating to the offering and issuance of the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 totaling $10.4 million, and the First Additional Senior Notes totaling $1.3 million, partially offset by the $3.2 million premium on the First Additional Senior Notes, which is being amortized under the effective interest method. See “Deferred Financing Costs” below. As of January 2, 2021, the face value of debt outstanding under the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 was $365.0 million, and accrued interest totaled $10.4 million.
The indenture for the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 gives us the option to redeem some or all of the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 at the redemption prices and on the terms specified in the indenture governing the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026. The indenture governing the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 does not require us to make any mandatory redemptions or sinking fund payments. However, upon the occurrence of a change of control, as defined in the indenture, the Company is required to offer to repurchase the notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase.
The indenture for the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 includes certain covenants limiting the ability of the Company and any guarantors to, (i) incur additional indebtedness; (ii) pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of capital stock or make certain other restricted payments or investments; (iii) enter into agreements that restrict distributions from restricted subsidiaries; (iv) sell or otherwise dispose of assets; (v) enter into transactions with affiliates; (vi) create or incur liens; merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of the Company’s assets; (vii) place restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to the Company; and (viii) designate the Company’s subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries. These covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications.
2016 Credit Agreement Due 2022
On February 16, 2016, we entered into the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, among us, the lending institutions identified in the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, and Truist Financial Corporation (formerly known as SunTrust Bank), as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent. The 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 establishes new senior secured credit facilities in an aggregate amount of $310.0 million, consisting of a $270.0 million Term B term loan facility originally maturing in February 2022 that amortizes on a basis of 1% annually during its six-year term, and a $40.0 million revolving credit facility originally maturing in February 2021 that includes a swing line facility and a letter of credit facility.
Our obligations under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 are, subject to exceptions, guaranteed by substantially all of our wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries that are restricted subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of our assets as well as our direct and indirect restricted subsidiaries’ assets.
On March 16, 2018, we entered into an amendment of our 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 (the “Second Amendment”). The Second Amendment, among other things, decreases the applicable interest rate margins for the Initial Term Loans (as defined in the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022) from (i) 3.75% to 2.50%, in the case of the Base Rate Loans (as defined in the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022), and (ii) 4.75% to 3.50%, in the case of the Eurodollar Loans (as defined in the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022). On February 17, 2017, we entered into the first amendment to our 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022, which also resulted in decreases in the applicable margins, but which, unlike the Second Amendment, did not include any changes in lender positions.
On October 31, 2019, we entered into an amendment of our 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 (“Third Amendment”). The Third Amendment provides for, among other things, (i) a three-year Term A loan in the then aggregate principal amount of $64.0 million (the “Initial Term A Loan”), maturing in October 2022, which refinances in full our existing Term B term loan facility under the 2016 Credit Agreement, and has no regularly scheduled amortization, and (ii) a new five-year revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $80.0 million (the “Revolving Facility”), maturing in October 2024, which replaces our existing $40.0 million revolving credit facility under the 2016 Credit Agreement, and includes a swing-line facility and letter of credit facility. Our obligations under the 2016 Credit Agreement continue to be secured by substantially all of our assets, as well as our direct and indirect subsidiaries’ assets.
Pursuant to the Third Amendment, interest on all loans under the 2016 Credit Agreement is payable either quarterly or at the expiration of any LIBOR interest period applicable thereto. The Third Amendment decreases the applicable interest rate margins for the Initial Term Loan A from (i) 2.50% to a spread ranging from 1.00% to 1.75% based on our first lien net leverage ratio, in the case of the Base Rate Loans (with a floor of 100 basis points), and (ii) 3.50% to a spread ranging from 2.00% to 2.75% based on our first lien leverage ratio, in the case of the Eurodollar Loans (with a floor of zero basis points).
Also, in connection with the Third Amendment, we will pay quarterly fees on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility equal to a percentage spread (ranging from 0.25% to 0.35%) based on our first lien net leverage ratio. The Third Amendment also modifies the springing financial covenant under the 2016 Credit Agreement to provide that such financial covenant will not be tested until the Initial Term A Loan is paid in full. As of January 2, 2021, there were $4.0 million, in letters of credit outstanding and $76.0 million available under the Revolving Facility.
- 39 -
Fees and costs relating to the Third Amendment were $0.9 million, which are deferred and being amortized. In connection with the Third Amendment, certain existing lenders modified their positions in or exited the 2016 Credit Agreement. Deferred financing costs and original issue discount allocated to these lenders of $1.5 million were written-off and classified as debt extinguishment costs in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended January 2, 2021. As of January 2, 2021, after making prepayments of borrowings totaling $10.0 million during the third quarter of 2020, the principal amount of debt outstanding under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 was $54.0 million, and accrued interest was $12 thousand.
The weighted average all-in interest rate for borrowings under the term-loan portion of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 was 2.15% as of January 2, 2021 and was 3.77% at December 28, 2019.
Pursuant to the Third Amendment, the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 contains a springing financial covenant that would apply if we draw in excess of thirty-five percent (35%) of the revolving facility commitment (excluding $7.5 million of undrawn letters of credit and letters of credit and draws thereunder that are cash collateralized at 103% of the stated amount thereof from such availability test). To the extent in effect, the springing financial covenant would prohibit us from exceeding a maximum first lien net leverage ratio (based on the ratio of total first lien (less unrestricted cash) debt to EBITDA) as of the last day of each applicable fiscal quarter. To the extent the springing financial covenant is in effect, the first lien net leverage ratio currently cannot exceed 4.00:1.00 (4.50:1.00 during a significant acquisition period as defined). We have not been required to test our first lien net leverage ratio because we have not exceeded 35% of our revolving capacity.
The 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 also contains a number of affirmative and restrictive covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of additional debt, liens on property, acquisitions and investments, loans and guarantees, mergers, consolidations, liquidations and dissolutions, asset sales, dividends and other payments in respect of our capital stock, entry into restrictive agreements, prepayments of certain debt and transactions with affiliates, in each case, subject to exceptions and qualifications. The 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 also contains customary events of default. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the amounts outstanding under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 may be accelerated and may become immediately due and payable.
On September 18, 2018, contemporaneously with the 2018 Equity Issuance, we prepaid $152.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the term loan portion of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022. On December 19, 2018, we voluntarily prepaid an additional $8.0 million in borrowings under the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022. Interest expense, net, in the consolidated statement of operations in the year ended December 28, 2019 includes $5.6 million, of accelerated amortization of lenders fees and discount relating to the prepayments of $152.0 million and $8.0 million, of borrowings under the term loan portion of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 we made.
Deferred Financing Costs
All debt-related fees, costs and original issue discount, including those related to the revolving credit portion of the facility, is classified as a reduction of the carrying value of long-term debt. The activity relating to third-party fees and costs, lender fees and discount for the year ended January 2, 2021, are as follows:
Estimated amortization expense relating to third-party fees and costs, lender fees and discount for the years indicated, as of January 2, 2021, is as follows:
- 40 -
As a result of prepayments of the term loan portion of the 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 totaling $214.0 million since its inception in February 2016, and pursuant to the Third Amendment, we have no future scheduled repayments until the maturity of the facility on October 31, 2022. The contractual future maturities of long-term debt outstanding, as of January 2, 2021, are as follows (at face value):
Long-Term Debt

Effective on August 10, 2018, the Company completed the issuance of $315.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% senior notes due August 10, 2026, issued at 100% of their principal amount. The senior notes were issued to finance, together with cash on hand, the WWS acquisition. On January 24, 2020, we issued an additional $50.0 million add-on senior notes, issued at 106.375% of their principal amount, to finance, together with cash on hand, the $90.4 million acquisition of NewSouth. Effective on January 25, 2021, we issued an additional $60.0 million add-on senior notes, issued at 105.5% of their principal amount, to finance together with cash on hand, and $8.0 million in Company common stock, the $108.0 million investment of our 75% ownership stake in ECO.

We are obligated to purchase certain raw materials used in the production of our products from certain suppliers pursuant to stocking programs. If all of these programs were cancelled by us, as of January 2, 2021, we would be required to pay $12.1 million for various materials.
At January 2, 2021, we had $4.0 million in standby letters of credit related to our workers’ compensation insurance coverage.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we follow U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations.
On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such difference could be material. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Item 8, Note 2. The following is a summary of our more significant accounting estimates that require the use of judgment in preparing the financial statements.
Valuation of Trade Name in Business Combination
The assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Intangible assets acquired in business combinations consist of trade names, developed technology, customer relationships, and other intangible assets. The fair value of the trade name intangible assets are determined utilizing the relief from royalty method which is a form of the income approach. Under this method, a royalty rate based on observed market royalties is applied to projected revenue supporting the trade name and discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate.
We applied this approach to the valuation of the trade name for the NewSouth Acquisition, for which the most significant intangible asset identified was its trade name. Specific to this intangible asset, our estimates of projected revenue included forecasted revenue growth rates that required judgment by management. Actual results can differ from our estimates, requiring adjustments to our assumptions. The estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in connection with the NewSouth Acquisition was approximately $27.4 million, which included its trade name with an estimated fair value of $22.2 million.
- 42 -
Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets
We disclosed the Company’s accounting policy for Goodwill and Trade Names under Item 8, Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. We perform our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing on the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter of each year, and at interim periods if needed based on occurrence of triggering events.
Given the general deterioration in economic and market conditions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and the narrow excess of fair value over carrying value of our WinDoor and WWS trade names as described in 2019, the Company determined it should complete interim quantitative impairment tests of its WinDoor and WWS trade names as of the end of the Company’s first quarter of 2020. These interim impairment tests did not indicate that impairments of those assets existed at that time. Following an increase in net sales of 14.0% in the first quarter of 2020, compared to the first quarter of last year, net sales at our WWS reporting unit decreased 19.3% in the second quarter of 2020, compared to the second quarter of last year. As a result of the decrease in net sales during our second quarter of 2020, compared to the second quarter of last year, as well as continued deterioration in macro-economic conditions in our core western markets relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, we determined to complete a second interim impairment test of our WWS trade name as of July 4, 2020. For this second interim impairment test, we further decreased our modeling assumptions for net sales of our WWS reporting unit for our 2020 fiscal year based on a reassessment of our key assumptions in our modeling, including an updated assessment of macro industry growth in our WWS reporting unit’s key markets. We also decreased our 2021 growth rate assumption as we expect the challenging macro-economic conditions in our core western markets to continue during 2021. Based on our revised modeling, we concluded that the fair value of our WWS trade name was less than its carrying value, which resulted in an impairment of our WWS trade name of $8.0 million in our second quarter of 2020. Sales for our WWS reporting unit for the 2020 fiscal year exceeded our modeling assumptions used during our second impairment test of our WWS trade name as of July 4, 2020. However, should our WWS reporting unit experience future financial results which are below our most recently updated projections, the estimated fair value of our WWS trade name could again fall below the carrying value, which could result in further impairment.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
Reference Rate Reform
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting.” ASU 2020-04 is intended to provide temporary optional expedients and exceptions to U.S. GAAP guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens related to the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. The transition to new reference interest rates will require certain contracts to be modified and ASU 2020-04 is intended to mitigate the effects of this transition. This new guidance was effective upon issuance of this ASU for contract modifications and hedging relationships on a prospective basis. We do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Accounting for Income Taxes
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes.” ASU 2019-12 simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles and also clarifies and amends existing guidance. This standard is effective beginning January 1, 2021, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect this standard to have any impact on our consolidated financial statements.

FORWARD OUTLOOK
Net sales
Looking ahead into 2021, we believe Florida’s economic factors that impact our business currently are stable. After some softness in single-family housing starts in the late first quarter of 2020 due to the impacts of the Pandemic, single-family housing starts for the remainder of 2020 grew steadily. For 2021, single-family housing starts in Florida are expected to grow by approximately 5%, below what we believe the Florida market can support. Within our core Florida market, we expect our growth in sales into the residential new construction market to outpace our repair and remodel segment growth in 2021, as compared to 2020. We also expect to significantly reduce our backlog during 2021, assuming there are no significant Pandemic-related disruptions to our supply chain for materials, and that we are able to attract, hire, and retain the labor we need to make our products and conduct our operations, and that the Pandemic does not create any significant increases in labor-related absenteeism. In our western market, we expect to see new construction growth driven by year-over-year recovery from the softness which lingered during 2020, primarily due to the conditions caused by the Pandemic, driven by a recovery in California. Homebuilder confidence indices ended the year at near record levels, both nationally and regionally, in the South and West. Based on that confidence, as well as our expectation that interest rates will remaining relatively low and the persistent shortage of housing in many markets will continue, we believe indications are that 2021 will be a solid year for single-family housing starts in our primary markets. For our NewSouth direct-to-consumer business, we expect to see solid growth in 2021, compared to 2020, due to market penetration in legacy store markets, but also from market penetration in new markets from new store openings.
We expect 2021 full-year sales to range between $1.0 billion and $1.075 billion, representing an increase of between 13% and 10%, as compared to 2020. This estimated sales range for 2021 includes our ECO Acquisition at 100% for the post-acquisition period in 2021.
Gross profit and gross margin
We believe the following factors, which are not all inclusive, may impact our gross profit and gross margin in 2021:
•
Our gross margin percentages are influenced by total sales due to operating leverage of fixed costs, and also by product mix. We expect product mix to show more growth in residential new construction, where gross margins are relatively lower, than in repair and remodel sales, for which gross margins are relatively higher.

During 2020, our gross profit and gross margin percentage benefitted from improved operational efficiencies in our PGT and WWS legacy businesses and the higher gross margin contributed by our NewSouth sales, whose gross margin on its direct-to-consumer sales is generally higher than sales to our traditional dealer networks. Our focus in 2021 will be to continue to sustain and further improve operating efficiencies, including material usage and labor cost reductions. Furthermore, we plan to take steps in our product pricing in 2021 to benefit gross margin and offset inflation currently affecting raw material pricing in building materials. Finally, because ECO produces its own glass and given our controlling ownership stake in ECO, we plan to source more of our glass needs from ECO in 2021, which we believe will favorably impact our glass costs.

We believe that the uncertainty around the new Presidential Administration’s policies on tariffs on steel and aluminum could result in continued fluctuations in aluminum prices, but that potential exists for a continuation of the Trump Administration’s policies towards imports of steel and aluminum by the new administration, including the potential for the imposition of additional tariffs on such products entering the United States, as demonstrated by the new administration’s recent decision to reinstate tariffs on aluminum imported to the United States from the United Arab Emirates. We believe the uncertainty surrounding the potential for these actions has and may continue to cause unpredictable volatility in aluminum prices during 2021, and that volatility could be significant. As of the beginning of 2021, we are hedged for approximately 65 percent of our anticipated aluminum needs for 2021, at an average price of $0.81 per pound, which is an average representing the cash price per pound, excluding the delivery component for the Midwest Premium. The current cash price is approximately $0.91 per pound.
•
Our gross profit and gross margin are also influenced by labor costs. Portions of our labor force have become more tenured and, therefore, labor costs have begun to normalize as efficiencies are achieved. However, we believe a strong jobs environment in Florida, combined with the effects of Federal government stimulus payments and enhanced unemployment benefits, has resulted in a contraction in the labor pool, which has led the Company to increase the wages it pays certain of its employees. We expect a tight labor market to continue during 2021 as the economy continues its recovery from the effects of the Pandemic, and because we expect additional forms of government stimulus to be approved.

Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A)
This expense category will be affected by the inclusion of the SG&A of ECO in 2021, including non-cash amortization depending on the level of amortizable intangible assets we determine to have acquired, if any. We are currently in the process of estimating the fair values of acquired intangible assets. We expect to leverage fixed SG&A on anticipated higher sales in 2021, compared to 2020, and to continue to look for areas within SG&A to drive efficiencies. However, we expect to continue to invest in strategic marketing initiatives and advertising, especially at our NewSouth direct-to-consumer business which relies heavily on outreach to consumers. As such, savings from SG&A efficiencies could be more than offset by increases in spending on strategic programs which we believe will provide a favorable return on investment.
Depreciation and Amortization
Excluding the impact on depreciation and amortization from our ECO Acquisition, depreciation and amortization is estimated to be approximately $48 million in 2021.
Interest expense
During 2021, we issued the Second Additional Senior Notes with principal totaling $60.0 million, proceeds from which were used to finance the cash portion of the purchase price for the ECO Acquisition. When added onto the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026, including the First Additional Senior Notes issued in 2020, our level of debt outstanding increased to $479.0 million, of which $425.0 million is at a fixed interest rate of 6.75%. We believe interest expense on our long-term debt will be approximately $31 million in 2021, including an estimated $1 million of non-cash amortization of net deferred financing costs.
Income tax expense
We expect to continue to be profitable in 2021, and thus, we believe that we will incur income tax expense at a combined Federal and state effective rate of between approximately 24% to 25%. This rate is based on the lower overall corporate income tax rate of 21% as the result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, plus a blended statutory state rate, taking into consideration a reduction in the corporate tax rate in Florida from 5.5% to 4.458% through 2021.
Liquidity and capital resources
We had $100.3 million, of cash on hand as of January 2, 2021. On February 1, 2021, we completed the ECO Acquisition. See “Subsequent Event” below for more information.
During 2021, we expect to continue to generate sufficient cash from operations to service the interest requirements on our debt, cover our operating expenses, and spend between $28 million and $34 million for capital expenditures, excluding any capital expenditures required by our investment in ECO, if any. As a result of the Third Amendment, we have no further mandatory required payments remaining until the maturity in October 2022 of our 2016 Credit Agreement due 2022 but may continue to make voluntary prepayments in the future as our cash generation and other relevant factors permit. However, no assurances can be given that cash from operations will be sufficient for some or all these purposes. We currently have $76.0 million of availability under the Revolving Facility portion of the 2016 Credit Agreement. The Revolving Facility expires in October 2024.
SUBSEQUENT EVENT
ECO Acquisition
On February 1, 2021, we completed our previously announced acquisition of a 75% ownership stake in ECO Window Systems and its related companies, ECO Glass Production, LLC, and Unity Windows, LLC (together “ECO”), Florida limited liability companies, for fair value consideration of $108.0 million, including $100.0 million in cash, and $8.0 million in PGT Innovations, Inc. common stock. The cash portion of the purchase price was financed by a second add-on issuance of $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% senior notes to the 2018 Senior Notes due 2026 on January 25, 2021, issued at 105.5% of their principal amount, resulting in a premium to us of $3.3 million, together with cash in hand. The common stock portion of the purchase price was represented by the issuance of 357,797 shares of PGT Innovations, Inc. common stock to the ECO seller on February 1, 2021, with a then value of $22.36 per share. Those shares are legally restricted from being sold by the recipient for a three-year period from February 1, 2021. ECO is a manufacturer and installer of aluminum, impact-resistant windows and doors, serving the South Florida region since 2009. ECO is headquartered in Medley, Florida, near Miami, Florida, and has three manufacturing locations in the region.
