General
We are a leading global designer, producer and marketer of a wide range of electromechanical power transmission motion control (“PTMC”) products. Our technologies are used in various motion related applications and across a wide variety of high-volume manufacturing and non-manufacturing processes in which reliability and precision are critical to avoid costly down time and enhance the overall efficiency of operations.
We market our products under well recognized and established brands, which have been in existence for an average of over 85 years. We serve a diversified group of customers comprised of over 1,000 direct original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) including GE, Honeywell and Siemens, and also benefit from established, long-term relationships with leading industrial distributors, including Applied Industrial Technologies, Grainger, Kaman Industrial Technologies and Motion Industries. Many of our customers operate globally across a large number of industries, ranging from transportation, turf and agriculture, energy and mining to factory automation, medical and robotics. Our relationships with these customers often span multiple decades, which we believe reflects the
high level of performance, quality and service we deliver, supplemented by the breadth of our offering, vast geographic footprint and our ability to rapidly develop custom solutions for complex customer requirements.
On October 1, 2018, Altra consummated the Fortive Transaction and acquired the A&S Business for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $2,855.7 million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments, which consisted of $1,400.0 million of cash and debt instruments transferred to Fortive and shares of Altra common stock received by Fortive shareholders valued at approximately $1,455.7 million. As of December 31, 2020, the initial accounting for the Fortive Transaction (including the allocation of the purchase price to acquired assets and liabilities) is complete.
Business Outlook
Our future financial performance depends, in large part, on conditions in the markets that we serve and on conditions in the U.S., European, and global economies in general. In the year ended December 30, 2020, the broad diversity of our end markets and our ability to act nimbly to control costs through the COVID-19 pandemic allowed us to generate strong cash flow, deliver excellent working capital performance, and continue to make significant progress de-levering our balance sheet.
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect the global economy and business environment. Throughout 2020, our Pandemic Response Team continued to identify and assess risks and develop countermeasures following guidance from national, state and local governmental and health authorities. In addition, our Business Continuity Task Force continued to work to ensure continuity of supply for our customers. During the pandemic to date, Altra has experienced minimal supply chain disruption and all material manufacturing facilities have continued to be operational.
Looking ahead to 2021, we will continue to adopt a cautious approach due to ongoing uncertainty related to the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the timing of any potential broad economic recovery. Our strategic priorities continue to be managing costs, driving margin enhancement, de-levering our balance sheet and positioning Altra to grow and thrive as a premier industrial company for the long term. In the event market conditions improve sooner than anticipated, we will revisit our outlook and priorities appropriately as we gain better visibility.
Critical Accounting Policies
The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on-going basis. Our estimates are based upon historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may vary from what our management anticipates and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results.
We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical in that they are important to the financial statements and they require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements.
Inventory. Inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. The cost of inventory includes direct materials, direct labor, and production overhead. We state inventories acquired through acquisitions at their fair value at the date of acquisition based on the replacement cost of raw materials, the sales price of the finished goods less an appropriate amount representing the expected profitability from selling efforts, and, for work-in-process, the sales price of the finished goods less an appropriate amount representing the expected profitability from selling efforts and costs to complete.
We periodically review our quantities of inventories on hand and compare these amounts to the historical and expected usage of each particular product or product line. We record as a charge to cost of sales any amounts required to reduce the carrying value of inventories to net realizable value.
Business Combinations. Business combinations are accounted for at fair value. Acquisition costs are generally expensed as incurred and recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. The accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair value for assets and liabilities acquired. The fair value assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, or require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite-lived intangible assets
Goodwill, Intangibles and other long-lived assets. In connection with our acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets were identified and recorded at fair value. We recorded intangible assets for customer relationships, trade names and trademarks, product
technology, patents, in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) and goodwill. In valuing the customer relationships, trade names and trademarks and product technology, we utilized variations of the income approach. The income approach was considered the most appropriate valuation technique because the inherent value of these assets is their ability to generate current and future income. The income approach relies on historical financial and qualitative information, as well as assumptions and estimates for projected financial information. Projected financial information is subject to risk if our estimates are incorrect. The most significant estimate relates to our projected revenues and profitability. If we do not meet the projected revenues and profitability used in the valuation calculations then the intangible assets could be impaired. In determining the value of customer relationships, we reviewed historical customer attrition rates which were determined to be approximately 1%- 12% per year. Most of our customers tend to be long-term customers with very little turnover. While we do not typically have long-term contracts with customers, we have established long-term relationships with customers which make it difficult for competitors to displace us. Additionally, we assessed historical revenue growth within our industry and customers’ industries in determining the value of customer relationships. The value of our customer relationships intangible asset could become impaired if future results differ significantly from any of the underlying assumptions. This could include a higher customer attrition rate or a change in industry trends such as the use of long-term contracts which we may not be able to obtain successfully. Customer relationships and product technology and patents are considered finite-lived assets, with estimated lives ranging from 3 to 29 years. The estimated lives were determined by calculating the number of years necessary to obtain 95% of the value of the discounted cash flows of the respective intangible asset.
Goodwill, trade names and trademarks and IPR&D are considered indefinite lived assets. Our trade names and trademarks identify us and differentiate us from competitors, and therefore competition does not limit the useful life of these assets. Additionally, we believe that our trade names and trademarks will continue to generate product sales for an indefinite period.
Accounting standards require that an annual goodwill impairment assessment be conducted at the reporting unit level using either a quantitative or qualitative approach. The Company has determined that its Power Transmission Technologies (“PTT”) reporting segment is comprised of three reporting units. The Company has also determined that its A&S Business reporting segment is comprised of four reporting units.
In connection with the Company’s annual impairment review, goodwill is assessed for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value. The Company’s measurement date is October 31st. The Company determines the fair value of its reporting units using the discounted cash flow model and, where appropriate, the Company also uses the market approach. The determination of the fair value using the discounted cash flow model requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenues, profit margins, and discount rates. The determination of the fair value using the market approach requires management to make significant assumptions related to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) multiples. The Company estimates future cash flows based upon historical results and current market projections, discounted at a market comparable rate. An impairment loss would be recognized to the extent that a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeded its deemed fair value. Refer to Note 7 for additional discussion of the Company’s annual impairment review.
Management believes the preparation of revenue and profitability growth rates for use in the long-range plan and the discount rate requires significant use of judgment. If any of our reporting units do not meet our forecasted revenue and/or profitability estimates, we could be required to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis in future periods. In addition, if our discount rate increases, we could be required to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis.
For our indefinite lived intangible assets, mainly trademarks, we estimate the fair value by first estimating the total revenue attributable to the trademarks. Second, we estimate an appropriate royalty rate using the return on assets method by estimating the required financial return on our assets, excluding trademarks, less the overall return generated by our total asset base. The return as a percentage of revenue provides an indication of our royalty rate. We compared the estimated fair value of the trademarks with the carrying value of the trademarks and did not identify any impairment as of the annual impairment date or for any of the periods presented.
Long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recovered. Long-lived assets are considered to be impaired if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset over its remaining useful life. If an asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value, and is charged to results of operations at that time.

Results of Operations.
Amounts in millions, except percentage data
Segment Performance.
Amounts in millions, except percentage data
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2019
Net Sales. The decrease in net sales during the year ended December 31, 2020 is primarily due to the overall economic decline due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and a decline in sales in our oil and gas end market as a result of the reduction in oil prices globally. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on net sales of approximately $1.0 million,
primarily driven by the Euro. Strength in China, primarily in the heavy-duty truck and wind end markets, and the impact of price collectively had a favorable impact of approximately $15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Gross profit. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased during the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to extensive cost reduction actions taken to offset the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including cost reductions associated with temporary shutdowns of our manufacturing facilities and shutdowns of operations of our customers and suppliers. Additionally, price increases of $15.0 million and changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $0.1 million, primarily driven by the Euro, contributed to the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales.
Selling, general and administrative expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2020, SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to cost reduction actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which began during the quarter ended March 31, 2020 and continued throughout the year. Our cost reduction efforts were focused on compensation reductions, and the elimination of non-critical expenses, including travel, which decreased our overall SG&A costs. Although we do expect our SG&A costs to increase as business activity normalizes and certain temporary cost reductions terminate, due to ongoing uncertainty as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic we are not able to anticipate when these costs will increase in future periods.
Research and development expenses. Research and development expenses decreased due to cost reduction actions which began during the quarter ended March 31, 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and continued throughout the year. We expect research and development costs to approximate 2.5% - 3.5% of sales in future periods.
Restructuring costs. During the quarter ended September 30, 2017, we commenced a restructuring plan (“2017 Altra Plan”) as a result of Altra’s purchase of Stromag (the “Stromag Acquisition”) and to rationalize our global renewable energy business. The actions taken pursuant to the 2017 Altra Plan included reducing headcount, facility consolidations and the elimination of certain costs. We incurred approximately $0.5 million in expense through 2020 related to the 2017 Altra Plan. The total 2017 Altra Plan savings are in line with our expectations. We do not expect to incur any additional material costs as a result of the 2017 Altra Plan.
During 2019, we commenced a restructuring plan (“2019 Plan”) to drive efficiencies, reduce the number of facilities and optimize our operating margin. We expect to incur expenses related to workforce reductions, lease termination costs and other facility rationalization costs. We expect to incur an additional $5 - $7 million in restructuring expenses under the 2019 Altra Plan over the next 3 years, primarily related to plant consolidation and headcount reductions. The cost savings for the year ended December 31, 2020 were recognized as improvements in SG&A and cost of sales of approximately $2.2 million and $0.8 million, respectively.
Interest expense. Interest expense decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to debt paydowns of approximately $160 million on our Term Loan Facility during the year ended December 31, 2020, which resulted in lower average outstanding borrowings and lower average interest rates. This includes non-cash interest expense of $9.0 million as a result of the termination of the interest rate swap. We expect our interest expense in 2021 to continue to decrease as a result of additional principal payments on our debt and expected continuation of lower current interest rates compared to 2020.
Provision for income taxes. The provision for income tax as a percentage of income before income taxes during the year ended December 31, 2020 was higher than that of 2019 due to the goodwill impairment charge recorded at the JVS reporting unit during the quarter ended March 31, 2020. The tax rate was also impacted by the 2020 benefit from the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) tax as a result of the 2017 Tax Act in the United States. The Company expects its consolidated tax rate to be approximately 20% to 23% in future periods.
Segment Performance
Power Transmission Technologies
Net sales in the Power Transmission Technologies segment were $818.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of approximately $89.1 million or 9.8%, from the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the overall economic decline as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our metals, mining, and oil and gas end markets. The decline in net sales was partially offset by strength in our renewable energy end market in China. In addition, changes in foreign currency exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2020 had a favorable impact on net sales of $2.1 million, primarily driven by the Euro. Price had a favorable impact on net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $9.4 million. Segment operating income decreased by approximately $16.0 million compared to the prior year, which was primarily driven by the decline in sales.
Automation & Specialty
Net sales in the Automation & Specialty business segment were $911.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $19.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the economic decline as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by growth in the class eight heavy duty truck, factory automation, aerospace and defense, and COVID-19 related medical end markets. In addition, changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by the Indian Rupee and Brazilian Real. Price had a favorable impact on net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020, of $5.6 million. The Automation & Specialty segment had a loss from operations for the year ended December 31, 2020, due to the non-cash impairment charge recorded at the JVS reporting unit during the quarter ended March 31, 2020. As a result of both the COVID-19 related economic downturn and its impact on the anticipated financial results of the JVS reporting unit, the Company concluded that it was more likely than not that the carrying value of the JVS reporting unit exceeded its fair value and performed an interim impairment review for both goodwill and tradename intangible assets of the JVS reporting unit during the quarter ended March 30, 2020. As a result, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $8.4 million and $139.1 million for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, respectively, in the quarter ended March 31, 2020.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
We finance our capital and working capital requirements through a combination of cash flows from operating activities and borrowings under the Altra Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2020, we have the ability under the Altra Revolving Credit Facility to borrow an additional $295.5 million subject to satisfying customary conditions. We expect that our primary ongoing requirements for cash will be for working capital, debt service, capital expenditures, acquisitions, pensions, dividends and share repurchases.
On October 1, 2018, we consummated the Fortive Transaction. The aggregate purchase price for the A&S Business was approximately $2,855.7 million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments, and consisted of (i) $1,400.0 million of cash transferred to Fortive and (ii) shares of Altra common stock received by Fortive shareholders valued at approximately $1,455.7 million. The value
of the common stock was based on the closing stock price on the A&S Closing Date of $41.59. We financed the cash portion of the Fortive Transaction with the Altra Credit Facilities (as defined herein).
We believe, based on current and projected levels of cash flows from operating activities, together with our ability to borrow under the Altra Revolving Credit Facility (as defined herein), we have sufficient liquidity to meet our short-term and long-term needs to make required payments of interest on our debt, make amortization payments under the Altra Credit Facilities (as defined herein), fund our operating needs, fund working capital and capital expenditure requirements and comply with the financial ratios in our debt agreements. In the event additional funds are needed for operations, we could attempt to obtain new debt and/or refinance existing debt, or attempt to raise capital in the equity markets. There can be no assurance however that additional debt or equity financing will be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.
Notes
On September 26, 2018, Stevens Holding Company, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Stevens Holding”), announced the pricing of $400 million aggregate principal amount of Stevens Holding’s 6.125% senior notes due 2026 (the “Notes”) in a private debt offering pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Private Placement”). On October 1, 2018, the Private Placement closed, and Stevens Holding sold $150 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes (the “Primary Notes”) and an unaffiliated selling securityholder sold $250 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes (the “Selling Securityholder Notes”). The Notes will mature on October 1, 2026. Interest on the Notes accrues from October 1, 2018, and the first interest payment date on the Notes was April 1, 2019. The Notes may be redeemed at the option of Stevens Holding on or after October 1, 2023, in the manner and at the redemption prices specified in the indenture governing the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. The Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Altra and certain of its domestic subsidiaries.
The unaffiliated selling securityholder received the Selling Securityholder Notes from Fortive prior to the closing of the Private Placement in exchange for certain outstanding Fortive debt held or acquired by the unaffiliated selling securityholder. Stevens Holding used the net proceeds of the Primary Notes to fund a dividend payment to Fortive prior to the consummation of the Merger, and Stevens Holding did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the Selling Securityholder Notes.
Altra Credit Agreement
On the A&S Closing Date, Altra entered into a new Credit Agreement (the “Altra Credit Agreement”) with certain subsidiaries of Altra, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent, and a syndicate of lenders. The Altra Credit Agreement provides for a seven-year senior secured term loan to Altra in an aggregate principal amount of $1,340.0 million (the “Altra Term Loan Facility”) and a five-year senior secured revolving credit facility provided to Altra and certain of its subsidiaries in an aggregate committed principal amount of $300.0 million (the “Altra Revolving Credit Facility” and together with the Altra Term Loan Facility, the “Altra Credit Facilities”). The proceeds of the Altra Term Loan Facility were used to (i) consummate the Direct Sales, (ii) repay in full and extinguish all outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money under the 2015 Credit Agreement and (iii) pay certain fees, costs, and expenses in connection with the consummation of the Fortive Transaction. Any proceeds of the Altra Term Loan Facility not so used may be used for general corporate purposes. The proceeds of the Altra Revolving Credit Facility will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.
The Altra Credit Facilities are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by Altra and by each direct or indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiary of Altra, subject to certain customary exceptions.
Borrowings under the Altra Term Loan Facility will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to a “Eurocurrency Rate” plus 2.00%, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate borrowings, or equal to a “Base Rate” plus 1.00%, in the case of Base Rate borrowings. Borrowings under the Altra Revolving Credit Facility will initially bear interest at a per annum rate equal to a Eurocurrency Rate plus 2.00%, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate borrowings, or equal to a Base Rate plus 1.00%, in the case of Base Rate borrowings, and thereafter will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to a Eurocurrency Rate or Base Rate, as applicable, plus an interest rate spread determined by reference to a pricing grid based on Altra’s senior secured net leverage ratio. In addition, Altra will be required to pay fees that will fluctuate between 0.250% per annum to 0.375% per annum on the unused amount of the Altra Revolving Credit Facility, based upon Altra’s senior secured net leverage ratio. The interest rate on the Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility was 2.146% at December 31, 2020.
Revolving borrowings and issuances of letters of credit under the Altra Revolving Credit Facility are subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including the accuracy of representations and warranties and the absence of defaults.
The Altra Credit Agreement contains usual and customary representations and warranties, and usual and customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on liens, investments, restricted payments, additional indebtedness and asset sales and mergers. In addition, the Altra Credit Agreement requires that Altra maintain a specified maximum senior secured leverage ratio and a specified minimum interest coverage ratio. The obligations of the borrowers of the Altra Credit Facilities under the Altra Credit Agreement may be accelerated upon customary events of default, including non-payment of principal, interest, fees and other amounts, inaccuracy of representation and warranties, violation of covenants, cross default and cross acceleration, voluntary and involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, inability to pay debts as they become due, material judgments, ERISA events, actual or asserted invalidity of security documents or guarantees and change in control.
2015 Credit Agreement
On October 22, 2015, the Company entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by and among the Company, Altra Industrial Motion Netherlands, B.V., one of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries (collectively with the Company, the “Borrowers”), the lenders party to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement from time to time (collectively, the “Lenders”), J.P, Morgan Securities LLC, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, and KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc., as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the “Administrative Agent”), to be guaranteed and secured by certain domestic subsidiaries of the Company, and which may be amended from time to time (the “2015 Credit Agreement”).
Under the 2015 Credit Agreement, the amount of the Company’s revolving credit facility was $350 million (the “2015 Revolving Credit Facility”). Prior to October 2018, the amounts available under the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility were used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, and to repay existing indebtedness.
Prior to October 2018, the amounts available under the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility could be drawn upon in accordance with the terms of the 2015 Credit Agreement. All amounts outstanding under the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility were due on the stated maturity or such earlier time, if any, required under the 2015 Credit Agreement. The amounts owed under the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility could be prepaid at any time, subject to usual notification and breakage payment provisions. Interest on the amounts outstanding under the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility was calculated using either an ABR Rate or Eurodollar Rate, plus the applicable margin. A portion of the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility could also be used for the issuance of letters of credit, and a portion of the amount of the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility was available for borrowings in certain agreed upon foreign currencies.
The 2015 Credit Agreement contained various affirmative and negative covenants and restrictions, which among other things, required the Borrowers to provide certain financial reports to the Lenders, required the Company to maintain certain financial covenants relating to consolidated leverage and interest coverage, limited maximum annual capital expenditures, and limited the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make other equity distributions, purchase or redeem capital stock or debt, make certain investments, sell assets, engage in certain transactions, and effect a consolidation or merger. The 2015 Credit Agreement also contained customary events of default.
On October 21, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to amend the 2015 Credit Agreement (the “October 2016 Amendment”). The October 2016 Amendment, which became effective upon the December 30, 2016 closing of the Stromag Acquisition increased the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility by $75 million to $425 million. The Company borrowed additional funds under the increased 2015 Revolving Credit Facility to finance the Stromag Acquisition. The October 2016 Amendment also reset the possible expansion of up to $150 million of additional future loan commitments. In addition, the October 2016 Amendment increased the multicurrency sublimit to $250 million and adjusted certain financial covenants.
On October 1, 2018, in connection with the Fortive Transaction and the entering into the Altra Credit Agreement, the 2015 Credit Agreement was terminated and all outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money thereunder was repaid in full.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
The following is a summary of our cash balances and cash flows (in millions) as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Cash Flows for 2020
Funds provided by operating activities totaled approximately $262.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $6.6 million as compared to December 31, 2019. This is primarily due to a net loss of $25.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to net income of $127.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, in 2020, the Company recorded a $34.7 million payment for the termination of an interest rates swap. These decreases were offset by a $147.5 million non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge, a $32.1 million improvement in working capital accounts and a $9.0 million non-cash amortization of interest rate swap expense.
Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by approximately $96.5 million primarily due to the receipt of settlement proceeds of approximately $56.2 million related to the termination of cross-currency interest rate swaps during the first quarter of 2020. We also had lower purchases of machinery and equipment and a lower purchase price adjustment related to the 2018 Fortive transaction when compared to the prior year. This cash provided by investing activities was partially offset by our $5.0 million investment in MTEK Industry AB (“MTEK”), a small manufacturing software company.
Net cash used in financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $15.3 million primarily due to debt paydowns of approximately $160.0 million on our Term Loan Facility compared to $130 million in 2019. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in dividend payments of $16.6 million compared to the prior year.
We intend to use our remaining cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from operations to provide for our working capital needs, to fund potential future acquisitions, to service our debt, including principal payments, for capital expenditures, for pension funding, and to pay dividends to our stockholders. As of December 31, 2020, we have approximately $157.6 million of cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries. We believe our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating and investing cash needs. Furthermore, the existing cash balances and the availability of additional borrowings under our Altra Credit Facilities provide additional potential sources of liquidity should they be required.
Capital Expenditures
We made capital expenditures of approximately $33.7 million and $51.7 million in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in capital expenditures during 2020 was due to efforts to preserve liquidity as a result of uncertainty related to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. These capital expenditures will support on-going business needs. In 2021, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $45.0 million to $50.0 million.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that provide liquidity, capital resources, market or credit risk support that expose us to any liability that is not reflected in our consolidated financial statements.
Contractual Obligations
The following table is a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2020 (in millions):
(1)

(4)

The mortgage has an interest rate of 1.85% per year which is payable in monthly installments from June 2016 until May 2025. The mortgage has a balance of €1.2 million, or $1.3 million, at December 31, 2020.
(5)
We have up to $300.0 million of total borrowing capacity, through October 1, 2025, under the Altra Revolving Credit Facility of which $295.5 million is currently available. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were $4.5 million and $4.4 million of outstanding letters of credit under the Altra Revolving Credit Facility and the 2015 Revolving Credit Facility. We have variable monthly and/or quarterly cash interest requirements due on the Altra Revolving Credit Facility through October 2025, which are not included in the above table. Refer to Footnote 11 for interest terms on the Term Loan.
(6)
We assumed $400 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% Senior Notes due 2026, upon the closing of the Fortive Transaction. The Notes will mature on October 1, 2026. The Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries.
(7)
Two foreign subsidiaries of the Company have lines of credit used for operating purposes. As of December 31, 2020 the Company had 13.5 million Turkish Lira, or $1.8 million, and 3.2 million Chinese RMB, or $0.5 million, outstanding on each line of credit respectively.
From time to time, we may have cash funding requirements associated with our pension plans. As of December 31, 2020, there were no funding requirements for 2021 to 2025. These amounts are based on actuarial assumptions and actual amounts could be materially different.
We may be required to make cash outlays related to our unrecognized tax benefits. However, due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities.
Stock-based Compensation
The 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2014 Plan”) was approved by the Company's stockholders at its 2014 annual meeting. The 2014 Plan provides for various forms of stock-based compensation to our directors, executive personnel and other key employees and consultants. Under the 2014 Plan, the total number of shares of common stock available for delivery pursuant to the grant of awards (“Awards”) was originally 750,000. Shares of our common stock subject to Awards or grants awarded under our prior 2004 Equity Incentive Plan and outstanding as of the effective date of the 2014 Plan (except for substitute awards) that terminate without being exercised, expire, are forfeited or canceled, are exchanged for Awards that did not involve shares of common stock, are not issued on the stock settlement of a stock appreciation right, are withheld by the Company or tendered by a participant (either actually or by attestation) to pay an option exercise price or to pay the withholding tax on any Award, or are settled in cash in lieu of shares will again be available for Awards under the 2014 Plan. An amendment to the 2014 Plan to, among other things, make an additional 2,200,000 shares of common stock available for grant under the 2014 Plan was approved by the Company’s stockholders at the special meeting of stockholders on September 4, 2018. An additional amendment to the 2014 Plan to, among other things, make an additional 3,000,000 shares of common stock available for grant under the 2014 Plan was approved by the Company’s stockholders at its 2020 annual meeting of stockholders on April 28, 2020.
As of December 31, 2020, there were 783.8 thousand shares of unvested restricted stock outstanding under the 2014 Plan. The remaining compensation cost to be recognized through 2022 is $19.3 million. Based on the stock price at December 31, 2020, of $55.4 per share, the intrinsic value of these awards as of December 31, 2020, was $43.5 million.
Income Taxes
We are subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions throughout the world. Our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected by a number of factors, such as the amount of taxable income in particular jurisdictions, the tax rates in such jurisdictions, tax treaties between jurisdictions, the extent to which we transfer funds between jurisdictions and repatriate income, and changes in law. Generally, the tax liability for each legal entity is determined either (a) on a non-consolidated and non-combined basis or (b) on a consolidated and combined basis only with other eligible entities subject to tax in the same jurisdiction, in either case without regard to the taxable losses of non-consolidated and non-combined affiliated entities. As a result, we may pay income taxes to some jurisdictions even though on an overall basis we incur a net loss for the period.
Seasonality
General economic conditions impact our business and financial results, and certain of our businesses experience seasonal and other trends related to the industries and end markets that they serve. For example, sales to OEMs are often stronger immediately preceding and following the launch of new products. In addition, we experience seasonality in our turf and garden business. As our large OEM customers prepare for the spring season, our shipments generally start increasing in December, peak in February and March, and begin to decline in April and May. This allows our customers to have inventory in place for the peak consumer purchasing periods for turf and garden products. The June-through-November period is typically the low season for us and our customers in the turf and garden market. Seasonality is also affected by weather and the level of housing starts. However, as a whole, we are not subject to material seasonality.
Inflation
Inflation can affect the costs of goods and services we use. The majority of the countries that are of significance to us, from either a manufacturing or sales viewpoint, have in recent years enjoyed relatively low inflation although there can be no assurance that inflation will not increase in future periods. The competitive environment in which we operate inevitably creates pressure on us to provide our customers with cost-effective products and services.
