MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Certain statements contained in this section and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K which are not historical facts are forward looking statements and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ significantly from the projected results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might affect actual results include, but are not limited to, those discussed in ITEM 1A “RISK FACTORS” and other factors identified from time to time in our reports filed with the SEC. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report.
Overview
ThermoGenesis Holdings, Inc. (“ThermoGenesis Holdings”, the “Company”, “our”, or “we”) develops and commercializes a range of automated technologies for cell-banking, cell-processing, and cell-based therapeutics. Since the 1990’s ThermoGenesis Holdings has been a pioneer in, and a leading provider of automated systems that isolate, purify and cryogenically store units of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells for the cord blood banking industry. The Company was founded in 1986 and is incorporated in the State of Delaware and headquartered in Rancho Cordova, CA.
The Company previously had two reportable segments, a Device Segment and a Clinical Development Segment. Due to the winding down of the Clinical Development Segment in 2019, the Company no longer has any material revenues or expenses in that segment. As a result, the Company’s chief operating decision maker no longer reviews unconsolidated operating results and the Company no longer reports in two segments. The Company provides the AutoXpress® and BioArchive® platforms for automated clinical bio-banking, PXP® platform for point-of-care cell-based therapies and CAR-TXpress™ platform under development for bio-manufacturing for immuno-oncology applications.

Results of Operations
Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019
Net Revenues
Consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $9,744,000 compared to $13,047,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $3,303,000 or 25%. The decrease was driven by AXP® disposable sales which declined by approximately $1,700,000 with approximately 1,000 fewer cases sold in 2020 as compared to 2019. The primary reason for the decrease was the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a significant impact on the cord blood industry, with fewer cord blood units being stored globally after the start of the pandemic. The pandemic also caused other problems with some domestic customers opting to utilize existing safety stock at the start of the pandemic in lieu of placing new orders, to minimize on-site workers. Internationally, customs delays led some customers to temporarily switch to manual processing due to the long wait to clear products through customs departments with reduced staffing. AXP® device sales decreased by approximately $900,000 in 2020 as compared to 2019 due to one-time revenues in 2019 from customers converting to our new generation AXP® II devices. The Company also had a decrease of approximately $900,000 in BioArchive® sales, primarily due to two less devices being sold and lower service revenue in 2020 as compared to 2019. Partially offsetting these decreases, was an increase of approximately $300,000 in CAR-TXpress revenue driven by $190,000 more recognized in 2020 from the exclusivity fee paid by the Company’s X-Series distributor in 2019 and other revenue which increased by $278,000 primarily due to antibody testing kits sold in 2020.
Revenues were comprised of the following:
Gross Profit
The Company’s gross profit was $1,259,000 or 13% of net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $5,696,000 or 44% for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $4,437,000 or 78%. The decrease was primarily due to an inventory disposition expense of approximately $2,800,000 for the remaining inventory of COVID-19 testing kits purchased from ImmuneCyte and a $470,000 increase in inventory reserves driven by X-Series® disposables. The remainder of the decrease is driven by reduced gross profit of approximately $1,200,000 from lower AXP® device and disposable sales.
Sales and Marketing Expenses
Consolidated sales and marketing expenses were $1,948,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $1,656,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $292,000 or 18%. The increase was driven by approximately $210,000 more in salaries and benefits and approximately $100,000 in additional consulting expenses for the new marketing firm the Company engaged in 2020.
Research and Development Expenses
Consolidated research and development expenses were $2,477,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $2,396,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $81,000 or 3%. The increase was driven approximately $100,000 more spending for project expenses in 2020, offset by a decrease in salaries and benefits of approximately $35,000.
General and Administrative Expenses
Consolidated general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $5,729,000, compared to $6,377,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $648,000 or 10%. The decrease was driven by a settlement expense of $1,400,000 related to the Mavericks lawsuit in 2019, partially offset by approximately $350,000 in accrued expenses related to the Company’s employee short-term incentive program, approximately $250,000 more in stock compensation expense related to awards granted in 2020 to Executives and Directors and approximately $100,000 more in corporate insurance expense.
Interest Expense
Interest expense increased to $7,908,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $4,479,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a difference of $3,429,000. The increase was driven by the accelerated expense of the unamortized debt discount of $2,486,000 for the beneficial conversion feature associated with the portions of the Revolving Credit Agreement with Boyalife Asset Holding II, Inc. which were converted during the first quarter of 2020. The remainder of the increase was driven by additional interest expense and amortization of the debt discount of approximately $800,000 related to the Revolving Credit Agreement with Boyalife Asset Holding II, Inc.
Loss on Extinguishment of Debt
The Company recorded a loss of extinguishment of debt of $0 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $840,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The recorded loss of extinguishment of debt in 2019 was due to the extinguishment of an unsecured note payable to an accredited investor.
Non-GAAP Measures
In addition to the results reported in accordance with US GAAP, we also use a non-GAAP measure, adjusted EBITDA, to evaluate operating performance and to facilitate the comparison of our historical results and trends. The Company calculates adjusted EBITDA as income (or loss) from operations less depreciation, amortization, stock compensation and impairment of intangible assets. This financial measure is not a measure of financial performance under US GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for loss as a measure of performance. The calculation of this non-GAAP measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are provided below.
The adjusted EBITDA loss was $7,273,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to a loss of $3,314,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase in the adjusted EBITDA loss of $3,959,000 or 119%. The adjusted EBITDA decrease was primarily due to an inventory disposition expense of approximately $2,800,000 for the remaining inventory of COVID-19 testing kits purchased from ImmuneCyte and a $470,000 increase in inventory reserves driven by X-Series® disposables. The year ended December 31, 2020 also had reduced gross profit of approximately $1,200,000 due to lower sales and approximately $500,000 more in salaries and benefits. These increases were partially offset by a settlement expense of $1,400,000 related to the Mavericks lawsuit in 2019.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $7,161,000 and working capital of $9,155,000. We have primarily financed operations through private and public placement of equity securities and our line of credit facility.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we used $14,393,000 of cash for operations primarily the result of the net loss incurred during 2020, offset by non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization. Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $23,000 as the result of capital purchases. Cash generated in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $17,422,000, primarily due to $10,838,000 received from the sale of shares under the At-the-Market Agreement and approximately $3,500,000 under a registered direct offering in March 2020.
The Company has a Revolving Credit Agreement with Boyalife Asset Holding II, Inc. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had drawn down the full $10,000,000 that is available under the Revolving Credit Agreement, which matures in March of 2022. Boyalife Asset Holding II, Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Boyalife Group Inc. (USA), which is owned and controlled by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors.
The Company has incurred recurring operating losses as of December 31, 2020. If these recurring losses continue, it could raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the filing of this report. The Company anticipates requiring additional capital to grow the business, to fund other operating expenses and to make principal and interest payments on the line of credit with Boyalife. The Company’s ability to fund its cash needs is subject to various risks, many of which are beyond its control. The Company may seek additional funding through bank borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities or strategic partnerships. The Company cannot guarantee that such funding will be available on a timely basis, in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us, if at all.
We manage the concentration of credit risk with our customers and distributors through a variety of methods including, pre-shipment deposits, credit reference checks and credit limits. Although management believes that our customers and distributors are sound and creditworthy, a severe adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding material effect on their ability to pay timely and therefore on our net revenues, cash flows and financial condition.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to stock-based compensation, depreciation, fair values of intangibles and goodwill, bad debts, inventories, warranties, and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. See Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
