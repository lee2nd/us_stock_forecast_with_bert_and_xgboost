Executive Level Overview
We are an advanced energy technology company with a passion for elevating people’s lives through innovative products in the cosmetic and surgical markets. Known for our innovative Helium Plasma Technology, Apyx is solely focused on bringing transformative solutions to the physicians and patients it serves. Our Helium Plasma Technology is marketed and sold as Renuvion® in the cosmetic surgery market and J-Plasma® in the hospital surgical market. Renuvion® offers plastic surgeons, fascial plastic surgeons and cosmetic physicians a unique ability to provide controlled heat toe tissue to achieve their desired results. The J-Plasma® system allows surgeons to operate with a high level of precision, virtually eliminating unintended tissue trauma. We also leverage our deep expertise and decades of experience in unique waveforms through OEM agreements with other medical device manufacturers.
As discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 ("2019 Form 10-K"), an outbreak of a novel strain of the coronavirus, COVID-19, was identified in China and subsequently recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The COVID-19 outbreak continues to severely restrict the level of economic activity around the world. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak the governments of many countries, states, cities and other geographic regions have taken preventative or protective actions, such as imposing restrictions on travel and business operations and advising or requiring individuals to limit or forego their time outside of their homes. Temporary closures of businesses in some jurisdictions were ordered, and numerous other businesses closed permanently. Many other businesses continue to be operated at reduced capacity.
Ongoing significant reductions in business-related activities could result in further loss of sales and profits and other material adverse effects. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business, financial results, liquidity and cash flows will depend largely on future developments, including new information that may emerge concerning actions taken to contain or prevent further spread of the virus, or its newly forming variants, within the U.S. and the related impact on consumer confidence and spending, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.
While our revenues were affected by the continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, in the latter half of 2020 we saw strong utilization of our Renuvion® handpieces from existing customers in the U.S., along with shipments to several new customers in our international markets, which helped to offset sluggish global demand for capital equipment. Throughout the year, we continued our efforts to support our customers during this challenging time.
While we were also pleased to see overall improvements in our Advanced Energy business trends during the third and fourth quarters, demand for handpieces remains uneven across, and within, the primary markets that we serve, and global demand trends for generator adoption remain in the early stages of recovery. Although the timing of a return to a more normalized environment remains uncertain, we remain cautiously optimistic with respect to the continued recovery of the cosmetic and plastic surgery market.
We source the components used in our products from a variety of suppliers and we have collaborative arrangements with three key foreign suppliers. At this time our suppliers have experienced no significant disruptions as a result of COVID-19. We have experienced minor delays in our procurement from these suppliers as a result of the availability of shipping from third party freight carriers. These delays have not, to date, had a significant impact on our operations.
In response to COVID-19, we took action in these key areas:

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued
•Protecting the Health and Safety of our Employees: To reduce the risk to our employees and their families to potential exposure to COVID-19, we required that all non-essential employees work remotely until further notice. We also split the shifts of our manufacturing personnel to allow for adequate social distancing, and require all personnel to utilize personal protective equipment while on site at our facilities. We also significantly reduced business travel and outside access to our facilities.
•Maintaining Engagement of or Sales Team and Our Customers: In addition to the initiatives we put in place to protect health and safety for all employees, we focused our direct sales team on remaining in close contact with their existing surgeon customers to do everything they can to provide them with support during this difficult time. With this goal in mind, we implemented additional training for our sales reps in order to sharpen their ability to engage with our customers virtually. In addition to engaging with existing customers via virtual methods, our reps also continued to target and reach out to prospective customers, and outside the U.S., we continued to monitor the activities of our distributor partners and helped them navigate the challenges they faced as a result of the slower demand they have seen in their respective countries.
•Operating Expenses: We continued to take preemptive steps to curtail spending, including implementing hiring restrictions, reducing most discretionary spending, reducing capital expenditures, and delaying certain R&D projects and clinical research studies.
•Governmental Policy: On March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the CARES Act to provide relief from COVID-19. We have taken advantage of certain provisions of the CARES Act which are applicable to us, including utilizing net operating loss (NOL) carryback provisions. We expect that utilizing these provisions will significantly help mitigate the working capital impact COVID-19 has had on our sales and operations.
During the first two months of 2020, our plans to host new Physician Mentor Programs, or “PMPs,” and expand our presence and educational programming at industry conferences and trade shows proceeded as expected. Our events planned for March, through the present time, however, were canceled or postponed due to COVID-19. In lieu of this in-person programming, our sales, marketing and field clinical teams have been very active in engaging with our customers - and prospects - around the world. We have hosted educational events virtually where we featured some of our leading clinician customers speaking on a wide range of topics, including side-by-side results comparing Renuvion® to a leading competitor's technology.
Our virtual educational events have also included case studies to illustrate how our leading clinician customers have adopted Renuvion®, their strategies for marketing and selling to new patients, and their thoughts on pricing and return on investment. We hosted the first installment of a planned series of webinars designed to assist our customers and prospects with opening their practices post-COVID 19. We also engaged with clinician customers outside the U.S. including hosting multiple continuing education training sessions on J-Plasma® and Renuvion® with our current international distributors and conducting multiple calls with groups of international prospects interested in learning about our Renuvion® technology.
During 2020, we continued to drive sales in our Advanced Energy business by increasing the adoption and utilization of our handpieces in the U.S. cosmetic surgery market and fulfilling demand from distributors in our international markets. Management estimates that our products have been sold in more than 55 countries. As of December 31, 2020, we had a direct sales force of 31 field-based selling professionals and utilized 2 independent sales agencies. We also had 5 sales managers. This selling organization is focused on the use of Renuvion® in the cosmetic surgery market. In addition, we have invested in training programs and marketing-related activities to support accelerated adoption of Renuvion® into physicians' practices.
We believe that our continued investment and focus on the following strategic initiatives in 2020 and beyond will position the Company for long-term growth in the cosmetic surgery market:
•To formalize our regulatory strategy to pursue specific clinical indications that will enable us to sell our Renuvion® products for targeted procedures
•To secure new clinical evidence demonstrating the safety and efficacy of our Helium Plasma Technology
•To provide enhanced physician and practice support for our cosmetic surgery customers
•To improve our manufacturing capabilities and efficiencies

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued
In regards to our operating segments, our results are aggregated into reportable segments only if they exhibit similar economic characteristics. In addition to similar economic characteristics, we also consider the following factors in determining the reportable segments: the nature of business activities, the management structure directly accountable to our chief operating decision maker for operating and administrative activities, availability of discrete financial information, and information presented to the Board of Directors and investors. Asset information is not reviewed by the chief operating decision maker by segment and is not available by segment and, accordingly, we have not presented a measure of assets by reportable segment.
Our reportable segments are disclosed as principally organized and managed as two operating segments: Advanced Energy and OEM. "Corporate & Other" includes certain unallocated corporate and administrative costs which are not specifically attributed to any reportable segment. The OEM segment is primarily development and manufacturing contract and product driven, and all related expenses are recorded as cost of sales, therefore no segment specific operating expenses are incurred.
We strongly encourage investors to visit our website: www.apyxmedical.com to view the most current news and to review our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Results of Operations
Sales
Total revenue decreased by 1.9% or approximately $(0.5) million for the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared with 2019. Advanced Energy segment sales decreased 2.0% or approximately $(0.5) million for the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared with 2019. The impact of COVID-19 resulted in decreased demand for our products, both domestically and internationally throughout 2020, although sales began to recover late in the second quarter, and through the end of the year, as many of our customers resumed operations in a limited capacity. We continue to see improved demand domestically for our products from pre-COVID-19 levels and have experienced improvements internationally, driven primarily by entry into new markets, the largest of which was Brazil.
The OEM product line consists of proprietary products designed specifically for third party equipment manufacturers. Revenue for this product line decreased (1.1)% or approximately $(0.1) million when compared to 2019.
International sales represented approximately 32.1% and 30.6% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Management estimates our products have been sold in more than 55 countries through local dealers coordinated by sales and marketing personnel through our facilities in Clearwater, Florida and Sofia, Bulgaria.

Gross Profit
Our gross profit margin as a percentage of sales decreased by 4.4% during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with 2019. During the second quarter, we reassessed our forecasted product mix due to COVID-19, increased availability of our newer handpiece designs, and improved timing of product registrations in some of our foreign markets. As a result, certain products were reduced to a lower carrying value, and some components were also written off as it was determined to cease further production on these models. This resulted in a decrease in gross profit of approximately $0.3 million which is reflective of small recoveries on the impairments later in the year through the manufacture and sale of handpieces utilizing the impaired components. The remaining decrease in gross profit margin is driven by product mix within our Advanced Energy segment, offset by improved product margins in our Advanced Energy segment as a result of our continued manufacturing efficiency initiatives and introduction of newer product models.

Other Costs and Expenses
Research and development
Our expenditures for R&D related activities increased by 5.1% or approximately $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with 2019. This increase was primarily due to continued spending on our two investigational device exemption (IDE) clinical studies, which had applications submitted to the FDA in late 2019.
Professional services
Professional services expenses decreased 13.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with 2019. The change was primarily attributable to decreases in legal expense ($0.7 million) associated with our now settled class action lawsuit, a decrease in Medical Advisory Board consulting fees ($0.5 million), and a decrease in option expense related to options granted to our Medical Advisory Board physicians ($0.3 million), as additional grants did not occur in 2020. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in accounting and auditing fees ($0.5 million) related to recent financial statement restatements, the change in our independent accountants and reaudit of the 2019 consolidated financial statements, and continued efforts to remediate our internal control deficiencies and material weaknesses.
Salaries and related costs
During 2020, salaries and related expenses increased approximately 4.3% or approximately $0.6 million compared to 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to additional employee stock option grants in 2020, which drove an increase in employee stock option expense of $1.2 million in 2020. This increase was partially offset by lower bonus expense during 2020 of approximately $0.6 million.
Selling, general and administrative expenses
Selling, general and administrative expense decreased by 14.7% or approximately $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with 2019. The decrease is primarily related to decreases in travel and entertainment expense ($1.2 million), advertising including show fees and related costs ($0.6 million), regulatory registration and related quality audit expenses ($0.4

million), and commissions on Advanced Energy sales ($0.2 million), all of which are associated with restricted travel, decreased sales activity, or delayed regulatory activity as a result of COVID-19. These decreases were partially offset by higher bad debt expense ($0.4 million).
Interest Income
Interest income decreased (82.7)% for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared with the prior year. This decrease is due to a lower yield, as well as a lower average balance, on our investments in U.S. Treasury securities included in cash and cash equivalents.
Other Income (Loss), net
Other income (loss), net increased 236.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared with the prior year. This increase is primarily due to the receipt of refunds on tariffs paid in the prior year during the first quarter of 2020, combined with the recognition of a joint and several liability for not collecting and remitting payroll taxes related to stock option exercises in the prior year.
Income Taxes
The income tax benefit was approximately $7.5 million, with an effective tax rate of 38.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to an income tax benefit of approximately $0.1 million, with an effective tax rate of 0.7%, in 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the release of the valuation allowance on our Federal NOL from 2019 as a result of the CARES Act, partially offset by a valuation allowance on our State NOL for 2020 and accrued interest and penalties on our uncertain tax positions. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the valuation allowance on our Federal and State NOL for 2019 and accrued interest and penalties on our uncertain tax positions.
On March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the CARES Act to provide relief from COVID-19. The CARES Act includes a provision that allows companies to carryback NOLs generated in the period 2018 through 2020 to prior years. As a result, we released the full valuation allowance of approximately $3.7 million on our Federal NOL carryforward from 2019 during the first quarter of 2020. In 2020, our income tax benefit is composed primarily of a benefit of $3.7 million associated with the current year net loss and $3.7 million associated with the release of the valuation allowance on the net operating loss from 2019 from the CARES Act. In 2019, our income tax benefit is composed primarily of return to provision adjustments related to the 2018 tax year (benefit of approximately $0.3 million), partially offset by the accrual of interest and penalties on our uncertain tax positions (expense of approximately $0.2 million).
We expect to receive refunds of approximately $7.5 million during 2021 related to the carryback of our 2020 and 2019 pre-tax losses.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
At December 31, 2020, we had approximately $41.9 million in cash and cash equivalents as compared to approximately $58.8 in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2019. Our working capital at December 31, 2020 was approximately $56.9 million compared with $64.4 million at December 31, 2019. The decrease in working capital at December 31, 2020 was primarily due to the net loss incurred by the Company in 2020, excluding non-cash activity, comprised primarily of stock-based compensation expense.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in operating activities was approximately $16.0 million compared with net cash used in operating activities of approximately $18.5 million in 2019.
Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, was $0.6 million, related to purchases of capital equipment. Net cash from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $60.5 million, primarily related to the maturity of short-term investments and reinvestment in cash equivalents, as well as approximately $1.3 million in purchases of capital equipment.
At December 31, 2020, we had purchase commitments for inventories totaling approximately $1.9 million, substantially all of which is expected to be purchased by the end of 2021.
Critical Accounting Estimates
In preparing the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), we have adopted various accounting policies. Our most significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our estimates and assumptions, including those related to inventories, legal proceedings, research and development, warranty obligations, product liability, sales returns and discounts, stock-based compensation and income taxes are updated as appropriate, which in most cases is at least quarterly. We base our estimates on historical experience, or various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and the results form the basis for making judgments about the reported values of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual results may materially differ from these estimates.
Estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and (2) other materially different estimates could have been reasonably made or material changes in the estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Our critical accounting estimates include the following:
Stock-Based Compensation
Under our stock option plans, options to purchase common shares of the Company may be granted to employees, officers and directors of the Company by the Board of Directors. We account for stock options in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718-10, Compensation-Stock Compensation, with compensation expense recognized over the vesting period. Options are valued using the Black-Scholes model, which includes a number of estimates that affect the amount of our expense. We have determined that the most critical of these estimates are the estimates of expected life and volatility used in the calculations.
Expected life
For employee stock-based compensation awards, we estimate the expected life of awards utilizing the SEC's simplified method. We utilize this method, as we have not historically granted stock-based compensation awards to employees in sufficient volumes to determine a reasonable estimate of the life of awards. For awards granted to non-employees, we calculate expected life using a combination of past exercise behavior, the contractual term and expected remaining exercise behavior.
Volatility
APYX MEDICAL CORPORATION
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued
We determine the volatility by utilizing the historical volatility of our stock over the period of the awards expected life. The SEC allows us to include periods in excess of the useful life if we determine that they provide a more reasonable basis for the volatility of our stock. Additionally, ASC 718-10 allows us to exclude periods from the volatility if they pertain to events or circumstances that in our judgment are specific to us and if the event or transaction is not reasonably expected to occur again during the expected term of the awards. We have not included any additional periods, nor disregarded any periods, in calculating our volatility.
Accounts Receivable Allowance
We maintain a reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable. When evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts, we analyze specific unremitted customer balances for known collectability issues, review historical bad debt experience, customer credit worthiness and economic trends, and we make estimates in connection with establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts, including the future impacts of current trends. Changes in estimates are reflected in the period they are made. If the financial condition of our customers deteriorates, resulting in an inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.
Inventory Obsolescence Allowance
We maintain a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell our products at prices in excess of current carrying costs. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, with new products and surgical procedures introduced on an ongoing basis. Such marketplace changes may cause our products to become obsolete. We make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience and expected future trends. If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which would unfavorably affect future operating results.
Litigation Contingencies
In accordance with authoritative guidance, we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements for these actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a loss is reasonably possible, but not known or probable, and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. In most cases, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded; actual results may differ from these estimates.
Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes includes federal, foreign, state and local income taxes currently payable and those deferred because of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted marginal tax rates. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Deferred income tax expenses or credits are based on the changes in the asset or liability from period to period.
As a result of historical losses exclusive of discontinued operations, and our expectation to continue to generate losses in the near future, we recorded a valuation allowance on the our deferred tax asset. Exclusive of the carryback provisions of the CARES ACT and the associated income tax benefit recognized in 2020, we do not anticipate recording an income tax benefit related to these deferred tax assets. We will reassess the realization of deferred tax assets each reporting period and will be able to reduce the valuation allowance to the extent the financial results of continuing operations improve, and it becomes more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realizable. As management expects the Company to continue to generate losses in the foreseeable future after 2020, we will continue to record a valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets balance as of December 31, 2020.
We assess the financial statement impact of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized in the financial statements unless it is more likely than not of being sustained.
