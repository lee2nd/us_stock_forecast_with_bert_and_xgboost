ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements about future revenues, operating results, plans and expectations. Forward-looking statements are based on a number of assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to significant risks and uncertainties and our results could differ materially from the results anticipated by our forward-looking statements as a result of many known or unknown factors, including, but not limited to, those factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. Also, please read the “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” set forth at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
In addition, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as our consolidated financial statements and the related Notes contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Overview
We are a medical technology company focused on developing and commercializing transformative technologies to improve clinical outcomes and reduce healthcare expenditures in the surgical and chronic wound and skin care markets. Our portfolio of products and services will allow us to deliver comprehensive wound and skin care solutions for patients in all care settings, including acute (hospitals and long-term acute care hospitals (“LTACHs”)) and post-acute (wound care clinics, physician offices, skilled nursing facilities (“SNFs”), home health, hospice, and retail). Each of our products, services, and technologies contributes to our overall goal of achieving better clinical outcomes at a lower overall cost for patients regardless of where they receive care. We strive to be one of the most innovative and comprehensive providers of effective wound and skin care products and technologies and are continually seeking to expand our offerings for patients requiring wound and skin care treatments across the entire continuum of care in the United States.
We currently market seven products across chronic and surgical wound care applications and have multiple products in our pipeline. We license our products from research and development partners Applied Nutritionals, LLC (“AN”) (through a sublicense with CGI Cellerate RX, LLC (“CGI Cellerate RX”), an affiliate of The Catalyst Group, Inc. (“Catalyst”)) and Rochal Industries, LLC (“Rochal”) and have the right to exclusively distribute certain products under development by Cook Biotech Inc. (“Cook Biotech”). In 2021, we intend to begin marketing three biologic products for surgical and wound care applications pursuant to our marketing and distribution agreement with Cook Biotech.
In June 2020, we formed a subsidiary, United Wound and Skin Solutions LLC (“UWSS”), to hold certain investments and operations in wound and skin care virtual consult services. We anticipate that our various service offerings will allow clinicians/physicians utilizing our technologies to collect and analyze large amounts of data on patient conditions and outcomes that will improve treatment protocols and ultimately lead to more evidence-based formulary to improve patient outcomes. We intend to launch our initial virtual consult service offerings in 2021. Through a combination of our UWSS services and our Sanara products, we believe we will be able to offer patient care solutions at every step in the continuum of wound and skin care from diagnosis through healing.
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
Beginning in March 2020, many states issued orders suspending elective surgeries in order to free-up hospital resources to treat COVID-19 patients. This resulted in a reduction in demand for our surgical products beginning in the second half of March 2020. Additionally, most states limited access to SNFs to only resident caregivers, which impeded our ability to provide education and product training to the clinicians who use our products in these facilities. These restrictions resulted in an overall decline in sales for the second quarter of 2020. During the third and fourth quarters of 2020, we saw a strong rebound in product sales as restrictions on elective surgeries eased in our primary markets in Texas, Florida, and the southeastern United States.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we significantly reduced costs in areas such as payroll, consulting, business travel, and other discretionary spending. The duration of the pandemic is uncertain; however, management believes that elective surgical procedures will continue to be performed with the exception of certain geographic COVID-19 hotspots. We will continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 pandemic in order to ensure the safety of our people and our ability to serve our customers and patients.
Cellerate Acquisition
Effective August 28, 2018, we consummated definitive agreements that continued operations to market our principal product, CellerateRX, through a 50% ownership interest in a newly formed entity, Cellerate, LLC (“Cellerate”), which began operations on September 1, 2018. The remaining 50% ownership interest was held by an affiliate of Catalyst, which acquired the exclusive license to CellerateRX products. Cellerate conducted operations with an exclusive sublicense from the Catalyst affiliate to distribute CellerateRX products in the United States, Canada and Mexico (which sublicense was subsequently amended to include worldwide distribution rights). In connection with the formation of Cellerate, we issued a convertible promissory note to an affiliate of Catalyst in the original principal amount of $1.5 million, which was convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $9.00 per share.
On March 15, 2019, we acquired Catalyst’s 50% interest in Cellerate in exchange for the issuance of 1,136,815 shares of our newly created Series F Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Cellerate Acquisition”). Each share of Series F Convertible Preferred Stock was convertible at the option of the holder, at any time, into two shares of common stock. Additionally, each holder of Series F Convertible Preferred Stock was entitled to vote on all matters submitted for a vote of our shareholders with votes equal to the number of shares of common stock into which such holder’s shares of Series F Convertible Preferred Stock could then be converted. Following the closing of the Cellerate Acquisition, Mr. Ronald T. Nixon, Founder and Managing Partner of Catalyst, was elected to our board of directors, effective March 15, 2019.
The Cellerate Acquisition was accounted for as a reverse merger and recapitalization because, immediately following the completion of the transaction, Catalyst could obtain effective control of the Company upon conversion of its convertible preferred stock and convertible promissory note, both of which could occur at Catalyst’s option. Additionally, Cellerate’s officers and senior executive positions continued on as management of the combined entity after consummation of the Cellerate Acquisition. For accounting purposes, Cellerate was deemed to be the acquirer in the transaction and, consequently, the Cellerate Acquisition was treated as a recapitalization of Sanara MedTech. As part of the reverse merger and recapitalization, the net liabilities existing in the Company as of the date of the Cellerate Acquisition totaling approximately $1,666,537, which included $508,973 of cash, were converted to equity as part of the Cellerate Acquisition. No step-up in basis or intangible assets or goodwill was recorded in this transaction.
The Company’s financials for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 do not include revenues and expenses related to the predecessor for the period January 1, 2019 through March 15, 2019. During this period, the predecessor’s revenues were approximately $34,000 and expenses were approximately $348,000.
Reverse Stock Split
Effective May 10, 2019, we effected a reverse stock split of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock at a ratio of one share for every 100 shares. All share and per share information in this discussion and analysis has been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split.
Components of Results of Operations
Sources of Revenues
Our revenue is derived primarily from sales of our surgical wound care products to hospitals and other acute care facilities, and sales of our chronic wound care products to customers across the post-acute continuum of care. Our revenue is driven by direct orders shipped by us to our customers, and to a lesser extent, direct sales to customers through delivery at the time of procedure by one of our sales representatives. We generally recognize revenue when our product is received by the customer.
Revenue streams from product sales and royalties are summarized below for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. All revenue was generated in the United States.
We recognize royalty revenue from a development and licensing agreement with BioStructures, LLC. We record revenue each calendar quarter as earned per the terms of the agreement which stipulates that we will receive quarterly royalty payments of at least $50,250. Under the terms of the development and license agreement, royalties of 2.0% are recognized on sales of products containing our patented resorbable bone hemostasis. The minimum annual royalty due to our Company is $201,000 per year throughout the life of the patent which expires in 2023. These royalties are payable in quarterly installments of $50,250. To date, royalties related to this development and licensing agreement have not exceeded the annual minimum of $201,000 ($50,250 per quarter).
Cost of Goods Sold
Cost of goods sold consists of the acquisition costs from the manufacturers of our licensed products, raw material costs for certain components sourced directly by our Company, and all royalties related due as a result of the sale of our products. Our gross profit represents total revenue less the cost of goods sold, and gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue.
Operating Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) consist primarily of salaries, sales commissions, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation. SG&A also includes outside legal counsel, audit fees, insurance premiums, rent, and other corporate expenses. We expense all SG&A expenses as incurred. We expect our SG&A expenses to increase in absolute dollars and decrease as a percent of revenue as we grow our commercial organization.
Other Income (Expense)
Other income (expense) is primarily comprised of interest income, interest expense and other non-operating activities. Interest expense during 2020 consisted primarily of interest expense associated with our unsecured promissory note under the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”) pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, and for 2019, consisted primarily of interest on amounts due on our revolving line of credit that matured in June 2020. Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents.
Results of Operations
Revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated revenues of $15,586,976 compared to revenues of $11,766,763 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a 32% increase from the prior year. The higher revenues in 2020 were primarily due to increased sales of surgical wound care products as we continued the execution of our strategy to expand our sales force and independent distribution network in both new and existing U.S. markets.
Beginning in March 2020, many states issued orders suspending elective surgeries in order to free-up hospital resources to treat COVID-19 patients. This resulted in a reduction in demand for our surgical products beginning in the second half of March 2020. Additionally, most states limited access to SNFs to only resident caregivers, which impeded our ability to provide education and product training to the clinicians who use our products in these facilities. These restrictions resulted in an overall decline in sales for the second quarter of 2020.
During the third and fourth quarters of 2020, we saw a strong rebound in product sales as restrictions on elective surgeries eased in our primary markets in Texas, Florida, and the southeastern United States. Fourth quarter revenues of $4,789,138 were up 43% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, and represented a record high sales quarter for the Company.
Cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1,616,625, compared to costs of goods sold of $1,209,300 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase over prior year was primarily due to higher sales volume.
Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”). SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $18,683,594 compared to SG&A expenses of $13,067,569 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The higher SG&A expenses in 2020 were primarily due to increased payroll costs resulting from sales force expansion and operational support, higher sales commission expense as a result of higher product sales, and higher costs related to the expansion of our comprehensive wound and skin care strategy.
The higher SG&A expenses are consistent with our strategy of building out a larger sales force and independent distribution network and the expansion of our comprehensive wound and skin care strategy. New sales representatives generally take six to twelve months to begin generating significant revenue. We expect SG&A expenses to decline as a percentage of revenue in the next two years as revenue generated by new sales representatives begins to offset the cost of the sales force expansion.
Interest expense. Interest expense was $11,528 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $105,919 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The lower interest expense was primarily due to declines in draws on our revolving line of credit that matured in June 2020 and the conversion of an interest-bearing promissory note to common stock in early 2020.
Net income / loss. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had a net loss of $4,445,145, compared to net loss of $2,835,778 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our fourth quarter net loss of $266,453 was favorably impacted by the recognition of $586,174 of Other income related to the forgiveness of our PPP Loan, and a $342,930 reduction of SG&A due to the capitalization of certain SG&A costs as internal use software. The net loss in 2020 was due to higher SG&A costs described above, which have been driven by our strategy to expand our geographic coverage through significant investments in sales force expansion, operational support and the expansion of our comprehensive wound and skin care strategy.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash on hand at December 31, 2020 was $455,366, compared to $6,611,928 at December 31, 2019. Historically, we have financed our operations primarily from the sale of equity securities. During 2019 and 2020, our principal sources of liquidity have been cash generated from operations, utilization of our bank line of credit that matured in June 2020, cash provided by an unsecured promissory note in the principal amount of $583,000 (“the PPP Loan”) to Cadence Bank, N.A. (“Cadence”) pursuant to the PPP, and $10,000,000 in proceeds received from a private placement of our common stock in October 2019.
On February 12, 2021, we closed an underwritten public offering of 1,265,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $25.00 per share resulting in gross proceeds of $31,625,000, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. We expect to use the net proceeds from the offering to expand our salesforce and for further development of its products, services and technologies pipeline, clinical studies and general corporate purposes, including working capital (see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on this offering). Based on our current plan of operations, including acquisitions, we believe our cash on hand, when combined with expected cash flows from operations and amounts available under our revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to fund our growth strategy and to meet our anticipated operating expenses and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months.
On January 15, 2021, we entered into a new loan agreement with Cadence (the “Loan Agreement”), providing for a $2.5 million revolving line of credit. The revolving line of credit matures on January 13, 2023, and is secured by substantially all of our assets. Any amounts outstanding will bear interest of 0.75% plus the “Prime Rate” designated in the “Money Rates” section of the Wall Street Journal. Proceeds from the line of credit are to be used to provide additional working capital in support of current assets and for other general corporate purposes and may not be used for acquisitions.
The line of credit contains customary representations and warranties and requires us to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants, including, among others, a minimum liquidity of $1,000,000 as of December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2021, a minimum Tangible Net Worth (as defined in the Loan Agreement) of $1,000,000 and, beginning with the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2021, a minimum Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Loan Agreement) of 1.5 to 1.0. The Loan Agreement also contains customary events of default. If such an event of default occurs, Cadence would be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the Loan Agreement. We generally may (and must, under certain circumstances) prepay all or a portion of the principal outstanding on the revolving line of credit prior to its contractual maturity. As of March 30, 2021, no amounts were owed under the Loan Agreement.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, beginning in March 2020, we significantly reduced costs in areas such as payroll, consulting, business travel, and other discretionary spending. We are continuing to monitor our cash flow and plan to make additional expenditure adjustments as necessary. In November 2020, we were informed that the full amount of the PPP Loan was forgiven. The forgiveness of the loan was recognized as Other income at that time. If appropriate, we may pursue additional financing including issuing additional stock and incurring additional debt to support our strategic initiatives. If we are unable to obtain additional funding for operations at any time in the future, we may not be able to continue expanding the business as currently planned which would require us to modify various aspects of our operations.
On November 9, 2020, our subsidiary, UWSS, entered into agreements to purchase shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series A Stock”) of Precision Healing Inc. (“Precision Healing”) for an aggregate purchase price of $600,000. The Series A Stock is convertible into 150,000 shares of common stock of Precision Healing and has a senior liquidity preference relative to the common shareholders. As stipulated in the agreements with Precision Healing, UWSS invested an additional $600,000 in February 2021 for 150,000 additional shares of Series A Stock. The additional shares of Series A Stock will convert into shares of common stock of Precision Healing at a ratio based on the date Precision Healing delivers a development milestone related to a wound diagnostic tool currently under development.
On July 7, 2019, we executed a license agreement with Rochal whereby we acquired an exclusive world-wide license to market, sell and further develop antimicrobial products for the prevention and treatment of microbes on the human body utilizing certain Rochal patents and pending patent applications (the “BIAKŌS License Agreement”). Under the terms of the BIAKŌS License Agreement, we agreed to pay Rochal $750,000 upon the completion of a capital raise, on or before December 31, 2022, of at least $10,000,000 through the sale of our common stock or assets. At our option, the $750,000 payment may be paid in any combination of cash and our common stock. In March 2021, we issued 20,834 shares of our common stock to Rochal as full payment of the $750,000 which became due upon the Company’s completion of a capital raise in February 2021.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in operating activities was $4,034,518 compared to $2,167,401 used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019. The higher use of cash in 2020 was primarily due to our investment in sales force expansion, corporate infrastructure, and start-up costs related to telehealth services including the development of electronic imagery and data sharing technology to support virtual consultation and diagnostics.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in investing activities was $2,744,374 compared to $1,197,097 used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019. The cash used in investing activities during 2020 was primarily due to our entry into a product license agreement with Rochal in May 2020, which included an initial cash payment of $600,000, along with a $500,000 milestone payment made to Rochal during the first quarter of 2020 as a result of FDA clearance of BIAKŌS Antimicrobial Wound Gel. During the third quarter of 2020, a $500,000 long-term investment was made to purchase a minority interest in DirectDerm. During the fourth quarter of 2020, a $600,000 long-term investment was made in Precision Healing.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $622,330 as compared to $9,800,005 provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019. The cash provided by financing activities in 2020 was primarily related to funds received from the PPP Loan. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was due to proceeds received from a $10,000,000 private placement of our common stock in October 2019.
Material Transactions with Related Parties
CellerateRx Sublicense Agreement
We have an exclusive, world-wide sublicense to distribute CellerateRX products into the wound care and surgical markets from an affiliate of Catalyst, CGI Cellerate RX, which licenses the rights to CellerateRX from AN. Sales of CellerateRX have comprised the majority of our sales during 2018, 2019 and 2020. On January 26, 2021, we amended the term of the sublicense agreement to extend the term to May 17, 2050, with automatic one-year renewals so long as annual net sales of CellerateRX exceed $1,000,000. We pay royalties based on our annual net sales of CellerateRX consisting of 3% of all collected net sales each year up to $12,000,000, 4% of all collected net sales each year that exceed $12,000,000 up to $20,000,000, and 5% of all collected net sales each year that exceed $20,000,000. Minimum royalties of $400,000 per year are payable for the first five years of the sublicense agreement, which was entered on August 27, 2018. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, royalties due under the terms of this agreement totaled $479,809 and $400,000, respectively.
Ronald T. Nixon, our Executive Chairman, is the founder and managing partner of Catalyst. Mr. Nixon and Catalyst, collectively with their affiliates, including CGI Cellerate RX, beneficially owned 3,481,406 shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2020.
Convertible Notes Payable
In connection with the Cellerate Acquisition, we issued a 30-month convertible promissory note to CGI Cellerate RX, an affiliate of Catalyst, in the principal amount of $1,500,000, bearing interest at a 5% annual interest rate, compounded quarterly. Interest on the promissory note was payable quarterly but could have been deferred at our election to the maturity of the promissory note. Outstanding principal and interest were convertible at CGI Cellerate RX’s option into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $9.00 per share.
On February 7, 2020, CGI Cellerate RX converted its $1,500,000 promissory note, including accrued interest of $111,911, into 179,101 shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2020, there were no related party promissory notes or accrued interest outstanding.
Payables
We had outstanding payables to related parties totaling $223,589 at December 31, 2020, and $68,668 at December 31, 2019.
Manufacturing and Technical Services Agreements
On September 9, 2020, we executed a manufacturing agreement with Rochal. Under the terms of the manufacturing agreement, Rochal agreed to manufacture, package, and label products we licensed from Rochal. The manufacturing agreement includes customary terms and conditions. The term of the agreement is for a period of five years unless extended by the mutual consent of the parties. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred $285,155 of inventory manufacturing costs with Rochal.
On September 9, 2020, we executed a technical services agreement with Rochal. Under the terms of the technical services agreement, Rochal will provide its expertise and services on technical service projects identified by us for wound care, skin care and surgical site care applications. The technical services agreement includes customary terms and conditions for our industry. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred $364,881 of costs for Rochal technical services. We may terminate this agreement at any time.
Ronald T. Nixon, our Executive Chairman, is also a director of Rochal, and indirectly a significant shareholder of Rochal, and through the potential exercise of warrants a majority shareholder of Rochal. Ann Beal Salamone, a director, is a significant shareholder, the former president and current Chairman of the Board of Rochal.
Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices
Inflation and changing prices have not had a material impact on our historical results of operations. We do not currently anticipate that inflation and changing prices will have a material impact on our future results of operations.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Under different assumptions or conditions, actual results may differ from these estimates. We have identified certain significant accounting policies which involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in making certain estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements, as summarized below.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which we adopted on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for transferring those goods or services. Revenue is recognized based on the following five step model:
- Identification of the contract with a customer
- Identification of the performance obligations in the contract
- Determination of the transaction price
- Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
- Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets, including certain identifiable intangibles held and to be used by our Company, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances, including the COVID-19 pandemic, indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. We continuously evaluate the recoverability of our long-lived assets based on estimated future cash flows and the estimated liquidation value of such long-lived assets and provide for impairment if such undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the long-lived assets. If impairment exists, an adjustment is made to write the asset down to its fair value, and a loss is recorded as the difference between the carrying value and fair value. Fair values are determined based on quoted market values, undiscounted cash flows or internal and external appraisals, as applicable. Assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of carrying value or estimated net realizable value. No impairment was recorded during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Investment in Equity Securities
Our investments consist of non-marketable equity securities in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values, and are reported at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. We have reviewed the carrying value of our investments and have determined there was no impairment or observable price changes as of December 31, 2020.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost computed on a first-in, first-out basis. Inventories consist of finished goods and related packaging components. We recorded inventory obsolescence expense of $318,076 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $120,442 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The allowance for obsolete and slow-moving inventory had a balance of $276,603 at December 31, 2020, and $43,650 at December 31, 2019. We considered the impact of COVID-19 on our recorded value of inventory and determined no adjustment was necessary as of December 31, 2020.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may directly or indirectly impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations is highly uncertain and subject to change. We considered the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our estimates and assumptions and determined there was not a material impact on our estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020; however, actual results could differ from those estimates and there may be changes to our estimates in future periods.
Income Taxes
We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic No. 740, “Income Taxes.” This standard requires us to provide a net deferred tax asset or liability equal to the expected future tax benefit or expense of temporary reporting differences between book and tax accounting and any available operating loss or tax credit carry forwards.
After applying the provisions of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, the unexpired net operating loss (“NOL”) carry forward at December 31, 2020 was approximately $13.5 million, of which, approximately $5.5 million, generated in 2017 and prior, will expire between 2021 and 2037. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the NOLs generated in 2018, 2019 and 2020, of approximately $8.0 million, will have an indefinite carryforward period but can generally only be used to offset 80% of taxable income in any particular year. We may be subject to certain limitations in our annual utilization of NOL carry forwards to off-set future taxable income pursuant to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, which could result in NOLs expiring unused.
The non-current deferred tax asset is summarized below:
A 100% valuation allowance has been provided for all deferred tax assets, as the ability of the Company to generate sufficient taxable income in the future is uncertain.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
None.
