Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments, and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments, and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Our consolidated financial statements would be affected to the extent there are material differences between these estimates. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Derivative liability movement
The derivative liability movement during the current year represents the mark to market movements of variably priced convertible notes and warrants issued during the current and prior years. These securities are marked to market on a quarterly basis and the resultant gain or loss is recorded as a derivative liability movement in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

· The decrease in net loss of $18,047,833 as discussed above.
· The decrease in non-cash movements of $13,368,909, primarily due to the gain on extinguishment of debt of $(12,596,352) and the movement on amortization of debt discount of $2,477,103 offset by the derivative liability movement of $4,442,939.
· The decrease in cash generated from working capital movements of $1,885,356, primarily due to the reduction in all working capital balances during the current year.
Cash used in investing activities was $684,454 and cash generated by investing activities was $4,556,698 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Over the next twelve months we estimate that the company will require approximately $6.5 million in funding to repay its obligations, if these obligations are not converted to equity and for funding working capital as we continue to seek opportunities for addiction treatment in the US markets. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful with future financing ventures, and the inability to secure such financing may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition. In the opinion of management, the Company’s liquidity risk is assessed as high.
