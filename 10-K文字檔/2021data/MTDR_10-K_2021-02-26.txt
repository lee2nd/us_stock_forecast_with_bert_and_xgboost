Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion contains “forward-looking statements” that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. We caution that assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions or beliefs about future events may, and often do, vary from actual results, and the differences can be material. Some of the key factors that could cause actual results to vary from our expectations include changes in oil or natural gas prices, the timing of planned capital expenditures, availability under our Credit Agreement and the San Mateo Credit Facility, uncertainties in estimating proved reserves and forecasting production results, operational factors affecting our oil and natural gas and midstream operations, the condition of the capital markets generally, as well as our ability to access them, the impact of the worldwide spread of COVID-19 on oil and natural gas demand, oil and natural gas prices and our business, the proximity to and capacity of gathering, processing and transportation facilities, availability and integration of acquisitions, uncertainties regarding environmental regulations or litigation and other legal or regulatory developments affecting our business, as well as those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, all of which are difficult to predict. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed may not occur. See “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
For a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on March 2, 2020.
Overview
We are an independent energy company founded in July 2003 engaged in the exploration, development, production and acquisition of oil and natural gas resources in the United States, with an emphasis on oil and natural gas shale and other unconventional plays. Our current operations are focused primarily on the oil and liquids-rich portion of the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring plays in the Delaware Basin in Southeast New Mexico and West Texas. We also operate in the Eagle Ford shale play in South Texas and the Haynesville shale and Cotton Valley plays in Northwest Louisiana. Additionally, we conduct midstream operations, primarily through San Mateo, in support of our exploration, development and production operations and provide natural gas processing, oil transportation services, oil, natural gas and produced water gathering services and produced water disposal services to third parties.
2020 Operational Highlights
During the first quarter and through April 2020, the oil and natural gas industry witnessed an abrupt and significant decline in oil prices from $63 per Bbl in early January to as low as ($38) per Bbl in late April. This sudden decline in oil prices was attributable to two primary factors: (i) the precipitous decline in global oil demand resulting from the worldwide spread of COVID-19 and (ii) a sudden, unexpected increase in global oil supply resulting from actions initiated by Saudi Arabia to increase its oil production to world markets following the failure of efforts by OPEC+ to agree on coordinated production cuts at their March 6, 2020 meetings in Vienna, Austria. Primarily as a result of these unexpected events and the resulting declines in oil prices, we significantly modified our 2020 operational plan.
We began 2020 operating six drilling rigs in the Delaware Basin, as we continued to focus on the exploration, delineation and development of our Delaware Basin acreage in Loving County, Texas and Lea and Eddy Counties, New Mexico. We had originally planned to operate these six drilling rigs in the Delaware Basin throughout 2020. As a result of the events noted above, however, we released (i) one operated drilling rig from our Wolf asset area late in the first quarter of 2020, (ii) a second operated drilling rig from the Greater Stebbins Area in late April 2020 and (iii) a third operated drilling rig from our Rustler Breaks asset area in late June 2020. We operated three drilling rigs in the Delaware Basin during the remainder of 2020. Two of these rigs operated primarily in the Stateline asset area, and the third rig operated primarily in the Rustler Breaks asset area and in the Rodney Robinson leasehold in the western portion of the Antelope Ridge asset area during the second half of 2020.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we completed and began producing oil and natural gas from 53 gross (45.6 net) operated and 36 gross (2.2 net) non-operated wells in the Delaware Basin. We did not conduct any operated drilling and completion activities on our leasehold properties in South Texas or Northwest Louisiana during 2020, although we did participate in the drilling and completion of four gross (less than 0.1 net) non-operated Haynesville shale wells that began producing in 2020.
The vast majority of our 2020 capital expenditures was directed to (i) the delineation and development of our leasehold position in the Delaware Basin, (ii) the development of certain midstream assets to support our operations there, (iii) our participation in non-operated wells drilled and completed in the Delaware Basin and (iv) the acquisition of additional leasehold and mineral interests prospective for the Wolfcamp, Bone Spring and other liquids-rich plays in the Delaware Basin. Our remaining capital expenditures were primarily directed to the installation of pumping units and other facilities on certain of our Eagle Ford shale wells in South Texas and to our participation in several non-operated wells drilled and completed in the Haynesville shale throughout 2020.
Our average daily oil equivalent production for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 75,175 BOE per day, including 43,526 Bbl of oil per day and 189.9 MMcf of natural gas per day, an increase of 14%, as compared to 66,203 BOE per day, including 38,312 Bbl of oil per day and 167.4 MMcf of natural gas per day, for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our average daily oil production in 2020 of 43,526 Bbl of oil per day increased 14% from 38,312 Bbl of oil per day in 2019. This increase in oil production was primarily a result of our ongoing delineation and development drilling activities in the Delaware Basin, which offset declining oil production in the Eagle Ford shale where we have not turned to sales any new operated wells since the second quarter of 2019. Our average daily natural gas production of 189.9 MMcf per day in 2020 increased 13% from 167.4 MMcf per day in 2019. This increase in natural gas production was primarily attributable to our ongoing delineation and development drilling activities in the Delaware Basin, which offset declining natural gas production in the Haynesville shale where we had significantly less non-operated activity in 2020 as compared to 2019. Oil production comprised 58% of our total production for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, our oil and natural gas revenues were $744.5 million, a decrease of 17% from oil and natural gas revenues of $892.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our oil revenues decreased 22% to approximately $595.5 million, as compared to $759.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in oil revenues resulted from a lower weighted average realized oil price of $37.38 per Bbl in 2020, as compared to $54.34 per Bbl in 2019. This decrease was partially offset by the 14% increase in oil production for the year ended December 31, 2020 noted above. Our natural gas revenues increased 12% to approximately $149.0 million, as compared to $132.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in natural gas revenues primarily resulted from the 13% increase in our natural gas production noted above.
We reported a net loss attributable to Matador shareholders of approximately $593.2 million, or ($5.11) per diluted common share, on a GAAP basis for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to net income of $87.8 million, or $0.75 per diluted common share, for the year ended December 31, 2019. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $519.3 million, as compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $610.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to our net income (loss) and net cash provided by operating activities, see “Selected Financial Data-Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”
At December 31, 2020, our estimated total proved oil and natural gas reserves were 270.3 million BOE, including 159.9 million Bbl of oil and 662.3 Bcf of natural gas, with a Standardized Measure of $1.58 billion and a PV-10 of $1.66 billion. At December 31, 2019, our estimated total proved oil and natural gas reserves were 252.5 million BOE, including 148.0 million Bbl of oil and 627.2 Bcf of natural gas, with a Standardized Measure of $2.03 billion and a PV-10 of $2.25 billion. Our estimated total proved reserves of 270.3 million BOE at December 31, 2020 represented a 7% year-over-year increase, as compared to 252.5 million BOE at December 31, 2019. Our estimated proved oil reserves of 159.9 million Bbl at December 31, 2020 increased 8%, as compared to 148.0 million Bbl at December 31, 2019. Proved oil reserves comprised 59% of our total proved reserves at both December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2020, 46% of our total proved reserves were proved developed reserves, as compared to 42% at December 31, 2019.
Our proved oil and natural gas reserves in the Delaware Basin increased 12% to 261.9 million BOE at December 31, 2020, as compared to 232.8 million BOE at December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of our ongoing delineation and development operations there. At December 31, 2020, approximately 97% of our total proved oil and natural gas reserves were attributable to our properties in the Delaware Basin. Our proved oil reserves in the Delaware Basin increased 12% to 156.3 million Bbl at December 31, 2020, as compared to 139.6 million Bbl at December 31, 2019. Proved oil reserves comprised 60% of our Delaware Basin total proved reserves at both December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.
At both December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, these reserves estimates were based on evaluations prepared by our engineering staff and have been audited for their reasonableness and conformance with SEC guidelines by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc., independent reservoir engineers. Standardized Measure represents the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves, less estimated future development, production, plugging and abandonment costs and income tax expenses, discounted at 10% per annum to reflect the timing of future cash flows. Standardized Measure is not an estimate of the fair market value of our properties. PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a reconciliation of PV-10 to Standardized Measure, see “Business-Estimated Proved Reserves.”
2020 Midstream Highlights
Effective October 1, 2020, together with our joint venture partner, Five Point, we completed the successful merger of San Mateo II with and into San Mateo I. San Mateo is owned 51% by us and 49% by Five Point.
San Mateo achieved strong operating results in 2020, highlighted by (i) increased midstream services revenues, (ii) increased produced water handling volumes and (iii) increased oil gathering and transportation volumes, all as compared to 2019. San Mateo’s natural gas gathering and processing volumes declined slightly in 2020 as compared to 2019 due to reduced volumes from a significant third-party customer, but, on a quarterly sequential basis, San Mateo’s natural gas gathering and processing volumes, produced water handling volumes and oil gathering and transportation volumes all increased significantly in the fourth quarter of 2020, as compared to the third quarter, as we realized the first full quarter of production from the Boros wells in the Stateline asset area and the Leatherneck wells in the Greater Stebbins Area.
During the third quarter of 2020, San Mateo completed the construction and successful start-up of the expansion of the Black River Processing Plant, which added an incremental designed inlet capacity of 200 MMcf of natural gas per day to the previously designed inlet capacity of 260 MMcf per day for a total designed inlet capacity of 460 MMcf per day. The expanded Black River Processing Plant supports our exploration and development activities in the Delaware Basin and, at December 31, 2020, was gathering and processing natural gas from the Stateline asset area and from the Greater Stebbins Area. The Black River Processing Plant also processes natural gas from our Rustler Breaks asset area and provides natural gas processing services for other San Mateo customers in the area.
In September 2020, San Mateo also completed and placed in service approximately 43 miles of large diameter natural gas gathering pipelines between the Black River Processing Plant and the Stateline asset area (approximately 24 miles) and the Greater Stebbins Area (approximately 19 miles). In addition, San Mateo completed and placed in service approximately 19 miles of various diameter crude oil pipelines from certain points of origin in the Greater Stebbins Area to the existing San Mateo interconnect with Plains in Eddy County, New Mexico. At December 31, 2020, San Mateo was gathering or transporting our oil and natural gas production via pipeline in both the Stateline asset area and the Greater Stebbins Area, as well as in the Wolf and Rustler Breaks asset areas. San Mateo was handling our produced water in each of these areas as well.
At December 31, 2020, San Mateo’s midstream system included:
•Natural Gas Assets: 460 MMcf per day of designed natural gas cryogenic processing capacity and approximately 140 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines in Eddy County, New Mexico and Loving County, Texas, including 43 miles of large diameter natural gas gathering lines spanning from the Stateline asset area to the Greater Stebbins Area in Eddy County, New Mexico;
•Oil Assets: Three oil CDPs with over 100,000 Bbl of designed oil throughput capacity and approximately 90 miles of oil gathering and transportation pipelines in Eddy County, New Mexico and Loving County, Texas, as well as a 400,000-acre joint development area with Plains to gather our and other producers’ oil production in Eddy County, New Mexico; and
•Produced Water Assets: 13 commercial salt water disposal wells and associated facilities with designed produced water disposal capacity of 335,000 Bbl per day and approximately 120 miles of produced water gathering pipelines in Eddy County, New Mexico and Loving County, Texas.
2021 Capital Expenditure Budget
We expect that development of our Delaware Basin assets will be the primary focus of our operations and capital expenditures in 2021. We plan to operate three contracted drilling rigs in the Delaware Basin for most of the first quarter of 2021. In March 2021, we plan to add a fourth drilling rig and operate four drilling rigs throughout the remainder of 2021. Our 2021 estimated capital expenditure budget consists of $525.0 to $575.0 million for drilling, completing and equipping wells (“D/C/E capital expenditures”) and $20.0 to $30.0 million for midstream capital expenditures, which reflects our proportionate share of San Mateo’s estimated 2021 capital expenditures. Substantially all of these 2021 estimated capital expenditures are expected to be allocated to (i) the further delineation and development of our leasehold position, (ii) the construction, installation and maintenance of midstream assets and (iii) our participation in certain non-operated well opportunities in the Delaware Basin, with the exception of amounts allocated to limited operations in our South Texas and Haynesville shale positions to maintain and extend leases and to participate in certain non-operated well opportunities. Our 2021 Delaware Basin operated drilling program is expected to focus on the continued development of our various asset areas throughout the Delaware Basin, with a continued emphasis on drilling and completing a higher percentage of longer horizontal wells in 2021, including 98% with anticipated completed lateral lengths of two miles or greater.
At December 31, 2020, we had $57.9 million in cash (excluding restricted cash) and $214.2 million in undrawn borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement (after giving effect to outstanding letters of credit based upon our elected borrowing commitment of $700.0 million). Excluding any possible significant acquisitions, we expect to fund our 2021 capital expenditures through a combination of cash on hand, operating cash flows and performance incentives paid to us by Five Point in connection with San Mateo. If capital expenditures were to exceed our operating cash flows in 2021, we expect to fund any such excess capital expenditures through borrowings under the Credit Agreement or the San Mateo Credit Facility (assuming availability under such facilities) or through other capital sources, including borrowings under additional credit arrangements, the sale or joint venture of midstream assets, oil and natural gas producing assets, leasehold interests or mineral interests and potential issuances of equity, debt or convertible securities, none of which may be available on satisfactory terms or at all.
We may divest portions of our non-core assets, particularly in the Haynesville shale and in our South Texas position (as we did in 2019 and 2020), as well as consider monetizing other assets, such as certain mineral, royalty and midstream interests, as value-creating opportunities arise. In addition, we intend to continue evaluating the opportunistic acquisition of acreage and mineral interests, principally in the Delaware Basin, during 2021. These monetizations, divestitures and expenditures are opportunity-specific, and purchase price multiples and per-acre prices can vary significantly based on the asset or prospect. As a result, it is difficult to estimate these 2021 monetizations, divestitures and capital expenditures with any degree of certainty; therefore, we have not provided estimated proceeds related to monetizations or divestitures or estimated capital expenditures related to acreage and mineral acquisitions for 2021. The aggregate amount of capital we expend may fluctuate materially based on market conditions, the actual costs to drill, complete and place on production operated or non-operated wells, our drilling results, the actual costs and scope of our midstream activities, the ability of our joint venture partners to meet their capital obligations, other opportunities that may become available to us and our ability to obtain capital.
Revenues
The following table summarizes our revenues and production data for the periods indicated.
________________
(1)We report our production volumes in two streams: oil and natural gas, including both dry and liquids-rich natural gas. Revenues associated with NGLs are included with our natural gas revenues.
(2)Estimated using a conversion ratio of one Bbl of oil per six Mcf of natural gas.
Year Ended December 31, 2020 as Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019
Oil and natural gas revenues. Our oil and natural gas revenues decreased $147.9 million, or 17%, to $744.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $892.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our oil revenues decreased $164.3 million, or 22%, to $595.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $759.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease in oil revenues resulted from a 31% decrease in the weighted average oil price realized for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $37.38 per Bbl, as compared to $54.34 per Bbl realized for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease in our oil revenues was partially offset by the 14% increase in our oil production to 15.9 million Bbl of oil for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 14.0 million Bbl of oil for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in oil production was primarily attributable to our ongoing delineation and development drilling activities in the Delaware Basin, which offset declining oil production primarily from our properties in the Eagle Ford shale. Our natural gas revenues increased by $16.4 million, or 12%, to $149.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $132.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in natural gas revenues was primarily attributable to the 14% increase in our natural gas production to 69.5 Bcf for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 61.1 Bcf for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in natural gas production was primarily attributable to our ongoing delineation and development drilling activities in the Delaware Basin, which offset declining natural gas production primarily from our properties in the Haynesville shale.
Third-party midstream services revenues. Our third-party midstream services revenues increased $5.8 million, or 10%, to $64.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $59.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Third-party midstream services revenues are those revenues from midstream operations related to third parties, including working interest owners in our operated wells. This increase was primarily attributable to (i) an increase in our third-party natural gas gathering, transportation and processing revenues to $30.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $27.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, (ii) an increase in our third-party oil gathering and transportation revenues to $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, and (iii) an increase in third-party produced water handling revenues to $25.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $24.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Sales of purchased natural gas. Our sales of purchased natural gas decreased $33.0 million, or 44%, to $41.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $74.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in natural gas volumes sold during the year ended December 31, 2020. Sales of purchased natural gas primarily reflect those natural gas purchase transactions that we periodically enter into with third parties whereby we purchase natural gas and (i) subsequently sell the natural gas to other purchasers or (ii) process the natural gas at the Black River Processing Plant and subsequently sell the residue gas and NGLs to other purchasers. These revenues, and the expenses related to these transactions included in “Purchased natural gas,” are presented on a gross basis in our consolidated statement of operations.
Lease bonus - mineral acreage. Our lease bonus - mineral acreage revenues were $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Lease bonus - mineral acreage revenues reflect the payments we receive to enter into or extend leases to third-party lessees to develop the oil and natural gas attributable to certain of our mineral interests.
Realized gain on derivatives. Our realized net gain on derivatives was $38.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to a realized net gain of approximately $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. We realized a net gain of $35.1 million related to our oil costless collar, put and swap contracts for the year ended December 31, 2020, resulting primarily from oil prices that were below the floor prices of certain of our oil costless collar contracts and below the strike price of certain of our oil put and swap contracts. We realized a net gain of $3.8 million from our oil basis swap contracts for the year ended December 31, 2020, resulting from oil basis prices that were lower than the fixed prices of certain of our oil basis swap contracts. We realized net gains of $8.9 million and $0.5 million from our oil and natural gas costless collar contracts, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019, resulting from oil and natural gas prices that were below the floor prices of certain of our oil and natural gas costless collar contracts. We realized a net gain of $0.1 million from our oil basis swap contracts for the year ended December 31, 2019, resulting from oil basis prices that were lower than the fixed prices of certain of our oil basis swap contracts. We realized an average gain on our oil derivatives of approximately $2.45 per Bbl of oil produced during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to an average gain of $0.64 per Bbl of oil produced during the year ended December 31, 2019. Our total oil volumes hedged for the year ended December 31, 2020 represented 77% of our total oil production, as compared to 59% of our total oil production for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our total natural gas volumes hedged for the year ended December 31, 2020 represented 10% of our total natural gas production, as compared to 12% of our total natural gas production for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Unrealized (loss) gain on derivatives. Our unrealized loss on derivatives was approximately $32.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to an unrealized loss of $53.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the aggregate net fair value of our open oil and natural gas derivatives and oil basis swap contracts decreased from a net liability of approximately $3.9 million to a net liability of approximately $35.9 million, resulting in an unrealized loss on derivatives of approximately $32.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the aggregate net fair value of our open oil and natural gas derivative and oil basis swap contracts decreased from a net asset of approximately $49.8 million to a net liability of approximately $3.9 million, resulting in an unrealized loss on derivatives of approximately $53.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Expenses
The following table summarizes our operating expenses and other income (expense) for the periods indicated.
Year Ended December 31, 2020 as Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019
Production taxes, transportation and processing. Our production taxes and transportation and processing expenses increased $1.1 million, or 1%, to $93.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $92.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily attributable to the $11.0 million increase in transportation and processing expenses to $40.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $29.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily resulting from the 14% increase in total oil equivalent production between the respective periods. This increase in transportation and processing expenses was largely offset by a $9.9 million decrease in our production taxes to $53.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $63.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, resulting from the $147.9 million decrease in oil and natural gas revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. On a unit-of-production basis, our production taxes and transportation and processing expenses decreased 11% to $3.39 per BOE for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $3.82 per BOE for the year ended December 31, 2019, as the 14% increase in total oil equivalent production between the respective periods more than offset the 1% increase in our production taxes, transportation and processing expenses.
Lease operating expenses. Our lease operating expenses decreased $12.4 million, or 11%, to $105.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $117.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. On a unit-of-production basis, our lease operating expenses decreased 21% to $3.81 per BOE for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $4.85 per BOE for the year ended December 31, 2019. These decreases in our lease operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were primarily attributable to (i) a decrease in produced water disposal expenses of $11.4 million, (ii) a decrease in equipment rental and workover expenses of $4.6 million and (iii) a decrease in ad valorem taxes of $1.1 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in expenses associated with compressors of $2.4 million, which were attributable to servicing the increased number of wells at December 31, 2020, as compared to December 31, 2019.
Plant and other midstream services operating. Our plant and other midstream services operating expenses increased $4.7 million, or 13%, to $41.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $36.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily attributable to (i) increased expenses associated with our expanded commercial produced water disposal operations of $21.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $18.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, and (ii) increased expenses associated with our expanded pipeline operations of $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. These increases were partially offset by decreased expenses associated with operating the Black River Processing Plant of $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $11.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Depletion, depreciation and amortization. Our depletion, depreciation and amortization expenses increased $11.3 million, or 3%, to $361.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $350.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily attributable to (i) the 14% increase in total oil equivalent production to 27.5 million BOE for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 24.2 million BOE for the year ended December 31, 2019, and (ii) increased depreciation expenses attributable to our midstream segment of approximately $23.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $16.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. On a unit-of-production basis, our depletion, depreciation and amortization expenses decreased 9% to $13.15 per BOE for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $14.51 per BOE for the year ended December 31, 2019. On a unit-of-production basis, the decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in unamortized property costs resulting from the full-cost ceiling impairments recorded in the second and third quarters of 2020, as well as the 14% increase in total equivalent oil production during 2020.
Full-cost ceiling impairment. Due to the sharp decline in oil and natural gas prices used to estimate proved oil and natural gas reserves in 2020, at June 30, September 30 and December 31, 2020, the net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties less related deferred income taxes exceeded the full-cost ceiling. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $684.7 million, exclusive of tax effect, to the net capitalized costs. This full-cost ceiling impairment is reflected in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020, with the related deferred income tax credit recorded net of a valuation allowance. No impairment to the net carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties and no corresponding charge resulting from a full-cost ceiling impairment were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2019.
General and administrative. Our general and administrative expenses decreased $17.5 million, or 22%, to $62.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $80.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our general and administrative expenses on a unit-of-production basis decreased 31% to $2.27 per BOE for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $3.31 per BOE for the year ended December 31, 2019. These decreases were primarily attributable to cost reductions initially implemented during the three months ended March 31, 2020, including headcount and employee compensation reductions, that were maintained throughout the remainder of 2020.
Interest expense. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred total interest expense of approximately $82.2 million. We capitalized approximately $5.5 million of our interest expense on certain qualifying projects for the year ended December 31, 2020 and expensed the remaining $76.7 million to operations. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred total interest expense of approximately $82.4 million. We capitalized $8.5 million of our interest expense on certain qualifying projects for the year ended December 31, 2019 and expensed the remaining $73.9 million to operations.
Total income tax (benefit) provision. We recorded a total income tax benefit of $45.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. As a result of the full-cost ceiling impairments that were recorded during 2020, we recorded a valuation allowance of $110.7 million against our net deferred tax assets for the year ended December 31, 2020, which partially offset the income tax benefit that resulted from our $599.2 million loss before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020. The valuation allowance will continue to be recognized until the realization of future deferred tax benefits are more likely than not to be utilized. Our effective tax rate was 7.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020, which differed from amounts computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory tax rates to pre-tax income due primarily to the impact of the valuation allowance, but also due to permanent differences between book and taxable income and state taxes, primarily in New Mexico. We recorded a total income tax provision of $35.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our effective tax rate was 22.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019, which differed from amounts computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory tax rates to pre-tax income due primarily to the impact of permanent differences between book and taxable income and state taxes, primarily in New Mexico.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary use of capital has been, and we expect will continue to be during 2021 and for the foreseeable future, for the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties and for midstream investments. Excluding any possible significant acquisitions, we expect to fund our capital expenditures for 2021 primarily through a combination of cash on hand, operating cash flows and performance incentives paid to us by Five Point in connection with San Mateo. If capital expenditures were to exceed our operating cash flows in 2021, we expect to fund any such excess capital expenditures through borrowings under the Credit Agreement or the San Mateo Credit Facility (assuming availability under such facilities) or through other capital sources, including borrowings under additional credit arrangements, the sale or joint venture of midstream assets, oil and natural gas producing assets, leasehold interests or mineral interests and potential issuances of equity, debt or convertible securities, none of which may be available on satisfactory terms or at all. Our future success in growing proved reserves and production will be highly dependent on our ability to generate operating cash flows and access outside sources of capital.
At December 31, 2020, we had cash totaling $57.9 million and restricted cash totaling $33.5 million, which was associated with San Mateo. By contractual agreement, the cash in the accounts held by our less-than-wholly-owned subsidiaries is not to be commingled with our other cash and is to be used only to fund the capital expenditures and operations of these less-than-wholly-owned subsidiaries.
At December 31, 2020, we had (i) $1.05 billion of outstanding 5.875% senior notes due September 2026 (the “Notes”), (ii) $440.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement, (iii) approximately $45.8 million in outstanding letters of credit issued pursuant to the Credit Agreement and (iv) $7.5 million outstanding under an unsecured U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loan. In February 2020, the lenders under the Credit Agreement completed their review of our proved oil and natural gas reserves, and, as a result, the borrowing base was reaffirmed at $900.0 million. We elected to increase the borrowing commitment from $500.0 million to $700.0 million, and the maximum facility amount remained $1.5 billion. We also added two new banks to our lending group as part of this redetermination process. This February 2020 redetermination constituted the regularly scheduled May 1 redetermination. In October 2020, the lenders under our Credit Agreement completed their review of our proved oil and natural gas reserves, and, as a result, the borrowing base was reaffirmed at $900.0 million. We elected to keep the borrowing commitment at $700.0 million, the maximum facility amount remained $1.5 billion and no changes were made to the terms of the Credit Agreement. This October 2020 redetermination constituted the regularly scheduled November 1 redetermination. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are limited to the lowest of the borrowing base, the maximum facility amount and the elected commitment (subject to compliance with the covenant noted below). The Credit Agreement matures in October 2023. The Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain a debt to EBITDA ratio, which is defined as debt outstanding (net of up to $50.0 million of cash or cash equivalents), divided by a rolling four quarter EBITDA calculation, of 4.00 or less. We believe that we were in compliance with the terms of the Credit Agreement at December 31, 2020. Between December 31, 2020 and February 23, 2021, we repaid an additional $10.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement.
At December 31, 2020, San Mateo had $334.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the San Mateo Credit Facility and approximately $9.0 million in outstanding letters of credit issued pursuant to the San Mateo Credit Facility. The San Mateo Credit Facility includes an accordion feature, which provides for potential increases to up to $400.0 million, and matures in December 2023. At December 31, 2020, the lender commitments under the San Mateo Credit Facility were $375.0 million (subject to San Mateo’s compliance with the covenants noted below). The San Mateo Credit Facility is guaranteed by San Mateo’s subsidiaries, secured by substantially all of San Mateo’s assets, including real property, and is non-recourse with respect to Matador and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The San Mateo Credit Facility requires San Mateo to maintain a debt to EBITDA ratio, which is defined as total consolidated funded indebtedness outstanding (as defined in the San Mateo Credit Facility) divided by a rolling four quarter EBITDA calculation, of 5.00 or less, subject to certain exceptions. The San Mateo Credit Facility also requires San Mateo to maintain an interest coverage ratio, which is defined as a rolling four quarter EBITDA calculation divided by San Mateo’s consolidated interest expense for such period, of 2.50 or more. The San Mateo Credit Facility also restricts the ability of San Mateo to distribute cash to its members if San Mateo’s liquidity is less than 10% of the lender commitments under the San Mateo Credit Facility. We believe that San Mateo was in compliance with the terms of the San Mateo Credit Facility at December 31, 2020. Between December 31, 2020 and February 23, 2021, we repaid an additional $11.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the San Mateo Credit Facility.
During the first quarter and through April 2020, the oil and natural gas industry witnessed an abrupt and significant decline in oil prices from $63 per Bbl in early January to as low as ($38) per Bbl in late April, although oil prices began to improve later in the second quarter and throughout the remainder of 2020. This sudden decline in oil prices was attributable to two primary factors: (i) the precipitous decline in global oil demand resulting from the worldwide spread of COVID-19 and (ii) a sudden, unexpected increase in global oil supply resulting from actions initiated by Saudi Arabia to increase its oil production to world markets following the failure of efforts by members of OPEC+ to agree on coordinated production cuts at their March 6, 2020 meetings in Vienna, Austria.
Primarily as a result of these unexpected events and the resulting declines in oil prices, we modified our 2020 operational plan. In March 2020, we significantly reduced our capital expenditure budget, including reducing our operated drilling program from six to three drilling rigs by the end of the second quarter of 2020. In addition, we made initial reductions to headcount, employee salaries and lease operating expenses and curtailed or shut in portions of our oil and natural gas production. While we had prepared to make further reductions to headcount, salaries and our capital expenditure budget, we have been able to avoid such reductions to date as a result of realizing greater-than-expected savings from the above changes to our 2020 operational plan, restructuring our hedge portfolio and applying for and receiving an SBA loan through the Paycheck Protection Program. While oil prices have continued to improve into 2021, the general outlook for the oil and natural gas industry for the remainder of the year remains highly uncertain, and we can provide no assurances as to when or to what extent the economic disruptions resulting from COVID-19 and the corresponding decline in oil demand may improve. These economic disruptions have also significantly reduced our ability to access the capital markets on reasonably similar terms as were available in prior periods.
As noted above, on April 13, 2020, we executed a promissory note evidencing an unsecured loan in the amount of approximately $7.5 million as part of the Paycheck Protection Program. The Paycheck Protection Program was established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and is administered by the SBA. The loan was issued through Iberiabank, which is a lender under the Credit Agreement, matures on the second anniversary of the funding date and bears interest at a fixed rate of 1.00% per annum. We used the proceeds of the loan for payroll, including salaries, payroll taxes and employee medical benefits, as permitted by the program. The receipt of the loan allowed us to avoid the planned further reductions to employee headcount and salaries discussed above. The loan is eligible for forgiveness for the portion of the loan proceeds used for payroll costs and other designated operating expenses, provided at least 60% of the loan’s proceeds are used for payroll costs.
We expect that development of our Delaware Basin assets will be the primary focus of our operations and capital expenditures in 2021. We plan to operate three contracted drilling rigs in the Delaware Basin for most of the first quarter of 2021. In March 2021, we plan to add a fourth drilling rig and operate four drilling rigs throughout the remainder of 2021. Our 2021 estimated capital expenditure budget consists of $525.0 to $575.0 million for D/C/E capital expenditures and $20.0 to $30.0 million for midstream capital expenditures, which reflects our proportionate share of San Mateo’s estimated 2021 capital expenditures. Substantially all of these 2021 estimated capital expenditures are expected to be allocated to (i) the further delineation and development of our leasehold position, (ii) the construction, installation and maintenance of midstream assets and (iii) our participation in certain non-operated well opportunities in the Delaware Basin, with the exception of amounts allocated to limited operations in our South Texas and Haynesville shale positions to maintain and extend leases and to participate in certain non-operated well opportunities. Our 2021 Delaware Basin operated drilling program is expected to focus on the continued development of our various asset areas throughout the Delaware Basin, with a continued emphasis on drilling and completing a higher percentage of longer horizontal wells in 2021, including 98% with anticipated completed lateral lengths of two miles or greater. We have built significant optionality into our drilling program, which allowed us to decrease the number of rigs in 2020 from six to three within a few months and should generally allow us to increase or decrease the number of rigs we operate as necessary based on changing commodity prices and other factors.
We may divest portions of our non-core assets, particularly in the Eagle Ford shale in South Texas and the Haynesville shale in Northwest Louisiana, as well as consider monetizing other assets, such as certain mineral, royalty and midstream interests, as value-creating opportunities arise. In addition, we intend to continue evaluating the opportunistic acquisition of acreage and mineral interests, principally in the Delaware Basin, during 2021. These monetizations, divestitures and expenditures are opportunity-specific, and purchase price multiples and per-acre prices can vary significantly based on the asset or prospect. As a result, it is difficult to estimate these 2021 monetizations, divestitures and capital expenditures with any degree of certainty; therefore, we have not provided estimated proceeds related to monetizations or divestitures or estimated capital expenditures related to acreage and mineral acquisitions for 2021.
Our 2021 capital expenditures may be adjusted as business conditions warrant and the amount, timing and allocation of such expenditures is largely discretionary and within our control. The aggregate amount of capital we will expend may fluctuate materially based on market conditions, the actual costs to drill, complete and place on production operated or non-operated wells, our drilling results, the actual costs and scope of our midstream activities, the ability of our joint venture partners to meet their capital obligations, other opportunities that may become available to us and our ability to obtain capital. When oil or natural gas prices decline, or costs increase significantly, we have the flexibility to defer a significant portion of our capital
expenditures until later periods to conserve cash or to focus on projects that we believe have the highest expected returns and potential to generate near-term cash flows. We routinely monitor and adjust our capital expenditures in response to changes in prices, availability of financing, drilling, completion and acquisition costs, industry conditions, the timing of regulatory approvals, the availability of rigs, success or lack of success in our exploration and development activities, contractual obligations, drilling plans for properties we do not operate and other factors both within and outside our control.
Exploration and development activities are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, which could cause these activities to be less successful than we anticipate. A significant portion of our anticipated cash flows from operations for 2021 is expected to come from producing wells and development activities on currently proved properties in the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring plays in the Delaware Basin, the Eagle Ford shale in South Texas and the Haynesville shale in Northwest Louisiana. Our existing wells may not produce at the levels we are forecasting and our exploration and development activities in these areas may not be as successful as we anticipate. Additionally, our anticipated cash flows from operations are based upon current expectations of oil and natural gas prices for 2021 and the hedges we currently have in place. For a discussion of our expectations of such commodity prices, see “-General Outlook and Trends” below. We use commodity derivative financial instruments at times to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in oil, natural gas and NGL prices and to partially offset reductions in our cash flows from operations resulting from declines in commodity prices. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report for a summary of our open derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2020. See “Risk Factors-Risks Related to our Financial Condition-Our exploration, development, exploitation and midstream projects require substantial capital expenditures that may exceed our cash flows from operations and potential borrowings, and we may be unable to obtain needed capital on satisfactory terms, which could adversely affect our future growth,” “Risk Factors-Risks Related to our Operations-Drilling for and producing oil and natural gas are highly speculative and involve a high degree of operational and financial risk, with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business,” “Risk Factors-Risks Related to our Operations-Our identified drilling locations are scheduled over several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling” and “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Laws and Regulations-Approximately 28% of our leasehold and mineral acres in the Delaware Basin is located on federal lands, which are subject to administrative permitting requirements and potential federal legislation, regulation and orders that may limit or restrict oil and natural gas operations on federal lands.”
Our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are presented below.
__________________
(1)Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to our net income (loss) and net cash provided by operating activities, see “-Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.
Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $74.5 million to $477.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $552.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Excluding changes in operating assets and liabilities, net cash provided by operating activities decreased to $500.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $586.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily attributable to significantly lower realized oil prices for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities between December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020 resulted in a net increase of approximately $11.4 million in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
Our operating cash flows are sensitive to a number of variables, including changes in our production and the volatility of oil and natural gas prices between reporting periods. Regional and worldwide economic activity, the actions of OPEC+ and other large state-owned oil producers, weather, infrastructure capacity to reach markets and other variable factors significantly impact the prices of oil and natural gas. Furthermore, the continued effect of COVID-19 and the corresponding decline in oil demand may also significantly impact the prices we receive for our oil production. These factors are beyond our control and are
difficult to predict. We use commodity derivative financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in oil, natural gas and NGL prices. For additional information on the impact of changing prices on our financial condition, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.” See also “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Financial Condition-Our success is dependent on the prices of oil and natural gas. Low oil and natural gas prices and the continued volatility in these prices may adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to meet our capital expenditure requirements and financial obligations.”
Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $128.3 million to $775.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $904.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to a decrease of $208.3 million in D/C/E capital expenditures as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, which was partially offset by (i) an increase of approximately $42.3 million in expenditures for midstream support equipment and facilities, which included the construction of the further expansion of the Black River Processing Plant and associated infrastructure, additional salt water disposal wells and additional pipeline infrastructure, (ii) an increase of $22.0 million in expenditures related to acquisition of oil and natural gas properties and (iii) a decrease of $17.1 million in proceeds from sales of assets. Cash used for D/C/E capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily attributable to our operated and non-operated drilling and completion activities in the Delaware Basin.
Cash Flows Provided by Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $324.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $333.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily attributable to net borrowings under our Credit Agreement of $185.0 million, borrowings under the San Mateo Credit Facility of $46.0 million, net contributions related to the formation of San Mateo I and from non-controlling interest owners of less-than-wholly-owned subsidiaries of $88.8 million and receipt of the $7.5 million SBA loan.
See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report for a summary of our debt, including the Credit Agreement, the San Mateo Credit Facility and the Notes.
Guarantor Financial Information
The Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of Matador (the “Guarantor Subsidiaries”) on a full and unconditional basis (except for customary release provisions). At December 31, 2020, the Guarantor Subsidiaries were 100% owned by Matador. Matador is a parent holding company and has no independent assets or operations, and there are no significant restrictions on the ability of Matador to obtain funds from the Guarantor Subsidiaries by dividend or loan. San Mateo and its subsidiaries are not guarantors of the Notes.
The following tables present summarized financial information of Matador (as issuer of the Notes) and the Guarantor Subsidiaries on a combined basis after elimination of (i) intercompany transactions and balances between the parent and the Guarantor Subsidiaries and (ii) equity in earnings from and investments in any subsidiary that is a non-guarantor (in thousands). This financial information is presented in accordance with the amended requirements of Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X. The following financial information may not necessarily be indicative of results of operations or financial position had the Guarantor Subsidiaries operated as independent entities.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We define Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Matador shareholders (“Adjusted EBITDA”) as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depletion, depreciation and amortization, accretion of asset retirement obligations, property impairments, unrealized derivative gains and losses, certain other non-cash items and non-cash stock-based compensation expense, prepayment premium on extinguishment of debt and net gain or loss on asset sales and inventory impairment. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of net income (loss) or cash flows as determined by GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management and external users of our consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies.
Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is necessary because it allows us to evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of operations from period to period without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. We exclude the items listed above from net income (loss) in calculating Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which certain assets were acquired.
Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) or net cash provided by operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP or as a primary indicator of our operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components of understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure. Our Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of another company because all companies may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner.
The following table presents our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the GAAP financial measures of net income (loss) and net cash provided by operating activities, respectively.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we reported a net loss attributable to Matador shareholders of $593.2 million, as compared to net income attributable to Matador shareholders of $87.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease primarily resulted from (i) significantly lower realized oil prices, partially offset by higher oil and natural gas production, for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, and (ii) the full-cost ceiling impairment of $684.7 million we recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, we recorded an unrealized loss on derivatives of $32.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to an unrealized loss on derivatives of $53.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, and we recorded an income tax benefit of $45.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to an income tax provision of $35.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, decreased $91.5 million to $519.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $610.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily attributable to significantly lower realized oil prices, partially offset by higher oil and natural gas production, for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
From time-to-time, we enter into off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material off-balance sheet obligations. As of December 31, 2020, the material off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions that we have entered into include (i) non-operated drilling commitments, (ii) firm gathering, transportation, processing, fractionation, sales and disposal commitments and (iii) contractual obligations for which the ultimate settlement amounts are not fixed and determinable, such as derivative contracts that are sensitive to future changes in commodity prices or interest rates, gathering, treating, transportation and disposal commitments on uncertain volumes of future throughput, open delivery commitments and indemnification obligations following certain divestitures. Other than the off-balance sheet arrangements described above, the Company has no transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or availability of or requirements for capital resources. See “-Obligations and Commitments” below and Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report for more information regarding our off-balance sheet arrangements. Such information is incorporated herein by reference.
Obligations and Commitments
We had the following material contractual obligations and commitments at December 31, 2020.
__________________
(1)The amounts included in the table above represent principal maturities only. At December 31, 2020, we had $440.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement, approximately $45.8 million in outstanding letters of credit issued pursuant to the Credit Agreement and $7.5 million in borrowings under the SBA loan. The Credit Agreement matures in October 2023. At December 31, 2020 San Mateo had $334.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the San Mateo Credit Facility and approximately $9.0 million in outstanding letters of credit issued pursuant to the San Mateo Credit Facility. The San Mateo Credit Facility matures in December 2023. Assuming the amounts outstanding and interest rates of 1.90% and 2.15%, for the Credit Agreement and the San Mateo Credit Facility, respectively, at December 31, 2020, the interest expense for such facilities is expected to be approximately $8.5 million and $7.3 million each year until maturity.
(2)The amounts included in the table above represent principal maturities only. Interest expense on the $1.05 billion of Notes that were outstanding as of December 31, 2020 is expected to be approximately $61.7 million each year until maturity.
(3)At December 31, 2020, we had outstanding commitments to drill and complete and to participate in the drilling and completion of various operated and non-operated wells.
(4)We do not own or operate our own drilling rigs, but instead we enter into contracts with third parties for such drilling rigs. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report for more information regarding these contractual commitments.
(5)The amounts included in the table above represent discounted cash flow estimates for future asset retirement obligations at December 31, 2020.
(6)From time to time, we enter into agreements with third parties whereby we commit to deliver anticipated natural gas and oil production and produced water from certain portions of our acreage for gathering, transportation, processing, fractionation, sales and disposal. Certain of these agreements contain minimum volume commitments. If we do not meet the minimum volume commitments under these agreements, we would be required to pay certain deficiency fees. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report for more information about these contractual commitments.
(7)In February 2017, in connection with the formation of San Mateo I, we dedicated our current and certain future leasehold interests in the Rustler Breaks and Wolf asset areas pursuant to 15-year, fixed-fee oil, natural gas and produced water gathering and produced water disposal agreements. In addition, effective February 1, 2017, we dedicated our current and certain future leasehold interests in the Rustler Breaks asset area pursuant to a 15-year, fixed-fee natural gas processing agreement. In February 2019, in connection with the formation of San Mateo II, we dedicated acreage in the Greater Stebbins Area and the Stateline asset area pursuant to 15-year, fixed-fee oil, natural gas and produced water gathering, natural gas processing and produced water disposal agreements. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report for more information regarding these contractual commitments.
General Outlook and Trends
Our business success and financial results are dependent on many factors beyond our control, such as economic, political and regulatory developments, as well as competition from other sources of energy. Commodity price volatility, in particular, is a significant risk to our business and results of operations. Commodity prices are affected by changes in market supply and demand, which are impacted by overall economic activity, the actions of OPEC+, the worldwide spread of COVID-19, weather, pipeline capacity constraints, inventory storage levels, oil and natural gas price differentials and other factors.
During the first quarter and through April 2020, the oil and natural gas industry witnessed an abrupt and significant decline in oil prices from $63 per Bbl in early January to as low as ($38) per Bbl in late April. This sudden decline in oil prices was attributable to two primary factors: (i) the precipitous decline in global oil demand resulting from the worldwide spread of COVID-19 and (ii) a sudden, unexpected increase in global oil supply resulting from actions initiated by Saudi Arabia to increase its oil production to world markets following the failure of efforts by members of OPEC+ to agree on coordinated production cuts at their March 6, 2020 meetings in Vienna, Austria. The sudden decline in oil prices began to improve later in the second quarter of 2020 and throughout the remainder of 2020 and into early 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2020, oil prices averaged $39.34 per Bbl, ranging from a high of $63.27 per Bbl in early January to a low of ($37.63) per Bbl in mid April, based upon the WTI oil futures contract price for the earliest delivery date.
As noted previously in this Annual Report, we significantly modified our 2020 operational plan primarily as a result of these unexpected events and the resulting decline in oil prices. We began 2020 operating six drilling rigs in the Delaware Basin but reduced our operated drilling program from six to three drilling rigs by the end of the second quarter of 2020. We operated three drilling rigs in the Delaware Basin throughout the remainder of 2020. We began 2021 operating three drilling rigs in the Delaware Basin as well, but on February 23, 2021, we announced our plans to add a fourth operated rig in March 2021. We expect to operate four drilling rigs in the Delaware Basin throughout the remainder of 2021. While oil prices have continued to improve into 2021, the general outlook for the oil and natural gas industry for the remainder of the year remains highly uncertain, and we can provide no assurances as to when or to what extent the economic disruptions resulting from COVID-19 and the corresponding decline in oil demand may improve.
We realized a weighted average oil price of $37.38 per Bbl ($39.83 per Bbl including realized gains from oil derivatives) for our oil production for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $54.34 per Bbl ($54.98 per Bbl including realized gains from oil derivatives) for the year ended December 31, 2019. At February 23, 2021, the WTI oil futures contract price for the earliest delivery date had increased from year-end 2020, closing at $61.67 per Bbl, and was higher compared to $51.43 per Bbl on February 24, 2020. Although we have been encouraged by the improved oil price environment in early 2021, we are uncertain that oil prices can remain at these levels.
Natural gas prices dropped significantly during 2019 and continued to decline during the first half of 2020 before beginning to increase during the middle of the third quarter and continuing to increase during the fourth quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2020, natural gas prices averaged $2.13 per MMBtu, as compared to $2.53 per MMBtu for the year ended December 31, 2019, based upon the NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures contract price for the earliest delivery date. During 2020, natural gas prices began the year at $2.12 per MMBtu and fell to a low of $1.48 per MMBtu at the end of June, before increasing to a high of $3.35 per MMBtu in late October and finishing the year at $2.54 per MMBtu.
We realized a weighted average natural gas price of $2.14 per Mcf (with no realized gains or losses from natural gas derivatives) for our natural gas production for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $2.17 per Mcf ($2.18 per Mcf including realized gains from natural gas derivatives) for the year ended December 31, 2019. As a two-stream reporter, the revenues associated with our NGL production are included in the weighted average natural gas price. At February 23, 2021, the NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures contract price for the earliest delivery date had increased from year-end 2020, closing at $2.88 per MMBtu, and was higher as compared to $1.83 per MMBtu at February 24, 2020. Although we have been encouraged by the improved natural gas price environment, we remain uncertain that natural gas prices can remain at these levels, particularly as we exit the winter heating season.
The prices we receive for oil, natural gas and NGLs heavily influence our revenue, profitability, cash flow available for capital expenditures, access to capital and future rate of growth. Oil, natural gas and NGL prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Historically, the markets for oil, natural gas and NGLs have been volatile, and these markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future. Declines in oil, natural gas or NGL prices not only reduce our revenues, but could also reduce the amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs we can produce economically, and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and reserves and our ability to comply with the leverage ratio covenant under our Credit Agreement. We are uncertain if oil and natural gas prices may rise from their current levels, and in fact, oil and natural gas prices may decrease in future periods. See “Risk Factors-Risks Related to our Financial Condition-Our success is dependent on the prices of oil and natural gas. Low oil and natural gas prices and the continued volatility in these prices may adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to meet our capital expenditure requirements and financial obligations.”
From time to time, we use derivative financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk associated with oil, natural gas and NGL prices. Even so, decisions as to whether, at what price and what production volumes to hedge are difficult and depend on market conditions and our forecast of future production and oil, natural gas and NGL prices, and we may not always employ the optimal hedging strategy. This, in turn, may affect the liquidity that can be accessed through the borrowing base under our Credit Agreement and through the capital markets.
The prices we receive for oil and natural gas production often reflect a discount to the relevant benchmark prices, such as the WTI oil price or the NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas price. The difference between the benchmark price and the price we receive is called a differential. At December 31, 2020, most of our oil production from the Delaware Basin was sold based on prices established in Midland, Texas, and most of our natural gas production from the Delaware Basin was sold based on Houston Ship Channel pricing, while the remainder of our Delaware Basin natural gas production was sold primarily based on prices established at the Waha hub in far West Texas.
The Midland-Cushing (Oklahoma) oil price differential has been highly volatile in recent years, but began 2020 slightly positive to the WTI oil price and remained positive through much of the first quarter. With the abrupt decline in oil prices during the first quarter of 2020, however, the Midland-Cushing (Oklahoma) oil price differential experienced significant volatility in April 2020, reaching ($6.00) per Bbl before becoming positive later in the second quarter and improving throughout the rest of 2020 and into early 2021. It is possible, however, that this differential could turn negative again at certain times in the future. At February 23, 2021, we had derivative contracts in place to mitigate our exposure to this Midland-Cushing (Oklahoma) oil price differential on a portion of our anticipated oil production for 2021 and 2022.
A portion of our Delaware Basin natural gas production is exposed to the Waha-Henry Hub basis differential, which has also been highly volatile in recent years, including times in April 2019 when natural gas was being sold at the Waha hub for negative prices as high as ($7.00) to ($9.00) per MMBtu. In early 2020, the Waha basis differential remained significant at about ($1.20) per MMBtu and continued to deteriorate. Natural gas prices at the Waha hub were negative again on certain days in April 2020. The Waha basis differential narrowed during the remainder of the second quarter. During the third quarter of 2020 and, in particular, at the beginning of October 2020, the Waha basis differential widened significantly again, including several days when natural gas was being sold at the Waha hub for negative prices, due to seasonal pipeline maintenance and other factors that reduced capacity out of the Waha hub. These capacity issues have been largely resolved and the Waha basis differential improved during the remainder of 2020 and into early 2021.
The majority of our Delaware Basin natural gas production, however, is sold at Houston Ship Channel pricing and is not exposed to Waha pricing. During 2020, we have typically realized a premium to natural gas sold at the Waha hub despite higher transportation charges incurred to transport the natural gas to the Gulf Coast. At certain times, we may also sell a portion of our
natural gas production into other markets, e.g., Southern California, to improve our realized natural gas pricing. Further, approximately 18% of our reported natural gas production for the year ended December 31, 2020 was attributable to the Haynesville and Eagle Ford shale plays, which are not exposed to Waha pricing. In addition, as a two-stream reporter, most of our natural gas volumes in the Delaware Basin are processed for NGLs, resulting in a further reduction in the reported natural gas volumes exposed to Waha pricing.
We anticipate that the volatility in these oil and natural gas price differentials could persist throughout 2021 or longer as additional oil and natural gas pipeline capacity from West Texas to the Texas Gulf Coast and other end markets is completed and as the balance between oil supply and demand is restored. We can provide no assurances as to how long these volatile differentials may persist, and as noted above, these price differentials could deteriorate in future periods. Should we experience future periods of negative pricing for natural gas as we have in previous periods, we may temporarily shut in certain high gas-oil ratio wells and take other actions to mitigate the impact on our realized natural gas prices and results of operations. In addition, we have no derivative contracts in place to mitigate our exposure to natural gas price differentials during 2021 or for future periods.
In addition to concerns regarding oil and natural gas prices and basis differentials, the destruction of global oil demand resulting from the decline in economic activity associated with COVID-19, in conjunction with the actions initiated by Saudi Arabia in March 2020 to increase its oil production to world markets, led to a significant oversupply of oil worldwide. On April 10, 2020, the members of OPEC+ (led by Saudi Arabia) reversed course and announced their intentions to reduce oil production significantly for the remainder of 2020 and into 2021 and 2022. The members of OPEC+ have generally adhered to these production cuts, which have contributed to improving oil prices, although OPEC+ may decide to eliminate or reduce such production cuts at a future meeting. It is uncertain to what degree these production cuts may restore the balance between oil supply and demand, and most oil and natural gas industry observers remain skeptical that oil prices can improve further until oil demand improves, most likely as a result of the “re-opening” of the world economy as concerns surrounding COVID-19 begin to subside.
During times of low oil prices, we may elect to shut in or curtail certain volumes of our oil production temporarily rather than sell the oil at further depressed prices. We voluntarily curtailed or shut in portions of our Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford shale oil production in May and June 2020, but these shut-in wells have since been returned to production. As most of our natural gas production in the Delaware Basin is associated with oil production, portions of our natural gas production were also curtailed or shut in. Furthermore, our Delaware Basin production in the first quarter of 2021 has also been impacted by the historically prolonged cold weather conditions experienced in New Mexico and Texas during the middle to latter portions of February. During that time, we estimate that approximately 30% of our average daily oil equivalent production was shut-in, although we continued producing and selling the majority of our oil and natural gas during this period. We have experienced minimal impact to our production volumes due to insufficient storage capacity or damage to refineries downstream of our operations as a result of this winter weather, but if we were to experience such difficulties, we may be required to shut in additional production. When shut-in wells resume production, they may not produce at their previous rates, and we may be required to expend capital to improve their production. We can provide no assurances as to whether additional portions of our production may be shut in or curtailed in the future or how long these periods may persist.
At February 23, 2021, we had not experienced material pipeline-related interruptions to our oil, natural gas or NGL production. In certain recent periods, shortages of NGL fractionation capacity were experienced by certain operators in the Delaware Basin. Although we did not encounter such fractionation capacity problems, we can provide no assurances that such problems will not arise. If we do experience any interruptions with takeaway capacity or NGL fractionation, our oil and natural gas revenues, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.
Our oil and natural gas exploration, development, production, midstream and related operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and affects our profitability. Because these laws, rules and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted and new laws, rules and regulations are proposed or promulgated, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with the laws, rules and regulations to which we are, or will become, subject. For example, although such bills have not passed, in recent years, various bills have been introduced in the New Mexico legislature proposing to add a surtax on natural gas processors and proposing to place a moratorium on, ban or otherwise restrict hydraulic fracturing, including prohibiting the injection of fresh water in such operations. In 2019, New Mexico’s governor also signed an executive order requiring a regulatory framework to ensure reductions of methane emissions. Following that executive order, the NMOCD, NMED and New Mexico legislature have proposed various rules, regulations and bills regarding the reduction of natural gas waste and the control of emissions that would, among other items, require upstream and midstream operators to reduce natural gas waste by a fixed amount each year and achieve a 98% natural gas capture rate by the end of 2026. These and other laws, rules and regulations, including any federal legislation, regulations or orders intended to limit or restrict oil and natural gas operations on federal lands, if enacted, could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In January 2021, the Biden administration issued the Biden Administration Federal Lease Orders.
The pause relating to federal oil and natural gas leases in these orders has not restricted activities on existing valid leases. As such, we have continued our operations on federal properties. However, we can provide no assurances that federal regulations will not be adopted that limit our ability to develop our federal properties. Should such actions be taken, they would almost certainly impact our 2021 and future drilling and completion plans and could materially impact our production volumes, revenues, reserves, cash flows and availability under our Credit Agreement. See “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Laws and Regulations-Approximately 28% of our leasehold and mineral acres in the Delaware Basin is located on federal lands, which are subject to administrative permitting requirements and potential federal legislation, regulation and orders that may limit or restrict oil and natural gas operations on federal lands.”
In addition, certain segments of the investor community have recently expressed negative sentiment towards investing in the oil and natural gas industry, recent equity returns in the sector versus other industry sectors have led to lower oil and natural gas representation in certain key equity market indices and some investors, including certain pension funds, university endowments and family foundations, have stated policies to reduce or eliminate their investments in the oil and natural gas sector based on social and environmental considerations.
Like other oil and natural gas producing companies, our properties are subject to natural production declines. By their nature, our oil and natural gas wells will experience rapid initial production declines. We attempt to overcome these production declines by drilling to develop and identify additional reserves, by exploring for new sources of reserves and, at times, by acquisitions. During times of severe oil, natural gas and NGL price declines, however, drilling additional oil or natural gas wells may not be economic, and we may find it necessary to reduce capital expenditures and curtail drilling operations in order to preserve liquidity. A material reduction in capital expenditures and drilling activities could materially impact our production volumes, revenues, reserves, cash flows and our availability under our Credit Agreement. See “Risk Factors-Risks Related to our Financial Condition-Our exploration, development, exploitation and midstream projects require substantial capital expenditures that may exceed our cash flows from operations and potential borrowings, and we may be unable to obtain needed capital on satisfactory terms, which could adversely affect our future growth.”
We strive to focus our efforts on increasing oil and natural gas reserves and production while controlling costs at a level that is appropriate for long-term operations. Our ability to find and develop sufficient quantities of oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs is critical to our long-term success. Future finding and development costs are subject to changes in the costs of acquiring, drilling and completing our prospects.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and reliable and that the actual results will not differ significantly from those reported; however, such estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and such risks and uncertainties could cause the actual results to differ materially from our estimates. We consider the following to be our most critical accounting policies and estimates involving significant judgment or estimates by our management. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report for further details on our accounting policies at December 31, 2020.
Oil and Natural Gas Properties
We use the full-cost method of accounting for our investments in oil and natural gas properties. Under this method of accounting, all costs associated with the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties and reserves, including unproved and unevaluated property costs, are capitalized as incurred and accumulated in a single cost center representing our activities, which are undertaken exclusively in the United States. Such costs include lease acquisition costs, geological and geophysical expenditures, lease rentals on undeveloped properties, costs of drilling both productive and non-productive wells, capitalized interest on qualifying projects and general and administrative expenses directly related to acquisition, exploration and development activities, but do not include any costs related to production, selling or general corporate administrative activities.
Capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties are amortized using the unit-of-production method based upon production and estimates of proved reserves quantities. Unproved and unevaluated property costs are excluded from the amortization base used to determine depletion. Unproved and unevaluated properties are assessed for possible impairment on a periodic basis based upon changes in operating or economic conditions. This assessment includes consideration of the following factors, among others: the assignment of proved reserves, geological and geophysical evaluations, intent to drill, remaining lease term and drilling activity and results. Upon impairment, the costs of the unproved and unevaluated properties are immediately included in the amortization base. Exploratory dry holes are included in the amortization base immediately upon the determination that the well is not productive.
Sales of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to net capitalized costs with no gain or loss recognized, unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between net capitalized costs and proved reserves
of oil and natural gas. All costs related to production activities and maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Significant workovers that increase the properties’ reserves are capitalized.
Ceiling Test
The net capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties are limited to the lower of unamortized costs less related deferred income taxes or the cost center “ceiling.” The cost center ceiling is defined as the sum of:
(a) the present value, discounted at 10%, of future net revenues of proved oil and natural gas reserves, reduced by the estimated costs of developing these reserves, plus
(b) unproved and unevaluated property costs not being amortized, plus
(c) the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved and unevaluated properties included in the costs being amortized, if any, less
(d) any income tax effects related to the properties involved.
Any excess of our net capitalized costs above the cost center ceiling as described above is charged to operations as a full-cost ceiling impairment. The fair value of our derivative instruments is not included in the ceiling test computation as we do not designate these instruments as hedge instruments for accounting purposes.
The estimated present value of after-tax future net cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves is highly dependent upon the quantities of proved reserves, the estimation of which requires substantial judgment. The associated commodity prices and the applicable discount rate used in these estimates are in accordance with guidelines established by the SEC. Under these guidelines, oil and natural gas reserves are estimated using then-current operating and economic conditions, with no provision for price and cost escalations in future periods except by contractual arrangements. Future net revenues are calculated using prices that represent the arithmetic averages of the first-day-of-the-month oil and natural gas prices for the previous 12-month period, and a 10% discount factor is used to determine the present value of future net revenues.
Because the cost center ceiling calculation is based on the average of historical prices, which may or may not be representative of future prices, and requires a 10% discount factor, the resulting estimated value may not be indicative of the fair market value of our properties. Any impairment related to the excess of our net capitalized costs above the resulting cost center ceiling should not be viewed as an absolute indicator of a reduction in the ultimate value of the related oil and natural gas reserves.
Derivative Financial Instruments
From time to time, we use derivative financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk associated with oil, natural gas and NGL prices. These instruments typically consist of put and call options in the form of costless (or zero-cost) collars and swap contracts. Costless collars provide us with downside price protection through the purchase of a put option that is financed through the sale of a call option. Because the call option proceeds are used to offset the cost of the put option, these arrangements are initially “costless” to us. Three-way costless collars also provide us with downside price protection through the purchase of a put option, but they also allow us to participate in price upside through the purchase of a call option. The purchase of both the put option and call option are financed through the sale of a call option. Because the proceeds from the call option sale are used to offset the cost of the purchased put and call options, these arrangements are also initially “costless” to us.
In the case of a costless collar, the put option and the call option or options have different fixed price components. In a swap contract, a floating price is exchanged for a fixed price over a specified period, providing downside price protection.
Prior to settlement, our derivative financial instruments are recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at fair value. We have elected not to apply hedge accounting for our existing derivative financial instruments, and as a result, we recognize the change in derivative fair value between reporting periods currently in our consolidated statements of operations. Such changes in fair value are reported under Revenues as “Unrealized gain (loss) on derivatives.” Changes in the fair value of these open derivative financial instruments can have a significant impact on our reported results from period to period but do not impact our cash flows from operations, liquidity or capital resources. The fair value of our open derivative financial instruments is determined using industry-standard models that consider various inputs including: (i) quoted forward prices for commodities, (ii) time value of money and (iii) current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures.
Realized gains and realized losses from the settlement of derivative financial instruments do have a direct impact on our cash flow from operations and liquidity. The impact of these settlements is also reported under Revenues as “Realized gain (loss) on derivatives.”
Revenue Recognition
We enter into contracts with customers to sell our oil and natural gas production. Revenue from these contracts is recognized when our performance obligations under these contracts are satisfied, which generally occurs with the transfer of control of the oil and natural gas to the purchaser. Control is generally considered transferred when the following criteria are met: (i) transfer of physical custody, (ii) transfer of title, (iii) transfer of risk of loss and (iv) relinquishment of any repurchase rights or other similar rights. Given the nature of the products sold, revenue is recognized at a point in time based on the amount of consideration we expect to receive in accordance with the price specified in the contract. Consideration under the oil and natural gas marketing contracts is typically received from the purchaser one to two months after production.
The majority of our oil marketing contracts transfer physical custody and title at or near the wellhead or a CDP, which is generally when control of the oil has been transferred to the purchaser. The majority of the oil produced is sold under contracts using market-based pricing, which price is then adjusted for differentials based upon delivery location and oil quality. To the extent the differentials are incurred at or after the transfer of control of the oil, the differentials are included in oil revenues on the statements of operations, as they represent part of the transaction price of the contract. If the differentials, or other related costs, are incurred prior to the transfer of control of the oil, those costs are included in production taxes, transportation and processing expenses on our consolidated statements of operations, as they represent payment for services performed outside of the contract with the customer.
Our natural gas is sold at the lease location, at the inlet or outlet of a natural gas processing plant or at an interconnect near a marketing hub following transportation from a processing plant. The majority of our natural gas is sold under fee-based contracts. When the natural gas is sold at the lease, the purchaser gathers the natural gas and transports the natural gas via pipeline to natural gas processing plants where, if necessary, NGLs are extracted. The NGLs and remaining residue gas are then sold by the purchaser, or if we elect to take in-kind the natural gas or NGLs, we sell the natural gas or NGLs to a third party. Under the fee-based contracts, we receive NGL and residue gas value, less the fee component, or are invoiced the fee component. To the extent control of the natural gas transfers upstream of the transportation and processing activities, revenue is recognized as the net amount received from the purchaser. To the extent that control transfers downstream of those services, revenue is recognized on a gross basis, and the related costs are included in production taxes, transportation and processing expenses on our consolidated statements of operations.
We recognize midstream services revenues at the time services have been rendered and the price is fixed and determinable. Third-party midstream services revenues are those revenues from midstream operations related to third parties, including working interest owners in our operated wells. All midstream services revenues related to our working interest are eliminated in consolidation. Since we have a right to payment from our customers in amounts that correspond directly to the value that the customer receives from the performance completed on each contract, we apply the practical expedient in Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) that allows recognition of revenue in the amount for which there is a right to invoice the customer without estimating a transaction price for each contract and allocating that transaction price to the performance obligations within each contract.
We periodically enter into natural gas purchase transactions with third parties whereby we (i) purchase the third party’s natural gas and subsequently sell the natural gas to other purchasers or (ii) process the third party’s natural gas at the Black River Processing Plant and then purchase, and subsequently sell, the residue gas and NGLs to other purchasers. Revenues and expenses from these transactions are presented on a gross basis on our consolidated statements of operations as we act as a principal in the transactions by assuming the risk and rewards of ownership, including credit risk, of the natural gas purchased and by assuming the responsibility to deliver and process the natural gas volumes to be sold.
From time to time, we, as an owner of mineral interests, may enter into or extend a lease to a third-party lessee to develop the oil and natural gas attributable to certain of our mineral interests in return for a specified payment or lease bonus. In those instances, revenue is recognized in the period when the lease is signed, and we have no further obligation to the lessee. We record these payments as “Lease bonus - mineral acreage” revenues on our consolidated statements of operations.
Stock-Based Compensation
We may grant equity-based and liability-based common stock, stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance stock units and other awards permitted under any long-term incentive plan then in effect to members of our Board of Directors and certain employees, contractors and advisors. We use the fair value method to measure and recognize the liability associated with our outstanding liability-based stock options (all of which were settled in the first quarter of 2020) and to measure and recognize the equity associated with our equity-based stock options. Stock options typically vest over three or four years, and the associated compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Restricted stock and restricted stock units typically vest over a period of one to four years, and compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period. We use our own historical volatility to estimate the future volatility of our stock.
We have adopted the “simplified method” as outlined in Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 14 for estimating the expected term of awards. The risk free interest rate is the rate for constant yield U.S. Treasury securities with a term to maturity that is consistent with the expected term of the award.
Assumptions are reviewed each time new equity-based option awards are granted and are reviewed quarterly for outstanding liability-based option awards. The assumptions used may be impacted by actual fluctuations in our stock price, movements in market interest rates and option terms. The use of different assumptions produces a different fair value for equity-based option awards and outstanding liability-based option awards and can significantly impact the amount of stock compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statement of operations or capitalized in accordance with our policy on capitalizing general and administrative expenses for employees involved in acquisition, exploration and development activities. We use the Black Scholes Merton model to determine the fair value of service-based option awards and the Monte Carlo method to determine the fair value of awards that contain a market condition. The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards is recognized based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of the grant for awards issued under the 2003 Incentive Plan and the 2012 Incentive Plan and on the trading day prior to the date of grant for awards issued under the 2019 Incentive Plan. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report for further details on our stock-based compensation at December 31, 2020.
Income Taxes
We account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting. The amount of income taxes recorded requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of federal and state taxing authorities. We have recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences, operating losses and tax carryforwards. We evaluate the probability of realizing the future benefits of our deferred tax assets and provide a valuation allowance for the portion of any deferred tax assets where the likelihood of realizing an income tax benefit in the future does not meet the more likely than not criteria for recognition.
We account for uncertainty in income taxes by recognizing the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority.
Oil and Natural Gas Reserves Quantities and Standardized Measure of Future Net Revenue
Our engineers and technical staff prepare our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and associated future net revenues. While the applicable rules allow us to disclose proved, probable and possible reserves, we have elected to present only proved reserves in this Annual Report. The applicable rules define proved reserves as the quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible-from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations-prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced, or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.
Our engineers and technical staff must make many subjective assumptions based on their professional judgment in developing reserves estimates. Reserves estimates are updated quarterly and consider recent production levels and other technical information about each well. Estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex and inexact because of the numerous uncertainties inherent in the process. The process relies on interpretations of available geological, geophysical, petrophysical, engineering and production data. The extent, quality and reliability of both the data and the associated interpretations can vary. The process also requires certain economic assumptions, including, but not limited to, oil and natural gas prices, development expenditures, operating expenses, capital expenditures and taxes. Actual future production, oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas will most likely vary from our estimates. Accordingly, reserves estimates are generally different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. Any significant variance could materially and adversely affect our future reserves estimates, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We cannot predict the amounts or timing of future reserves revisions. If such revisions are significant, they could significantly affect future amortization of capitalized costs and result in an impairment of assets that may be material. See “Risk Factors-Risks Related to our Financial Condition-Our oil and natural gas reserves are estimated and may not reflect the actual volumes of oil and natural gas we will recover, and significant inaccuracies in these reserves estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves” and “Risk Factors-Risks Related to our Financial Condition-We may be required to write down the carrying value of our proved properties under accounting rules, and these write-downs could adversely affect our financial condition.”
Leases
On January 1, 2019, the Company began recording in the consolidated balance sheet certain of the Company’s compressor leases, drilling rig leases and office leases, which were previously considered operating leases and not reported on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The present value of the related lease payments is recorded as a liability and an equal amount is capitalized as a right of use asset on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. Right of use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. The Company’s estimated incremental borrowing rate, determined at the lease commencement date using the Company’s average secured borrowing rate, is used to calculate present value. For these purposes, the lease term includes options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such option. Leases with terms of 12 months or less at inception are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet unless there is a significant cost to terminate the lease, including the cost of removal of the leased asset. As the Company is the responsible party under these arrangements, the Company records the resulting assets and liabilities on a gross basis in its consolidated balance sheets.
