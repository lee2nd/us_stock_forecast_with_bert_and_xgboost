Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Form 10-K including, without limitation, statements under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” regarding the Company’s financial position, business strategy and the plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. When used in this Form 10-K, words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend” and similar expressions, as they relate to us or the Company’s management, identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, the Company’s management. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Report. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
Overview
We are a blank check company incorporated on June 24, 2020 as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. We intend to effectuate our business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of securities that occurred in private placements simultaneously with the completion of our initial public offering, our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt.
The issuance of additional shares of our stock in a business combination:
· may significantly dilute the equity interest of investors, which dilution would increase if the anti-dilution provisions in the Class B common stock resulted in the issuance of Class A shares on a greater than one-to-one basis upon conversion of the Class B common stock;
· may subordinate the rights of holders of our common stock if preferred stock is issued with rights senior to those afforded our common stock;
· could cause a change in control if a substantial number of shares of our common stock are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors;
· may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the stock ownership or voting rights of a person seeking to obtain control of us; and
· may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our Class A common stock and/or warrants.
Similarly, if we issue debt securities or otherwise incur significant indebtedness, it could result in:
· default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after a business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations;
· acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;
· our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand;
· our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt security is outstanding;
· our inability to pay dividends on our common stock;
· using a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our common stock if declared, our ability to pay expenses, make capital expenditures and acquisitions, and fund other general corporate purposes;
· limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate;
· increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation;
· limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, and execution of our strategy; and
· other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt.
We expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete a business combination will be successful.
Recent Developments
On February 9, 2021, the Company entered into a business combination agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”) with the Opportunity Financial, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“OppFi”), OppFi Shares, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“OFS”), and Todd Schwartz, in his capacity as the Members’ Representative (in such capacity, the “Members’ Representative”). Upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, the Company will change its name to “OppFi Inc.”
Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set forth therein, at the time of the closing of the business combination (the “Closing”), (x) in exchange for common units of OppFi (the “OppFi Units”), the Company will contribute to OppFi cash (the “Cash Consideration”) and the number of shares of newly issued Class V common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (the “Class V Voting Stock”) equal to the number of Retained OppFi Units (as defined below), which will entitle its holder to one vote per share but no right to dividends or distributions and (y) immediately thereafter, OppFi will distribute to OFS the shares of Class V Voting Stock received by OppFi.
At the Closing, OppFi will transfer to the Company a number of OppFi Units equal to the number of shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing (after giving effect to any Company stockholder redemptions and the Class B Common Stock Conversion (as defined below)). The members of OppFi (“Members”) will, immediately following the Closing, retain an aggregate number of OppFi Units (such OppFi Units retained by the Members, the “Retained OppFi Units”) equal to (i) (A) OppFi’s equity value (i.e., $743,000,000), plus (B) the Company Cash Amount (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement), plus (C) the amount by which the Working Capital (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) is greater than the Target Working Capital Amount (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement), if any, minus (D) the amount by which the Working Capital is less than the Target Working Capital Amount, minus (E) the Cash Consideration, divided by (ii) $10.
In connection with the Closing, on the date of the Closing (the “Closing Date”), 25,500,000 Retained OppFi Units (the “Earnout Units”) held by the Members and an equal number of shares of Class V Voting Stock issued to the Members by the Company in connection with the business combination and held by OFS, will be subject to certain restrictions and potential forfeiture pending the achievement (if any) of certain earnout targets pursuant to the terms of the Business Combination Agreement.
Following the Closing, the combined Company will be organized in an “Up-C” structure in which substantially all of the assets and the business of the combined Company will be held by OppFi and its subsidiaries, and the Company’s only direct assets will consist of OppFi Units. Assuming that none of the Company’s current stockholders exercise their right to redeem their Class A Common Stock, and subject to adjustment for cash on hand and working capital, as of immediately following the Closing and without giving effect to the Earnout Units or outstanding warrants to purchase Class A Common Stock, the Company is expected to own, directly or indirectly, approximately 38% of the OppFi Units and will control OppFi as the sole manager of OppFi in accordance with the terms of the OppFi A&R LLCA (as defined and discussed below) and all remaining OppFi Units will be owned by the Members.
In connection with the Closing, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of Company, dated as of September 29, 2020 (the “Current Certificate of Incorporation”), and the Amended Sponsor Letter (as defined below), all then-outstanding shares of Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (the “Class B Common Stock”) will be converted into shares of Class A Common Stock (after giving effect to the Amended Sponsor Letter (as defined below)) on a one-for-one basis and into an aggregate number of 5,943,750 shares of Class A Common Stock (the “Class B Common Stock Conversion”).
Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, the “Cash Consideration” will be equal to (i) the cash remaining in the Company’s trust account as of immediately prior to the Closing following any redemptions of Class A Common Stock by the Company’s current stockholders, less (ii) the amount by which (a) the aggregate amount of transaction expenses incurred by the parties to the Business Combination Agreement as of the Closing and $15,000,000, exceed (b) the amount of all cash, cash equivalents, deposits and marketable securities held by OppFi on the Closing Date (such amount, as adjusted, the “Available Closing Date Cash”).
Beginning on the six month anniversary of the Closing, each Retained OppFi Unit held by the Members may be exchanged, subject to certain conditions, for either one share of Class A Common Stock or, at the election of the Company in its capacity as the sole manager of OppFi, the cash equivalent of the market value of one share of Class A Common Stock, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the OppFi A&R LLCA (such exchange rights, as further described in the OppFi A&R LLCA, the “Exchange Rights”). For each Retained OppFi Unit so exchanged, one share of the Class V Voting Stock will be canceled by the Company.
Representations, Warranties and Covenants
The parties to the Business Combination Agreement have agreed to customary representations and warranties for transactions of this type. The representations and warranties made under the Business Combination Agreement will not survive the Closing, other than claims against a party that committed fraud with respect to the making of its applicable representation and warranty. In addition, the parties to the Business Combination Agreement agreed to be bound by certain customary covenants for transactions of this type, including, among others, covenants with respect to the conduct of OppFi, the Company and their respective subsidiaries during the period between execution of the Business Combination Agreement and the Closing. The covenants made under the Business Combination Agreement will not survive the Closing, unless by their terms, they are to be performed in whole or in part after the Closing. Each of the parties to the Business Combination Agreement has agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Business Combination to be consummated after the date of the execution of the Business Combination Agreement in the most expeditious manner practicable.
Conditions to Closing
Under the Business Combination Agreement, the obligations of the parties (or, in some cases, some of the parties) to consummate the Business Combination are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary closing conditions of the respective parties, including, without limitation: (i) the approval and adoption of the Business Combination Agreement and transactions contemplated thereby and certain other matters by requisite vote of the Company’s stockholders (the “Company Stockholder Approval”); (ii) if required, the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended; (iii) the absence of a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) since the date of the Business Combination Agreement; and (iv) material compliance by the parties with their respective pre-Closing and Closing obligations and the accuracy of each party’s representations and warranties in the Business Combination Agreement, in each case subject to the certain materiality standards contained in the Business Combination Agreement. In addition, OppFi’s obligation to consummate the Business Combination is subject to the condition that the Company have at least $200,000,000 of Available Closing Date Cash at the Closing.
Termination
The Business Combination Agreement may be terminated under certain customary and limited circumstances at any time prior to the Closing, including only as follows, (i) upon the mutual written consent of the Company and OppFi; (ii) by the Company or OppFi if any applicable law or final, non-appealable Order (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) is in effect making the consummation of the Business Combination illegal; (iii) by the Company or OppFi if the Closing has not occurred by the Outside Date (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement); or (iv) by the Company, on the one hand, or OppFi, on the other hand, as a result of certain breaches by the counterparties to the Business Combination Agreement that remain uncured after any applicable cure period provided in each case (i)-(iv) that such termination right is not available to the applicable party if such party exercising the right is in breach of its representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations under the Business Combination Agreement.
Other Agreements
The Business Combination Agreement contemplates the execution of various additional agreements and instruments, on or before the Closing, including, among others, the following:
Tax Receivable Agreement
Simultaneously with the Closing, the Company, OppFi, the Members and the Members’ Representative will enter into a tax receivable agreement (the “Tax Receivable Agreement”), which will provide for, among other things, payment by the Company to the Members of 90% of the U.S. federal, state and local income tax savings realized by the Company as a result of the increases in tax basis and certain other tax benefits related to the transactions contemplated under the Business Combination Agreement and the exchange of Retained OppFi Units for Class A Common Stock (as more fully described in the Tax Receivable Agreement).
Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company and Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company
In connection with the Closing, the Company will amend and restate (i) subject to receipt of Company Stockholder Approval, its current Certificate of Incorporation by adopting the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the “Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation”) and (ii) the current Bylaws of the Company by adopting the Amended and Restated Bylaws of Company (the “A&R Bylaws”), to establish a structure containing Class A Common Stock, which will carry such economic and voting rights as set forth in the Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation and A&R Bylaws, and Class V Voting Stock, which will carry only such voting rights as set forth in the Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation and A&R Bylaws (as more fully described in the Second A&R Certificate of Incorporation and A&R Bylaws).
Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of OppFi
At the Closing, the Company, OppFi and the Members will enter into the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of OppFi (the “OppFi A&R LLCA”), which will, among other things, permit the issuance and ownership of OppFi Units as contemplated to be issued and owned upon the consummation of the business combination, designate the Company as the sole manager of OppFi, provide for the Exchange Rights, otherwise amend and restate the rights and preferences of the OppFi Units and set forth the rights and preferences of the OppFi Units, and establish the ownership of the OppFi Units by the persons or entities indicated in the OppFi A&R LLCA, in each case, as more fully described in the OppFi A&R LLCA.
Amendment to the Sponsor Letter
In connection with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, certain current officers and directors of the Company (including the Founder Holders (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement)), FG New America Investors LLC, the Company, OppFi and the Members’ Representative have entered into an amendment (the “Amended Sponsor Letter”) to a letter agreement entered into on September 29, 2020 in connection with the Company’s initial public offering (the “Letter Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, the Founder Holders agreed to waive any and all anti-dilution rights described in its current Certificate of Incorporation or otherwise with respect to the shares of Class A Common Stock (that formerly constituted shares of Class B Common Stock held by the Founder Holders) held by the Founder Holders that may be implicated by the business combination such that the Class B Common Stock Conversion will occur as discussed herein (and as more fully described in the Amended Sponsor Letter).
Investor Rights Agreement
At the Closing, the Company, the Founder Holders, the Members, the Members’ Representative and certain other parties will enter into an Investor Rights Agreement (the “Investor Rights Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, (i) the Company, the Founder Holders and certain other parties will terminate the Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of September 29, 2020, entered into by them in connection with the Company’s initial public offering, (ii) the Members’ Representative will have the right to nominate five directors to the board of directors of the Company, subject to certain independence and holdings requirements, (iii) the Company will provide certain registration rights for the shares of Class A Common Stock held by the Members, the Sponsor, and certain other parties, and (iv) a certain Founder Holder and the Members will agree not to transfer, sell, assign or otherwise dispose of the shares of Class A Common Stock and the OppFi Units held by such Founder Holder or such Members, as applicable, for twenty-four months and nine months, respectively, following the Closing, subject to certain exceptions, in each case as more fully described in the Investor Rights Agreement.
Results of Operations
We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities through December 31, 2020 were organizational activities, including those necessary to prepare for the initial public offering and identifying a target company for a business combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our business combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses in connection with completing a business combination.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred net loss of $185,637, which consisted of $191,470 in operating expenses, offset by $5,833 investment income earned in trust account.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
On October 2, 2020, we consummated the initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 22,500,000 units (“Units”), at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $225 million. On October 14, 2020, we consummated the closing of the sale of 1,275,000 additional Units upon receiving notice of the underwriters’ election to partially exercise their overallotment option (the “over-allotment”), generating additional gross proceeds of approximately $12.8 million.
Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, on October 2, 2020, the Company completed the private sale to FG New America Investors LLC (“Sponsor”) of an aggregate of (i) 462,500 units (the “Private Placement Units”) at a purchase price of $10.00 per Private Placement Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $4,625,000, (ii) 3,848,750 warrants (the “$11.50 Exercise Price Warrants”) at a purchase price of $1.00 per $11.50 Exercise Price Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $3,848,750 and (ii) 1,512,500 warrants (the “$15 Exercise Price Warrants” and together with the $11.50 Exercise Price Warrants, the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a purchase price of $0.10 per $15 Exercise Price Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $151,250. In addition, simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company completed the private placement of an aggregate of 112,500 units (the “Underwriter Units”), to the underwriters. In connection with the partial exercise of underwriters’ over-allotment option on October 14, 2020, the Company also issued an additional 6,375 Underwriter Units to the underwriters.
Following the closing of the IPO and the private placements of Private Placement Warrants and Private Placement Units on October 2, 2020, as well as the closing of the over-allotment option on October 14, 2020, an amount of $243,375,000 from the net proceeds of the sale of Units in the IPO (including proceeds from the partial exercise of the over-allotment option) and the sale of Private Placement Warrants and Private Placement Units was placed in the trust account.
For the period from June 24, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2020, cash used in operating activities was $278,454, consisting primarily of net loss of $185,637 and change in operating assets and liabilities which include, increase in prepaid expenses by $228,465 and increase in account payable by $135,648.
We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the trust account (excluding deferred underwriting fees) to complete our business combination. To the extent that our capital stock or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the trust account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies.
As of December 31, 2020, we had cash of 1,137,685 held outside the trust account. We intend to use the funds held outside the trust account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete a business combination.
In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a business combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete a business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that a business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such working capital loans may be convertible into $11.50 Exercise Price Warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender.
We do not believe we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business through October 2, 2022. However, if our estimates of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our business combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our business combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of public shares upon completion of our business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. In addition, we intend to target businesses larger than we could acquire with the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the Private Placement Units and Private Placement Warrants and may as a result be required to seek additional financing to complete such proposed initial business combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. In addition, following our business combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations.
Off-balance sheet financing arrangements
We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2020. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets.
Contractual obligations
We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities other than an administrative agreement to reimburse the Sponsor for office space, secretarial and administrative services provided to members of the Company’s management team by the Sponsor, members of the Sponsor, and the Company’s management team or their affiliates in an amount not to exceed $10,000 per month in the event such space and/or services are utilized and the Company does not pay a third party directly for such services, from the date of closing of the IPO. Upon completion of a business combination or the Company’s liquidation, the Company will cease paying these monthly fees.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We had identified the following as its critical accounting policies:
Basis of presentation
The accompanying financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars and conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.
Emerging growth company
The Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.
Cash and cash equivalents
The Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company did not have any cash equivalents as of December 31, 2020.
Common stock subject to possible redemption
The Company accounts for its common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.” Common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that features redemption rights that is either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company’s control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders’ equity. The Company’s common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company’s control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, at December 31, 2020, common stock subject to possible redemption is presented as temporary equity at redemption value, outside of the stockholders’ equity section of the Company’s balance sheet.
Offering costs
Offering costs consist of underwriting, legal, accounting and other expenses incurred through the balance sheet date that are directly related to the IPO and that are charged to shareholders equity upon the completion of the IPO. Offering costs amounting to $1,608,028 (including $1,000,000 of underwriting fees) were charged to shareholders’ equity upon the completion of IPO. In addition, underwriters also received 118,875 Underwriter Units, with such Underwriter Units restricted from sale until the closing of the business combination and with no redemption rights from the trust account.
Income taxes
The Company complies with the accounting and reporting requirements of ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes,” which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in future taxable or deductible amounts, based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
ASC Topic 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, as income tax expense. There were no unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2020 and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. The Company is subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities since inception.
Net loss per share
Net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, excluding shares of common stock subject to forfeiture. As of December 31, 2020, weighted average shares were reduced for the effect of an aggregate of 525,000 shares that were forfeited by our initial stockholders due to partial the over-allotment exercised by the underwriters.
Fair value of financial instruments
The fair value of the Company’s assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurement,” approximates the carrying amounts represented in the accompanying balance sheet, primarily due to their short-term nature.
Recently issued accounting standards
Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.
