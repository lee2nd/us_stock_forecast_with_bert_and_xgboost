Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation
The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes, and other financial information included in this Form 10-K.
Our Management’s Discussion and Analysis contains not only statements that are historical facts, but also statements that are forward-looking. Words such as “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “potential,” “believes,” “seeks,” “hopes,” “estimates,” “should,” “may,” “will,” “with a view to” and variations of these words or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Forward-looking statements are, by their very nature, uncertain and risky. These risks and uncertainties include international, national, and local general economic and market conditions; our ability to sustain, manage, or forecast growth; our ability to successfully make and integrate acquisitions; new product development and introduction; existing government regulations and changes in, or the failure to comply with, government regulations; adverse publicity; competition; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; change in business strategy or development plans; business disruptions; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the ability to protect technology; the risk of foreign currency exchange rates; and other risks that might be detailed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Although the forward-looking statements in this Report reflect the good faith judgment of our management, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known by them. Consequently, and because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements. You are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report as we attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and prospects.
Overview
Our Company is a provider of health and nutritional supplements and personal care products. Currently, we are mainly selling our products over the Internet directly to end-user customers through our websites, www.dailynu.com and www.merionus.com, and to wholesale distributors through phone and electronic communication. Our major customers of our nutritional and beauty products are located in the Asian market, predominantly in the People’s Republic of China. Our major customers of our OEM and packaging products are located in the United States.
Since June 2014, we have sold our products primarily over the Internet directly to end-user customers and by phone/email orders directly to our wholesale distributors. Certain miscellaneous sales are made directly to customers who walk into the Company offices and customers who call the Company directly for products. We are now focusing on selling health and nutritional supplements and personal care products directly on the internet through our websites, www.dailynu.com and www.merionus.com. As of the date of filing of this report, we market ten individual nutritional supplement products, three and four of which were introduced in 2018 and 2019 respectively, and one beauty product, which was also introduced in 2018, on our websites. We are no longer selling similar products of third parties on our websites.
In January 2018, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with SUSS Technology Corporation, a Nevada corporation (the “Seller”), pursuant to which the Seller agreed to sell to the Company substantially all of the assets associated with the Seller’s manufacture of dietary supplements (the “Asset Sale”) for an aggregate purchase price (the “Purchase Price”) of $1,000,000 and 1,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Purchase Shares”) valued at $320,000. The Seller was one of our major suppliers during the year ended December 31, 2017. Upon purchasing these assets from the Seller, we started to manufacture some of the nutritional supplements that we sell. These assets meet all industry nutritional and dietary supplement manufacturing standards, including U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Good Manufacturing Practice compliance and Current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations. In addition to manufacturing the nutritional supplements that we sell, we produce hard capsules, tablets, solid beverages (sachet packaging), teabags, powder, granules, dietary supplements, softgel capsules and health foods from these assets for any potential new customers who need such products. These are the products that were added to our existing products, as a part of our OEM and packaging businesses.
In January 2018, we introduced a new beauty product, Noir Naturel, a gentle formula for grey coverage from the first application into hair care.
In September 2018, we introduced three different types of natural aphrodisiac supplements, Viwooba (1-3) for men that may support kidney health, improve immunity, enhance physical fitness, eliminate fatigue, improve sexual desire and enhance body energy, strength and sexual ability.
In March 2019, we introduced 1) Lady-S, a female dietary supplement that may assist with weight loss, 2) Gold King, a nutritional supplement that may provide antioxidant support and liver health, 3) New Power, a nutritional supplement that may support heart health, and 4) Taibao, a nutritional supplement that may enhance physical performance and energy metabolism.
In December 2019, we introduced ReMage Power, a nutritional supplement that may provide anti-aging Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ support and promote energy & cell metabolism.
Principal Factors Affecting Our Financial Performance
We believe consumers have become more confident in ordering products like ours over the internet. However, the nutritional supplement and skin care products e-commerce markets have been, and continue to be, increasingly competitive and are rapidly evolving due to the reasons discussed below.
Barriers to entry are minimal in the nutritional supplement and skin care businesses, and current and new competitors can launch new websites at a relatively low cost. Many competitors in this area have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. Continued advancement in technology, and increased access to that technology, is paving the way for growth in direct marketing. We also face competition for consumers from retailers, duty-free retailers, specialty stores, department stores and specialty and general merchandise catalogs, many of which have greater financial and marketing resources than we have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we believe that we are well-positioned within the Asian consumer market with our current plan of supplying American merchandise to consumers in Asia. There can be no assurance that we will maintain or increase our competitive position or that we will continue to provide only American-made merchandise.
As COVID-19 has limited the global travels and import goods, we moved our focus on local OEM and packaging business and it became our majority revenue source in the fiscal year of 2020. The loss of one or more of our local OEM and packaging customers could result in a potential loss of sales and have a negative effect on our operations if we cannot find one or more substitutes.
Our products are sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels, and demand tends to decline or grow more slowly during economic downturns, including downturns in any of our major markets. The global economy is currently undergoing a period of downturn now due to COVID-19, and the future economic environment continues to remain uncertain. This has led, and could further lead, to reduced consumer spending, which may include spending on nutritional and beauty products and other discretionary items. The increase of trade tensions between US and China and the spread of COVID-19 have and might continue to have negative impacts on our business. The reduced consumer spending may force us and our competitors to lower prices. These conditions may adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.
Coronavirus (COVID-19)
At the end of 2019, there was an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) in China, which has spread rapidly to many parts of the world, including the U.S. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The pandemic has resulted in quarantines, travel restrictions, and the temporary closure of office buildings and facilities in China and in the U.S. The economic impact of the coronavirus or COVID-19 in both China and the U.S have significantly impacted our business and resulting in lesser demand from our customers.
Our headquarters are located in California and were closed from March 19, 2020 to June 9, 2020. Due to the recent surge of new Covid-19 cases in California, our offices were closed again from July 16, 2020 to September 16, 2020 and our employees worked remotely from home during these periods. Our offices have been reopened since September 16, 2020. Our manufacturing facility is located in Nevada and partially suspended its operations from March 23, 2020 to April 1, 2020 due to lack of raw materials and it has been operating normally since April 1, 2020. Substantially all of our product sales revenues are generated in China and all of our OEM and packaging revenues are generated in the U.S. Consequently, our results of operations have been and will continue be materially adversely affected, to the extent that COVID-19 harms the Chinese and U.S. economy. Any potential impact to our results will depend on, to a large extent, future developments and new information that may emerge regarding the duration and severity of COVID-19 and the actions taken by government authorities and other entities in China and U.S. to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, almost all of which are beyond our control.
Although we expect that our health supplement products and our OEM/packaging services will still be in demand due to awareness of the importance of health growing along with the realities of COVID-19, the global economy has been and may continue to be negatively affected by COVID-19 and there is continued uncertainty about the duration and intensity of the impact of COVID-19. Many of our customers are individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which may not have strong cash flows or be well capitalized, and may be vulnerable to a pandemic outbreak and slowing macroeconomic conditions. If the SMEs cannot weather COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic impact, or cannot resume business as usual after a prolonged outbreak, our revenues and business operations may be materially and adversely impacted.
While the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, COVID-19 may be difficult to assess or predict, a widespread pandemic could result in significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing the Company’s ability to access capital, which could negatively affect the Company’s liquidity.
Substantially all of our revenues are concentrated in China and the United States. Consequently, the COVID-19 outbreak has and may continue to materially adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and operating results, including but not limited to the material negative impact to our production and delivery of our products, revenues and collection of accounts receivable and the additional allowance for doubtful accounts. The situation remains highly uncertain for any further outbreak or resurgence of the COVID-19. It is therefore difficult for the Company to estimate the impact on our business or operating results that might be adversely affected by any further outbreak or resurgence of COVID-19 for the year of 2021.
In addition, due to the of COVID-19 going around the world and some of the Company’s raw materials sourced from outside of the United States, the raw material supplies have been and might continue to be negatively impacted and due to increased shipping costs and shortage of raw materials around the world. Consequently, the COVID-19 outbreak has and may continue to materially adversely affect the Company’s business operations, financial condition and operating results for 2021, including but not limited to the shortage of raw materials, delay of shipment, and increased price of raw materials for the Company’s products.
Because of the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak, the overall financial impact for 2021 cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Our total revenues in 2020 were lower as compared to the same period of 2019.
Looking ahead, we understand that these unprecedented times will have a financial impact to some of our customers, and might potentially cause loss of certain existing customers. Our plan has been to promote the awareness of the importance of health and our health supplement products, which in term might build sales with new customers to offset the loss of any of our existing customers.
As COVID-19 continues to impact global business, the U.S. government established relief programs for small business such as the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program (“EIDL”). We received a PPP loan of $131,100 and EIDL loan of $150,000 to help fund our operation in 2020. The PPP loan was fully forgiven by the SBA administration in January 2021.
Results of Operations
Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019
Total sales decreased by approximately $1,369,000, or 75.7%, from approximately $1,808,000 in the year ended December 31, 2019 to approximately $439,000 in the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease of sales was mainly due to lesser demand from our customers resulting from the negative economic impact of the coronavirus or COVID-19 in both China and the U.S.
The cost of sales increased by approximately $166,000, or 57.8%, from approximately $288,000 in the year ended December 31, 2019 to approximately $454,000 in the year ended December 31, 2020. The main reason for the increase was due to the increase of OEM and packaging costs of approximately $130,000, which is in line with this type of revenue, the increase of inventory write-down of approximately $36,000 due to obsolescence, and the increase of idle capacity costs of approximately $71,000 as we were operating under capacity during the year ended December 31, 2020, due to the negative impact of COVID-19 pandemic.
Our overall gross margin (loss) percentage decreased from approximately 84.1% in the year ended December 31, 2019 to approximately (3.5) % in the year ended December 31, 2020, mainly due to the decrease of sales in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 while we were still incurring significant overhead cost in our factory which we operated under idle capacity. The decrease in overall gross margin percentage was also due to the inventory obsolescence write-down.
Our product sales gross margin (loss) percentage decreased from approximately 93.1% in the year ended December 31, 2019 to approximately 48.8% in the year ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the majority of our product sales were attributable to our Cell Power, Viwooba (1-3), OPC Spa, Lady-S, Gold King, New Power, Taibao and Remage Power products, which were all manufactured by us. For the year ended December 31, 2020, in additional to our own manufacturing products, we sold two new supplements products that promote brain health and anti-aging that were manufactured by the third-party manufactures. The main reason for the decrease of sales gross margin percentage was due to our majority sales in 2019 are self-manufactured products which has a higher profit margin and some of our product sales in 2020 had a lower profit margin as we did not manufacture these products.
Our OEM and packaging sales gross margin percentage decreased from approximately 51.1% in the year ended December 31, 2019 to approximately 29.2% in the year ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had incurred more manufacturing overhead costs for our OEM and packaging sales with additional labor hours being allocated to such production due to more production procedures for certain products as compared to the same period in 2019. As a result, our OEM and packaging sales gross margin percentage decreased by 21.9% during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019.
Selling expenses decreased from approximately $165,000 in the year ended December 31, 2019 to approximately $48,000 in the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease of approximately $117,000, or 70.9%, was mainly due to the decrease of approximately $118,000 of marketing expenses as we have limited our global business marketing and traveling due to COVID-19.
General and administrative (“G&A”) expenses decreased by approximately $66,000 from approximately $1,411,000 in the year ended December 31, 2019 to approximately $1,345,000 in the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was mainly attributable to the decrease of approximately $30,000 of professional expenses, such as attorney fees, auditor fees and consulting fees, the decrease of approximately $99,000 of payroll and benefit expenses and the decrease of approximately $12,000 of bad debt expense, the decrease of $25,000 of other miscellaneous G&A expenses such as insurance expenses, meals and entertainment and storage expenses as we temporarily closed our California office due COVID-19 outbreak from March 19, 2020 to June 9, 2020 and again from July 16, 2020 to September 16, 2020, offset by the increase of approximately $100,000 of rent expense of our training center in New York.
Stock compensation expenses decreased by approximately $436,000 from approximately $857,000 in the year ended December 31, 2019 to approximately $421,000 in the year ended December 31, 2020. In March 2019, we issued 1,000,000 shares of our common stock to an advisor to provide certain business and financial operation and planning consultation services, and amortized such cost, which was $445,000 and $125,000 during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. We also issued shares of our common stock to other financial advisors which resulted in approximately $157,000 of stock compensation expense during the year ended December 31, 2019. Approximately $255,000 and $296,000, related to the amortization of the value of 2,300,000 shares of restricted common stock issued to three employees for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively, which all have a vesting period of three years.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we traded in one of our vehicles which resulted in a gain of $16,000.
Other income decreased by approximately $196,000 from approximately $192,000 of other income in the year ended December 31, 2019 to approximately $4,000 of other expense in the year ended December 31, 2020, mainly due to the decrease of approximately $241,000 of gain on debt settlement as we were able to negotiate a higher conversion with our debtor as compared to our closing stock price as of the conversion date in 2019, the decrease of approximately $27,000 of other income and the increase of approximately $59,000 of interest expenses, offset by approximately $131,000 of gain on forgiveness of loan payable.
Net loss increased by approximately $1.1 million from approximately $0.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 to approximately $1.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, mainly due to the reasons discussed above.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, we had a cash balance of approximately $10,000, compared to a cash balance of approximately $9,000 at December 31, 2019.
In assessing our liquidity, we monitor and analyze our cash on-hand and our operating and capital expenditure commitments. Our liquidity needs are to meet our working capital requirements, operating expenses and capital expenditure obligations. Other than operating expenses and current liabilities of approximately $0.9 million, the Company does not have significant cash commitments. Cash requirements include cash needed for purchase of inventory, payroll, payroll taxes, rent, and other operating expenses. However, in response to the liquidity factors described above, the Company has continued to find ways to reduce its operating expenses. In addition, should our Company need funds, our principal shareholder and Chief Executive and Financial Officer Mr. Dinghua Wang may lend additional money to the Company from time to time to the extent he is in a position and willing to do so. No assurance can be provided that he will continue to lend funds to the Company in the future.
Management has concluded under U.S. GAAP that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as a result of our lack of significant revenue and sufficient working capital. If we are unable to generate significant revenue or secure financing, we may be required to cease or limit our operations. Our financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash used in operating activities amounted to approximately $990,000 as compared to approximately $1,444,000 used in operating activities in the same period in 2019. Cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to the result of our approximately $1.8 million net loss, non-cash transaction of approximately $16,000 from gain on disposal of equipment and approximately $131,000 from gain on forgiveness of loan payable, the increase of accounts receivable of approximately $64,000, the increase of prepaid expenses of approximately $167,000 and the payment of lease liabilities of approximately $177,000 as we paid for our lease obligations when they become due. This amount was partially offset by the non-cash expense of approximately $421,000 in stock based compensation, approximately $59,000 of depreciation expense, approximately $190,000 in amortization of operating leases right-of-use assets, approximately $29,000 of bad debt expense, approximately $49,000 of inventory write-down, the decrease of inventories of approximately $36,000, the increase of accounts payable and accrued expenses of approximately $103,000 and increase of deferred revenue of approximately $497,000.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, financing activities provided approximately $990,000 as compared to approximately $1,158,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019. Net cash received in the year ended December 31, 2020 includes approximately $1.1 million from the issuance of common stock and collection of our stock subscriptions receivable, approximately $10,000 from a third party loan, and approximately $281,000 from SBA loans. These amounts were partially offset by our net repayments to our principal shareholder and Chief Executive and Financial Officer, Mr. Dinghua Wang of approximately $382,000, repayment of third party loans of approximately $10,000 and principal payments of our long-term debt of approximately $13,000.
The material terms of the loans from our principal shareholder and Chief Executive and Financial Officer, Mr. Dinghua Wang, certain related parties and certain unaffiliated third parties are set forth in Note 6 and Note 7 of the accompanying notes to financial statements.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to our stockholders.
