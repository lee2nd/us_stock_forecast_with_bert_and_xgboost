Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
You should read the following discussion in conjunction with Item 1. Business, Item 1A. Risk Factors, and our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.
Overview
We are one of the largest automotive franchises in the United States and were ranked #252 on the Fortune 500 in 2020. As of February 19, 2021, we offered 33 brands of new vehicles and all brands of used vehicles in 210 stores in the United States and online at over 200 websites. We offer a wide range of products and services including new and used vehicles, finance and insurance products and automotive repair and maintenance.
REGIONAL REACH & DENSITY MAP
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we had net income of $470.3 million, or $19.53 per diluted share, compared to net income of $271.5 million, or $11.60 per diluted share, during 2019. We experienced growth of revenue and gross profit in all major business lines in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily driven by increases in volume related to acquisitions, complimented by organic growth in used vehicles, finance and insurance and service, body and parts sales. On a same store basis, new vehicle revenues and gross profits experienced headwinds with plateauing national new vehicle sales and declining manufacturer incentives. For the year ended December 31, 2020, new vehicle sales accounted for approximately 52% of our revenue and approximately 21% of our gross profit. Used vehicle retail sales accounted for approximately 31% of our revenue and approximately 20% of our gross profit. Our parts and service and finance and insurance operations accounted for approximately 15% of our revenue and contributed approximately 58% of our gross profit.
As of December 31, 2020, we had available liquidity of $1.4 billion, which was comprised of $160.2 million in cash and $1.2 billion availability on our credit facilities and unfloored new vehicle inventory. In addition, our unfinanced real estate could provide additional liquidity of approximately $471 million. For further discussion of our liquidity, please refer to “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below.
Results of Operations
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we reported net income of $470.3 million, or $19.53 per diluted share. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we reported net income of $271.5 million, or $11.60 per diluted share, and $265.7 million, or $10.86 per diluted share, respectively.
Same Store Operating Data
We believe that same store comparisons are an important indicator of our financial performance. Same store measures demonstrate our ability to grow operations in our existing locations. Therefore, we have integrated same store measures into the discussion below.
Same store measures reflect results for stores that were operating in each comparison period, and only include the months when operations occurred in both periods. For example, a store acquired in November 2019 would be included in same store operating data beginning in December 2020, after its first complete comparable month of operations. The fourth quarter operating results for the same store comparisons would include results for that store in only the period of December for both comparable periods.
New Vehicles
Under our business strategy, we believe that our new vehicle sales create incremental profit opportunities through certain manufacturer incentive programs, provide used vehicle inventory through trade-ins, arranging of third party financing, vehicle service and insurance contracts, future resale of used vehicles acquired through trade-in and parts and service work.
During 2020, volumes were impacted by shelter in place policies and restrictions enacted by various states, counties and local governments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout the year, the impact of the pandemic on each of our markets varied. We experienced initial declines of approximately 50% on average in late March and early April. In our most restrictive states, such as Pennsylvania and Vermont, our locations had few or no sales during those weeks. As restrictions eased during the second quarter, new vehicle sales began to improve with period over period declines gradually decreasing.
The decrease in same store new vehicle revenues for 2020 compared to 2019 was driven by the decrease in unit volume of 14.0%, partially offset by an increase in average selling prices of 5.6%. As the national new vehicle market plateaus, our stores focus on improving gross profit per new vehicle sold. On a same store basis, gross profit per new vehicle increased 28.3% during 2020 compared to 2019. Our recently acquired stores are also focused on improving gross profit per new vehicle as total company gross profit per unit increased 26.1% during 2020 compared to 2019. Pent-up demand and reduced inventory levels related to short-term production closures combined with increased manufacturer partner incentives contributed to these improvements in gross profit per unit. We believe these increases in gross profit per unit will return to normalized levels in 2021.
The same store new vehicle sales increase in 2019 over 2018 of 1.7% included an increase of 5.0% in average selling prices, offset by a decrease in volume of 3.2%.
Used Vehicles
Used vehicle retail sales are a strategic focus for organic growth. We offer three categories of used vehicles: manufacturer certified pre-owned (CPO) vehicles; core vehicles, which are late-model vehicles with lower mileage; and value autos, which are vehicles with over 80,000 miles. We have established a company-wide target of achieving a per store average of 100 used retail units per month. Strategies to achieve this target include reducing wholesale sales and selling the full spectrum of used units, from late model CPO models to vehicles over ten years old. During 2020, our stores sold an average of 78 used vehicles per store per month. This compares to 77 used vehicles per store per month in 2019 and 69 in 2018.
Used vehicle revenues increased 13.4% during 2020 compared to 2019 and 14.6% in 2019 compared to 2018. These increases are due to a combination of increased volume from acquisitions and organic growth in our core and value auto categories at our seasoned stores. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, on a same store basis, used vehicle revenues increased 6.0% during 2020 and included a 1.0% increase in unit volume and a 5.0% increase in average selling price per retail unit compared to 2019. The revenue increase in 2020 was driven by increases in our core and value auto categories of 10.1% and 7.2%, respectively, offset by a decrease in CPO vehicle revenues of 3.0%. The increase in our core vehicle category includes a 4.6% increase in volume, complimented by a 5.3% increase in average selling price per vehicle. The increase in our value auto category is due to an increase in unit sales of 1.5% and an increase in average selling price per vehicle of 5.6%.
Used vehicle gross profits increased 21.4% during 2020 compared to 2019 and 13.8% in 2019 compared to 2018. On a same store basis, used vehicle gross profit increased 13.6% in 2020 compared to 2019, led by the performance in our core and value auto categories with increases of 15.2% and 14.5%, respectively, complimented by an increase in our CPO vehicles of 8.8%. The increase in our core vehicle category was primarily driven by an increase in gross profit per unit. Gross profit per unit in our core vehicle category, which accounted for 57.0% of our used vehicle unit sales in 2020, increased 10.1%, from $2,239 in 2019 to $2,465 in 2020. The increase in same store gross profit in our value auto category was driven by a 12.8% increase in gross profit per unit from $2,211 in 2019 to $2,494 in 2020. Our CPO category experienced a decrease in volume, with unit sales decreasing 7.9% in 2020 compared to 2019, but saw an increase in gross profit per unit of 18.1%, from $2,040 in 2019 to $2,408 in 2020.
Similar to new vehicles, volumes were impacted by the shelter in place policies and restrictions enacted. Initial declines were similar to new vehicles; however, we experienced improvements during the second quarter of 2020,
which accelerated into the third quarter of 2020. We believe our used inventory performance will return to normalized levels in 2021.
Used vehicle revenues increased 14.0% in 2019 compared to 2018 on a same store basis due to increases in unit volume and average selling prices of 12.7% and 1.2%, respectively. Same store used vehicle gross profit also increased 13.0% in 2019 compared to 2018.
Our used vehicle operations provide an opportunity to generate sales to customers unable or unwilling to purchase a new vehicle, sell brands other than the store’s new vehicle franchise(s), access additional used vehicle inventory through trade-ins and increase sales from finance and insurance products and parts and service.
Finance and Insurance
We believe that arranging timely vehicle financing is an important part of providing personal transportation solutions, and we attempt to arrange financing for every vehicle we sell. We also offer related products such as extended warranties, insurance contracts and vehicle and theft protection.
The increases in finance and insurance revenue in 2020 compared to 2019 and in 2019 compared to 2018, were primarily due to increased volume related to acquisitions, combined with expanded product offerings and increasing penetration rates. Third party extended warranty and insurance contracts yield higher profit margins than vehicle sales and contribute significantly to our profitability. During 2020, finance and insurance sales accounted for 4.4% of total revenues and 26.1% of total gross profits. On a same store basis, finance and insurance sales accounted for 4.3% of total revenues and 25.6% of total gross profits in 2020. Same store finance and insurance revenues increased 0.9% during 2020 compared to 2019 and 13.3% during 2019 compared to 2018. These increases were driven by increases in finance and insurance revenues per retail unit, combined with increases in used vehicle unit volume, offset by decreases in new vehicle unit volume. On a same store basis, our finance and insurance revenues per retail unit increased $121 per unit to $1,604 in 2020 compared to 2019 and $123 per unit to $1,488 in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to increases in service contract and financing penetration rates of 80 basis points and 70 basis points, respectively, from 47.9% to 48.7% and from 73.7% to 74.4%, respectively.
Service, body and parts
We provide service, body and parts for the new vehicle brands sold by our stores, as well as service and repairs for most other makes and models. Our parts and service operations are an integral part of our customer retention and the largest contributor to our overall profitability. Earnings from service, body and parts have historically been more resilient during economic downturns, when owners have tended to repair their existing vehicles rather than buy new vehicles.
Our service, body and parts revenue grew in customer pay and warranty work in 2020 compared to 2019 and in all areas in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to acquisitions. With more late-model units in operation from 2010 to 2016 and a plateauing new vehicle market, we believe the increased number of units in operation will continue to benefit our service, body and parts revenue in the coming years as more late-model vehicles age, necessitating repairs and maintenance. We focus on retaining customers by offering competitively-priced routine maintenance and through our marketing efforts.
On a same store basis, service, body and parts revenue declined 6.5% during 2020, primarily driven by decreases in customer pay and warranty revenues of 4.8% and 6.3%, respectively, primarily as a result of shelter in place policies in effect during the first half of 2020. Performance in parts wholesale and body shop also saw decreases of 10.6% and 11.7%, respectively, compared to the same period of 2019.
Same store service, body and parts gross profit decreased 2.2% during 2020 compared to 2019 and increased 10.0% during 2019 compared to 2018. These changes were also driven by customer pay and warranty work. Our gross margins continue to increase as our mix has shifted towards customer pay, which has higher margins than other service work.

NM - Not meaningful
Domestic
A summary of financial information for our Domestic segment follows:
Total Revenue in our Domestic segment increased 2.8% in 2020 compared to 2019. New vehicle unit sales decreased 9.1%, 10.3% on a same store basis, in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to decreases in Chrysler and Ford. However, Domestic segment revenues benefited from improved used vehicle retail sales due to an 8.4% increase in volume and a 14.1% increase in gross profit per vehicle in 2020 compared to 2019. Finance and Insurance revenue also contributed to the overall increase in Domestic segment revenue, driven by the increased used vehicle retail volume, combined with a 7.9% increase in finance and insurance income per retail unit sold to $1,765 per unit.
Strong performance in used vehicle retail, service, body and parts, and finance and insurance revenues in 2019 contributed to the 4.0% increase in revenue over 2018.
Our Domestic segment income increased 86.4% in 2020 compared to 2019 due to gross profit growth of 12.1% with declines in SG&A and floor plan interest expense of 0.4% and 42.3%, respectively. As a percentage of gross profit, SG&A decreased 820 basis points in 2020 compared to 2019.
Our Domestic segment income increased 26.4% in 2019 compared to 2018 due to gross profit growth of 8.7% with only minimal increases in SG&A and floor plan interest expense of 5.8% and 2.2%, respectively. As a percentage of gross profit, SG&A decreased 210 basis points in 2019 compared to 2018.
Import
A summary of financial information for our Import segment follows:
Revenues in our Import segment increased in used vehicle retail, finance and insurance, and service, body and parts in 2020 compared to 2019. New vehicle unit sales in our Import segment decreased 5.3%, 15.9% on a same store basis, primarily related to decreases in Toyota and Honda. However, Import segment revenues benefited from improved used vehicle sales due to a 6.3% increase in volume, increases in finance and insurance revenues as a result of increased volume combined with a 13.8% increase in finance and insurance income per retail unit sold to $1,559 per unit, and improved service, body and parts revenues.
The increase in our Import segment revenue in 2019 compared to 2018 was driven by increases in used vehicle retail, finance and insurance, and service, body and parts. New vehicle unit sales in our Import segment decreased 4.0%. However, Import segment revenues benefited from improved used vehicle retail due to a 10.4% increase in volume, increases in finance and insurance revenues as a result of increased volume combined with a 10.1% increase in finance and insurance income per retail unit sold to $1,370 per unit, and improved service, body and parts revenues.
Our Import segment income increased 62.3% in 2020 compared to 2019 due to gross profit growth of 15.2% with only a minimal increase in SG&A expense of 7.0% and a decrease in floor plan interest expense of 28.3%. As a percentage of gross profit, SG&A decreased 550 basis points in 2020 compared to 2019.
Our Import segment income increased 32.4% in 2019 compared to 2018 due to gross profit growth of 10.4% with only minimal increases in SG&A and floor plan interest expense of 6.5% and 6.1%, respectively. As a percentage of gross profit, SG&A decreased 280 basis points in 2019 compared to 2018.
Luxury
A summary of financial information for our Luxury segment follows:
The increase in our Luxury segment revenue in 2020 compared to 2019 resulted from increases in all major business lines. New vehicle unit sales increased 2.9%, but decreased 14.3% on a same store basis, mainly related to our BMW, Acura, and Audi franchises. Our Luxury segment revenues also benefited from a 9.3% increase in used vehicle unit sales, a 15.9% increase in finance and insurance revenues per retail unit to $1,541 per unit and growth in service, body and parts during 2020 compared to 2019.
Our Luxury segment revenue increased in 2019 compared to 2018 across all major business lines. New vehicle unit sales increased 8.6% over the prior year. Our Luxury segment revenues also benefited from an 18.7% increase in used vehicle unit sales, a 9.7% increase in finance and insurance revenues per retail unit to $1,330 per unit and growth in service, body and parts during 2019 compared to 2018.
Our Luxury segment income increased 72.5% in 2020 compared to 2019. This increase was due to gross profit growth of 14.2% and decreased floor plan interest expense of 26.6%, offset by an increase in SG&A of 8.0%. As a percentage of gross profit, SG&A decreased 430 basis points in 2020 compared to 2019.
Our Luxury segment income increased 30.1% in 2019 compared to 2018. This increase was due to gross profit growth of 14.6%, offset by an increase in SG&A of 12.0% and an increase in floor plan interest expense of 17.9%. As a percentage of gross profit, SG&A decreased 180 basis points in 2019 compared to 2018.
Corporate and Other
Revenue attributable to Corporate and other includes the results of operations of our stand-alone collision centers, offset by certain unallocated reserve and elimination adjustments.
NM - not meaningful
The decrease in Corporate and other revenues in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily affected by our reserve for revenue reversals associated with unwound vehicle sales. Corporate and other revenues were affected in 2019 by a decrease in internal corporate vehicle purchases and leases with our stores resulting in positive revenues compared to 2018.
Internal corporate expense allocations are also used to increase comparability of our dealerships and reflect the capital burden a stand-alone dealership would experience. Examples of these internal allocations include internal rent expense, internal floor plan financing charges, and internal fees charged to offset employees within our corporate headquarters who perform certain dealership functions.
The increase in Corporate and other segment income in 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily due to an increase in gains on the divestiture of stores. The decrease in Corporate and other segment income in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due decreased gains on the divestiture of stores and an increase in certain insurance reserves.
See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Financial Data of this Form 10-K for additional information.
Asset Impairments
Asset impairments recorded as a component of operations consist of the following:
Goodwill and franchise value for our reporting units are tested for impairment annually as of October 1 or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. We elected to perform qualitative franchise value and goodwill impairment tests as of October 1 each year. These non-cash impairment charges are included in the “Corporate and Other” category of our segment information.
During the second quarter of 2020, there were indications of a triggering event at certain reporting units. We tested the goodwill and franchise value for these locations. As a result, we identified certain reporting units where it was more likely than not the fair values were less than the carrying amounts, and we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $4.4 million and $3.5 million, which was equal to the difference between the fair value and the carrying value for franchise value and goodwill, respectively. One of these locations was subsequently sold in the fourth quarter of 2020.
In the first quarter of 2019, we recorded an asset impairment of $0.5 million associated with certain real properties. The long-lived assets were tested for recoverability and were determined to have a carrying value exceeding their fair value. The impaired long-lived asset was subsequently sold in the second quarter of 2019.
As a result of our 2019 annual impairment testing, we identified certain reporting units where it was more likely than not the fair value was less than the carrying amount, and recorded non-cash impairment charges of $0.4 million and $1.7 million for franchise value and goodwill, respectively.
In 2018, we recorded an asset impairment of $1.3 million associated with certain real properties. The long-lived assets were tested for recoverability and were determined to have a carrying value exceeding their fair value.
See Note 1, Note 4 and Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Financial Data of this Annual Report.
Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A)
SG&A includes salaries and related personnel expenses, advertising (net of manufacturer cooperative advertising credits), rent, facility costs, and other general corporate expenses.
SG&A increased 4.0%, or $54.5 million in 2020 compared to 2019. Overall increases in SG&A were primarily due to increased personnel costs resulting from our growth through acquisitions, offset by decreases in advertising spend and gains on sales of assets. Other expenses in 2020 included acquisition expenses of $3.1 million, compared to $2.5 million in 2019 and $6.1 million of storm related insurance charges, compared to $9.5 million in 2019. Gains on the sale of stores were $16.6 million and $9.7 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
On a same store basis and excluding non-core charges, adjusted SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 64.4% in 2020 compared to 69.4% in 2019, which included decreases across all categories.
SG&A increased 9.6%, or $120.5 million, in 2019 compared to 2018. Overall increases in SG&A were primarily due to growth through acquisitions, increased losses related to storm insurance reserve charges, and a decrease in gains on disposal of stores. Other expenses in 2019 included acquisition expenses of $2.5 million, compared to $4.3 million in 2019 and $9.5 million of storm related insurance charges, compared to $3.2 million in 2018. Gains on the sale of stores were $9.7 million and $15.1 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.
On a same store basis and excluding non-core charges, adjusted SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 69.8% in 2019 compared to 70.5% in 2018. Decreases were seen in advertising, rent, facility costs, and data processing, partially offset by increases in personnel costs.
SG&A adjusted for non-core charges was as follows:
See “Non-GAAP Reconciliations” for more details.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization is comprised of depreciation expense related to buildings, significant remodels or improvements, furniture, tools, equipment and signage and amortization related to tradenames.
Acquisition activity contributed to the increases in depreciation and amortization in 2020 compared to 2019 and in 2019 compared to 2018. We acquired approximately $241 million and $63 million of depreciable property as part of our 2020 and 2019 acquisitions, respectively. Capital expenditures totaled $167.8 million and $124.9 million, respectively, in 2020 and 2019. These investments increase the amount of depreciable assets. See the discussion under “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for additional information.
Operating Income
Operating income as a percentage of revenue, or operating margin, was as follows:
(1)See “Non-GAAP Reconciliations” for additional information.
In 2020, our operating margin increased 140 basis points compared to 2019. In 2020, the increase in our operating margin was driven by a decrease in SG&A as a percentage of gross profit and increased total gross margin.
In 2019, our operating margin increased 10 basis points compared to 2018. Adjusting for non-core charges, including storm related insurance charges and acquisition expenses, our operating margin increased 20 basis points in 2019 compared to 2018. In 2019, the increase in our operating margin was driven by a decrease in SG&A as a percentage of gross profit and increased total gross margin.
Floor Plan Interest Expense and Floor Plan Assistance
Floor plan interest expense decreased $38.4 million in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to our ability to pay off our higher interest rate floor plan notes payable with the surplus liquidity generated from our senior note and equity offerings in 2020. This changed the overall mix in our interest rates on our floor plan facilities, decreasing floor plan interest expense $19.4 million for pre-existing locations. Acquisition volume increased floor plan interest expense $1.0 million, while overall decreases in inventory financed with floor plan decreased floor plan interest expense $20.0 million.
Floor plan interest expense increased $10.5 million in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to changes in our interest rates. Changes in the interest rates on our floor plan facilities increased expense $10.9 million, acquisition volume increased expense $1.4 million, and decreases in average outstanding balances on our floor plan facilities decreased the expense $1.8 million during 2019 compared to 2018.
Floor plan assistance is provided by manufacturers to support store financing of new vehicle inventory. Under accounting standards, floor plan assistance is recorded as a component of new vehicle gross profit when the specific vehicle is sold. However, because manufacturers provide this assistance to offset inventory carrying costs, we believe a comparison of floor plan interest expense to floor plan assistance is a useful measure of the efficiency of our new vehicle sales relative to stocking levels.
The following tables detail the carrying costs for new vehicles and include new vehicle floor plan interest net of floor plan assistance earned:
Other Interest Expense
Other interest expense includes interest on debt incurred related to acquisitions, real estate mortgages, our used and service loaner vehicle inventory financing commitments, our revolving lines of credit, and issued senior notes.
The increase in other interest expense in 2020 compared to 2019 was due to the issuances of $400 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.625% senior notes due 2027 in December 2019 and $550 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.375% senior notes due 2031 in October 2020, offset by decreases in our average borrowings on our credit facility. See also Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
The increase in other interest expense in 2019 compared to 2018 was due to increased average borrowings on our credit facility, the issuance of $400 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.625% senior notes due 2027 in December 2019, and increases in mortgage borrowings related to acquisitions.
Other Income, Net
Income Tax Provision
Our effective income tax rate was as follows:
(1)See “Non-GAAP Reconciliations” for more details
Our effective income tax rate in 2020 was positively affected by an increase in pre-tax income, excess tax benefits on stock awards vesting in the current period, and a reduction in non-deductible expenses. Our current state effective tax rate was negatively impacted by the enactment of the Oregon Corporate Activity Tax beginning January 1, 2020, which was partially offset by favorable changes in our state rate due to acquisitions.
On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act, among other items, includes modifications to federal net operating loss rules, the business interest deduction limitation, and the bonus depreciation eligibility of qualified improvement property. An analysis of bonus depreciation eligibility of qualified improvement property was completed and recorded during the year. On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2021 (CAA) was signed into law. We will continue to monitor the potential impacts of these legislative changes on future periods.
Our effective income tax rate in 2019 was negatively affected by excess tax deficiencies on stock awards vesting in the current period, an increase in non-deductible expenses, and an increase in the current state effective income tax rate, primarily due to enactment of combined reporting in New Jersey beginning January 1, 2019.
Our effective income tax rate in 2018 was positively affected by the enactment of tax legislation commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act"), signed into law on December 22, 2017, which reduced the Federal corporate income tax rate to 21.0%. Our effective income tax rate in 2018 benefited from return to provision adjustments to our income tax receivable and deferred taxes as a result of finalizing calculations supporting our 2017 federal income tax return. These adjustments are the result of tax planning undertaken in 2018 to change certain established tax accounting methods. Additionally, our effective income tax rate in 2018 was positively affected by excess tax benefits related to our stock-based compensation and the revaluation of certain acquired deferred tax liabilities. Partially offsetting these benefits was the negative impact from an increasing presence in states with higher income tax rates, including the impact of New Jersey Assembly Bill 4202.
Non-GAAP Reconciliations
Non-GAAP measures do not have definitions under GAAP and may be defined differently by and not comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, we review any non-GAAP financial measures in connection with a review of the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We caution you not to place undue reliance on such non-GAAP measures, but also to consider them with the most directly comparable GAAP measures. We believe each of the non-GAAP financial measures below improves the transparency of our disclosures, provides a meaningful presentation of our results from the core business operations because they exclude items not related to our ongoing core business operations and other non-cash items, and improves the period-to-period comparability of our results from the core business operations. We use these measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures to assess our business, including our compliance with covenants in our credit facility and in communications with our Board of Directors concerning financial performance. These measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP measures.
The following tables reconcile certain reported non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measure from our Consolidated Statements of Operations (in millions, except per share amounts):
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We manage our liquidity and capital resources in the context of our overall business strategy, continually forecasting and managing our cash, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility. Our capital deployment strategy targets an allocation of 65% investment in acquisitions, 25% investment in capital expenditures and 10% in shareholder return in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
Cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities are our main sources for liquidity. In addition to the above sources of liquidity, potential sources to fund our business strategy include financing of real estate and proceeds from debt or equity offerings. We evaluate all of these options and may select one or more of them depending on overall capital needs and the availability and cost of capital, although no assurances can be provided that these capital sources will be available in sufficient amounts or with terms acceptable to us.
Available Sources
Below is a summary of our immediately available funds:
NM - Not meaningful.
In October 2020, we raised additional capital through the issuance of $550 million aggregate principal amount of 4.375% senior notes due 2031 and gross proceeds of $805 million from the issuance of Class A Common stock. Combined, these transactions provided for $1.3 billion of available liquidity, net of applicable transaction costs.
Information about our cash flows, by category, is presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The following table summarizes our cash flows:
Operating Activities
Cash provided by operating activities increased $17.7 million in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily as a result of improved profitability, lower inventory turns compared to the prior year and growth in our business through acquisitions.
Borrowings from and repayments to our syndicated credit facility related to our new vehicle inventory floor plan financing are presented as financing activities. Additionally, the cash paid for inventory purchased as part of an acquisition is presented as an investing activity, while the subsequent flooring of the inventory is included in floor plan notes payable cash activities. At the end of 2020, we had excess cash from the proceeds received from our debt and equity offerings and utilized some of those funds to temporarily pay down outstanding floor plan debt.
To better understand the impact of these items, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities is presented below:
Inventories are the most significant component of our cash flow from operations. As of December 31, 2020, our new vehicle days’ supply was 50 days, or 21 days lower than our days’ supply as of December 31, 2019. Our days’ supply of used vehicles was 65 days, which was the same as our days’ supply as of December 31, 2019. We calculate days’ supply of inventory based on current inventory levels, excluding in-transit vehicles, and a 30-day historical cost of sales level. We have continued to focus on managing our unit mix and maintaining an appropriate level of new and used vehicle inventory.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1.6 billion and $463.0 million, respectively, for 2020 and 2019. Cash flows from investing activities relate primarily to capital expenditures, acquisition and divestiture activity and sales of property and equipment.
Below are highlights of significant activity related to our cash flows from investing activities:
Capital Expenditures
Below is a summary of our capital expenditure activities:
Many manufacturers provide assistance in the form of additional incentives or assistance if facilities meet manufacturer image standards and requirements. We expect that certain facility upgrades and remodels will generate additional manufacturer incentive payments. Also, tax laws allowing accelerated deductions for capital expenditures reduce the overall investment needed and encourage accelerated project timelines.
We expect to use a portion of our future capital expenditures to upgrade facilities that we recently acquired. This additional capital investment is contemplated in our initial evaluation of the investment return metrics applied to each acquisition and is usually associated with manufacturer image standards and requirements.
If we undertake a significant capital commitment in the future, we expect to pay for the commitment out of existing cash balances, construction financing and borrowings on our credit facility. Upon completion of the projects, we believe we would have the ability to secure long-term financing and general borrowings from third party lenders for 70% to 90% of the amounts expended, although no assurances can be provided that these financings will be available to us in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us.
Acquisitions
Growth through acquisitions is a key component of our long-term strategy that enables us to increase our network of locations, support maintaining a diverse franchise and geographic mix and improve our ability to serve customers through wider selection and improved proximity. Our disciplined approach focuses on acquiring new vehicle franchises that are accretive and cash flow positive at reasonable valuations.
We are able to subsequently floor new vehicle inventory acquired as part of an acquisition; however, the cash generated by these transactions are recorded as borrowings on floor plan notes payable, non-trade. Adjusted net cash paid for acquisitions, as well as certain other acquisition-related information is presented below:
We evaluate potential capital investments primarily based on targeted rates of return on assets and return on our net equity investment.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities, adjusted for borrowing on floor plan facilities: non-trade was as follows:
Below are highlights of significant activity related to our cash flows from financing activities, excluding net (repayments) borrowings on floor plan notes payable: non-trade, which are discussed above:
Borrowing and Repayment Activity
During 2020, we raised net proceeds of $606.5 million through the issuance of $550.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.375% senior notes due 2031 and $56.5 million through mortgages, and repaid $110.0 million, net, on our lines of credit. These funds were primarily used for acquisitions, share repurchases and capital expenditures.
Our debt to total capital ratio, excluding floor plan notes payable, was 44.5% at December 31, 2020 compared to 50.0% at December 31, 2019.
Equity Transactions
In October 2020, we completed the public offering of 3,659,091 million shares of our Class A common stock, no par value per share, which included the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase up to 477,272 additional shares of our Class A common stock, for total net proceeds of approximately $777.6 million.
Our share repurchase program, authorized by our Board of Directors, allows us to repurchase up to $250 million of our Class A common stock. As of December 31, 2020, we had $187.5 million available for repurchase under the program. The authority to repurchase does not have an expiration date.
During 2020, we paid dividends on our Class A and Class B Common Stock as follows:
We evaluate performance and make a recommendation to the Board of Directors on dividend payments on a quarterly basis.
Summary of Outstanding Balances on Credit Facilities and Long-Term Debt
Below is a summary of our outstanding balances on credit facilities and long-term debt:
(1)As of December 31, 2020, we had a $2.1 billion new vehicle floor plan commitment as part of our credit facility.
(2)The amounts available on the credit facilities are limited based on borrowing base calculations and fluctuates monthly.
(3)Available credit is based on the borrowing base amount effective as of November 30, 2020. This amount is reduced by $18.2 million for outstanding letters of credit.
(4)Debt issuance costs are presented on the balance sheet as a reduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.
Credit Facility
Our syndicated credit facility (credit facility) is comprised of 19 financial institutions, including seven manufacturer-affiliated finance companies, with a maturity date of January 2025.
We have the option to reallocate the commitments, provided that the used vehicle inventory floor plan financing commitment does not exceed 16.5% of aggregate commitments, the revolving loan commitment does not exceed 18.75% of aggregate commitments, the service loaner floor plan financing commitment does not exceed $100 million, and the sum of these commitments plus the new vehicle inventory floor plan financing commitment does not exceed the aggregate total financing commitment of $2.8 billion. Additionally, we may request an increase in the aggregate new vehicle floor plan commitment of up to $400 million provided that the aggregate commitment does not exceed $3.2 billion total availability. All borrowings from, and repayments to, our lending group are presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as financing activities.
Our obligations under our credit facility are secured by a substantial amount of our assets, including our inventory (including new and used vehicles, parts and accessories), equipment, accounts receivable (and other rights to payment) and our equity interests in certain of our subsidiaries. Under our credit facility, our obligations relating to new vehicle floor plan loans are secured only by collateral owned by borrowers of new vehicle floor plan loans under the credit facility.
The interest rate on the credit facility varies based on the type of debt, with the rate of one-month LIBOR plus 1.10% for new vehicle floor plan financing, one-month LIBOR plus 1.40% for used vehicle floor plan financing; and a variable interest rate on the revolving financing ranging from the one-month LIBOR plus 1.00% to 2.00%, depending on our leverage ratio. The annual interest rate associated with our new vehicle floor plan commitment was 1.24% at December 31, 2020. The annual interest rate associated with our used vehicle inventory financing commitment was 1.54% at December 31, 2020. The annual interest rate associated with our service loaner inventory financing commitment was 1.34% at December 31, 2020. The annual interest rate associated with our revolving line of credit was 1.14% at December 31, 2020.
Under the terms of our credit facility we are subject to financial covenants and restrictive covenants that limit or restrict our incurring additional indebtedness, making investments, selling or acquiring assets and granting security interests in our assets.
Under our credit facility, we are required to maintain the ratios detailed in the following table:
As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all covenants. We expect to remain in compliance with the financial and restrictive covenants in our credit facility and other debt agreements. However, no assurances can be provided that we will continue to remain in compliance with the financial and restrictive covenants.
If we do not meet the financial and restrictive covenants and are unable to remediate or cure the condition or obtain a waiver from our lenders, a breach would give rise to remedies under the agreement, the most severe of which are the termination of the agreement, acceleration of the amounts owed and the seizure and sale of our assets comprising the collateral for the loans. A breach would also trigger cross-defaults under other debt agreements.
Although we refer to the lenders’ obligations to make loans as “commitments,” each lender’s obligations to make any loan or other credit accommodations under the credit facility is subject to the satisfaction of the conditions precedent specified in the credit agreement including, for example, that our representations and warranties in the agreement are true and correct in all material respects as of the date of each credit extension. If we are unable to satisfy the applicable conditions precedent, we may not be able to request new loans or other credit accommodations under our credit facility.
Other Lines of Credit
Our other lines of credit include commitments of up to $80.0 million, secured by certain assets from select Chrysler locations and all Ford locations. These other lines of credit mature in 2021 and have interest rates up to 5.70%. As of December 31, 2020, no amounts were outstanding on these other lines of credit.
On July 14, 2020, we entered into a five-year real estate backed facility with eight financial institutions, including two manufacturer affiliated finance companies, maturing in July 2025. The real-estate backed credit facility provides a total financing commitment of up to $251.5 million in working capital financing for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and working capital, collateralized by real estate and certain other assets owned by us. The interest rate on this credit facility uses one-month LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 2.00%-2.50% based on our leverage ratio, or a base rate of 0.75% plus a margin. The facility includes financial and restrictive covenants typical of such agreements, lending conditions, and representations and warranties by us. Financial covenants include requirements to maintain minimum current and fixed charge coverage ratios, and a maximum leverage ratio, consistent with those under our existing syndicated credit facility with U.S. Bank National Association as administrative agent. As of December 31, 2020, no amounts were outstanding on the real estate backed facility.
On July 31, 2020, we entered into a securitization facility which provides initial commitments for borrowings of up to $150.0 million and matures in July 2022. As of December 31, 2020, we had $39.0 million drawn on the securitization facility.
Floor Plan Notes Payable
We have floor plan agreements with manufacturer-affiliated finance companies for certain new vehicles and vehicles that are designated for use as service loaners. As discussed above in “Operating Activities,” during 2019 we entered a floor plan agreement with Chrysler Capital. This facility provides floor plan financing for new vehicle inventory at select Chrysler stores. This facility adds to our existing facility with Ford Motor Credit Company. The interest rates on these floor plan notes payable commitments vary by manufacturer and are variable rates. As of December 31, 2020, $234.2 million was outstanding on these agreements at interest rates ranging up to 5.25%. Borrowings from and repayments to manufacturer-affiliated finance companies are classified as operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Real Estate Mortgages, Finance Lease Obligations, and Other Debt
We have mortgages associated with our owned real estate. Interest rates related to this debt ranged from 1.9% to 5.3% at December 31, 2020. The mortgages are payable in various installments through August 1, 2038. As of December 31, 2020, we had fixed interest rates on 76.2% of our outstanding mortgage debt.
We have finance lease obligations with some of our leased real estate. Interest rates related to this debt ranged from 1.9% to 8.5% at December 31, 2020. The leases have terms extending through August 2037.
Our other debt includes sellers’ notes. The interest rates associated with our other debt ranged from 4.4% to 5.3% at December 31, 2020. This debt, which totaled $2.4 million at December 31, 2020, is due in various installments through August 2037.
5.250% Senior Notes Due 2025
On July 24, 2017, we issued $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.250% senior notes due 2025 to eligible purchasers in a private placement under Rule 144A and Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933. Interest accrues on the notes from July 24, 2017 and is payable semiannually on February 1 and August 1. We may redeem the notes in whole or in part at any time prior to August 1, 2020 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus a make-whole premium set forth in the indenture and accrued and unpaid interest. After August 1, 2020, we may redeem some or all of the notes subject to the redemption prices set forth in the indenture. If we experience specific kinds of changes of control, as described in the indenture, we must offer to repurchase the notes at 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase.
4.625% Senior Notes Due 2027
On December 9, 2019, we issued $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.625% senior notes due 2027 to eligible purchasers in a private placement under Rule 144A and Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933. Interest accrues on the notes from December 9, 2019 and is payable semiannually on June 15 and December 15. We may redeem the notes in whole or in part, on or after December 15, 2022, at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture. Prior to December 15, 2022, we may redeem the notes, in whole or in part, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus a make-whole premium set forth in the indenture. In addition, prior to December 15, 2022, we may redeem up to 40% of the notes from the proceeds of certain equity offerings. Upon certain change of control events (as set forth in the indenture), the holders of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price of 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase.
4.375% Senior Notes Due 2031
On October 9, 2020, we issued $550.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.375% senior notes due 2031 to eligible purchasers in a private placement under Rule 144A and Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933.

A summary of our contractual commitments and obligations as of December 31, 2020, was as follows:
(1)Amounts for new vehicle floor plan commitment, floor plan notes payable, the used and service loaner vehicle inventory financing commitments and the revolving lines of credit do not include estimated interest payments. See Note 1 and Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
(2)Amounts for operating lease commitments do not include sublease income, and certain operating expenses such as maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes. See Note 7 and Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
(3)Balances exclude net impact of debt issuance costs. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Inflation and Changing Prices
Inflation and changing prices did not have a material impact on our revenues or income from operations in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses at the date of the financial statements. Certain accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments on matters that are inherently uncertain. The following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on assumptions made by management. While we have made our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time, different estimates could have been used in the current period. Changes in the accounting estimates we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations.
Our most critical accounting estimates include those related to goodwill and franchise value, and acquisitions. We also have other key accounting policies for valuation of accounts receivable and expense accruals. However, these policies either do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates described above or are not currently material items in our financial statements. We review our estimates, judgments and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are deemed to be necessary. We believe that these estimates are reasonable. However, actual results could differ materially from these estimates.
Goodwill and Franchise Value
We are required to test our goodwill and franchise value for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. Our reporting units are individual retail automotive stores as this is the level at which discrete financial information is available and for which operating results are regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker to allocate resources and assess performance.
We have the option to qualitatively or quantitatively assess goodwill for impairment and, in 2020, we evaluated our goodwill using a qualitative assessment process. If the qualitative factors determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount, goodwill is not impaired. If the qualitative assessment determines it is more likely than not the fair value is less than the carrying amount, we would further evaluate for potential impairment.
As of December 31, 2020, we had $593.0 million of goodwill on our balance sheet associated with 192 reporting units. No reporting unit accounted for more than 2.8% of our total goodwill as of December 31, 2020. During the second quarter of 2020, there were indications of a triggering event at certain reporting units. We tested the goodwill values for these locations, and, as a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $3.5 million. The annual goodwill impairment analysis, which we perform as of October 1 of each year, resulted in no indications of impairment in 2020 or 2018. In 2019, our annual analysis resulted in an impairment charge of $1.7 million.
We have determined the appropriate unit of accounting for testing franchise rights for impairment is on an individual store basis. We have the option to qualitatively or quantitatively assess indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. In 2020, we evaluated our indefinite-lived intangible assets using a qualitative assessment process. If the qualitative factors determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the individual store’s franchise value exceeds the carrying amount, the franchise value is not impaired, and the second step is not necessary. If the qualitative assessment determines it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount, then a quantitative valuation of our franchise value is performed. An impairment charge is recorded to the extent the fair value is less than the carrying value.
As of December 31, 2020, we had $350.2 million of franchise value on our balance sheet associated with 192 stores. No individual store accounted for more than 5.2% of our total franchise value as of December 31, 2020. During the second quarter of 2020, there were indications of a triggering event at certain reporting units. We tested the franchise values for these locations, and as a result we recorded an impairment charge of $4.4 million. The annual franchise value impairment analysis, which we perform as of October 1 each year, resulted in no indications of impairment in 2020 or 2018. In 2019, our annual analysis resulted in an impairment charge of $0.4 million.
We are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that our goodwill or franchise rights become impaired due to decreases in the fair value. A future decline in performance, decreases in projected growth rates or margin assumptions or changes in discount rates could result in a potential impairment, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. Furthermore, if a manufacturer becomes insolvent, we may be required to record a partial or total impairment on the franchise value and/or goodwill related to that manufacturer. No individual manufacturer accounted for more than 19.5% of our total franchise value and goodwill as of December 31, 2020.
See Note 1 and Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Financial Data of this Annual Report.
Acquisitions
We account for acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting which requires recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value as of the date of the acquisition. Determination of the estimated fair value assigned to each assets acquired or liability assumed can materially impact the net income in subsequent periods through depreciation and amortization and potential impairment charges.
The most significant items we generally acquire in a transaction are inventory, long-lived assets, intangible franchise rights and goodwill. The fair value of acquired inventory is based on manufacturer invoice cost and market data. We estimate the fair value of property and equipment based on a market valuation approach. Additionally, we may use a cost valuation approach to value long-lived assets when a market valuation approach is unavailable. We apply an
income approach for the fair value of intangible franchise rights which discounts the projected future net cash flow using an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risks associated with such projected future cash flow.
See Note 1 and Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Financial Data of this Annual Report.
